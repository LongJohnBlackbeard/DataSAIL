03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I was thinking it might be a good time to get in...
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Wtf relax fool. It was never a short term play except for some quick iv bucks because of demos
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This probably isn't much help to you but I bought this at IPO and got the fuck out when it spiked to around 30 the first time a few months back.

&#x200B;

Anyway, all the best."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You have LEAPS. No need to worry. Short term price swings are negligible with long-term positions, even if you can't avg down. That just means you won't be able to recoup the losses on the way back up."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"No investment is risk free but in my humble ape opinion you've made a good play. The only way you lose is if Palantir fails. Now, by all accounts Palantir is a great company so that's very unlikely.

I have large part of my portfolio in Palantir at 25.3. Not worried.

Why are you worried?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,turn off for a few months. come summer you‚Äôll be good but don‚Äôt stress or panic sell.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Jume 2022 25 calls. ü¶çü¶ç
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This looks awfully Canadian.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Was doing fine for the first 5 paragraphs then I started seeing equations n shit and my brain exploded now there‚Äôs brain matter all over my wall, thanks"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Well one bonds and the other yields
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Excellent explanation of why bond yields affect tech so much. I don't think the normal Reddit user understands why you need to pay attention to bond yield % DAILY to help figure out what to avoid , especially if you're swing trading"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,No rocket. No banana. Ape not happy.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks fellow ape. Very helpful
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you. I‚Äôm a student to the world of finance.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What do you use to see those bond rates?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It ALWAYS comes back to ‚Äúthese 10 stocks you need to own‚Äù
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Always easier to blame the little guy ü§£
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Only buying and never selling causes the price to wildly move up and down? Must be all that dumb money
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Where coronavirus uncertainty caused wild swings in equity valuations in 2020, this year's volatility can be attributed to retail investors on Reddit's WallStreetBets chatroom. Without getting too far into the weeds, these young and/or novice investors have agreed to work together to buy shares and out-of-the-money call options on heavily short-sold companies and/or penny stocks. In many instances, these retail investors¬†have proved successful¬†at driving the price of these targeted stocks higher.""


...what utter horseshit. Retail money is a drop in the bucket compared to institutions. We are pawns playing among kings. Very rarely can a retail buying fury actually make a long term difference. Maybe some spikes here and there, but nothing sustainable.

Also fuck this guy. We have a 1b market cap rule for stocks, so where the fuck is he getting ""penny stock"" manipulation from??"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Fool.com is the perfect name for the site putting this article out. lol
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for reminding me how awful Motley Fool articles are.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. The MostlyAssholes trying to deviate prominent investors from Amc and Gamestop. All I understood is buy amc buy gme!!! Idk about you.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"1) what do you mean you people
2) oh no motley fool, the bubble 1.0 powerhouse."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right, they are totally crap!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,If a bunch of retarded apes can crash the entire market then there is something massively wrong with said market.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What is this money you speak of? I'm pretty much programmed to only buy at the dips at this point. I'm even low on crayons for the month for that reason.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup. Welcome to the Blame Game! Your host, Shitadel! [slow clap]"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Negative earnings. Balance sheet doesnt look good. Lots of debt. Low current ratio.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tried to sell some of my mom‚Äôs shoes brand new  but older at her request. I had 364 people following me and 164 people sharing products. No orders. They were brand name 250 new. 

Not sure if this is a bad thing but that tells me they got a lot of bots working.


EDIT: spoke too soon.. no order but an inquiry about flaws is a buying sign. You may be onto something. I‚Äôm gonna look into this. Thx OP"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Confused at seeing a non-GME post.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep. Their reasoning was the pandemic killed the consignment market. Given we have months to recovery and social sentiment about social distancing, etc, this would be a very long hold IMO. Not worth the gamble when other sectors gonna boom"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I found Poshmark 2-3 years ago by word of mouth and was addicted to it pretty hard. It‚Äôs legit, yeah."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs pretty good. Me and my friends use it. It‚Äôs starting to become a household name. I won‚Äôt be surprised if they become a e-commerce giant in the next few years if they play it right. A very active user base. Does the job better than eBay for used clothing, shoes and accessories imo."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It's definitely a household name in the major city I'm in. All my friends use it. I have several friends that are bloggers and they mention it in their lifestyle blogs often!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Confused why all the new people think this sub is only about GME. The GME craze started in early 2021. This sub is about making YOLO trades and making bets on rising stocks. Not 1 particular stock. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I support the stuff revolving GME and AMC but that doesn‚Äôt mean we shouldn‚Äôt invest in other companies that we believe in."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, I LIKE seeing stuff besides GME!  Thanks for posting this!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The Melvin data point is very important. 

Selling puts is a great strategy when you are short big as it ensures you can get shares back to close your position without having to go into the float to find them bumping the price. 

Melvin is double fucked, because GME is not going to where they sold those puts. 

Citadel is fucked because likely shorted $GME and then turned around lent those shares to Melvin to naked short $GME.

Citadel is also fucked because they sold calls, which are likely naked at this point.

Blackrock and every other institutional owner could potentially be fucked if they call their shares back, triggering a MOASS and melting other parts of the market down via mass selling of longs. 

They just keep kicking the can down the road.

Meanwhile, the market continues to become gamma negative as everybody knows this, QQQ, SPY & IWM all have a massive short interest and 2+ put/call ratio. 

Also, Citadel has enemies that would love to see them go under as well. Mainly SIG international and virtual financial who compete for order flow.

Buy some $GME shares."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You said hold, but I heard buy."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I skimmed through, it says hodl GME to paraphrase"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Went through comments to get a tldr, but apperently nobody read it.

So, hold and buy."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I saw GME and didn't read. 

&#x200B;

I'm just gonna keep buying more and holding it till I die."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You had me at the graph printed to paper and drawn on with pen.  Put me down for more shares on Monday!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just like Tesla, buy some and hold. Buy some more when you can and hold. Hold no matter what. Time is on our side as the shorts bleed borrow costs. This is a slow moving train wreck for the them."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Check to see how many ETFs trade each ticker and compare the percentage of stock owned by ETFs.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"At the end of the day, Tesla is just a car company, but unlike an actual car company, it's overvalued by like ten thousand percent."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The options positions is line with the information from bloomberg terminal posted here last friday. The short interest could be anything at this point. I heard the Dtcc made some new regulations. Do you know if they are in charge of SI info as well?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Has everyone considered that if the sub refrains from mentioning GME for even just a week strait, it might provoke some long awaited reaction? Hint hint. Someone kick off the GME challenge where the ticker isn‚Äôt mentioned for a week, there‚Äôs gonna be news articles out the ass about it and it may benefit everyone who‚Äôs holding, just an idea."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Next week is going to be awesome
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,GME could possibly squeeze? You don't say!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for this comment. It's clear you also read my post which I appreciate.  
Yeah this seems to be a situation where melvin and citadel are only delaying the inevitable.  
Unfortunately there's no way to confirm and it's important to remember risks here."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,All in!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Ape brain is strong in this one
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tldr: gme could moon squeeze but maybe very slowly
So yes buy and hodl"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,How did you get your formatting to actually work? Line breaks never seem to work for me
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha glad you liked my take on graphs
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"No clue, but it's worth noting also that short interest reports are self reported.
     
Edit: corrected by u/Verb0182"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's not going to happen, it just ain't. How would people not mentioning GME cause a squeeze? Why do you say that?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hope so, but I think it's important not to put dates on this stock"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not just saying it's a possible squeeze, I'm saying specifically in the style of Tesla's 2020 squeeze."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Stir the pot
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,People are assholes here
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That is true
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"All I‚Äôm saying is, as long as every other post is about GME, then imagine this goes on as long as everyone other post is about GME. Consider that this week there are zero mentions about GME on this sub, it will provoke a reaction."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I suppose it could, but with GME megathreads, trolls, etc there's no way that would happen"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bears, beets, battlestar galactica."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey man I can‚Äôt read.

Write your shit like a memo the second I see more than 4 sentences without a break in text my eyes glaze over."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs the difference between IPOE and IPOE-UN? And which one is the one to buy?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So yolo on SOFI?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What is the symbol or ticket of SOFI?  or what is the name of the company?  I can't find it on Thinkorswin
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Michael!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,IPOE - it‚Äôs a SPAC at the moment.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you sell?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What options strikes / expirations.... positions or ban

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,How long have you been doing options and where did you learn how too?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you have buyers for those options at those prices? Also what strike did you settle the shares at - the 479?

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Started trading over a year ago to date üëÅ
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did. I lowered the cost of the premium when I sold, meaning less profit but pretty much a guaranteed fill. My total profit from that trade was 215,000 profit from a $3200 initial investment 2 days prior."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,God‚Äôs work üëÅ
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs easy. Find stock you think will have a solid spike in price, based on your own research and dd, buy as close to in the money you can afford, choose expiration based on timeframe you think it will increase. Keep in mind Theta will cuck you, and cuck you harder as you get closer to the expiration date. Pray to or make sacrifices to whatever gods you believe in, and either bank, or back to your day job to try again."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This was my return from a $3200 initial investment. It went to $238,000 two days later üëÅ"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Umm no no you dont.

Not financial advice."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Super cringe
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Can I get tree fiddy for the bus?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So your total return wasn‚Äôt $235000 it was $105000. Very nice. But fcking weird the way people post screenshots of the moment their position was at peak PnL.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Hope you are using your gains to benefit your community/country then.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I did sell. Look at the expiry dates. These are my old trades from the last two months that brought me my highest returns.

Russel said there weren‚Äôt enough voting shares to qualify for an inclusion and UWM is disputing the decision. Could have been wrong on russel‚Äôs part, would be interesting to see if they concede 1% of their holding to gain inclusion.

A sustained hold above a certain price hurts the shorts, and they have to pay the fees, therefore whoever is receiving the fees and loaning the shares wants long whales to help them out and push up the share price, yes? There is a whole web of relationships going on; shorts trying to find help in keeping/driving the price down (due to the long retail diamond holders, I doubt we will see 40-50 again). Somehow the shorts think they have a way out of this, and it's our job/the long whales job, to figure out how to hurt them based upon the shorts current position. Shorts appear to be hedging against sudden surges upward with calls? Maybe we are stuck at this point because you can earn more hurting a short by pushing them slowly, rather than blasting them into oblivion, forcing them to declare bankruptcy. You want that money continuing to flow in, so keep the shorts alive but squeeze them slowly."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I think the Hedges are going to ride the squeeze up just like we are and print tendies as well.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,My brain is too smooth for this. Say it again with pictures.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm way too stupid for this but it sounds interesting
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The only good thing I can really say about the people buying the $800c is that they're creating one hell of a ramp for whenever we reach that price. Holy shit
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Needs more lines going uppy and downy.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is also the date DFVs $12c calls expire as well, isn't it?"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This all basically means nothing. Monthly contracts generally have much higher oi than weeklies, especially considering many of those weeklies did not exist until roughly December. 

Dollar value if exercised don‚Äôt mean shit that far OTM. Delta is practically zero so net impact on the underlying is the same, almost zero. 

The numbers you‚Äôre looking for are net delta on each side, and oi on the contracts near the money."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Options are only helping kick the can further down the road. Please stop trying to predict a date, it doesn‚Äôt help anyone."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So buy GME?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What happened yesterday...with this huge OI? Nothing...pinned around $200
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So they buy puts and hedge with calls....is this like...instead of using a band aid you just grow a bigger body so you can afford to bleed more blood?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop blowing money up the MM's asses buying over priced calls.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"So if it goes sideways that day, some hedgies will lose massive money.  

I like that idea better."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bruh, do you even READ this sub? Those options don't mean shit. They are long hedged for."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Look I appreciate your enthusiasm but whatever you think it means - it doesn‚Äôt. Nothing about 4/16 is any more special than any other date. 3/19 was the date that kept getting hyped up on here with all the options volume set to expire then we blew right through it barely above $200. Don‚Äôt focus on days where you‚Äôre expecting huge options expirations - they mean nothing despite the value they have on their face.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It means that the close on 16th of April will be $200.27
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can someone explain like ape? So many words, can only understand numbers and bananas"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is how they are hiding all their short interest with fake aka synthetic long position's. At least that's a theory.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,BUY & HOLD RETARDS üíéüôå
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If these options are exercised it will pull the price way down not way up. The market will react as if the shares were purchased at the strike price not the current price. We need out of money calls to exercise. 

Stop buying options, buy shares if you want it to moon"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Hedge funds starting to take the other side of the trade?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt pretend to understand it all myself however, from that news piece last week where that boomer suit guy claimed to have made billions off GME first time around, seems to me like the HFs will ride it up and then back down again, making as much as they can whichever way it goes. They just have bottomless pockets..."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I would say this could be their backup/hedge if they fail with their strategy to tank the stock and if it moons.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"What'll happen is same as this time.

Just slightly above or below a price, to the right of the max pain.

In fact, it just shows me that we may indeed have a delayed squeeze until all these options are dealt with."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude its because its a monthly
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is REALLY interesting. Thank you.

This is also helps explain how they'll be able to pay back that $600,000,000 loan they had last week..."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs one method of covering a short. Buy deep ITM options without having to buy the stock. It‚Äôs pushing closing the short position in the future.

Edit: oops forget above statement. I just noticed they were PUTS after posting."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What gives?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Is that roughly 300 mil of -50 putsüò≥
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Its a monthly...they are always outsized with OI. Especially with a hot topic such as GME. Especially when WSB gets a touch of GME FOMO.... WE ALL bought some options.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So buy more?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I just checked from my broker. They don't offer anything above 690C atm. They've been offering it in previous weeks even with high volatility. Not sure what it means but it seems they might take precaution incase it moons.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Options Collected:  Like a billion.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Sir. Please add rockets for us. Stonk go up?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude don't type $.50 as ""fifty cents""

You write like a real retard. Nothing you say has any value on my beliefs. Try again and maybe I'll take a look."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôll say it with 2 words instead :
Buy 
Shares"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I gotta wonder if OP understands the difference between weekly and monthly options and why the third week of every month will always have much higher volumes and OI than the surrounding weeks
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,he‚Äôs saying that there‚Äôs millions of dollars worth of put contracts bought for 4/16. so it‚Äôs likely that the hedge funds are betting for GME to tank to below $30 by 4/16 bc there‚Äôs no way retail investors have the capital to buy this many puts
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I am pretty sure we will see the effects even before it reach the strike because either they will start to hedge like crazy once $800 becomes a possibility or they will try to drive the price down to prevent it from happening
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not so good at crayon analysis, Im still on ""make sure all the numbers face the right way"""
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I do like the stock
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Refer to name.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. Not financial advice.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right that's what I was thinking, but given the volumes the premiums on those puts must be gigantic. If those are puts held by short funds, then it's in THEIR interest to move GME downward as best they can so their bet is profitable.

Did they buy the 800c as a resignation to the squeeze and to hedge against the 350 million bet going down the toilet as a result of said squeeze?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree, I've seen some solid DD on how options can influence underlying price in a vacuum, but here we are outside of a vacuum where retail investors stampede to own them - something I don't think the system was designed to handle. 

The hedging that MMs do when they sell the option involves algorithms that require level 5 gold tier premium plus stock exchange membership to unlock, and now it's happening on one of the most unusual, un-technical stock events in the history of man. Who plays options better than anyone? Who is the buying power behind the constantly-referenced gamma squeezes?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Look guys. These have been here since late January. Look up a trick to fake covering a short position with synthetic longs. But idk I could honestly be confused. Lol it's definitely fuckery
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre framing the options play as being greed driven. What do you think is driving the share play?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Options are literally what pushed the price up. Notional value of option contracts bought at ask has been one to one with GME's downtrends and uptrends. Remember how Melvin's Gabe said it was options that drove the price up? Buying calls makes market makers take more shares off the market per dollar than buying shares. Telling people to stop buying calls will hurt GME. Plus gambling is fun.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you sir o7 tendie airdrop expected soon sir!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, it's quite possible for the price to be pinned at $799 to deny the calls while also making shorting expensive as hell and denying the puts as well."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This cunt gets it.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I predict April 12th - April 16th.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,But DFV‚Äôs calls are for 4/16
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This isn't a prediction, it's an observation of existing numbers. My theory here is that hedge funds are the only ones with enough capital available to purchase contracts (due to sky high premiums from IV) in such high volumes, and this expiration date has a huge amount of money riding on it compared to the other 3 weeks I looked at.

Look for yourself, tell me I'm wrong cause I don't want hedge funds to win. They're not supposed to win, the primate horde is!!!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs an attractive investment
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Until we find out this is all part of a massive *IRON CONDOR* scheme!!!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've seen some speculation that the downward market trend is from short funds liquidating ETFs to pay for GME. If that ends up being true... Idk man it's just insane to think about. 

One month Citadel is loaning 2.4 bn to bail out melvin, next month Citadel itself is *borrowing* 600m like you said."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ but unfortunately I think the hedge funds will be riding it with us
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Why wouldn‚Äôt they to hedge?...
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I will. Once the puts I sold get assigned.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Witching day and multiples of (i.e. quad witching day).
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't but I'd like to learn!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Could it be long whales hedging another flash crash like we had this week? People with big OTM puts driving it down to quickly cover, then quickly buying a bunch of OTM calls and letting the price return to where it was before the crash? Volatility is the play now."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,... aaand it also looks like they're hedging with 800c. You missed the whole point of the post.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol it‚Äôs reversed bro it‚Äôs way more betting it‚Äôs  gonna rocket
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Not even remotely true.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"My guess is the people selling them, for each end, are making a ton safely, since the likely hood of each event is probably low. Doubt it will either crash or squeeze at this point."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,A lot
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"When the squeeze happens whoever sold those 800cs will go bankrupt basically.

But yes, there are some obvious and aggressive bears at play here. The ones who bought the puts, the people selling calls, and the shorters. That's pretty much the entire narrative of the saga.. Such a shame they lost! üôÇ So sad."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It could be played by the enemy to get as much of the dumb money. Shitadel is a MM and could be playing these numbers/sentiments to their advantage. Idk. Best play is to buy shares and hold, but have extra on side to gamble, then your call."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can make more off options, just over greed lol"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not if, as another rising post today hypothesized, MMs are selling both the puts and the calls after spiking theta, then manipulating the price to trade sideways and collecting all the premiums from puts and calls. Since we can‚Äôt be sure, shares are the play, since they carry no risk of enriching MMs, and continual prolonged buying and holding of shares will force shorts to cover. If they make too much money off of premiums, i.e. enough to cover the interest payments on their shorts, they could continue to drag this out indefinitely. Buy shares."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This sounds nice üëç
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets, This is the way
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"And the price of tea in Iran is 20,000 rials, which also means jack shit. He‚Äôs already made multiple millions of dollars on gme, bought them months ago for a great price at strikes well below $100 and is probably going to exercise them."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve seen the data and it‚Äôs very similar to Friday just gone. We also just seen them manipulate the price to suit on 3/19 and can only see it happening again 4/16. If it squeezes before hand it would be a different story all together of course. But the dirty bastards know every trick in the book and it seems a new trick is revealed every week now - I want us to clean up here more than anything believe me!!

I‚Äôm more intrigued by the amount this is still short every day. For the past 20 days the short volume has still been between 54.6-66.1% of the total volume of trades every dayü§î"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I just want tendies.  Hundreds and hundreds of my shares in exchange for sweet yummy tendies.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree that their action of lending, then borrowing themselves tells some type of narrative. I think the max pain will result from actual shares. Shitadel being the MM could be manipulating the options market to take out the dumb whales with deeper pockets. IDK. Just seems the safer bet is to get more shares."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Because they are still squeezed if the price goes up high enough to make tendies. Im guessing they still have shorts open at very low prices and are greedy and refuse to lose a shit ton on those. So if the price goes up they are even further out of the money on those shorts. They could possibly still hedge and make money on the ride up but that still doesn‚Äôt solve their main problem. Also some of them are obviously low on liquidity as we can guess by major securities dipping when gme spikes. Idk im retarded. Using Market knowledge level one here.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"A lot of (smaller) hedgie types are still convinced the company is inevitably headed for bankruptcy, soon, with a degree of confidence such that I wouldn't be surprised if they don't hedge their shorts / puts"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't know who's hedging what. But I do know that if you sell an OTM call that becomes ITM you lose money... And if the price is squeezing at the time you lose *a lot* of money...

I also know that if you short a stock and it goes up you lose money... And again, if the price is squeezing at the time you lose *a lot* of money...

So when the squeeze happens someone is going to lose *a lot* of money... It's a zero sum game...

Further the shorts are not yet covered, and the 800 calls are not yet covered. GG."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôll say it with 2 words: Welcome aboard
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Look up the triple witching
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,No no these have been there for a while like as in late January. Look up how to hide short interest with synthetic longs....
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,that‚Äôs not what OP is saying. OP is saying that there are as many puts just as there are as many calls and so basically hedges are betting that they could make money either way. this is an IV play
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Utterly ü§ë heart üí∏ broken üí∞üíµüí≤
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,If they sell covered calls and the squeeze happens won't they get $80K per contract?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not, if they were covers calls!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree. I think the end game is in favor those holding shares. I think up until that point they‚Äôll try to throw whatever arsenal they have to deleverage their shorts as much as possible. My simple ape brain thinks holding share is best for foundation. Any options play could be the cherry on top if ITM.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The calls are insane. You really should look at it. There's the same likelihood it'll hit $800 as there is it will hit $110 according to the price for july. That's insane. It makes no logical sense.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Who sells covered calls at 800 when the price is a fraction of that? I think people buying those calls at 800 are either hedging or speculating, but the people selling them are going to get fucked. They basically didn't read the play."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"No one knows for sure but it was starting to look like retailers were buying the 800 calls. Not particularly because the price action, but super cheap premium and if the stock made a major move you could make superior gains. However, 2 weeks straight that gamble did not pay off. Id let IV cool waaaaayyyy down before touching options. Or, just pony up the cash for ATM calls, but the IV is still the wild card as far as i know. Better off buying shares. Just an opinion though"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If they sold them naked, yes  
If they are covered, no.  
If they get delta hedged along the way, no.  

33% of scenarios they are fucked, and the only ones stupid enough to sell them naked without a recovery plan if things go south are 97.6% likely to be WSB member."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So you still believe the price is going shoot over $800?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, of course, what else do you think this madness is all about?

Look, they deleted the buy button at 450, cos they shit themselves. So at 450 the squeeze resumes in earnest. That squeeze will then force people to start covering the huge number of 800 calls they sold which will squeeze the price even further causing shorters to cover even more etc etc. It'll be a chain reaction, destination moon.

Not financial advice."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can someone confirm if this is true?  The GME options writings premiums have been thru the roof, but do MMs actually do anything here? If open interest on puts is sky high, I would imagine it‚Äôs because there are people who hold shares looking for insurance OR people are betting on the stock falling below that level.  

If the put is ITM, then the other side of the trade can just buy shares below cost and sell to the writer at an instant gain. If the put is OTM, it expires worthless and nothing needs to be done.   Am I missing something about why the MM would need a hedge?  The only person who needs a hedge would be the writer since they need cash to buy the shares in case they go ITM"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"As an engineer, the lack of governing equations in this field troubles me."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"One thing I think you're overlooking is the number of shares a MM would need to buy to cover the put you're writing is not 1 for 1.

In your example, you use the $100 4/16 put.  As of right now, the delta on that put is -.104.  I was taught delta is an approximation for the probability of finishing ITM.  So the MM would only need to buy 10 shares to hedge against your one put.  But if GME starts dropping, then the MM would ostensibly add shares to their position hedge corresponding to the incremental change in delta.

That, and you'd be required to have $10,000 in unencumbered cash in your account for every $100 put you write."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I stopped reading at the first mention of stuff I don‚Äôt know about
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your price efficiency analysis is true, but only on a short term basis. Options give no room for a stock to turn back around after a decline. It is cheaper until you are proven wrong"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So in the best case scenario your doing all this for a 1 percent premium at best. Since you're dealing with ITM contracts because the stock is so volatile you're getting less than 1 percent because of liquidity. You also have to take into account your time and effort for managing this mess all for a 1 percent premium. There are way safer stocks to sell premium on and way more simple strategies. Even the most boring stocks like AT&T moves more than 1 percent a week. Here my tldr: you're a pretentious douche pretending to be smart when you have no idea what you doing. You could have just bought leaps like DFV with 10 grand and made 17 million but you're sitting there scratching your head thinking you're better than us. Also you're title mentions selling puts but your example doesn't show this
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If anyone is super bullish on the price action this week, it would be better to buy the underlying and sell a 10-15% OTM covered call; instead of a cash secured put."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm too poor to afford any puts from what I see everytime I consider it.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"To anyone here, PLEASE DON,T TOUCH OPTIONS, because it could destroy you , if/when you don‚Äôt know what you are doing.

Haven‚Äôt you guys seen the massive LOSS screenshots posted the past weeks on options."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy shares. 

Period."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea I‚Äôm too dumb to know that puts require shares and you would have had got them shares easier at $40.00 than $190.00
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This sounds great, but you need to have enough to cover the purchase of 100 shares at whatever your strike price is. So even at a, now ridiculous, put strike of $100, you need $10,000 to cover."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Annnnd and that‚Äôs why you buy the dip and hold. üíØüíØüíØ
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah the MM doesn‚Äôt need to hedge anything if you sell a PUT, so i think this is a lot of rubbish (to be fair i stopped reading after i read that part).

If you sell a PUT (or even a CALL for that matter) the only obligation is on the person that sold ie. you. The other side of the contract has no obligation to do anything and merely the option to exercise if wanted."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a fellow engineer, I recommend you read into Black Scholes. If you're feeling super kinky, dig into the Kelly Criterion and read up on convexity. If you're into straight up BDSM, read up on second order greeks.

That way when you're getting ass-fucked and choked by $ROPE, you'll know which equations to blame."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,you can sell biweeklies 100p at 10$. I know everyone wants to quadruple their money in this sub but thats 10% gain every two weeks and thats my play.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"For people that don‚Äôt understand, Monday you sell the $190 put. You need $19k available in case GME finishes below $190 next Friday. You‚Äôll collect roughly $2700 for doing this, no matter what happens to the stock. The risk is if something crazy happens and GME drops to $80 next Friday, you‚Äôre still buying 100 shares at $190, but you save a little because you made $2700ish. Now you‚Äôre upside down on 100 shares and you have to wait until the price comes back or you switch over to selling calls. If the next week comes and your shares get called away because the price blew through your strike, you‚Äôve collected another premium but you‚Äôre down $190-current stock price per share. Just don‚Äôt sell any options if you don‚Äôt understand because you‚Äôll be getting long $ROPE"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,thats why you sell weeklies
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You should not buy them, but sell them. 

That being said, when you sell short 1 lot of 100 puts, your broker will require that you set aside enough money to buy 100 shares at the strike price. 

So... yes, settling puts means you need üí∞ü§ëüí∏üí≤"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok. You dont have any idea what OP is actually talking about, do you?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is not true. If you sell a put they are buying it. This gives them a negative delta that they need to buy shares to hedge.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Requires too much attention for my taste. I need to keep my eyes free to go find the next opportunity more than stare at one stock‚Äôs chart in order to time my options

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"No if you sell a put the person on the other end is buying it...thats not necessarily the MM.

If you were to buy an option then that would be another matter as the MM could end up being caught out if the other side couldn‚Äôt satisfy the contract. I‚Äôll happily admit i‚Äôm not an expert though so not sure of the exact workings."

People are gonna disperse and start building homes once the Rona is under control. TX is already seeing that. Still a mystery to me why anyone would pick that state but each their preferences.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What the fuck bro üòé.....good god i love every single word in here ..... keep up the good work
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck me. No tldr. I scrolled through all that Text and now feel unfulfilled. You bastard. Gonna have to do puts on this shit now

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"1. No emojis 
2. Does this mean I‚Äôm going to get rich? 
3. Needs a reference to wife‚Äôs boyfriend

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Almost tripled their margin you say? 

Q4 almost matched entire FY2020 you say?

You don‚Äôt say."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you think it's likely to hit 8.50 and below, why not sell massive amounts of puts?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Fine I‚Äôm in
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro you know we can't read. Im buying more.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I stopped reading at $UWMC

I didn't plan on selling this quarter or next, why would I sell now? If the price drops I'll lower my average."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What have I read?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck it, I'm gonna wheel 200 shares and grow my position. Rocket has been a nice edition to my portfolio for options premiums alone, this should as well."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Just remember DFV held GME for 18 months. We can hold uwmc for 18  months.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Let me ask you this I'm targeting between 15-18 a share as the fair market value of the underlying company is that reasonable or way to low? I have around 400 shares and 10 leaps for 2022 will add more shares on the dip monday
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This account is sus but I like DD. Damn
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"TLDR.  Interest rates go up, refinancings go down.  This stock is going down.  Only being propped up by retail investors like you."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Im still exiting
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,When's the next Ex D date for the dividend?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Something about filibuster and running for senate.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didn‚Äôt read this, boring.  Sorry but this stock is a total disaster and will end up like NOK"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the longest stretch of text my eyes have ever seen. I will double down just for that.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I‚Äôm not reading all that shit
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Bwahaha. You had me at Pride and Prejudice.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,My iPhone read it to me
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Higher interest rates= banks are more likely to loan due to greater profit percentage= literally bank?      

Inflation causes real estate to go up? Crank?      

I feel like UWM has been tracking tech stocks too much while not holding the value of a tech stock, or the value of a cyclical in the finance industry."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm honestly so sorry for this new loss, come on over... My RKT will be popping like a spring!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm saying you should fucking feast when/if it goes down, because tomorrow will be an all you can eat buffet lmao. You'll thank me when it goes up."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Relatively low cost of living, provided you're not right in the metro areas, no state income tax, and pretty much if its legal in the US anywhere you can do it in TX, not including weed for some reason.  That said with the whole ERCOT thing, maybe they'll realize the usefulness of a grid connected to the rest of the country and the attached regulations, but who knows. 

Also people love cowboy hats and boots, that shits science.  You're legally obligated to buy a truck though, but it comes with a complimentary gun."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry Lmao. I kinda got really into it because i'd been doing research into the mortgage market for days now haha.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"In hlding calls too, i got you baby"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,May 21 7.50 p last trade 0.85. Sell massive csps
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Considering the forward P/E ratio at the low and high end, that's just fine. It has room to grow even further. With that said, that'll be a very, very, respectable gain and you shouldn't feel like exiting at those price points is bad."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You literally just proved you didn't read the write up. OP addressed that
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,UWMC doesn‚Äôt focus on refinancing
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"UWMC gets most of its revenue from new construction, NOT refinance. RKT does refinance mostly. So you're missing the picture here. Typical retail trader"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,">Demand has gone so off the charts that a record 26.4% of new homes on the market do not even exist yet. Of the 307,000 homes that were on the market at the end of January, just 42,000 of them had been completed. At 13.7% that was the lowest on record.

Ah, yes. Because demand is so high almost 90 percent of homes on the market at the end of January weren't even completed. As if it isn't a ridiculously bullish indicator. Or the fact that the interest rate is still far below what it used to be."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Bye Felicia.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Past ex dividend date 3/9. Payment date 4/6. This was announced 2/3, so expect the next dividend to be announced at the beginning of May."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Rocket keeps the U man down mon
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Why can't we have both
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you retard ü§ßü§ß
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Appreciate it. Also thanks for all of the great info it's nice to see a dd with actual factual numbers.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It was a typo lmao. If you hadn't read at the time i said Rocket.... while Rocket... Lol.

Edit: Just realized this wasn't to me lmao, my bad dude."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Not trying to argue with you just stating facts.  Confirmation bias is the worst enemy of investors.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Who keeping the rocket man down? Because they be keeping me down , my uwmc & Rkt bags are getting heavier by the day."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Np, glad i could shed some light on some of this stuff."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Prove it if it's a fact. Show me where UWMC generates most of their revenue from refis.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You don't even understand what UWMC does business wise, trying to figure out where your 'facts' are?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Jerome man
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Airlines have revenue, lordstown is an overpriced stock from the SPAC hype that has nothing to show yet"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't understand how I spend like 3 hours coming up with good DD content and it gets auto-banned again and again, but some dummy decides to write like 10 sentences with 3 question marks at the end of every sentence and it gets posted as DD. . . WTF."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Where‚Äôs the DD? üòÇ

I think you‚Äôre brushing aside the SEC investigation"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So how much are you down?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,We may be pre-travel but Lordstown is pre-product and facing down an SEC investigation
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Dumbass
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"All those companies you mention, have real goods, and services to sell. With proven track records. RiDE has hopes and dreams, a factory, and a burnt test mule. With a lot of non-binding no deposit orders. From people who have went on the record to say they have no intention of buying. Even if they wanted to buy, RIDE doesn't even have crash test vehicles yet. Let alone a product to bring around and show consumers. Everyone wants to get in on the next Tesla. But automotive history isn't kind to startups. Exactly 1 man has made it in the last 100 years. Its a cutthroat, cost intensive business."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nio has cars in production in China and sales.

Airlines have a product ‚Äî you can get on a flight tomorrow if no travel restrictions.  Cruise lines have a known product.

Not all short reports result in a SEC inquiry-/ yet this one did."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"They can't be 30 USD, because:  


1. No actual product in line (emphasis on ""actual"").
2. Prototype went down in flames.
3. Got shorted into oblivion by Hindenburg Research after publishing a demolishing file on the company. Fake non binding orders on their new pickup which may or may not be ready for production on the promised dates (Stated to be September this year, apparently 3 or 4 more years before it's a reality).
4. Allegations made by Hindenburg were stated to be contested last week after closing markets midweek. The response from management? any disclaimers? nope. The wonderful, superdeep phrase ""haters gonna hate"". True story, check it out.
5. Being probed by the SEC for making, let's say, bold claims and behaving less than ethically regarding hype to fool investors and media.

Disclaimer, I had 165 shares in RIDE and I felt they took too much flak from shorts, I expected a recovery from the level I picked them up after the dive (15.17) to quite close to the point where they were sitting during the last months before Hindenburg (17.70). Went well the first day, easy 11% during the first day. Then the FED screwed up tech, then they promised to contest Hindenburg claims and failed miserably. Result? they went tits up and I lost a killing. As of today, with the SEC working their asses off, I do not expect them to get close to their original levels in quite a long time, if at all.  


But most importantly: more serious contenders are doing poorly. Hell, Tesla is taking a beating (we could argue they are way over valued, sure, but they are the only ones alongside NIO actually selling EVs). Lucid also took a beating. So what gives for this fellas? not much at all.  


I don't think they will fly, based on those 5 points, but this is a casino after all. If you want to gamble everything on 33 red, be my guest..."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Their tech is made by a Slovenian company and they just licensed it. That was the only reason Trump featured them on the WhiteHouse lawn. They're fraud. Tesla only became public after proving themselves with the Roadster, and Elon and his executives didn't rush to sell their stocks on IPO day like Lordstown execs did. Fraud is fraud."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Their alpha prototypes can't go 10 minutes without catching fire. They haven't built a beta prototype. They have only laboratory tested a single hub motor for 20k miles with no dynamic real world loads. They say they are going to begin production in 5 more months.

This is NKLA levels of lying to shareholders.

SEC gonna give them a new butthole."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Earnings call this week, so there will be volume. Can the company make any announcements alongside the earnings call? (New CEO, or details about transformation?) Or do they have to hold an investors day for that?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've explained this before but the triple triangle dip ice cream cone pattern doesn't work until the crippled elbow slip dips to the tri fold delta. Once we see the corner flip of the lip, take a sip of a nip. That's when we're in bull territory"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,it wasn't making sense but then you added the obligatory emojis and it clicked
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"In my opinion TA is usually bullshit that can be justified after the fact.

But in this case, its doubly bullshit because normal market dynamics are NOT in effect."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME has not much to do with traditional investing
It‚Äôs a bunch of apes holding unto their banana until it rockets them beyond the moon.

It must give people headache to figure out what we do. The media tries their best to bash common sense into these apes, but all they do is hodl and buy until liftoff.

Cracks me up to think that they think they can talk sense into us"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just read a now deleted DD on what‚Äôs going on with GME. Made instant sense. Stop buying options - MM are strangling the price and making bank.

Shares or gtfo

Also - why is solid DD disappearing?

Hmmmm."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The volume will be there this week.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Where will the volume come from?  Apes have spent their monies. Stimulus checks arent enough to support the volume needed. Is there a rich saudi oil prince lurking here who can drop a billy on some gme stonks for us?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What if I'm a Sagittarius?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,TLDR; hodl.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dont know what kinds of cup‚Äôs you have, But my 2girls with there 1cup for sure does not look like that"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Monke see lines, monke like. Monke see shape, monke upvote"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can someone give examples of macd behavior at other cup and handle breakouts? Do they often correlate or are they independent of each other? A lot of us are new to this shit and don't fully understand yet, but are trying to learn"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"TA doesn't really apply to GME. Also, it's earnings on Tuesday. It will either make it go down or up. Not a chart. Thanks for your time though."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just my opinion....
1. Retail excitement has passed and we're left with people who want to hold, but the drop scared off most of the public...
2. Big funds are using the weakness in volume to push the stock lower, specifically to limit the upside swing after earnings and prevent any real chance of a squeeze.

I honestly don't care as I got in at 44.20 and will be holding to see the turnaround."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Not sure if this is satire or actual technical analysis.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Personally I think that the prawn will arrive in three days, two hours, 5 minutes, 23 seconds, or something within 23 hours of that, probably."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Before the first gamma squeeze, the price was fairly stable around $25, then after Robinhood killed the momentum it was stable around $50.

If you ask me, those patterns don't really mean anything but we've clearly lost momentum and people sold the peak or close to it and are waiting to buy the dip which means it will keep dipping until it stabilizes, which I'd assume would happen above $50, probably at the next psychological milestone of $100.

I don't think a volatile market betting on a short squeeze likes to follow pretty shapes and patterns made up by boomers who sell books on how to invest as a hedge against the fact that they just got lucky."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look at the apple cherry creampie with the cock ring dildo. When you connect them with a kite that is being tightened by a bollinger band you‚Äôll get a big messy mess that is a sign of big bull testicles. When you overlay those testies with some tendies you‚Äôll have a portrait of DFV holding a magic 8 ball that says ‚Äútry again.‚Äù If its april 5th, that means buy more but any other day that this image comes up, just HODL. Thank you for reading"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So it comes down to the momentum the earnings might bring to brake out of the handle?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,anything that touches $40-$50 after lift off is a signal to buy for me.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"So.... Buy, HODL,  REPEAT

GOTCHA

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Everyone holding GME is getting played!  Watch it to sink below $100 by end of March.  Sorry üíé üôå
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"They can announce at earnings. They can‚Äôt before due to the blackout period.

New CEO?

Major business transformations?

Some other announcement triggering the return of shorted shares to lenders? 

Any of these would spike SP. The last one would start the thrusters."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Potentially, I don't think there's a particular reason they couldn't announce something like that. Although it may actually be better to announce big news like that separately"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This only applies to GME
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is it a sip nip or a nip slip once we see the corner flip of the lip? I‚Äôm seeing a nip slip pattern with a secondary pimp cane forming, which is also bullish, but we need to look out for the cripple slip with the nip slip pimp cane floating blimp simp ship that could potentially develop in that scenario."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just be careful that what you're seeing isn't a ""vomiting camel"" formation which is an ominous sign."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I've been running the numbers for an hour and without question you are right. What a breakthrough!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You win
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Omg i just realized you are absolutely correct sir!!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy fuck.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I need a verification on this, but I think retail only accounts for 6% of volume? This fight, as with all fights are with good whales and bad whales and one of the lenses we have in their world are these charts"

I am Prince Fhskfj djdjfbw from Nigeria and I have an urgent busness proposle that you will liken.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I only have 5% of my portfolio and 2% of my net worth in this thing.  To be fair I had 40%/20% in January but paper handed like a bitch.  Got back in with a more conservative amount because I have balls of jello.  But there are people like me who are watching it close, have liquidated some other positions, and are waiting for a run up or a big dip.  < $100 and I'll go back in big.  shoots up quickly and I'll dump in a little more to help the cause.  

I'm of the thought that this is real or too good to be true.  It was both last time.  If I hadn't gotten burned at $369 buy in I would be more into the risk"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh is it not? Care to explain? I can edit my post
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Except it does. TA works on every stock, but its the catalysts that are what determine the overall trend. You just need to read a book or two"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,of course! let me put together a couple examples and ill dm you
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good point! I wasnt trying to predict future movement. I was actually just trying to show yesterday's trend. Thats the only thing TA shows. 

Now based on yesterday's trend I can make informed decisions that may or may not be right, but I wasn't trying to say it will go one way or another"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Was there ever a difference?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Except you forgot to carry the 3 to the niner which means definitally, kinda sorta"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fortunately for us, we get to see the end result in time LOL I guess we will find out right!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Outlook not so good
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"yes, but no. Earnings is just one potential catalyst, and there is a lot speculation on how that even will impact price. It may go up or down honestly. Historically, even with good earnings, stocks often go down after the earnings. So while it may add momentum, it may not. At the same time, that event is hardly the make or break for momentum. A series of different things can happen in the coming weeks so it really doesnt come down to any one event in particular"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,so buy more end of March? Got it!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"What are your reasons to believe that? Seriously asking here, i'm trying to diversify my opinon as much as possible"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"They would to mitigate bad earnings, like ""guys we didn't do great, but we made the changes, see here"" ..."

Too many seem to think our contributions have a real impact on this stonk. They dont. We need big dicked whales to jump in and let us cozy up under their large whale bellies to clean thrm and snatch up scraps."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This proposal sounds as sure a thing as gme stonks actually going to the moon!  Im in.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Still going to need more than a few people like yourself to get the volume needed. Its gotta go viral like it started to in january. Then whales. Then crazy retail frenzy. We need tom hanks to get on board.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Descending triangles are bearish and come from downtrends
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,No it doesn't. Just look at the volume and you'll see why. All it takes is one 2 million order to execute and your TA is up in flames and GME is such a stock that you can see high volumes in patches on 15 min candles.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"TA works on every stock except when it doesn't. It's astrology at worst, self fulfilled prophecy at best; and with all going on around GME it doesn't make sense to apply it to that stock"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,TA works on literally 0 stocks. Its a placebo effect
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Totally get it. I'm just saying you can have 4 bear signals, and if Ryan Cohen tweets, that goes out the window. TA won't tell you much about a stock that is this prone to volatility based on so many different variables that keep appearing like linting buying, Elon tweeting, DFV in a congressional hearing, etc."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah thats what i'm saying too. The current trend appears to be bearish. In other words the handle part of the cup with handle is usually stagnant or bearish. In the post I say that we need high volume to break out of it
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If TA worked in general, everyone would be a moolianeer"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I refuse to believe its possible to be as retarded as you
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yah except, RC has tweeted when momentum was on our side. And suddenly its silence when there's bearish sentiment. It's almost like they know not to waste things that might help momentum until it's the right time to do so. You actually bring up a really interesting point though! I think my next post will be comparing social media mentions in correlation to technical signals"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure! IMO the only one u need is Trading for a Living by Alexander Elder. People may say whatever they want about his trading system, but the general advice about market psychology and his breakdown of TA is gold. I personally use webull charts, and I actually reread the TA portion of his book every 6 or 8 months and adjust my charts accordingly."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Last time I bought on the way down I ended up quadrupling my investment.  Seems like a solid plan.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,God! I love this sub. I‚Äôm still giggling with your camel comment.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fetch , is still poorly timed"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,üòã
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,If
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Its not bearish if it comes from upside
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"U guys are actually all right. LOL TA only works if the pattern is absolutely perfect with absolutely perfect volume ranges. So it does work on all stocks, as long as it already has happened. That being said, the institutions have so many advantages, shouldn't retail investors use ALL the tools they have at their disposal, which includes fundamentals, TA, and risk management rules ect ect"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thats the dumbest shit ive heard. A majority of full time traders, especially who are scalping or day trading fully rely on TA to place their trades. I dont know where this 'TA doesnt work' came from but I assume its because you cant comprehend it. You realize literally trillions of dollars are being traded by algorithms based off of TA, billions from MM's, and hedge funds, prop firms, and experienced retail. Other than news reports / catalysts, TA is what moves the market. For GME, it is arguable that TA over a longer period of time isnt as accurate but intraday levels are just as any other high volume stock. When youve been staring at charts for 5 years you learn a thing or two"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ta ofcourse works. But its natural, either you get it or you don't. 

I've seen some of the most amazing price action traders irl who use simple indicators like stochastic rsi, support and resistance and candlesticks to get the feel of the market and swing trade like a fucking pro.

But you gotta know what you're using and how you're using. Most people just follow textbooks and think that's TA. There needs to be a trading system of sorts for yourself to consider taking trades only when all of them point to a buy signal."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah? You believe in horoscopes too?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Now that is what would be really interesting.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Do that last part.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Bearish sentiment began on 3/12. Signals are converging dmi and macd with overselling. The descending triangle starts on 3/12. Either were talking about two different things or we have a different definition of upside?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"it's not even all that just knowing about the pattern allows us to influence the pattern meaning if I'm a market maker I can change your cup and ball analysis and create a different picture that will fool you. It's very meta, technical analysis is only good for explaining what happened in retrospect in my opinion not for predicting the future. You just have to look at the current state of things to understand the market."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,All this talk of T&A is making ape friskyü¶çü¶ç.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,TA is 5% patterns and 95% price action
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Clearly you are Neo and I am just sad frustrated Cypher
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I hear u. I fully support T&A analysis.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Reddit appears to be biased against TA. Admittedly, I'm not sure whether some of the more complex TA concepts are necessarily *that* reliable, but basic concepts like support/resistance/volume (OBV, VWAP) and even fib extensions/retracements are clearly useful in some situations (even if it's only because people think they are). Appears to be a reddit blind spot."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Continuation patterns are based off the previous trend not the current one
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yah I agree. TA shows yesterday's trend not tomorrow's. But it's one of many things I have at my disposal to make an educated bet. As with any tool, need to take in it with a grain of salt"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cup and ball analysis? Don't you mean cock and ballz analysis? (As in: dis guyz a real cock'nballz, dis fuckin guy!!)ü¶ç"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,we are all neo and that's why technical analysis appears to work by explaining the past but can't be used to predict the future because we're all writing the future in the now.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's natural to be biased against something when people don't understand what it is! All of these indicators are tools. In the right hands proper tools can be used to create great things or they go to waste if they're not used properly. And honestly if someone doesn't like TA, that's okay too. They'll prob just retard thru and make huge gains anyways. To each their own"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm certainly not biased against T&A, I'll tell you dat!ü¶çü¶çü¶ç"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"oh! I see what you mean now. Yeah my bad, my mistake. I was mainly looking at 3/16-3/19. I am going to change my post to say downward trend lines, instead of descending triangle. Side note, how would you classify the action from 3/10to 3/19 then? Do you think it falls into any pattern?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also, I changed the wording! Take a look, see"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If nothing else understanding the psychology behind x number of people using ta and x number of people trading emotionally is probably a better source of insight. I've only invested in things that I thought I could understand or that I use in my own life, or have experience with in my past.

A screenshot of this situation would be your ta above. It's true right now. We know the facts that you're talking about are facts and the opinions are opinions. it's good to talk about this and try to understand the situation from as many angles as possible.

I believe GameStop will go up a lot because of the current situation."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That's a cool way to think about it! I always saw TA as a visual representation of market psychology. There are always a mix of institutions and retail investors fighting on every stock and sometimes TA gives me insight on who's winning
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Whoever has the most information will make the best determinations and therefore in a stock market will make the most money. Right? that's why fraud is really important to crack down on in the marketplace because things like insider information and shares fraud give unfair advantage to certain people or entities.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I transferred on same day as you - everything finished up late last night. You'll be good on Monday.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did a move on Monday that was final on Thursday, but it wasn‚Äôt from RH. I moved $23k of shares to close the account and the whole thing was done in 96 hours. 

If your shit takes forever I suspect the blame is on RH."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro if we moon during your transfer and you dm me proof I'll legit paypal you part of my tendies. No cap
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Upvoted for getting out of RH. We gots enemies.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I FOMO'ed hard like that a couple weeks ago. Transfer to Fidelity only takes like a day or so AS LONG AS your shares have been chilling with RH for at least a week. If you just bought your shares like yesterday then yeah the funds have to settle and you're SOL for a few days.

From there once the transfers done, a couple of days later contact Fidelitys customer service (I would recommend live chat) and ask them to switch your shares from margin to cash. 

None of this is financial advice, but my wife's boyfriend might buy me a nintendo switch if we make lots of money on my GME shares."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The upside of this is that while your shares are stuck in limbo, the odds of the squeeze happening for the rest of us jump astronomically!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"My transfer to Fidelity was only like a day. They've got a good rhythm going I think, expecting people to jump ship from RH."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I started my transfer to Fidelity on Wednesday or Thursday. My shares were there and out of RH this morning. (Saturday)
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Everyone so far has reported that they bailed on Wednesday/Thursday, and was completed by Friday."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fear not, I hold strong for my fellow retards in transit!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you transfer all of your securities or just GME? You can speed it up if you'd have left at least 1 share of something in your RH. I too moved my shit on Wednesday from RH to Fidelity except my 12 GME and 10 AMC were settled in my Fidelity by Friday market open
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,given gold to help combat the instant downvoters. stay strong fellow ape
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way. Godspeed sir.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"you will just be buying first class tix instead of economy class that all. You'll be fine, they so fucking short on this shit its gonna take a week alone to even see a down trend."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck Robinhood.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I transferred Wednesday night got mine this morning. Some people on the same thread said they did there‚Äôs Thursday/Friday and also got it Saturday morning.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mine transferred in three days and was in my account last night, I was also able to play on robinhood while they were transferring, although i didn‚Äôt try to make any trades. I think you‚Äôre good"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm keeping what I have on RH but every trade I make is on fidelity.  At the end of this chapter I‚Äôll close out RH and continue using fidelity
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Mine just cleared this weekend.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,If it happens it'll take weeks if not a month or five
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel your pain. Did the same exact shit Wednesday. Except it was from stash. Hoping it clears before earnings report.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"MINE IS ALREADY COMPLETED TO ESTIMATED IT WOULD BE DONE BY THE 25TH BUT WOKE UP THIS MORING TO THEM TRANSFERRED. 

I INITIATED IT ON THE 17TH"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats why i left my gme in RH. No great choices here.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Brother.

You're fine.

Don't panic if you see us shoot up to test 359 again.

Don't even panic if you see us pass it...

Because we will likely get dunked back down again.

I guarantee that the options chains in April mean that we are VERY LIKELY to trade sideways until then, if not just slowly bleeding.

It is going to be agonising for everyone.

I understand that a lot of HFs who are short on GME have deep OTM options in both directions. Bleeding the max cost from them ensures higher likelihood of margin calling and BANG. Liftoff."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thought the same thing when I transferred to webull a few weeks ago just as things started to heat up. 

It didn‚Äôt take the whole time they said it would, maybe you‚Äôll have the same fortune"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It took two days for the share to transfer
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I liquidated out of Robinhood to get the Schwab.  Those mf'ers let my xfer stall and die so I had to clear and move to make the last series of dips.  Still made a profit, but that counted as sells and wasn't what I wanted at all."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,How long might a transfer to Webull take?? I need out of RH bad
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Good luck with that. I had to initiate the transfer twice because RH was doing some fuck shit.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Spread the word, APRIL 1ST PULL ALL YOUR MONEY OUT OF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT. MAKE THE BANKS OUR BITCH"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Incase case the transfer happens during the squeeze you can short it when it squeezes really high since you'll have shares to cover it.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It should have been obvious as to what type of people were at Robinhood from the beginning. You were never allowed to transfer any of your buttcoins out of there; just buy and sell.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn, merril usually settles the same day."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for easing my worries. I also did them after market close on Wednesday so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea I don‚Äôt think it would be on Fidelity‚Äôs end, definitely RH. Rh is also charging me 75 for the account transfer and liquidating my partial shares even though fidelity supports it. In short, fuck robinhood. Just saw an ad for them while watching March madness and now I‚Äôm angry. Going to go yell at the sky next commercial break"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Such a kind ape, sharing his banana tendies ü¶ç ‚ù§Ô∏è"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The downvotes are fucking pouring here in. Blow me vlad!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,My gme has been chilling for a couple months but I bought some NOK options on Monday shit haha
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Was just on the phone with them. I have a couple shares at RH and the rest at public.com (apex clearing, baddies) . tried doing a transfer 3 days ago, RH didnt process shit but thats fine. Apex showed that I have $91 cash balance ( No idea where that came from) and 0 GME shares. I go on public.com and it dropped my shares from 26.86 to 26. How is this legal ?? How is RH not processing my shit ?? Fidelity's Customer service is amazing though, I hope i can get my shit fixed before the squeeze."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre welcome!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I read ‚Äúlimbo‚Äù as ‚Äúlambo‚Äù and then started thinking about driving a lambo and forgot what the thread was about...  

oh yea some guy is gunna get fucked.  I‚Äôll beep the horn when I go by"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Fidelity's customer service was doing 24/7 last week from the migration flock from RH. Gotta appreciate these guys.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Well uhhhh hopefully I‚Äôll wake up Monday to it being cleared lmao
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,üçå ü¶ç

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,How much did it cost you to transfer?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is why I transferred instead of selling and withdrawing. If I trusted robinhood to get me my cash in a timely manner I would have done that but with my past experience I had a feeling I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to withdraw for a week or so
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"DID YOU JUST ASSUME MY ACCOUNT BALANCE
ITS ALREADY 0"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Big brain retard play I‚Äôll keep this in my back pocket
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you do a partial transfer or full? I did a partial and just listed the stocks in my portfolio.. Not sure if that impacts the time to process or not.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Liquidating partial shares is standard. $75 transfer fee is not unheard of, either. I paid that fee 15 years ago moving out of an Ameritrade account. That was back before trades were free."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I left my faction share in robinhood because i like the app but hate the company and i‚Äôm not even willing to sell a fraction of a share... fuck that.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you open a fidelity account first or did it get created as part of the transfer
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Do a partial for the GME then
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"partial shares are ~~always~~  often liquidated in transfer.

This is because you don't own partial shares. Your broker does. So there is nothing to transfer accept what's in the broker's books.

Now, $91 for 0.86 shares does seem screwy. That about $105/share"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I'll send you a post card from Uranus
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Fidelity‚Äôs customer service is good.  They saved my dumbass after I made a stupid mistake.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The fuckery by RH and their control of the market is unacceptable.  So I'm happy a broker has been taking the immigrants in with priority.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have heard others question that however I don't think it's an issue. I had (12) GME shares and (10) AMC shares transferred over with a breeze.
Edit: Its not necessarily volume but when you transfer all of your positions, RH closes your account which supposedly makes the transfer last longer. I wouldn't panic. Perhaps you can try buying at least 1 other security on Monday market open. Hopefully that might void and/or prolong your transfer"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,$75. RH sold all my partial shares and that came out to $60.60 or something. Then when I added money about a week later it took the rest from that
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Once we all take the money out we can give some to you
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Full account transfer. Luckily I already closed all my other positions weeks ago to buy more gme so it‚Äôs just gme and 2 NOK calls I bought monday that need transferring
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm still going to be irrationally angry about this
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Created fidelity account then transferred
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh shoot didn't know* that, makes sense."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Immigration is a choice. Y'all are refugees brother.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"When Robinhood closes your account, how is the $75 fee applied?

Will my Robinhood show $-75 if I don‚Äôt have any cash in there at the time of transfer? 

Sorry to ask here, but I figure you or someone might know since I‚Äôve been having a hard time finding that info."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I LIKE TO PARTY!!!!!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Understood. 

Back when I paid to transfer I wanted to just dump all the shares, transfer the cash for free, then buy the shares back in the new account to avoid the $75. Problem was at $15 per trade commission that would have cost me *more.*  

In your case there‚Äôs no commission, but you could totally get fucked by price movement between the sell and the buy. 

Bottom line: it sucks. You can‚Äôt win."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Was never on RH.  People leaving RH are emigrants, and immigrants to where they find their home again.

I do agree with RH users leaving being Refugees though!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Hell heah.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Even though I had approx $150 in my RH, they charged the -$75 to my Fidelity"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea I considered the sell transfer buy option but you are correct, the transfer and eating the fee is definitely the least of the evils here. At least this is a one time thing and once I‚Äôm out of RH I‚Äôm out"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh yeah see I‚Äôve been doing it the other way paying to play so every time it starts going up I have to buy more thinking it‚Äôs gonna only get more costly like inflation !

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I was gonna say the same thing. I'm never mad if one share becomes over priced a few minutes later but multiple shares? Naaa.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea I tried to buy the dips and sell the peaks ended up buying the peaks selling the dips now I‚Äôm just holding
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not super-experienced, and I don't know yours, but do you read candlestick graphs? Because it could help you anticipate the dip"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,lol so true
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Guess who put 170 as their buy when gme hit 172.50 lol

going to add in a little edit here: I saw on youtube a google talk where an investor says he never uses limits for this reason ^. You dont know where the bottom is, I didnt know where the bottom was, $2.5 a share doesnt mean much I would have jumped on that even quicker. So what do we do? 

Hey says nothing, place your buy and dont worry about limits, you can easily miss opportunities that would be just as great. Set your buy in the morning and carry on. Just an different perspective on the same issue"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Got it. Setting a limit buy order for 100 @ $0.01. Now I can just sit back and wait till I‚Äôm a millionaire.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way. I just haven‚Äôt got the wrinkles to work that out
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Then the dip makes a turn just a bit above your limit order.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agree with your comment that it is awesome having an actual discussion around here again.  I think you're generally correct but still early.  The bond market is going to have tantrums in fits and spurts (my opinion) but the inflows are still coming into equities.  While everyone is a bit nervous on valuations, I also think that most companies used the last few quarters to kitchen-sink everything.  

This quarter's earnings are going to be lapping the original coronavirus shut down.  What I expect to happen when earnings start in 3-4 weeks is that a lot of companies guide up (the banks will recapture last year's loan loss reserves as earnings as an example) and companies like KO and restaurants that haven't provided guidance will start to talk about forward visibility with travel/live entertainment opening back up fully.

In addition, don't forget all the stimulus that never got spent.  Not all of it went into GME or loss porn.  American consumers have their strongest balance sheet's ever, and their pent up demand to get out and spend is outrageous.  

I actually think we have another melt up mid-April/early May.  Then... SELL IN MAY, WALK AWAY.

But I'm an idiot and and optimist.  Not a professional.  Not even a good amateur..."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Bears are gay but you‚Äôre not wrong here. If Jpow can‚Äôt control the bond market things could get a little ugly in the short term. There is some tail winds out there though I expect a lot of earnings beats this year which will make stocks look less expensive.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm gettings comments about further dated expirations to prevent as much theta decay while moving further OTM. I do agree that perhaps a spread of puts on further dates and expirations is the best play here.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This awakened something in me. I haven‚Äôt been excited about SPY puts in a long, long time. I had to hibernate the last year. It was awful."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"you forgot that while most other indexes have just recovered, nasdaq is trading at a +33% premium."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think a stronger play is puts on TLT if your conviction is a rise in yields, as we've seen recently, QQQ corrected by 10% and there was money waiting on the sidelines to buy the dip. 

This money wasn't stimmy checks, but rather low interest rates on institutional borrowing. This will still be around.

With SLR exemption expiring, the banks will be eager to lend out even more money they will get from selling the bonds they're bagholding to satisfy jpow.

Jpow was pushed into a corner and he caved in. In the short term we'll see a spike in yields and another sell off in the bonds but this will reach an equilibrium at some point.

We also have another problem, that is inflation. Jpow has caved in and doesn't mind let inflation run hotter, so he's not going to raise the interest rates. This will let the bull run continue on equities, 

A. Because there's nowhere else to put your money where it'll be safe from inflation and 

B. Because the money leaving the bonds has to go somewhere where it's both low risk and provides higher returns than inflation (think boomer stonks and commodities)

I think QQQ will continue flat for the next month, same with SPY, but the boomer stonks will drag these up so maybe DJI will rise as it's been lagging SPY and QQQ a good bit.

Once we see a rise in interest rates, the money flow will cool off and people go back into the bonds. We may see a rug pull at that point. 

TLT 125P 4/16

The put to call ratio is like 5:1 on 4/16, institutional investors are expecting a literal dump into double digits here."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah I would like to dispute this by saying TLT is highly shorted. I would like to point out that it started happening in September during the height of tech. The surge in long bonds would not cause a crash, rather it would likely cause a spike. I believe that hedge funds started shorting long bonds in order to cause tech to fall prior to the rebalancing that typically happens every December by passively managed funds. This year, they took greater advantage of that by selling the bonds prematurely and effectively causing tech to be sold off so the portfolio managers could manage a specific percentage of equal weighting.         

In short, hedge funds have been shorting tlt with short sales, using options to make it drop faster as it hits different tiers, and compounding the money they make with tech puts. They are preying on your parents‚Äô retirement funds. The only way to protect your parents is by forcing the lawmakers to ban short selling similar to how almost  every other nation in the world has banned short selling at some point in the past year(a lot of them still have it in effect). If congress and senate don‚Äôt ban short selling, they are complicit in allowing your parents to be scammed.         

For everyone buying the shills of investing in other countries, please look into if they have a short sales ban. I know the media has been shilling Korea specifically, but Korea has a short ban that comes off in March or May of 2021. Dont get caught holding that bag and do your research."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"My reasoning is based off of what Bloomberg analysts have said about tlt being shorted, and the fact that tlt has been the driver of accurately day trading qqq for the past 8+ months on a tick for tick basis running on the 5 minute candles. On Friday it reversed where qqq was leading tlt apart from 3 15 minute anomalies where the charts didn‚Äôt match. That made me believe it was the turn of tech and the bond sell off as people either started covering or retirement funds started rotating out of cyclicals."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am fairly heavy in $MO and a position in $PM. 

I think DD was good OP. I am going to take a peak. 

Good luck."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,All hail the weekend where I can finally find good DD on this sub. Will def be taking a look at it on Monday. Thanks friend!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for the thorough and well written DD!

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a buddy who's a retired hedge fund manager and he likes to day trade BTI as he says it's usually trending between $30-36 the last 2-3 years
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I got into Altria and bti after I cashed out of gme end of Jan. Been good to me ;)
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck you King George were murican murican tobaccos!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,awesome to hear. i really like $pm as a breakout too but the spreads on their contracts are so wide that it makes it difficult to find a position to fill
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Small Position $MO here also , will take a deeper look back into BTI. 

Last year I wanted to 50/50 but felt greedy going into just 1 ."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,thanks for the support! hopeful we can get back to a sub with dd reflective of the whole stock market
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"thanks, glad you enjoyed!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"for sure, it has been stuck in a choppy zone. thinking we're breaking out!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,you‚Äôre not out of money it‚Äôs literally only 25% of ur portfolio
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought in at 38.....it‚Äôll be okay fren....somebody for the love of fuck please tell me it‚Äôll be okay
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,4100 @ $24.35. let's go!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I have faith it‚Äôs a great long term stock
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell covered calls my guy
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"600 shares at $26. I have been buying 2023 leaps instead of averaging down more. If I can get them at 9.60 or less, I buy. HODL for mama Cathy"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok. Fuck you and fuck Robbinghood
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,6.9% that's a 69 but interrupted by a period.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Start selling CCs this stock isn‚Äôt getting to $100 anytime soon.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Well done ü¶çüíéüôè
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,PLTR üöÄüíéüôåüèª
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe it's because I'm new here but I don't understand why people here don't average down more. 

PS: 38.445 shares at $25.56. Originally got in around $31. Will continue to average down during dips."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Avg down is much worse than holding a losing position. Mathematically it makes 0 sense but psychologically makes us feel good...IF it eventually works out.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,U beast im averaging 2 shares at 276
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"you missed the set up PLTR recurring button.

if you click that you get instant tendies."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What calls you holding?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,i want to know more about these 12 options contracts worth 250 bux.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I got a good average when it went down to $21 a few weeks back :) WEN MOOOOON
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Holding 100 at 24.50 or so. I expect it will go up when tech starts mooning again for no reason
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,2070 @ 25.31 - might add more on Monday if I don‚Äôt find any great short term plays by then.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Same!  Already close to covering the difference with covered calls and CSPs.  Stay strong. It will rally again soon!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You are fine! I bought at $29 then it went down all the way down to $22. Averaged down at $25 and offloaded extra shares at $36. currently holding 1400 shares at an average of $24.6 (excluding profit made previously) and 23K worth of 2023 leaps.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just got assigned on a $29 CPS and $25 CPS. Got $325 and $385 premium out of them respectively. Unfortunately I just realized PLTR is 75% of my portfolio now............. lol

Crazy thing is that before I sold these CSPs I had made enough premium out of CSP/CC that my break even would have been $2.06 a share lol"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôll ride you to 100 ü§åüèºüçí
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah. You‚Äôre in for the long haul bro. Get comfortable.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It wil...... might take a while tho.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy Moly!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,How much are the premiums on the leaps these days? What breakeven calcs are you using?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You don't care about the strike on the leaps? And why choose LEAPS over shares? Is the IV low enough to make it worth it?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You gonna let a little blood stop you?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Your portfolio quickly becomes overweight in the stock. See the 300 shares of micron I accumulated in 3018
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Because not everyone has the money to average down limitlessly
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's just a matter of how much you want to invest in a stock... No matter how good the pick, and how good the price, and PLTR is a great pick, risk is not zero..."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,We don‚Äôt know what we‚Äôre doing.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"In a perfect world you would buy a stock when the price reaches the bottom.

You'll never know the bottom.

In a perfect world you'll sell a stock when it reaches the top.

You'll never know the top.

Never catch a falling knife. What do you advise these individuals do instead?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This isn‚Äôt GME dude...lol
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,April 1 30c currently getting fucked. We don't talk about those.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What would you say if I was holding PLUG at +61? Am I still comfortable or should I just end it now
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got for the 30C 01/2023, as of close Friday they were 9.85. Still at a good price there but I want deals."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,3018? Tell me how AMC ATH and on what date please!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That's true. But they had enough money to drop 5 digit figures at one time so I just presume they could drop drop a few hundred dollars to help themselves out.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This. I ran out of dip buying money for Palantir 3 weeks ago üòÇüòÇüòÇ
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hear ya but at given moment I can be up maybe $50 because I averaged down. If I kept it at the original price, I would be in the red everyday all day."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,ü§£
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn i thought every post is anout gme nowdays
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yo are you me?

250 shares @24.64 avg

10x PLTR 4/1 30c @64 avg

If it stays low next week ill be avg down on these calls lmao cause fuck that."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You don't know how much they spend when their average was 33. You only know that their 550 shares are now worth $13420.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also, if you bought originally at a higher price, doesn't mean it was a bad play, just means you have to hold a bit longer..."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah averaging down is good play if you've got the balls and the cash and the belief in the pick... That's a few ifs though...
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Then you‚Äôre missing AMC
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I was speaking in general and was not referring to OP at all.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Never said it was a bad play. Just average down if you can (especially if the price has been consistently down $5 since when people originally got them per their posts on here).
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You literally said 
""... But *they* had enough money to drop 5 digit figures at one time so I just presume *they* could drop drop a few hundred dollars to help themselves out."""
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah sure, if you've got the money, and the appetite, and it's good stock, BTFD!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"That was about people who dropped a lot of money and complains about the price without trying to double down.

Pretty sure OP dropped a lot of money then averaged down which means my statement doesnt pertain to them.

Anyhoo, you seem like you want to argue or debate this for some reason so you win. Congrats."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought at 20 and sold at 13
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice brother! I was a retard and sold my 1000 shares in August/sept when price jumped to $3.50 lol
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ya rode it from about $2 - $7, then got out. Good on ya!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Grats on this W. Thinking of attempting this with Ryce.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,ridden from sub-$2 to nearly $30 back to $15. waiting on $100. üíéüôåüèª
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I swear some of you are allergic to making money
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hope it flys Back to 25$ 

I bought at 17$ üöÄüöÄ"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn mans gonna have them tax free TENDIES
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,can someone explain what happened with FCEL? I sold early too...never thought it would go from $2 to $20 so fast
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice going! Hold for another 5 years
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice run retard!

I did pretty well in it and just sold a CSP Friday. I will be getting back in."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Their eps is negative their net profit is negative. What the hell?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Ride or Die That's The only Way here :}
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Before this GME mad brilliance, FCEL was  by far the best stock I'd ever bought into. 

I've been watching it for a year and a half, and I'm convinced that it's as solid an investment that one can make, outside of breaking hedgefund heads using their own system against them with GME."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you look at this chart from 2000 shit went parabolic. Doesn‚Äôt that look familiar? I‚Äôm just struggling to understand the logic of investing in the current market. Doesn‚Äôt necessarily apply to you since you got into this well after it had crashed. But still, it‚Äôs so obvious that we‚Äôre in a massive bubble that will make straight up destitute bag holders out of so many. I just don‚Äôt get it"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Son of a bitch I wish I did this frfr I almost did with $15,800 ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope you are at least selling CCs against them.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"that sucks, still using judashood"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Cum harder bro
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,25 (pre-split) and .57
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Profit is profit üöÄ
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,you aren't a retard if you realized your gains
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It looking good?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Holding with you.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Not allergic just terrified.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Then you gotta pay taxes.  Who‚Äôs the real idiot here.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"FYI: long term capital gains tax is *lower* than short term, but it‚Äôs **not** nothing."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,you familiar with any technology in its ripening stages? you know..... for instance........ previously............. tesla?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You'd like MVIS.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You make sense. My buddy told me that too. Especially with call options. Get out near top and wait for stock to settle. Fight the urge of FOMO.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"My account is up 672% YTD soooo good?

Edit: Sorry its 750% YTD, sh!t settled today...."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs only paper hands when you sell at a loss. Nobody has ever gone broke cashing out tendies.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You can't make money if you don't sell retard
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It has potential for a sizable upside if you look at the pre covid share price. I would suggest doing some DD because they've been hurting badly during the pandemic.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You're right don't get out at over 1400% gains because you are afraid of taxes. Let the stock drop half its value (which would not have been even close to the income tax owed) and now hope the tanking does not continue. Stocks only go up.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,A lot lower
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,it‚Äôs zero up to $80k i thought. either way.. much damn lower.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but tesla built a whole business in like 15 years. Fcel has been dogshitting for like 30"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Interesting. 

I may buy some up once the squeeze gives me the funds to make such wise investments."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,i would never touch that shit even if it moons. complete rug pull
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you expect there's more in it, you can stagger your sell orders, sell in 1/3's until it really stops going up and turns over."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm in Rycey as well for the same reason. That and the fact that UK government would never let it die. Hate that it's not optionable.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"lmao. what dumb ass sells a hydro stock before it really becomes a thing. ü§°

not to mention this will easily see $30 end of year. zero worries. free ass cash."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"\*if\* you're single and have <$40k income \*combined\* (W2, 1099, investments, etc), then it's 0. otherwise it's still a lot less than short term, which is taxed at your normal income rate."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,50
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,because there was no hurry for people to want to do anything with their tech until now.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Check r/mvis if you want an overwhelming amount of DD. Most of us have been in since under $1 and continue riding it.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This mentality will lose you money.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed. But can't complain getting in at this price if it does go back up. A 5k invest could net almost 6 figures if it hits $20+
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure, but a ton of that growth is priced in already, and the management team has proven to be ineffective. Decent battery tech will also reck their up too. If the hyln battery tech is what they say it is the advantages would fix the major drawbacks. Anyway that's just my thoughts. Open to a counter argument, I held fcel for awhile but just don't see too much real upside, just a crowded fomo trade. Bets of luck!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,ok good luck
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"bro current market cap is around $14.5B, $20 per share would imply a market cap of $171B lmao"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"‚Äúineffective management‚Äù


***fails to know who jason few is***"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Stranger things have happened.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I just purchased shares on Thursday so this is some welcome party you guys are having for me. Just picked up a new keg in anticipation of Monday.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"1000 shares + options reporting in. Still holding. Still plan to. They are profitable, growing, brokers love them and there is pent up demand for housing despite whatever happens with interest rates."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Index inclusions don‚Äôt make the stock price go up. The news is good but that‚Äôs it and that‚Äôs only temporary. Doesn‚Äôt impact my feeling on the stock in the least as it was always about the value.
I‚Äôm sure we will have a dip from the paper hands though."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Can't wait to buy the dip Monday. If this gets to $11 by mid may I'll buy my wife's boyfriend a Corvette.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you're in the tri-state area I already found a few good soup kitchens while I still have internet access , lmk"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,im definitely in with you retards with 855 shares üíéüëêüèº
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck paper handed bitches
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's a long hold play. The fundamentals of this company haven't changed, and they are strong.

Gonna hold my shares and call options (expiry August), momma didn't raise no paper handed bitch."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not trying to be a dick, but don‚Äôt YOLOs have to be a minimum of 10k?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,When I bought these shares I didn't plan on selling them this quarter or next why would I now? üíéüôå
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Right there with you. The 4/16 calls i have are gonna give me hella anxiety though.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So what I‚Äôm hearing is this is gonna crash and I‚Äôm going to average down and increase my position.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bag holding at 13.50 since GHIV
My paper hands have been waitinf to unload these the moment it hits 13.51

My most regretful stock all year."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,70@9.39 checking in.. will get more when it dips Monday
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you see UWMC Twitter they're trying to fix their russel inclusion[here's their Twitter](https://twitter.com/UWMlending?s=09)
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Why don‚Äôt you buy the stocks instead of options? don‚Äôt have the momentum for options on this right now
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought a few shares at 8.33, before I heard all this news and fuss about it"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Holding 1500 shares at 9 and 100x 4/16c $10. Solid company. In it to win it.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Flavor of the week.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,My only question is my 4/16 calls gonna print or not
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"buy some shares, so it can rocket"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Why y'all still in RH pussies!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Only got 35 shares@sub $9 but I'll actually be happy if this tanks a bit on Monday so I can buy more at discount ü§™
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It didn‚Äôt get included this quarter because there isn‚Äôt 5% available float to the public yet because some of the shares have a lock up period that end soon and they should be included in q2 or q3 at the latest
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,When is earnings ? Holding calls + shares üöÄ
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Not gonna sell either. Holding 3K shares and maybe i'll buy another 1000 next weeküöÄüöÄüöÄ
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm glad someone called them out. They are screaming and kicking today.. 
I kinda see it as a win for me.. my average is 9.36,I think.. so if they sell Monday.. that drop the price low enough for me to average down."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I went in Monday. Don‚Äôt worry interest rates will hike, the brokers hate rocket and they always win, this thing is at its IPO price and set to profit big when the rest of the market will tank. This is a value play mate this is totally financial advice sec"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm with you retard üíéüôå next week we ride or die, I think of apes unite we should be good üòå"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This - wish people would stop posting bullshit that scares people into selling.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"üôèüèæ I feel you bro, a lot of abandon ship incoming Monday"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,But it would require index funds that hold Russel 2k to buy UWMC.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao nice
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the WAY
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,üíéüôå I‚Äôll have to scrape some tendies together and get some December calls after having front row seats to my FD calls üò∂

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuckin same lol I have 8k set aside for a down payment on a house, trying not to touch my 401k. Put 500 down on $14 calls for April and was hoping to get a few extra grand for new shit for the house. Not totally gonna fuck me because I got some other good plays going for me right now but damn.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I honestly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs crashing. That would insinuate the entire value of the stock was contingent on the Russell index, which is complete horse shit"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What's the strike on those 4/16s
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôll throw another 5k at it for 7.50
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs at 8.95 and everyone‚Äôs freaking out? It was basically flat yesterday. Did they expect it to 50x?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think I should also mention it‚Äôs my first house, so I qualify for an FHA loan, which helps a lot. And with rates being low for now I couldn‚Äôt help but buy a house. It‚Äôs always been cheaper to rent here but shit went up a lot over the past few years and it is now cheaper to just buy ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I‚Äôve been saving money since I was 14 and have never touched any of it.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I actually only need 4k down for a 2400sq ft house where I live but figured I‚Äôd save more for inspections and what not. Nice attempt at an insult, I guess? That‚Äôs my house fund. I‚Äôm 31 with 89k in between my two savings accounts. Not mentioning my business account or my actual checking account. I think I‚Äôm ok."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn dude I was just asking where you live that $8k is a reasonable down payment. No need to be a little salty boy about it.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don‚Äôt sweat it man, i‚Äôm sure dude paid $300/sf for his house in an overpriced market."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They said they‚Äôre reviewing the situation and talking to the russell people about it. Some misunderstanding about available float or something.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is why I stay off the internet lol. I have a short fuse.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Middle of nowhere Ohio on the lake. Houses range from 80k-5mil where I live in a little port town. Most houses are 140-280k.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Even if it‚Äôs not included doesn‚Äôt affect the fact that they‚Äôre the largest most broker favored wholesale mortgage supplier in the us lmao like how can it possibly stay down at a lower valuation when all these low interest rates + stimulus/welfare shit will get everyone thinking they should get a house. Either that or the fed raises interest rates like they should and mortgage lenders still make more money. Doesn‚Äôt make sense to say it‚Äôs dead if they don‚Äôt get in Russell wtf kind of stupidity is this.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,12/17 7.5 calls all the way bought em at $7.80 cheap
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro, I know it‚Äôs undervalued, in my opinion this is a solid $20 , no way this should be trading at its price right now even tho it has recent IPO, but my options are April and may so I need this shit to start trading at its analyst PT which is $12-$13 lol"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,There are a bunch of stupid people out there hahahahaha

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Retards used GME gains and bought a shitload. I know I did after my options expired ITM for GME.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre saying the GME apes had that much capital that they alone bought too many shares? I got mostly calls I thought that was the point get calls so there‚Äôs still a float. Fuck
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"So let me get this straight:

Step 1: Flood the market with shares to depreciate their value

Step 2: ?

Step 3: Profit

Like I'm seriously asking if that's what you just described."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Now consider how much less of a influence your vote carries when your share count goes from 200 to just 50 "" - this is very stupid, after a reverse split you hold the same percentage of total shares as you did before the split, your amount of ""voting power"" (or however you want to think of it) stays the same"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So I should sell my call options bright and early Monday morning and buy more shares?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt all the shares have to be accounted for during a reverse split and all the outstanding borrowed shares need to be settled up?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,how does this primate hold some much stoopid information in his head ?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"So basically ... No more short squeeze... But long term value is there. We'll folks, I guess we bag holding boomer stocks now. I'll wait for my dividend check please."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So as a reverse split it would cause the price to increase correct? like reverse of aapl and tsla
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, sell on Monday? I have June and September calls I‚Äôm not 100% sure what to do lol. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Well explained... üôåüèª
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I really think they are planning something good for all of the shareholders and to fuck their hedgies. I came to this casino to play and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm gonna do haha buy and hold (not financial advice)
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is fine if the company wasn't fighting through bankruptcy not too long ago.

If they increase shares and people decide to sell before then I think they're back to square one, so it's risky af...only difference is I assume now that those they fucked over (HF'S) would be more than happy to come back and finish off the job for old times sake."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Step 2 is buy them all cheap.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Percentages anyone?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt buy calls retart
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"By reading and learning about it.

Yes we are all Retards here but, we need to fucking learn about what we are doing.

The problem with pretending to be retarded or autistic is that it gets flooded by legit Retards who don't know jackshit about stock markets apart from buying selling."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,No dividend :(
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea this shit doesn't fit my conformation bias somebody ban em.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Reverse splits are terrible. The price per share goes up but you then have less shares. Example: say you happen to have 100 shares of AMC at a price of $13/share. They reverse split 2:1, now the price per share is $26 but you only have 50 shares. You now have the same amount of money as before but there are less shares. Typical reasons why companies do this aren‚Äôt cause their price got too low and they were going to get delisted (see what happened to ACB for instance) or they want to artificially increase the price per share so less retail investors buy their shares and more institutional investors find it attractive (GE just announced a reverse split for that like a week or so ago)."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"incorrect, reverse splits are bad. apple and tesla had 5:1 splits not reverse"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Correct
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Lube up
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,HOLD
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,And then the company becomes profitable? Lol
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You don‚Äôt think the hedgies are going to do the same thing with all of their FTDs?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That sounds like a dessert. Retart.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"but I use my lack of knowledge to my advantage, I just want exposure, I am just interested in the payoff."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Nobody said anything about the company... the board members make profits.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Of course they will. Issuing more shares PREVENTS the squeeze. This is why we need to vote against it. Of course, the number of votes retail holds isn‚Äôt enough to do shit."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I maka for uü§å
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,A second try on a dessert.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I got an email from them and my other broker I have AMC with this morning
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,">wait for the company to enter a period of stable growth and profit

OP said: ""wait for the company to enter a period of stable growth and profit."" Sorry for not explicitly saying that in my original post."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah the op has a ton of assumptions in there and doesn‚Äôt even have the current amount of outstanding shares right.  Also, AMC has ALREADY diluted their shares once during this run.  And if the stock is going to plummet in value, then why not sell now, wait to see what happens, and then jump back in if it looks attractive? 

We need to be a firm no on this. Might not matter but have to at least try.

Position: 1000 @ 8.40"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't think he knows about second dessert.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"SCREENSHOT. 

twice I was up 300 percent, n did not take profits....right into the feels."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same I got no email, I own the stocks via Wealthsimple trade"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. That period is not caused by the flood of shares. They wait for it to happen naturally.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I already voted against. I‚Äôm sure it will happen anyway.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, so step 2 is now wait for natural happenings. Sorry for sounding like a smart ass, I just don't see AMC having a good plan to turn things around considering they were already hemorrhaging money pre-pandemic but best of luck."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"As someone who is looooooong on amc theyre simply not worth double digit numbers yet. All they've done is escape bankruptcy. 

Hell.  I wish everyone who has calls and stocks good luck but I personally believe amc is worth 6 bucks max still."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They been saying Ford was undervalued for the longest of time.  Man I wish I can get into something cheap that's under Mofo Valued
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Over the last six months, I have been buying a few calls that are six months out and I‚Äôve made decent money after a couple months and just rolled out and bought some more. Slow and steady good money.

It‚Äôs not flashy like others, but it‚Äôs normally green."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, Ford will make a great breakout this summer.

There's got to be something positive on that note."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,bought few hundred shares of ford when it was between 5 and 9 last year. what do my fellow remorons target for EOY price per share?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm long Ford. Barclays upgraded to $16 and VW recent price movement makes me feel confident. Fords spring investor day could be big if they come out with any good EV plans. And I want a Mach-e üöÄ
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Not financial advice but Ford leaps are cheap af right now. Jan 15c‚Äôs are only $1.7 each and you‚Äôre betting for a roughly 20% increase in 9 months. Pretty safe leveraged boomer play.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree with rolling the calls. What strikes and date are they? I‚Äôm planning to gradually roll out the Sep 12Cs to Jan 2022 calls, to take profits and reduce my delta exposure."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Boomer play, sit on those when they reintroduce dividends."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Im hoping for bigger moves if they outline some ambitious EV plays and/or hit some big EV commercial contracts. They‚Äôre already proving their EV products are hitting the mark, so if the boomer/non growth views drop the revaluations could change rapidly"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I went Jun $15 and Sept $17. ü§ûüèª
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The bottleneck right now is with the chip shortages.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Should i move 18k into this mofo?

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right now I have sept 13c, but if I get about 20% more profit on them, I might roll out to later. Slow and steady.  

Most of my steel plays that expired yesterday crashed and burned, so have some work to do to make up for them."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a couple LEAPs and won‚Äôt buy shares until they reinstate said dividend. Unsure if they will? Haven‚Äôt heard much and I am sure they are going to pour üí∞ into EV to play catch up.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is WSB."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,At least take it to dinner first sheesh
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks better than a model y
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"ya i was hyped AF when i heard they made a ford mustang EV, and then i saw it lmao"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt know where I read it but 2022 was a target year for them to reinstate
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Oof..Money can‚Äôt buy taste ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"At least make it a 2 door coupe.. crossover wtf were they smoking?

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They named their follow up SUV the Escape.  Ford gets it
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Does it come equipped with a secure glove compartment?

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow you guys really hate this stock lol
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank god someone else posted this, im all up in there with calls"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"CNBC and co are supporting the claim that they don‚Äôt like LMCs ‚Äòlanguage‚Äô on pre orders. The only claim in hindenburgs short report that is not opinion based is a 4 year delay in production. If you noticed, these short sided actors have dropped this point. 

The water has always been cloudy as to the length of the line for truck buyers on production day. 

Nobody has concerns about an electric truck selling when there is a shift coming to electric vehicles throughout government. Rivian and LMC combined will not be able to produce enough trucks to replace America‚Äôs truck EV fleet. 

As I said. An SEC complaint will be carried out on Hindenburg for their backing of the production timeline if LMC starts production, and that will give LMC all the financing they need to pay down debts imo. 

I have already signed up for a potential support of LMC against Hindenburg"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Did the ceo write this?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao good luck with that

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You guys may or may not be new, but this is what every end stage corporate equity scam looks like.  I don't think I have ever seen a company pull up from this kind of shit.

Odds are very, very high that the class action is going to find traction and be allowed to proceed.  RIDE will be ordered to be pay their investors all their money back, but they won't since they originals already dissolved with stakeholder money and will arbitrarily declare bankruptancy.  Whatever little is left of the stock price will be zeroed out.  The remaining retail investors will then learn what ""preferred"" stock actually means, which, coincidentally, they have 0 of.  ...and for some reason, no one will go to jail."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Personally, I am not a fan of pure telemedicine and the decline of quality healthcare.  Especially for older patients and patients who have serious problems.  I‚Äôve seen some of the terrible healthcare that mid levels have give and I feel that telemedicine may attempt to push that way to cut costs.  Ridiculously over ordering labs and imaging without taking a good history.  Sure these things will allow insurances to bill more at the cost to patients.

Telemedicine can contribute to the health of a patient if they see someone and establish care with them first (I do a lot of telemedicine with my patients after I‚Äôve seen them in person - I‚Äôm capitated so they don‚Äôt pay me extra).  But there are some issues that need to be dealt with in person.  But I‚Äôm mostly talking about this from the angle of better healthcare and not the business side of it.  It could expand, I haven‚Äôt looked into these companies in terms of the business side much.

I don‚Äôt have any positions in any of these telemedicine companies.  I have to turn away new patients because I have so many, unfortunately I can‚Äôt take a lot of patients and people might have a hard time finding good providers and have to go on these platforms.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I am a family practice provider with a 4.9/5 rating. I say this because the comments from patients are in regards to how easy going I am and can talk about anything with. With that said - the number of men that I reconcile sildenafil 20mg 2-3 tab 1 hr prior to sex from an outside pharmacy when I see them for their next check ups is overwhelmingly surprising. These people all use the online platforms for their viagra.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not really laziness or embarrassment that is going to be the major driver for this shift in primary health care.  The entire healthcare model is very outdated.  Where we are now is where the music and movie industry was in the early 2000s, with services like Napster and Hulu fighting against RIAA and other industry behemoths that wanted to uphold their outdated model.  The people that are utilizing these new medical services are the early adopters, primary medicine will look a lot different in the future.

Specifically what's driving the changes:

1. People have access to vast amount of information and are more educated regarding health than anytime in the past.  This allows drug and medical companies to market directly to consumers that understand what their products are for.  The old view of medicine is top down model, younger people are more desirous of a consultant model where the patient is the driver of the medical care, not the doctor.
2. Diagnostic errors are common in primary care settings leading to delay in diagnosis and often resulting in the need for many followup appointments before correct treatment is initiated.  Many patients with unexplained issues eventually chose to bypass primary care (gatekeepers) due to frustration and seek specialist care in a self-directed manner.  For some issues even AI is more skilled at diagnosis than general physicians.
3. Chronic disease management is generally performed by data collection and following guidelines and flowcharts.  The standardization of the management of these issues really paves the path for automation as data collection can be done many times at home or other convenient locations (like a 3rd party lab or imaging center).  There is less need for primary general physicians when processes are standardized for common chronic illnesses.  Preventative treatments and testing are also very standardized which could be automated without the need for the educational level of a physician.  We are already moving towards this by employing NP and physician assistants to manage primary care.
4. Primary health care is unnecessarily expensive as compared to other professional services that people utilize and that have better systems for automating standardized tasks (for example, if I own a company, I can hire a payroll service that specializes only in that service at lower cost than a in house accountant performing the same function).
5. Primary care is unnecessarily cumbersome as a process due to lack of automation.  Spending time scheduling appointments, going to appointments, having to wait sometimes weeks to even be able to get an appointment, figuring out post-service billing and insurance issues, having gatekeepers block access to services that the patient desires, etc. are all time consuming and could be fixed with different models.
6. Outcomes are better without physicians for primary care.  \*\*\*This is really the kicker.  In a lot of studies of  the NP model of primary care (with standardization and provider as consultant) shows that outcomes for patients are better for patients who's primary providers are NPs rather than a physicians.

The AMA has been fighting hard against the changes (ie restricting telemedicine, restricting automation, restricting what other types of providers can do under their licenses, etc).  The future might not look exactly like Hims&Hers, but the fact is there that the top-down physician-as-authority model of primary medicine is not going to be the future either."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don‚Äôt buy paper silver, the world is buying physical silver."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"One thing to add is the effect of the stimmy inflation and the inevitable shift into commodities to hedge.  

That combined with the natural increase of industrial usage in solar, EV, high speed charging, etc. Without the increase in mining capacity (years to ramp up) will finally lead to the physical squeeze folks have been trying for for decades.  

Can probably jump in any time this year, basically before the market takes a shit after evictions start and prices rise from inflation.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed. People hate on SLV and prefer PSLV but lots of people smarter than me still use SLV.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Good question. I think I read that if just 4% of all the comex market took delivery the price would sort itself out. So based on my math that's 5 million ounces and at $26 silver that's 131M. That number will only get smaller as the supply continues to drain.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,lol but how much does it weigh
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm already waist deep in $POOP. If you're not in already it's never too late, this stonk only goes up!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Less than one ounce of silver for every person in the world. Every new EV that is produced takes at least an ounce of silver to produce. I'd say that's pretty rare.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Aluminum, copper, and gold. Most wiring is aluminum or copper, and the connection points will be gold plated (corrosion resistance). silver is only about 5% more conductive than copper. And for applications where efficiency isn't very important (residential wiring and many electronics), aluminum can be used, you just need thicker wires for the same current."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes alot is. It started in the 70s to be popular. That was the start of the decline for the industry. It's a slow and steady trend that explains the differences in pricing to other metals.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, however with Reddit and Gamestop, is this the new rallying cry that could actually affect change?

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,LOLOLOL
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I loved their cover of Immigrant Song. We often sing $420.6999999!!!!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The original is one of my favourite songs! Good work, guys!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Well done hahahaha. At first I thought you would replace the ‚Äúoh oh oh‚Äùs with ‚Äúho...ho-ho-ho-hold‚Äù
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,THE GAIN SONG LMFAO
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey GME...You got the stonk I need
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is why it takes a village... of apes!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,**Crazy Gain

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Approved via request and awesomeness.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's a lady who's sure, all the glitters ain't GME, and she's buying the stairway to Heaven."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME YOU AND ME TO THE MOON REALLY SOON WAY UP HIGH IN THE SKY

WHOAH NO

AND THE SHORTS DONT KNOW, THEY REALLY SHOULDNT SHOW, THEIR PUTS WAY DOWN LLOOOOWWWWW

We should collab hmu I made a few of these 

‚ÄúGME the album‚Äù"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, please."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,My thoughts exactly
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's a melvin who's sure, all the retail is done, and he's shorting my stairway to heaven..."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,\*buying the rocket to the moon
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"When he gets there he knows, if the exchange is closed, with a word he can buy more put options."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,AND IIIIiIiiiiIIIIIIIII WILL BUY GMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEOOOOOOAAHHHHH I WILL BUY GM^EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the DD we want and need. Godspeed autist...
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Going to exit calls, and hold shares. Love how these plays turn into ‚Äúsensible long-term holdings.‚Äù Fuck me."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,How can they incorrectly conclude something? Isn‚Äôt this a very binary process? Fuck me this is such a kick to my balls.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone explain in retard
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Let‚Äôs get it on the index. Holy shit. They‚Äôre giving us the keys.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,UWMC is undervalued with or without inclusion.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol, guess i'll hold on a bit longer"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If people were waiting for the stock to be added into the index to go above 12$, then that means the current price does not include the premium of the index.

You should only expect the stock to plummet if the index is already in the current price.

Short-termism is ruining this group."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You inbred cyclops just gave me a sliver of hope. I‚Äôm forever grateful
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I was looking forward to buying shares at 7 on Monday.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,My calls are fucked!!!!!!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can you recontact them and ask if there is a chance this is sorted out before Monday.

Also tell em they should definitely do an announcement about this or Monday will be bloody red for the company and it shareholders, destroying trust for a long time."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"What's interesting is.....investor place has an amazingly positive write up on UWMC and how clever WSB is.    

They also have a write up about how GME is garbage and a waste and how dumb WSB is. 

Make if that what you will.  I call shenanigans with UWMC."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but can‚Äôt Matt not sell any shares for 180 days from ipo?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Uh, I don‚Äôt think they are getting in by going to the principal"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Dream on. Fed has this market by the short hairs. üìâ
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop being pussies and buy more. I'll be adding to my positions every week  until we cross $10. $9c 08/20s
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,how many people have bought a stock on the chance it would be part of an index?  lol y'all are freaking out over nothing
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So you're telling me there is a chance. ü§î I read ya.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao watching all you paperhands change your mind like a guy change out his wife's boyfriend
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Woo MindMed!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So they planning on begging and groveling to get included. Basically no hope here. Expect blood on Monday.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm concerned about the public float only representing about 6% of the total shares, red flag? Edit: I‚Äôm balls deep here, but I want to know the good and bad points about the stock."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, so next step is reach out to Russell dudes and ask them why the fuck didn't they include UWMC. Can you go do that and report back?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,On a unrelated note. MM ED got included in this index for Monday.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmfao
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well there goes any hope for my 4/16 calls....

I am just gonna exit my calls and hold my shares."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Glad I sold my calls on the spike this week.  Maybe I'll sell some 7p this week.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup.  Turn around gonna take a bit longer than thought/hoped.  I‚Äôm too impatient!!!!!!  I won‚Äôt sell at a loss though.  I‚Äôll just constantly bitch about it
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wanted the weekend off, not a rollercoaster ride."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Smooth brain Russell people thought this rocket only had enough room for 4 bananas instead of 50 bananas.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,REEEEEEE
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,UWMC is too cool for them anyways
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I did a 90g TFSA yolo into this play. Now I might be forced to get dividends. This sucks lol."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Right. I already sent a sell order based on the news but now I'm rethinking that. I need to find other things to do with my brain on the weekends.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They act like the largest wholesale mortgage company is going to $.69 cause of not being included in some index lmao I‚Äôm done.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,We in this together. We die or get Rich in the same boat
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I think you still will get the chance for a minute.. people are insanely stupid. They will still sell.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"7 is an excellent price, was thinking 7,50 myself"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wrote to them again, I‚Äôll share when they respond."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"InvestorPlace, Motley Fool, SeekingAlpha,...the list can go on. They're not much different than CNBC, Cramer, Fox, and so forth who are used as tools by Wall Street. Do your own DD. UWMC is a low risk investment, that will see growth, but it's not exploding. GME isn't garbage either. UWMC talk should be in r/investing though. That is not this sub."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What kind of shenanigans?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Going on the index was icing on the cake. I bought because it's undervalued at $9.00.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I like how we refer to an index as a physical guy named russel whose probably waiting in a cubicle ready to respond to emails and phone calls.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Already did, they have not replied yet"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,fair answer would be they saw another stock and liked it
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sold one 7.5 put less than two weeks ago. Was hoping to buy but it didn't work out. 

I might sell two at 7 this coming week though."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Tarded
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"For me it's just that I won't get my money quick. I got in for short term value, but guess I'll be holding these shares for a while, might get a dividend or two."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Same. Gonna set at 7.50 too
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I'll wrote too. What was response time on your last mail?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,">UWMC talk should be in r/investing though

Yep"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"So I shouldn‚Äôt have started my email with: Dear Russell,"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Good shit bro
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"not good enough -
anyway tesla took 2 quarters to get added , this isnt a final no"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Looks like only monthly options right now and even then the premiums are shit right now, I'm going to pass."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Trust me mate when the fed finally wakes up and realize they need to raise interest this company‚Äôs profits will go up dramatically.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,7 already got shook out your range is off.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wrote to them last night, about 12 hrs"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"correct, good luck next time"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish I understood how interest rates and bonds work. Is it good when the 10-yr yield rises? What should I be looking for exactly?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What do you mean by that
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Noooo that‚Äôs when things go down in the market. Interest rates are bad for the market except in banking and mortgage. The UWMC bet is that Jerome will finally realize he can‚Äôt brrrrrr and keep interest rates down and then they become way more profitable because they wholesale mortgages.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"https://www.thebalance.com/treasury-yields-3305741#:~:text=The%20longer%20the%20time%20frame,is%20a%20normal%20yield%20curve."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,But yeah 10 yr bond yields inverse the market
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I meant if it's good for UWMC. When Interest rates goes up, it means that everyone that wants to loan money has to pay higher rates, aka not ideal, but on the other side the one's who do the lending are liking it? Is this somewhat right?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks bro, appreciate it a lot!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes that‚Äôs exactly right. But Bond yields are not the same as interest and that might fuck shit up for us too. It‚Äôs just another thing for people to say ‚Äúthis is a better and more stable investment‚Äù if bond yields go up and all stocks suffer for that even finance ones. It makes the interest rates go up sometimes too cause the banks see an opportunity
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah, thanks for clearing these up. I'll read a bit more about bonds and shit as well, then"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Please report back, for those of us that can't read."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bond price go down, because no one wants em (yet) => interest rates go up to make em more attractive. 

The bonds are sold at auction by the Department of the Treasury. It sets a fixed face value and interest rate. Bonds are basically something no one buys, except big money, because they are super-mega-ultra safe. The return on them is little, but they're safe (something no one here should really give a fuck about, cuz who wants to wait forever for their money). 

A piece on how they affect the economy, from a link someone else linked: ""As Treasury yields rise, so do the interest rates on consumer and business loans with similar lengths. Investors like the safety and fixed returns of bonds. Treasurys are the safest since they are guaranteed by the U.S. government.""

Ôªø""They must return higher yields in order to attract investors. To remain competitive, interest rates on other bonds and loans increase as Treasury yields rise.""

How it affects us (also from the link): ""The most direct manner in which Treasury yields affect you is their impact on fixed-rate mortgages. As yields rise, banks and other lenders realize that they can charge more interest for mortgages of similar duration. The 10-year Treasury yield affects 15-year mortgages, while the 30-year yield impacts 30-year mortgages. Higher interest rates make housing less affordable and depress the housing market. It means you have to buy a smaller, less expensive home. That can slow gross domestic product growth.""

2021-03-20 19:21:23,wallstreetbets,"Still holding, I like the stock. Apologies for RH, will close out account after the squeeze. "
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,My transfer to Fidelity just finished this morning. Feels like a weight off my shoulders
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats in joining the space program at such an early stage fellow ape
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah yes. A pleasant reminder of the 50 shares I sold at $19.19 in December. 

Hello darkness my old friend."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"For the love of God, please tell me you've been making bank selling a covered call every week!?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I transferred from RH to Fidelity in 2 days. To speed things up, don't transfer allow of your securities. Allow $75 to sit in either account"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,21 average?! I fuckin hate you.  Good job n hodl
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why would you risk getting  out AFTER a squeeze? RH literally has control of your money right now and you aren‚Äôt worried about a thing once you suddenly have a shit ton more? 

Get out now dude. It takes a couple days, make the call and transfer to fidelity.

Edit: ok guys by ‚Äúgetting out‚Äù I mean getting out of ROBINHOOD. Not getting out of GME."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Just vomited everywhere after seeing RH
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Ever sold Covered calls?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey Vlad. You see this guy have to apologise for using your app? Thats a bad look my dude.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone really needs to reverse engineer the robinhood app and sell it to a real brokerage.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I was already able to transfer the account to Schwab since the first trading restriction
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well done, fellow ape!  I am green with envy. ;)

&#x200B;

As soon as you can, get yourself out of RH.  Heads up, it took me 12 days to get my portfolio and all of my cash from RH to Schwab.  Apparently,  I had very good timing because mine landed on the day before they made the Ryan Cohen announcement when the price was still in the forties.  DFV made sense to me, too.  ;)  

However, retarded me only bought five shares (2 @$43 and 3 @$48).  Still kicking myself that all I bought was five.  I'm up to 17 shares now but it could be so much more."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Not allowing RH account posts no more? Fuck RH lol
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I got the chase brokerage. It‚Äôs convenient to see all my finances in one page and the account transfers are lightning fast. Does anyone have any experiences with chase we should know about?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What the fuck do you mean after squeeze dude do it now before you regret it fuck RH
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,How you feel about selling CCs way out of the money?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre my new favorite idiot
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I didn't know that you can trade optons on pornhub
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It's ze best stock.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You wish you had bought 1000 shares huh?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"FUCK RH BOI! These fucks steal your money like the greedy, immoral capitalists they are. Get it out of their grubby hands before they screw you over for showing how broken the system is"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,and how do you know RH won't fuck u over when the squeeze happens? just switch to TD or Fidelity asap man
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You wont be able to sell you moron. RH WILL fuck you if a squeeze ever happens again. 

Just transfer now. I still cannot comprehend why people still use those criminals product."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,In all honesty what is your price point to sell?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice position!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,24/48 hours for a transfer to fidelity (done in the week) thats 100 share to lend to others
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Transfer to fidelity, it took me 2 days when I did it."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way ü¶çüíé‚úã
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Truly heroic
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Transfer to Fidelity already. It's like you get the free upward stock pressure that you should have had from RH... now at $200!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Awesome average cost. True üíéüôåü¶ç
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If robinhood limited buying during the spike up, what makes you think theyre gonna let you sell once the squeeze hits? Transfer to Fidelity, it took only 2 days for me"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Apology accept, congrats"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"When the squeeze happens, they‚Äôll pause trading again, didn‚Äôt you learn anything? Leave Robinhood!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Only thing I‚Äôm more looking forward to than the squeeze squozing is closing my MF Robin-steal account.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,">**will close out account after the squeeze**

ape, the squeeze wouldn't squoze when you use RH"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"hey guy i would transfer your shares... you can do a partial transfer to another brokerage so that way you have some shares available to trade in case the squeeze squozes. 

RH is not going to let you SELL at the top of the squeeze!!! i am almost certain they will stop trading again!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,#would you still like the stock if your average price was $300+?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I've been seeing this a lot about transferring after the bug squeeze from RH to someone else. Some have already last week or the week before but people keep saying it. Just transferring now because the squeeze ain't happening for awhile. Ryan Cohen said he sees the stock going up $1k by end of year (what I read from another post)
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You retard, get off RH NOW!!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,STOP POSTING YOUR POSITIONS!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like this account is never going to get closed.  There will always be ‚Äúanother squeeze‚Äù here.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,i have 3 accounts and im scared to transfer from RH at the moment...  because banana
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,MAIN$ $REAM MEDIA SAID IT WAS OVER THO CUZ THEY DIDN'T PICK $IT UP ON $HERE
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Just transfer your shares. Pay $75 or ask new broker for reimbursement. Done. GTF off Robinhood
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Holding on RH is understandable and I dont blame you for it. What I am sick of seeing is people saying that but still buying new things on robinhood.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Vlad, when asked what his message is to WSB, said ‚Äúwe plan to continue serving you and providing the best service.‚Äù

Best service my ass. Get $RKT, Vlad"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Transfer as soon as you can, it doesn't take long enough for you to miss the squeeze"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"My transfer will complete next week :) RH does not care about their customers , they are shady AF."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Transfer! Mine went in late Wednesday and showed up in my Fidelity account this morning. The peace of mind alone will be worth it. Instant hold and it guarantees that RH won‚Äôt screw you out of your seat on the rocket üöÄüöÄüöÄ
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I will have to liquidate everything and cash out. The names on robinhood vs fidelity don't match. I got married and couldn't get in contact with customer service on rh to do a name change so my transfer didn't happen to fidelity.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can start slowly transferring shares to fidelity, today I did 5... Plan on doing 5 at a time..."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Hold while ur wife‚Äôs boyfriend holds ur balls
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I would transfer the shares not the account. But I eat crayons. I would be afraid that Robin hood would put a sell cap on my stocks and force users to either sell at a loss. Oh that is illegal? You mean like that other thing they did?? And yet they did it anyway... A squeeze isn't coming soon simply because everyone is expecting a squeeze soon and they keep buying options which stops the squeeze. This might take months or maybe years at this point. Do whatever you want. I'm just going to hold forever.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,if i transfer do they charge my debit card or funds in RH??
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean Schwab froze my account because they couldn't verify my address without notifying me so...
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Why apologies to RH? RH is fucking shit. I switched to FD. FD even reimbursed whatever RH charged me.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Did a partial transfer last month. Lost the remaining $400 on Nokia options because I'm retarded. Transferring $8 to my bank before I close my account and delete forever.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,$21 average?!? How did you never average up to at least $100?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Burn robinhood to the ground!!! Close your account
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Just do it now.  Or at least half of your shares how can you continue to use such a shit broker.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's all about the hold. Hedgehogs are kicking their problem down the road. Holding, purchasing and time decay is their worst enemy."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Obligatory fuck Robbinghood
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Congrats and fuck you, nice avg cost"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Where do you buy GME?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Laughing cause you think they're going to give you money
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,How long might it take to transfer to Webull?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So never closing the account got it.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You don't need to apologize because you're a retard.

On every other sub, yes. But here? No."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Can someone help me transfer my shares? I don‚Äôt even know what to do
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,god damn you got in at just the right time. Well played.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,won't get to the squeeze with ya'll on rh.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't think the squeeze is happening as soon as people think.  The HF as playing the T+21 day game on everything they're doing.  This has turned into a 2 month to 1 year war at least.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You trust them to let you sell if/when that happens?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel like 700-1000 is a nice price for a few shares to throw at them..... give them that COMEBACK.... thirsty for more... then I price GME in line with AMAZON at about 3000$ a share.... let the hedgies pay 5000$ maybe....
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You don't need to apologize for using robinhood.  But you've now held through two unprecedented movements in price.  The second lower than the first. You're waiting for a third?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Upvoted for closing RH. This is the way.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same - 2 days to transfer completed this morning.

GTFO of RH - they will fail you when you need it most"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Put in transfer for 80% of GME position to fidelity a couple days ago, should have done it long time ago lol."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Mine too.  $75 well spent.  Gonna transfer the rest (dividend plays only) to Webull and get the free stock and transfer reimbursement.  The free stocks will help cover that Fidelity fee.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Mine as well
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"As someone who didn't have the nerve to pull the trigger, I am seriously relieved for you. 

The only conclusion I reached was that if I get screwed one way or another, I'd rather be able to blame Vlad than myself. Wish those of us who didn't have the balls luck, I can't fucking wait to get off RH without need for a 7 day stroke."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,And they even send you love letters
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Doesnt fidelity ALSO use PfOF to process your orders too?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Same completed this morning but my shared show they are margin
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Same! Took less than 2 days. Im so happy.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,DFV made sense to me - this was an option that I exercised.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That is the case!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm trying to learn about this but need guidance. Let‚Äôs say I want to sell calls of AAPL, currently at $120, what would I set the call at?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the absolute way!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,How can an ordinary create a call and sell it?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I just set it to transfer my gme shares but left my calls on RH. Does that mean they will have the $75 to take?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have a Fidelity account as well (with a couple hundred more shares there), but they wouldn't give me options trading privileges (irritating considering I'm an accredited investor) and RH did.  I've put in the request again and am waiting for a response. My plan is to move them over once approved."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you transfer shares? I'm down on GME in robinhood. It's my only stock on there. I'd like to move it to Fidelity without having to sell and buy more
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What do you mean?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I just did the transfer to Fidelity finally. It won't complete until 29th it says though. But I'm not fucking selling so I guess that doesn't matter too much. What happens with partial shares?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Emetophiles: ""That's hot!"""
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,But that cost average gave you a boner at the same time
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I do!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They are gold
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Super interesting! I see it constantly being emailed to me, or notifying me while using the mobile banking app that they offer security trading but idk if day trades are allowed or not etc. is the platform user friendly?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I like making easy money - my CC OTM strike price is what I would be happy to get exercised at.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Happy cake day!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks!  üòÇ
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a few hundred more in Fidelity.  This was my very first option and I exercised it. Now waiting for Fidelity to approve me for options trading to close the RH account.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What a nice thing to say to her.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,My goal is to have over $100k in profit across all my shares.  My other cost basis (taxable)  is $21.05 and \~$114 in the Roth account.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"yes, because i like it"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I would.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"These are some rookie numbers bro.. I feel bad for anyone thinking MAYBE 5k would be what they are going to pay. 10x that, 100x that, now you‚Äôre thinking with crayons."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think the third will come. This isn‚Äôt a sprint, it‚Äôs a marathon."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Learned that the hard way... Have 5 $145c 4/23 NKE calls, did exactly what I thought would do, spike on Thursday. Could not get them sold off. Friend on TD had same calls, his sale went thru at a higher ask than I was shooting for. He was also seeing a much tighter bid/ask than I was. Couldn‚Äôt off load them before 4pm.. and watched NKE tank in AH... TD account created and transfer initiated by 5:30 pm Thursday."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,How long did it take for funds to appear in fidelity? I started my transfer on 3/17
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"My transfer says won't complete til 29th

I am hopeful"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you have to sell everything or can you just transfer?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I tried to move them in February and they denied it. Called Fidelity and they told me RH needed more documentation. What docs? IDK. RH never contacted me and my ACAT sat for 2 weeks and then eventually cancelled it. I think the bad press they got made them wake tf up.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Call Fidelity and have them reimburse you. They'll do it.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Ive been hearing if you call them they will cancel your transfer fee.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,How does RH charge you for the $75?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for your service!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Could you explain a bit more about that please ?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It depends on how bullish/bearish you are on the stock. Definitely watch some youtube videos on covered calls
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good question. I'm didn't have any options in RH however, I left (1) share of PLTR and aprox. $150 in my brokerage account. RH charged my Fidelity account the bogus $75 ACAT fee. Sounds like they would rather charge my Fidelity the $75 fee instead of pulling it from my RH brokerage account."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"  Good luck. I know RH uses PFOF to sell your options data to Shitadel for HFTs. It makes sense why they'd easily allow users to trade options. They simply make money on it. Someone is going to say ""fIdElitY dOeS iT tOo""
  You may have issues transferring if your RH is on margin and your Fidelity is on cash."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. A good guide will probably be on google. ‚ÄúHow to transfer my robinhood shares to fidelity‚Äù
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I transferred to fidelity as a partial account transfer, just my GME shares to make sure it was quick in case something happened. Did it Wednesday afternoon, Friday it was ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù, this morning it was completely on Fidelity. Super easy step by step I can find you if need be."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean transfer your shares to a different broker. Get them out of RH.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Partial shares don‚Äôt really exist. They are provided by brokers for convenience, and will probably be liquidated into funds and also transferred to fidelity."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Hell ya!!  Weekly? Or further out?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes day trades are allowed as much as any other retail investor is allowed. It‚Äôs is pretty user friendly, has more of a utilitarian vibe compared to robinhood‚Äôs flashy hip vibe. This retard got his 90 restrict the other day and the support group was very fast and friendly while helping explain how dumb I am."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Good man.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Best of luck in your strategy. I don‚Äôt follow the stock but I don‚Äôt see it squeezing in the next month so I think you‚Äôd be better off initiating the transfer. But you do you and again best of luck.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I... hope... you...right.... ü¶ßü¶ßüíéüöÄ either way tendies.... ü§òüèº
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Even if you think thats true, by selling high you could buy more when it drops.  By riding it down you risk never seeing those gains again.

But whatever, you do you."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Screw me once, shame on you.

Screw me twice, shame... on...  ?

What Im saying is you cant screw me again! F You RH!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just transferred shares of GME (not full account) in 3/17, and this morning my shares are showing out of RH and into Fidelity.  They are currently listed as margin but that clears to cash after a couple days"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I started mine on 3/17 as well and it was completed today.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Mine on the 18th in AH said by the 24th and cleared this morning
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I started my ACAT last Wednesday, they were settled in Fidelity by Friday Morning before market open."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only if you've transferred over $25,000 in assets was the latest I've heard."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôll give it a try
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They charged my Fidelity account even though I had $150 in my RH brokerage account just in case
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Google covered calls. 

An option contract on GME (and most stocks) is a lot of 100 shares. If you‚Äôre holding 100+ shares of any stock you can sell a covered call. It‚Äôs basically the other end of when you Buy a call. 

When you‚Äôre selling a covered call, you‚Äôre selling a contract that obligates your to sell all 100 shares of that contract for whatever price you set it to when you originally sell the contract. If the expiration date arrives (or the buyer decides to exercise) and your set price is ‚Äúin the money‚Äù (under current strike price) then it will require you to complete the contract by selling your shares at the set price. 

You make money in GME doing this by selling covered calls every week that expire that week, against the shares you own, and you sell them for a price you hope it doesn‚Äôt make it to so it expires ‚Äúout of the money‚Äù. If this happens you get to pocket the contract sale price AND keep your shares. Do this every week and it‚Äôs constant flow of profits even when the stock doesn‚Äôt go anywhere. And with GME options volatility, they are selling for outrageous prices so people are making a killing doing this."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"So I understand it quite a bit more, but I guess I‚Äôm still unsure how you turn this into serious cash. People say to sell calls for stocks that seem to keep going up like AAPL, but then I‚Äôm almost betting against myself. AAPL is at $120 right now. It could easily be $127 within the week so I‚Äôd want to sell my call higher than that‚Ä¶ but at $128 it‚Äôs only 22¬¢ per contract, so I‚Äôm looking at making $22 this week assuming it doesn‚Äôt hit $128? That‚Äôs some pretty weak sauce, no? The comment above about making 20grand a month‚Ä¶ is that just suggesting that I‚Äôve got 10,000 shares so i sell 100 contracts and have to make $50 per contract per week? But that‚Äôs suggesting I continually bet that AAPL won‚Äôt hit $125? I mean I might be able to run that for like two weeks but pretty soon it‚Äôs gonna hit $125 and then my shares are gone. I mean I guess I can then rebuy my shares‚Ä¶ I guess I‚Äôm still missing how to make consistent money with this.

And why does it have the ability to sell calls below current market price? Wouldn‚Äôt someone just buy that as soon as the market opens and then I instantly sell my stocks for less than their worth?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Alright I‚Äôm gonna throw $75 into my recently opened fidelity account now just to make sure. Thanks
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cool, thanks."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I understand, but feels like fear-mongering. Do you actually know that RH ""has control of your money"" or are you just saying that to scare people into switching brokers?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Weekly/biweekly, depending on how juicy the premium is at that time."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL nice, I‚Äôm assuming the funds just hadn‚Äôt ‚Äúsettled‚Äù before the transaction was completed? I‚Äôm John Stuart Fucki-Mill when it comes to the UI so that‚Äôs a positive! I‚Äôm checking it out, thanks fellow ape!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd consider it but you're in the way and you seem pretty thirsty.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Shutup bich Boi you think you‚Äôre smarter than DFV or something?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They continue to transfer on the weekends?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,mine got rejected due to an unsettled fractional share. I'm really hoping I'll be good to transfer monday
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm hoping for eod Wednesday
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks. I suppose I should add cash in my Fidelity account?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok so you sell a call with a strike price of like 600-800 every week and as long as it doesn‚Äôt reach that price you always get the premiums ?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right, so selling covered calls on Apple is probably not a great idea.

But now, check out Gamestop. You could sell a $600 call expiring next week and make a few hundred dollars. And the thing too is that if GME does end up going above $600, you'd still get paid $60k upon exercise since they're buying the shares from you at $600 per share. So even if the call does get exercised, you'd still come out with a huge profit.

ETA: Regarding your question about calls below the current market price - keep in mind you are still paying a premium for the call. For example, you can buy a GME call expiring next week with a strike price of $195. Given the current stock price is $199, you're already ""in the money"" by $4. However, you have to pay $3,520 in order to get that option right now (this is called the option premium). So, if you bought the option now and exercised right away, you'd make $400 (buy 100 shares at $195 and sell at $199) but since you spent $3,520 for the option you ended up losing a little over $3k. You would need the price to get to around $230 to break even on the call."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Aapl not what u wanna sell CCs for. much better for high iv positions like gme
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Which is why selling covered calls on GME is a good idea. The IV is so high the options are really expensive so if you are the one selling them the premium is a lot.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sounds good! Good luck! You can look into your Fidelity for the ""Transfer Tracker"" to see the status."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Keep in mind it will lock all the shares you have until the transfer is complete so if you go for it you may as well do the full amount.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay, I‚Äôm not trying to be asshole-like or anything, but where have you been? RH makes money continuously off of whatever we put in, and actively sells our trades to a bigger organization that pockets the difference on our investments.

This isn‚Äôt even touching the surface on the shenanigans they pulled when preventing buy trades amongst other things. 

Even if the latter wasn‚Äôt true - RH is a company that shouldn‚Äôt be supported in any regard after what they did. Just don‚Äôt utilize them as a company.

Edit: once again I don‚Äôt want this to sound hostile, I‚Äôm open to discussion."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes Robinhood has control of your money.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Fur sure didn‚Äôt settle. I thought cuz I saw the money there that it was available. It is just only 2ice in a rolling 365 days...  fortunately I can still trade on limits but my luck I set my limit @180 Friday and it bottomed out at 182.66 so I had to reset it to 190
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"DFV, who has extraordinary incentive not to create the appearance of dumping bags on suckers like you.

Think for yourself, QAnon."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idk honestly. It says it was completed yesterday, but my shares were still in RH well after market close. Today everything is settled."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,why would you hope for Wednesday? Earnings for GME is on Tuesday which means Implied Volatility should go down a lot the next day. Not good for any options you're holding.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Simple answer is Yes, BUT, There‚Äôs always the possibility the call buyer decides to exercise the contract before expiration. If that happens, it doesn‚Äôt matter what the current strike is, they get to buy your shares at the set contract price.

Edit: that should never happen unless the mid week strike price puts your contract ITM (in the money) by like Tuesday and the buyer feels good about the rest of the week, they could exercise early. After that point there is no more contract and your shares are gone so it doesn‚Äôt matter what the end of the week brings."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,See edit
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes the transfer was submitted to RH to review at this point. Hopefully they don‚Äôt take forever lol
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Holding only shares at this point
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So basically this call stuff is good in the meantime but when the thing moons u risk losing your shares at not a moon price essentially dicking yourself
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Technically how do you hand out the share you own to close the contract when they exercice ?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What's annoying is they are losing money by exercising. Only time you want to exercise is on expiration day when there's no theta left. Exercising early is someone that doesn't know what they are doing from everything I've read.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"okay good, smart ape, lambo soon"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your broker does it for you. When you sell a covered call, your 100 shares (or 500 shares for 5 calls) are locked to those contracts. You get assigned to a buyer and can‚Äôt change it.

I‚Äôm no pro FYI"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Then you take the money buy 100 shares again and keep the profit
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If your strike was 600 you‚Äôd get paid out huge on exercise anyways, that would be a win in my book."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok and I guess if you don‚Äôt own the stock the broker would require you to have a margin to back up the potential unlimited loss potential
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This. I sold a $780 covered call for $7500 in instant cash ..

Now I can use that to buy more shares .. which I can use to buy more covered calls .. ad infinitum.

I'll squeeze this sucker myself if you apes can't f*in figure it out."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This would be selling a ‚Äúnaked call‚Äù or ‚Äúuncovered call‚Äù. You actually need approval from your broker to get this level of options trading.

I don‚Äôt even know what it would take to get that. I would imagine you are required to hold a large amount of equity in your account for this to get approved. 

Specifically this would be Level 4/5"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"As an add on to the other comment, I would not recommend this."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,LOL this is where all the 800c action is coming from isn‚Äôt it.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This... this is the way.
2021-03-20 18:14:19,wallstreetbets,"AMC Voting Megathread for Saturday, March 20th, 2021 Congratulations, you were asked your opinion on something for the first time in your life.

Instead of making a new thread, please post your questions here. (E.g. ""Which crayon do I fill the form with?"")"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm actually retarded
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"We should have threads like this more often, I'd love to see how people here vote when it comes to these decisions for different companies"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets," Interesting vote, but typical of companies right now

1 - They want authority to issue by 500,000,000 shares to a total of 1,024,173,073 shares of  Class¬†A Common Stock.  I bet it is stock options on the executives who want to take profit for doing very little or / combination of Hedge Funds trying to drive the price back.  Voted No with my shares

  
2 - Election of the Board of Directors.  Voted no with my shares.

3 - Approve the accounting Firm to audit their books.  Voted yes with my shares.  

4 - A non-binding advisory vote to approve the compensation of named executive officers.  Voted no with my shares, the Apes shaved the day, not the Executives.  

5 - Approval of amendment to the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (EIP) to  increase the total number of shares subject to the EIP to  35,000,000¬†shares of Class¬†A Common Stock, revise the share  replenishment provision and eliminate the mandatory expiration of  the EIP.  Other words, they are rewarding themselves for the hard work of Apes.  Voted no with my share

I don't see us winning but maybe it will get their attention."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think voting against any executive or ceo getting raises here is good, get their books audited too, if there was a way to allow them to dilute while ensuring the above happened it‚Äôd be a worthy sacrifice. Problem is if u vote yes to the full List your likely to get stuck giving raises AND diluting turning it from a smart play to a cash grab on their part."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Can i refund my stocks if i still have the receipt?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I have shares and never got an email :(
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone explain wtf is going on? You go away from WSB from two days and suddenly you retard are all voting akin to executives.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,FUCK! Got the email. The future of AMC is between my hands now. 10 Shares holder. Just voted.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Good thing this is a multiple choice test and not a fill in the blank one.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,No matter what everyone else is saying. I‚Äôm very bullish for $AMC and $GME. Never been this bullish in my life ever. To the moon üöÄüöÄüöÄ
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I am throwing my name in the nomination as the next president of AMC my policies involve more tendies and more whatever AMC does I have yet to look at the company please do vote for me to make AMC great again
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Based on my calculations... it‚Äôs either gonna go up..... or it‚Äôs gonna go down. üíé
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I didn‚Äôt get a voting email and I‚Äôve owned amc since December

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"1.) no
2.) yes
3.) yes
4.) yes
5.) yes
6.) no

We don‚Äôt want share dilution because most of us are in it for a short term squeeze play. The company itself will be earning enough money due to reopening their theaters. Meanwhile apes are just buying and holding stocks fighting against those hedgies. Make sure to fill in with green crayons.
No financial advise. ü¶ç"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got 9 shares of AMC, someone wanna translate into crayon for me?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,How many movies can you watch with 1 share of AMC?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Alright a few things. If you read my comments you know I‚Äôm super critical of circlejerking on this sub and others so just trying to be objective because there‚Äôs so much fluff and nonsense here. 

1. Proposed share issuance. 

- yes it‚Äôs only an option for them to issue more shares. But they‚Äôll make use of it, make no mistake. So I voted no. Share dilution = dilution of your interest

- if you plan to hold AMC for years you may want to vote yes. It may be the only path for AMC to raise capital to cover any shortfalls in cash this year

- technically speaking if they issue more shares they will raise more cash. More cash on their balance sheet = less debt or more assets, ie higher valuation. But the company will just continue to bleed money if their revenue doesn‚Äôt go up

- all in all, I was in AMC for a short while and want to get my profits. So, even with all of the pros in mind I voted no on new share issuance. 

2. Appointment of PWC as the auditor
- saw so many people say they voted no to everything. DONT BE STUPID. 
- appointment of an audit firm is routine. PWC is one of the biggest and most respected auditors in the world. They need an auditor to sign off on the financials for us to know the fundamentals
- I obviously voted yes. It‚Äôs a no brainer 

3. Change in stock comp scheme
- my personal vote was no because as others noted the company got through last year because of investors support, not some genius level work from the C suite 

Just my 2 cents. Happy to discuss if you disagree."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,When will shareholders know the results of the vote?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This has been known about and posted about on wsb for over a week.  Why are people surprised?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Are Robinhood users getting their notifications to vote? I just spoke with someone that uses RH and said they didn't get the email to vote. If RH isn't giving people their votes that is not right.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Having a conversation about AMC on WSB is like being on a date with a prick who just wants to get you in the backseat so he can fuck your stock and make you have his GME baby.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Been through this before and it really doesn't matter how we vote, yes/no management,ceo,ceso,cfos, they will all still pass whatever they want for there company. Yes I voted no. But our votes are going to get thrown out as the final say will be on them. Either way how ever this goes, we ride with it or they will suffer our expertise in eating crayons and fakin up your company's share holders to either rise to the sky or drop it like some second rate hoe. 
 Don't get me wrong, we like the stock, but you screw over your share holders and we will tea bag your company share price right to bankruptcy quickly. Why you ask, cause we are fakin tard strong."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm actually soooooooo happy to see this post lol. Because I got this email, and had no idea what to vote. 

Usually when I get this email for other companies, I vote against everything, because whatever they are doing right now, likely isn't good and needs something/ someone new Lol."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know some of y‚Äôall are freaking out but from what I‚Äôve heard, this is a management head fake.

More shares usually means dilution and decrease in price of stock but in this case, some make a case that management knows that most shareholders will unanimously decide against it.

Regardless, the true intention of this vote is to force a RECOUNT.  If there is a recount, HF will force a cover or have DTCC force a report.

Sounds like a positive to me.  

HODL!!! Apes strong together!

This is the Way...

*not financial advice, just a financial panther"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"By the way, directly from your friends at AMC, for those incorrectly freaking out about RH -


Beneficial owners are stockholders who hold their shares through a brokerage account, bank or other record holder. You also may have heard the term ""held in street name"" when describing stock ownership. When you buy securities through a brokerage firm, most firms will automatically put your securities into ""street name."" This means your brokerage firm will hold your securities in its name or another nominee and not in your name, but your brokerage firm will keep records showing you as the real or ""beneficial owner."" Under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE""), member stockbrokers who hold shares of Common Stock in their name for customers are required to obtain directions from their customers on how to vote the shares. NYSE rules permit brokers to vote shares on certain proposals when they have not received any directions. The Staff of the NYSE, prior to the Annual Meeting, informs brokers of those proposals on which they are entitled to vote the undirected shares

(Robinhood kind of sucks but no, they don‚Äôt trade CFDS, and no, holding in street name isn‚Äôt fraudulent, and no, switching to another broker won‚Äôt change that)"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The Vote Was Known For Weeks

We all knew about this vote, the ones hyping it are shills and hedgies. Your vote honestly doesnt matter for the squeeze and dont let anyone manipulate you into thinking otherwise.

Prior to May 4th, AMC stocks need to all be located and bought. Naked shorts need to be bought and I have a feeling we have naked fuckin shorts from all the shenanigans Friday. 

The whole 500,000,000 stock vote is because AMC CEOs know there will be a squeeze and want to be a part of it. They want in on the tendies, I dont care how you vote on May 4th because in my opinion the squeeze will lead up to that day anyways. 

After all is said and done, AMC is a bigger company then all the cinemas, they play Disney while Cinemark protests it and yet right now they arent 20$. 

We are literally being spammed by hedgies and shills, if you want to sell then sell. This is OLD news and part of the reason why many believe a squeeze is happening."

I don't necessarily see this as a bad thing, If the CEO and the board sees something that makes financial sense for the long term health of the company shouldn't we allow them to use these tools if they deem it necessary? I am all for making money but we bought into AMC because we believe in them, we want them to stay alive not just a short term take our $ and bounce.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Folks need to understand.

AMC needs dilution to survive. I mean for goodness sakes people, they laid it out in the 10k in December.

They basically said they need massive cash to stay alive, and they were burning 350m a quarter. They received a bail out of 500m due to dilution ontop of taking out another 500m in lines of credit plus selling stock at the height for 308m.

Add it all up, they have 880m in cash as of January 25th and access to 500m in credit 


They explicitly said three things needed to happen to survive this year

1) attendance returning to 80-90%

2) vaccination roll out success in Europe (25% of revenues come from international markets!)

3) studios stop going straight to streaming services. 



I honestly don't think 2/3 of these are going to happen on 2021. Ontop of burning 350m in cash a quarter! Do the math people, the dilution is coming or bankruptcy is coming.

Buy out isn't even an option because the debt ratio is over 120%! On paper amc is worth 8b give or take, a majority of it is in real estate assets, they owe about 12b in liabilities. 

No company would ever buy them for a premium let alone anything for shareholders. Look what Citibank and wells Fargo did to wachiva in 2008 when they bought them out.


I have no position nor options on amc or related peers, Im just tired of the cult mentality here"

DILUTION! It's the solution to pollution!

Jk, but seriously Dilutions are bad in the SHORT term. It basically means the company it taking your money and actually going to use it to GROW the company, GME and AMC are not for short term gains anymore, these are Long term GROWTH stocks now. In the long term AMC might actually take off (Have you imbeciles ever seen a rocket actually take off it goes up then curves, up up up) So slowly but steadily it will rise. Stop being stuck on today and think about tomorrow, seriously, this is great news for Holders, bad news for paper hands."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Nothing paper about leaving a company throwing you under the bus. Gme bought it shares back and made the float go from 100 million to 50 million. Amc is doing the opposite they grew there float to over 400 million and want to double it. Amc is grimes as fuck

Voting yes might save the company should they get shorted to shit again in the far future and need more shares to save the company. We will still get our tendies and amc will have a get out of jail free card for the future. If I‚Äôm wrong please correct me but this is what I‚Äôve gathered so far."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damned if they do, damned if they don't.

You're damned if they dilute shares, cuz your price is gonna tank, and probably not recover to where it's now for years, if ever. Maybe I'm

Damned if they don't, because they NEED the money to stay alive, and if they don't get it, your share price will definitely tank.

I mean, people might flock to buy AMC at its lower price with the dilution, buuuut I highly doubt enough will. If people are going to get in on a memstock, they're gonna go for the one that is doing WAY better...Maybe I'm wrong, just just my gut on it though, given it's history at this point. What, it was at like 6-7 bucks for how long until just about a week ago, and people weren't too interested then to pile in then, ya?

oof. Sorry guys :(

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"One thing I noticed:

>Under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (‚Äò‚ÄòNYSE‚Äô‚Äô), member stockbrokers who
hold shares of Common Stock in their name for customers are required to obtain directions from their customers on how to vote the shares. NYSE rules permit brokers to vote shares on certain proposals when they have not received any directions.
>
>Under rules of the NYSE, brokers may not vote on ‚Äò‚Äònon-routine‚Äô‚Äô proposals unless they have received voting instructions from the beneficial owner, and to the extent that they have not received voting instructions, brokers report such number of shares as ‚Äò‚Äònon-votes.‚Äô‚Äô Your bank, broker or other nominee may vote your shares in its discretion on ‚Äò‚Äòroutine‚Äô‚Äô matters. Proposals 2, 4, 5 and 6 are considered ‚Äò‚Äònon-routine,‚Äô‚Äô which means that brokerage firms may not vote in their discretion regarding these items on behalf of beneficial owners who have not furnished voting instructions. Proposals 1 and
3, however, are considered ‚Äò‚Äòroutine‚Äô‚Äô items, which means that brokerage firms may vote in their discretion on behalf of beneficial owners who have not furnished voting instructions.

If I'm reading this right (and I fully admit that my brain has a glossy sheen) then if you don't respond your broker can basically vote for you on Proposals 1 and 3 -- that is, on authorizing the potential sale of more shares and on retaining the same public accounting firm. So if you care about these two, you should definitely submit how you want them to vote on your behalf.

Please correct if I'm wrong!

4) The executive compensation will often be tied to share prices, giving incentive to push those values up.

5) if I understand it‚Ä¶ the 2013 EIP for AMC will ensure 35 million shares held available to award the execs as bonuses essentially, further incentivizing increasing stock prices‚Ä¶

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Although I eat crayons, I would sell AMC and buy GME. My AMC stonks are now all gone (I sold them)...and it bought me a few more GME during Friday's fire sale! I don't like them diluting the AMC stonks.

THIS is the way."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell amc
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I smell FUD
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Bye
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Get out while u can imo
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC GME BRRRR
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,How do I vote? I haven‚Äôt received any emails from my broker Trading212
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Vote for share dilution?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you guys get crayons?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Here‚Äôs a hug! How to vote?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I sold all my GME and bought AMC.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm calling it FUD at this point. Everybody panicking that their share value will drop and add to paper hand pile! Stop freaking out! The man is on our side for sure!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have puts, what should I vote for?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What's going on with gme bag holder with 14 shares @ 299 here
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow, the ""no"" shills are out in full force. Vote yes to avoid the dilution of the share pool."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"What is the porpuse of this thread? You trying to manupilate your own ape people? So if you buy GME you are a good ape if you buy AMC  you are bad ape? Keep it up try more and harder  you cant avoid the Squeeze.For all the AMC holders it comes let them try cheap methods they harder they try,  the louder the noise we make my brother monkeys. $AMC2008.01"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Its i.e. not e.g.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Can I borrow Apes crayon I ate mine.  Wait I found one... no that is my damn tail?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Voted!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They are really shitty theaters to be honest.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This will attract a lot of attention to AMC regardless of the outcome. Buying more AMC with my GME profits I‚Äôll make on Monday after I sell!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it a share split or new shares?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What is GUH?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Woah an AMC thread on WSB I wonder how long it will take for mods to remove the post.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are you retards still memestonking?  I assumed you would have moved on to a tik tok challenge or some Facebook activism by now.

This is an unprecedented level of concentration from the internet hive mind.  LOL!  How retarded."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Huh? Ape confusion
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So you‚Äôre saying you‚Äôre smarter than us?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I was no down the board. The fact that the dilution was their first agenda shows the intention moving forward.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,">2 - Election of the Board of Directors. Voted no with my shares.

How? I can only vote for or abstain."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would AMC cater to HF that supposedly want AMC price to go down? This doesnt have shit to do with HF you wacky conspiracy theorists. The company loves the price being up because selling stock nets them more cash. This is purely because they know they need a whole lot more cash to stay alive(and exec bonuses of course)
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Theyve already show they have no shame in grabbing cash. Giving themselves massive bonuses while begging for government help. Definitely get what you ask for on this one i think
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"They're a publicly traded company, so the books are already audited. This is likely just switching CPA firms. I've dealt with Ernst and Young, they're generally competent."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Within 30 days if you come in store.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Same
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have you bought it with margin account,     
Buying with margin doesn't give voting privileged"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I got a few hundred. Basically on the board now.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I've got 11 but missed the boat on getting the email..
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep. Even apes can pass a multiple choice test sometimes.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve held it for 3 weeks and I got an email
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"check if your account is on margin. Last time I checked, people on margin = no voting rights."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They‚Äôre holding a shareholders vote
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah bel come to tru democracy comrade
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way with extra butter. üçøüßàüëãüßàüçø
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds like a great moment in hook up history.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Real heros don't wear capes.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The only way to break the wall of resistance is to buy market price. We have to creat enough volume to blast through resistance and all the sell orders.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,FUCK YEAH ! I VOTE HANDIES AND BLOWIES FOR FUTURE SONS OF OUR NATION!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,How did you cast your vote?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the right answer for most people here. 

Dilution is explicitly stated as an outcome from when and if the proposed additional shares are issued. From the proxy document section regarding Proposal 1:

""Adoption of the Certificate of Amendment will have no immediate dilutive effect on the proportionate voting power or other rights of the Company‚Äôs existing stockholders. However, any future issuance of additional authorized shares of our Common Stock, at the future direction of the Board (and generally without the requirement of stockholder approval, unless specifically required by applicable law or NYSE regulation) may, among other things, dilute the earnings per share of Common Stock and the equity and voting rights of those holding Common Stock at the time such additional shares are issued."""
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I voted no on #1. They're threatening share dilution which will lower the price per share.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"On balance if you vote no to PwC they will be forced to find a new auditor, and a different auditor may find things or have different interpretations. That could be a good (or horrible) thing."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Its been known for weeks lol. By May 4 naked shorts need to be all bought back aswell.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think margin accounts have the right to vote, because your shares have been loaned out to shorts.  All robinhood accounts are margin accounts, even if you aren't approved for 'margin'.  The instant deposit makes it a margin account."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn, I felt the second rate hoe comment"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The board and c-suite don't have that much say. It comes down to institutional ownership and public ownership.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit...now more than anything in the world, I want to see a retarded memestonk shareholder derivative suit.

That would be **awesome**!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It does matter what the masses vote for. There are elections all over the world where there isn't any real choice but that doesn't mean the voting is pointless. I won't get into the matter as it's much too cumbersome to explain through text but there are a lot of good videos on the subject. Metrics like how many people voted are incredibly important in gaguing which issues people care about. 

Basically, if amc passes something against the will of a ton of their shareholders then guess what, the shareholders will likely not be around much longer."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You simultaneously invest in a company and believe everything they‚Äôre doing needs to change.  Sir, YOU belong here."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do you have an idea now? Serious question.
How do you know people here dont have an interest in AMC shareprice dropping and are giving bad advise on purpose?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,i‚Äôm too smooth to understand. can anyone corroborate this assumption?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Cant they sell them directly to the shorts to cover?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,There are no sides.  We are all primates. I‚Äôm holding both.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"same voted 'no' to the dilution

but it'll  be irrelevant short term, they aren't voting until mid-May, by which time the good stuff will already have happened, considering selling that much stock doesn't happen overnight too"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I voted no
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Me too and yes
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The opposite lmao
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"AMC needs cash badly.  They are creating cheap shares for both the public and employees.  They probably have about 3-5 months worth of cash right now to pay their bills.  The proposal is to inject cash to stay afloat past those months when the pandemic is supposed to be over.  Sure it'll drop the shares by a lot and assure no rocket to the moon, but it'll at least keep the company from going bankrupt, shares worthless, and allow for a very slow gain for the shareholders once the pandemic is over.  AMC is hoping to make the long holders happy at the loss of the short holders.  Hedgies are see blood and expect them to short the hell out of AMC in the coming weeks.  It ain't going to be pretty no matter how the votes go."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I haven‚Äôt received an email from Freetrade either
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,TD Ameritrade does
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Replying because same!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,To be fair most of the pay was in stock shares
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol they‚Äôre going to dilute it further because they know their investors are retarded. You could all vote no but they know you guys can‚Äôt count so they‚Äôll do it anyways
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"When did they announce they were gonna vote on this? 

If it passes I see AMC going to $.50


Edit: they already have too many fucking shares outstanding. Fuck this

Edited again: said I'd bail out Monday out of anger, not selling yet. I don't have much and my cost is low anyway. I also want to company to survive but I vote that THIS IS NOT THE WAY"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre wrong. Do some basic Dd or learn to read you fud piece of shit.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm with TD.  I‚Äôve received voting via mail for other stocks. So yours may come via mail.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mr. Sussman said, ‚ÄúAMC has been transforming the movie-going experience through innovation for much of its nearly 100-year history. I am looking forward to working with the team as technology plays a larger role in the value proposition for theatre exhibition.‚Äù

I also vote for Sussman ü§ó"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Im not sure about him. He's kinda suss man ü§î
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly I was just doing research on the other board members and it‚Äôs nothing but government officials, i voted the same way"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The choices for Directors are either For or Abstain.  There's no way to say ""Fuck this guy."""
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly I voted for Gary Locke solely because he was my governor for a long time (WA) and I always really liked him. Literally no other reason lol
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy Shit that is true. I just looked at the LinkedIn. AMC board of directors and President of Epic games. Something is happening.. AMC combining with video games = GOOD SIGN.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Isn't epic games majority owned by tencent? Ie the CCP propaganda machine. I personally don't want any of my companies run by someone who ""didn't know"" his user data was being sold to foreign nations. I have enough of that from home grown corps."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Researching those guys as well. Sussman does look like better choice. 
He was also chief digital officer for Nike, and I think VP for two years.
Still researching"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Which ones ? Would love to know !
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,If so my calls will print
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I would üçÜüí¶ if $35 happens.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Right? How hard is it to understand that we vote YES here?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If your shares are on loan, then whoever has ahold of the shares gets the right to your vote unless you call the share back."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,May. But how investors anticipate things turning out will begin being reflected at market open
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Bit boomery
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it makes them money but has the effect of diluting stock. They have done this twice recently and I think it might do it again. Makes sense from their end. Sucks as a holder. The fact they have been talking about this is why I have not bought back i  since selling my initial shares when it was trading at 19 bucks. 
Disclaimer, I bought in at $2.61"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought 34 shares using RH on Thursday morning.  Didn't get the email.  Gonna keep eating bananas in the meantime.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Adam Sussman is the nominee to elect IMO into the executive officer position. He plans on transitioning into the video game industry. Currently President of Epic Games. Balance of movies and video games would be amazing.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This was also my thought. I hope someone has a better theory.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs literally the most effective way for the company to benefit from the high share price. It‚Äôs a shitty thing to do but I understand their motivation.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holding both AMC and GME, as well. \*IF\* amc is going to put more shares on the market it will effect us all, so we need DD to see what our best move is - the more info we have the better every individual can decide for themselves."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm holding my 6k position
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"sorta, theyre authorizing them with the intentions to do so later"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It doesn‚Äôt already? Lead me to the land of cheap tickets.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Before you know it, AMC is going to moon to pre-pandemic levels! Then these naysayers will be sorry they didn‚Äôt jump in now."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,lol this is actually so true
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Right? I literally hated everything the board suggested lmao
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,May the 4th be with you.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It's stupidity like this thats going to create another generation of baguettes. Creating another 500 million shares is not going to create a short squeeze. The stocks don't need to be located and bought they just needed to find the registered owners to email them about the vote and they did. I'm beginning to think posts like these are from HF's that are long AMC and need bag holders for when they sell. Sell AMC and buy GME or any other stock but this.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"no, you‚Äôre the beneficial owner of the shares so the right is yours"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. We've been begging for a share count to expose ghost shares. The recount will do that.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,im on fidelity and didnt get shit ;/
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,check out the wrinkles on this chad
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes.  Correct.  There is no dilution with this. It‚Äôs an insurance policy for the future.  Again- no dilution.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I also have wealthsimple and I haven't got anything either
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Basically if you used any other platform you'd get the information
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What do you think the hedgefund and institutional holders will vote for?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,When do we know the results of this vote?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I just goggled him he looks like a slimy fucking soulless c-sucker who would sell his family into slave labor for an extra mill
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I cashed out all my AMC shares at a profit the second I saw that news.

So fucking glad I did."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Whales know retail will hold no matter what
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"They are dumb as fuck.... they have their own network and pay per view already. They should have snagged up the movies they could have and aired them for people at home before theaters reopened.

Why am I watching a movie on HBOMAX that should have come out in an AMC theater?

Answer, bad fucking management"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,No sir I have both
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The amc thing was a dumb idea from the start lol.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Your brokerage legally has to send you your voting package. If they didn't you should contact them.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Also can somebody send a link to vote?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,All AMC shareholders are sent a link to vote on some changes to the AMC corporate structure including the proposal to issue new shares which would dilute the stock and decrease the price for everyone who holds shares.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC is deciding whether to shut down its movie theater business and instead start a food cart business. Vote.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs also about AMC tapping into cash (they need a butt-ton more just to keep open).  Stock price rising says to them ‚Äúinvestors think we are a good company.  So let‚Äôs let more investors in.‚Äù    They have no obligation to the current stock holders.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It will go up or it will go down that is for certain
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yesterday I had 100 shares, and did not get a mail :/

Perhaps because the shares were called away now?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it popcorn flavors? I vote crayon flavor!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,if u have amc shares they sent u an email to vote on some brokerages
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Additional capital for investing in the business = more money.  That money goes somewhere and it gets added to the cash value of the businessn without increasing debt, which curiously enough increases shareholder value.

If you believe in management's ability to effectively operate the company then you should believe in their ability to do well with additional capital.  If not, then perhaps you should sell your shares to somebody who does."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Seems like a bad time to sell amc as the squeeze is coming
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,14 is well past the high of any sane valuation I can come up with.   I think 8 is a more than fair price target for 2021.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Aren't we all
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you! Goddamn best comment here tonight.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Full retard
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"1. We probably don't need more stock
2. These are the guys that ran amc into the ground pre-covid get them outta here. 
3. Accountants are nice, independents probably won't cook the books 
4. No board directors we didn't all just dump money to make y'all debt free just to give yourself raises wtf (see point 2)
5. Amc removed damn near all benefits from their employees (besides basic health) we should give the little guys something. 
6. If we vote now this is pointless. 
These are my opinions. I'm open for debate because we should all be informed and not voting randomly."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The CEO after hours on friday sold 500,000 shares. He has never bought shares at market price he was granted these shares as part of his deal."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Adam Aron sold 500,000 shares on 3/19 he knows what dilution will do. [https://sec.report/CIK/0001032673/Insider-Trades](https://sec.report/CIK/0001032673/Insider-Trades)"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep. Potential. Capital can be raised through other means that exposes the company and their major shareholders to increased risk. As opposed, to the less risky exposure to them by passing on to publicly traded shares. If they have a positive outlook, then let them take on more debt through private investor capital. Vote against."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,For the same reason the company went public in the first place - to get more cash. A higher share price me as nothing to them if they can't sell more shares. A holder may think it's a good idea if they're investing in the company for the long haul.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The people that want the money to get extra cash for the company. They have done this twice recently to help keep them afloat. It's a common practice. Better to dilute stock than risk business failure is their mindset.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Read the sec filing. It says immediately
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I have both
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,A vote?  None.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It might make the price go down, confusion is never good for a stock"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Now? WSB has been this way about AMC since the beginning.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,No but if you are telling people 500 million more shares is good for the stock price and good for a short squeeze you are obviously shilling something.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Brain to smooth for future thought...
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL!  Long-term growth in movie theaters and shopping mall video game stores.  I'm going long on video rental stores and pay phones!

This is all just fascinating retardation."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,He gifted 250000 to each of his sons.  Big difference.  There is so much misinformation being pushed this weekend.  Shorts are scared and working overtime.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Just vote against it.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean the company was literally going to go bankrupt until they issued more shares.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah.  Everyone should pull out. Let the stock crash back down to what it‚Äôs supposed to be and keep pirating and steaming their movies at home.  Fuck going to theatres. They‚Äôre overrated. If it wasn‚Äôt for the popcorn I wouldn‚Äôt even think about ever stepping foot in one
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Shorting aint gonna bankrupt them at this point. Only if another pandemic hits or they release another crappy starwars movie
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You may not own your share
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,FUCK
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Fidelity sent me an e-mail this morning linking to the vote page.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity will email you, don‚Äôt panic about it. Fidelity is not Robinhood and won‚Äôt screw you over. Email distributions to thousands are not instantaneous and still have to be iterated through. You should also be able to find a link within your AMC position on the Fidelity website (not app)."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"to clarify, i do not have an options enabled account, and have held 70 shares of AMC since feb 1st.  Why didn't i get an email but some people with like 1 share did?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have fidelity and got the email. But I also have it on webull and they sent the same type of voting email. Theres a link in the email that sends you to another link about a vote. So I clicked the download to see what the vote is about for shareholders and it is for the additional 500,000,000 shares. Which this would dilute the value of our current shares so that's why we are here on reddit. To discuss."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Nothing from wealthsimple
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So AMC asked for 500 million more shares to try to scare people into selling? How does that help them?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,where have you been the past 2 months around robinhood??
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are not the registered owner of shares. Your ""IOU"" is housed at Citadel, but the record of ownership never transferred because they never actually bought your shares on market. You hold synthetics. 

Please folks... get off RH"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They probably don‚Äôt really have your sharesüëÄüòÇ
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The brokerage most likely holds your shares in their name, but cant vote for anything on your behalf so they will contact you or you them to voice your vote.. Don't listen to the clowns here.. Ugh"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Robin the hood probably lend your shares.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"They don't actually own your shares. They are synthetic shares and don't purchase them unless they absolutely have to like when you move your business from them to someone else like Webull, TD Ameritrade , eTrade ect"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They probably have til the week of the 4th before they have to do anything. I sorted through the app language and they should be contacting users through by a third party host.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'll buy this guys stocks and HOLD both. Power to the player, Love GAMESTOP and I love movie theaters. There should be no divide. We are all apes."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Where did you even sell it? Market is closed retard
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity sent me an email this morning with a phone number. Can also do it via the app.

I only hold two."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Buying some shares of $NUG that should pay dividends in the future
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its wsb, amc is not welcomed yet here we are"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Bunch of bots prolly
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Additional 500,000,000 shares vote"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Smart
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What about GME?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"That guy is not very bright. He influenced a lot of other complete newbies. The people who have wrinkle brains can see the GME has a lower float, higher short interest, a lot of synthetic shares artificially lowering the price, a boss ceo, dfv, business pivoting to e-commerce, etc. GME is worth $500+ without a squeeze, maybe even $1000. Amc is not and was never the play, just a bunch of idiots who thought GME had already had its run up and not it‚Äôs amc turn. GME hasn‚Äôt even gotten started"

They‚Äôve been doing similar shit across the last few weeks. Giant short walls that buy orders need to constantly eat through in order to prevent the price from going up. False selling pressure with naked shorts. I don‚Äôt know where to look for accurate figures on short float or interest anymore, if anyone has info please feel free to let us know."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I can't decide between 12 and 11.50
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck that the CEO doubles his pay and wants the shares diluted to pay for it. Crazy.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"So doubling down on confirmation bias?! The delusion is never ending. It popped to 20 and 14.5. AMC is actively screwing you over and you are still like ""we like the stock"" instead of hopping in a lifeboat. You sir have earned your bags."

What is Bobby Bonilla Day?
July 1 in baseball is Bobby Bonilla Day, when the Mets pay $1,193,248.20 to their former third baseman, who hasn‚Äôt set foot on a major league diamond since 2001, as part of a deferred payment plan. It‚Äôs a check the Mets have been cutting annually since 2011, and they will send a seven-figure sum to Bonilla, every July 1, through 2035."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actually AMC on Friday was the best thing that could have happened since the stock just sat and consolidated all day until the end. 

If you look at the charts on a larger time frame you will see how we go up some and then we trend sideways for a few days and then we move up and have been doing so for a few weeks now and it also lowers the I.V. (Implied Volatility) and makes the stock ‚ÄúAMC‚Äù look more appealing to the Big Smart money to wanna come play and Jack this stock up higher! 

But I agree that right at the end was a dick move and was on purpose to drop it out of the money of $14 for Friday."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Friday was proof we're winning and the hedgies are terrified. Makes me want to double down - they had to dump billions in the market to achieve that, probably lost tens of millions in the process and yet still many many options ended ITM."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm seriously wondering this too. It blows my mind that there can be AMC bulls that are simultaneously GME bears too. GME has all kinds of lofty ambitions about completely reinventing the company. At the absolute worst, that'll maintain bull speculation until it proves wrong.

The only case I've heard for AMC is that they're gonna reopen...which, as I understand, has been priced in by now. I haven't heard anything about them reinventing themselves. They were on a downward spiral for the past 5 years. But it's totally possible I'm missing some DD here. Is AMC planning something revolutionary once they open back up? They gonna start up a streaming service like Netflix or something?"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"No matter the decision, they need to recount the shares, consequently forcing hedges to buy back their shorts as they‚Äôre not real stock. Aka price goes up when the vote happens, and if the vote no occurs then not only does the price shoot up from a squeeze the price per share is unaffected. So this is a good thing.

Edit: investorplace is looking at 35/share by the end of this"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"No. Its class A shares FOR MANAGEMENT TO HAVE MORE VOTE POWER..but the real cause is to force share count and HF are in deep shit.
Class A cannot be traded in public. 
And last one - if it was dilution, it would decrease stock price, so why HF were so busy attacking AMC all these days, and especially on this Friday and spend aonmuch money on that????. 
And will AMC owners with delution want to decrease their fortune? NO.
So HF are now spread manipulation with this voting to vote against.. what actually is again Manipulation as no one can tell you how to vote!!!!"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that's true, and I would say that's a lesson for keeping an eye on corporate takeovers. Watch for news articles stating that kind of takeover happening, like when Tencent tried to snatch up Activision-Blizzard. Sussman had no power over that. Executive Directors can't control who buys how much of a company's shares."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gary F. Locke and Philip Lader were both being voted on, as well. Again, I have no way of knowing if these are the same guys, literally all I could do was a google search, but if it's the same dudes, that's who they are!"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay a couple of theories.

1.  Cash for covering debt and pivoting the business to be more than just a theater chain.
2. Make the share price cheaper for a buyout from a major studio because they just retired the law that studios couldn't own theaters.
3. Maintain corporate control.
4. Shares sold into the squeeze, more debt retired a la the last IOU.
5. Make the stock a more attractive recovery stock with a lower share price.  Right now 13 to 14 bucks is fairly stout.  Trading at 4 bucks gives it room to run back up again along with freeing the company up to do the above stuff."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah, its either that or dump what they are holding onto at this point, I think some people are under the impression that when a company's stock price rises that the company somehow gets some benefit directly from it."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Supply and demand gonna hurt real bad on this one. One of the worst dilutions I've ever heard of

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You can only vote if you own shares
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The new shares issued wouldn‚Äôt be for the public market for traders like us. It‚Äôs added shares to the private shareholders to establish more corporate control and structure for the big guys up top. It in no way will affect us as retail investors. If anything may help. Also you wouldn‚Äôt see these changed til this time next year 2022
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Aren't stock splits supposed to compensate shareholders with new shares?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats not accurate at all.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"On one hand I don't think that sounds right at all. Yet on the other you managed to use the correct ""its"" while also eschewing any unnecessary capitalization for emphasis which in my opinion garners you significant credence here on reddit."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Vote for what?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why do you think people bought AMC in the first place? Because of their great management or the potential for a gamma squeeze/short squeeze? Don't be dumb. We can worry about the issuance of more shares once this play, plays out and stabilizes at a new price. They won't go bankrupt now with all of this action and theaters reopening. There is literally no reason I can think of to dilute the shares right now other than a cash grab from the hype. If they issue more shares they are effectively stabbing their shareholders from the past few months in the back. We saved them from the shorts. Resurrected them. If they fuck us like this, we can as easily boycott them. Investor sentiment/support will die faster than it started. Dangerous play here for them."

I would rather be retarded than socially inept like you
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,How far do you think it‚Äôll go if the management is more worried about it‚Äôs bonuses then growth. Before it can even grow it has to dig itself out of this massive covid hole. Gme made money during covid and gained a massive and wealthy loyal following. Only reason we‚Äôre still squeezing is the size of our float. We have 50 million shares available. Amc has 400 million and wants to make it a billion. Shits a fucking joke and there leaving there shareholders out to dry.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly and fucking chad gme was buying back its shares like a fucking boss because they knew the shorts were full of shit and they had people actually buying with them during covid.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It will be fine. Trust the process and hold. If it starts to dip below your average  cost. Then sell. If it doesn't just Hold. Time will tell what happens. But scaring others into selling is what's going to kill the stonk. Just shut your mouth and let the process role
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is incorrect. It‚Äôs the same for RH as other brokers. 

By the way, directly from your friends at AMC, for those incorrectly freaking out about RH -

Beneficial owners are stockholders who hold their shares through a brokerage account, bank or other record holder. You also may have heard the term ""held in street name"" when describing stock ownership. When you buy securities through a brokerage firm, most firms will automatically put your securities into ""street name."" This means your brokerage firm will hold your securities in its name or another nominee and not in your name, but your brokerage firm will keep records showing you as the real or ""beneficial owner."" Under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE""), member stockbrokers who hold shares of Common Stock in their name for customers are required to obtain directions from their customers on how to vote the shares. NYSE rules permit brokers to vote shares on certain proposals when they have not received any directions. The Staff of the NYSE, prior to the Annual Meeting, informs brokers of those proposals on which they are entitled to vote the undirected shares

(Robinhood kind of sucks but no, they don‚Äôt trade CFDS, and no, holding in street name isn‚Äôt fraudulent, and no, switching to another broker won‚Äôt change that)"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,they could at least begin with some sort of context. Everyone here is beginning to think this voting is about share dilution now. But this share holder voting is for May. Which will not affect any short term price. Lead with DD not a confusing title
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I made 180ish% profit? Why would I be sorry. If it moons that's great! I like the movies. I made 150% of of Cinemark as well. I wish nothing but the best for movie theater chains.

The Amazon deal has been talked about for years. I'll stick my bias to greedy CEOs over pipe dreams anyday."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,We can like more than one stonk.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I like that stock.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like GME. Still holding and averaged up actually. Again I was too stupid to sell back when they halted buying in January and I didn't have cash available to buy more when it was $40 since it wasn't cleared yet.

But I think the earnings report will be good and I believe there is a future in the company that Ryan Cohen will bring to light soon. If it squeezes great, but either way I like the stock."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,AAAAAgreed. He sure is...uh...enthusiastic though.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude, no offense, but GME is worth 20-30 at MOST. Like, wtf how do you even have the balls to say it‚Äôs 500 lmao. Apple is 160 or so. MSFT is also around that. Hell, Telsa maaybe is worth 500. Bug maybe. But GME, a failing brick and mortar business with an idea (just an idea) of a change. I don‚Äôt know if you guys know what fundamentals are anymore. AMC is shitty too, not denying that. But GME is only at 200 now because of WSB sentiment, definitely not because it‚Äôs worth it - just go fo Finviz or check any common sense analyst."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"They just want the approval to exercise more shares, I think they would want more shares once we have a much higher share price. Don‚Äôt panic. Just yesterday the HF were fighting to keep the price down and they will be next week if we hold."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The fact is the company is in bad shape and needs more cash. They are going to take advantage of the fact that the price is up and do it asap.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Same here. I do like having a few drinks while watching a movie.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well I am highly encouraged by the absorption and lack of repayment... I think if MM have been vwap hedging we will see a push to punish them with higher prices tomorrow... Check iborrow shorts didn't return shares on goev, AMC rkt or CLVS..."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're absolutely right... The question is can the longs keep up and was the gamma ramp win enough... I think the short interest is the same across AMC, goev and perhaps ark and clvs... Your stock really is hft theatrical warfare"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah shit thanks bro I need to impress yknow
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,like a true asshole. asking for help and instead of explaining you call me retarded.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,i‚Äôve desperately been trying to figure out how it‚Äôs a good play and between the bots/dilution/$Billions in debt/investors stepping back i just don‚Äôt see it
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Good DD
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What do u think he's selling? Your post doesn't even make sense. Do you think AMC has no debt and no problems? Retarded. Utter pants on head
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,SO YOUR SAYING I GOTTA SELL MY AMC AND PUT IT IN GME ?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"They are probably going to sue HBO and movie studios to try to force releases back into theatres. WW84 fucked them. They're not going to innovate, they're going to fight innovation. I bought both AMC and GME and the difference in corporate philosophy between the two is quite stark."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,you must be the kind that adds water to your soda. enjoy
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol you‚Äôre actually retarded if you believe that.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That's why I'm on this sub.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Im sorry i agree with odd, not as gruffly said, i do think it was the cheaper option of the tale of 2 squeezes, i exercised a 15.5 puts last week to sell my 400 shares,. They want to issue that much stocm because the hedies have shorted that much stock. Interesting so perhaps that would be the same amount if not more that they shorted gamestock."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That means it‚Äôs the perfect time to buy puts. You think a 150% gain is sustainable for AMC?   Lolol.  I‚Äôm new to trading but you must be BRAND new
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm selling if you had half a brain you would sell. Another greedy CEO fucking retail investors.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not about the past mi amigo, it's the about the momentum moving forward. Sooo dumb. Good luck with your bags."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Only yesterday the HF were fighting to keep the price down and they still will be next week if we hold. Meeting not till May.  Don‚Äôt panic sell hold for a higher price.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I wrote that to see how many shills are in here. Seems I‚Äôm holding the right stock. Btw I never am selling my GME. But seeing at how fast I‚Äôm getting Downvoted is convincing me this FUD  is being spread by the shills who want my AMC shares.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow, convincing response definite robot, but I'm voting yes."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That sucks. Its not good for us
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"When I say I don't see us winning, I was only referring to the Shareholder vote.  Apes are still strong in AMC."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That too
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I think AMC has an investor relations site as well. Maybe contact them and ask them why you havent received the voting email?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are you sure about that? Because as i can see we are buying Class A shares. Look at the whole name when you‚Äôre buying it says AMC ENT. Holdings, Inc. Class A Common Stock"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,QAnon shit. Any executive of a corporation actually likes hedge funds because it's a source of capital. They aren't going to do anything to benefit small retail investors. People don't seem to understand. The rich have class solidarity. They are not your friend.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Class A shares can and do get traded publicly. The difference is the weight of voting power.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The combo is absolutely perfect. I had a vision where we can bring either bring personal VR units to AMC or rent one out and play video games together. AMC and gamestop can potentially create a whole new type of experience.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,While that's true they don't have direct control. Sussman has tasted the benefits of having outside investors who have their own interest and are willing to throw a lot of money around. Based off basic psychology he's likely to not appose any action by them even if it's detrimental to stockholders because he knows he'll get paid regardless.

I didn't go to the Wharton School of bricklaying but this seems like irrefutable economic/mathematical  principle. 

Copied from Proxy:

Not trying to be argumentative just having a hard time understanding the ""It wont dilute our shares because we trust them not to sell them to the open market"" concept.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely correct! This is what I just when I on a rant about on another, this is not to dilute, why would they cut their own throats ?"

You will have millions of actual retards with millions in their account off the first trade they have ever made over confident as all hell they will not cash out and buy safe stocks with a dividend. 

Every single one of them will look for the next GME and by then the AMC will have the float shorted likely over 100% and they will all dogpile on it. Because if they can make GME moon with a 1k investment how can they fail with literal millions. But if nothing changes from what I can see about AMC now they will all get a lesson that basic economics actually matters and all the reasons GME happened is absent in AMC. Worst case is AMC goes belly up and all the millions retail made on GME is now gone and no lessons learned."

GME is at 200 just due to speculation by WSB fanatics and people who want to get rich, its value is 20 dollars at MOST. Sure, you may want to get into that fabled squeeze (which already happened, that‚Äôs the hilarious thing, that you literally don‚Äôt see that you already did it and are waiting on nothing).

If you guys are so concern about this, then use your fucking vote to influence the result. You guys are so fucking brain dead, bad and good news are spun to deceive you, everyone  has their own agenda, so it's crucial that you do your own DD, OR you all will keep falling for idiots claiming the sky is falling constantly.

Things to consider:

Why would someone who has shares on AMC claim they'll publicly dump it asap because of this news? Would inducing panic a good idea before that person dumps his shares? Why is this news being spread around like crazy like the CEO's bonus?"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,These shares would be for someone looking to take on partial ownership of the company. Buy out or merger type situation. If they needed to take on new/extra ownership to stay afloat these shares would be given to that person/entity and they would be able to sell them on the open market. Until that time they would not dilute the value.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Um this is dilutive.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They arent going to wait til cash hits 0 to do an offering. They will do it WELL ahead of time. And I dont support anyone you loser im just playing this market game for the money and giving my opinion on a stock subreddit
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They have enough cash for a year. Ok great. Do you think they will wait til their cash hits 0 in a year to do the offerig? When the hype may be gone and the price could be lower? No they will do it well ahead of time to be ahead of the game.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,i‚Äôm not into but if people like the stock could be dangerous
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Or my account
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but not everyone gets the same votes per share. Ultimately theyll do what the want and fuck over apes
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Is the voting transparent or not?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice bought account hedgefund shill. Im on to you and your short-ass ladders
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,More than likely that will happen initially.  What is unknown is what will happen after it does.  There are cases where they stocks recover reasonably  quick and cases where they don't.  That will be the unknown factor in this.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre wrong dude. You own class A. Lol. Guess you can‚Äôt read good.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Because of the new DTCC rule?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,My bad.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, I know what Class A and B shares are...I just thought this was a Class B push.   Yeah, adding 500mil shares is a cash grab plain and simple and given it could double the shares outstanding... it's effectively a negative stock split."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Why doesn‚Äôt the board own a significant amount of shares? Why is the float so huge. They should be buying back shares not selling them. They‚Äôve made a fuckton of money off you guys and are begging for more instead of making you money.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What's your take?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Upvoted this one too!!!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh he big mad now üòÇ

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Read through my comments, I‚Äôve not been negative about anything until something made me question motives, I‚Äôve nothing to hide. I‚Äôm still holding amc currently but not to line the pockets of the management and dilute my money"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Jesus Christ.. Good luck man
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Wanna bet?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Again but *how* (emai, website, which way to vote, etc.). Ive come to realize a lot of people interpret ""how"" differently."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs a quite a bit, i won‚Äôt sell Im holding"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Right so whats wrong with AMC making more stocks when they're about to be bankrupt and cant raise capital
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Am I only allowed to post confirmation bias? AMC used you as their ATM. why would you like to support them? They literally shit on the ppl who saved them
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"lol right, like i don't get all this spreading hateful shit, they must be bots working for shitidel"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"IMHO: Fractional shares are bullshit. Trying to get in on multiple fronts without buying power heavy in any doesn't really trend well with me. 

If you have the capital to buy bits of a lot of things, you have the capital to buy whole of a few things. At no point do I go 'Hmm... sure would be nice to own 10% of one share of something"". No -- unless you are hyper managing 1000000 different positions simultaneously and just love the manic feel of having hands in every damn thing then it's pointless. Pick a core position, pick some fun outliers, pick your theta farm for contracts that feed your pools. Get all those things going, then use what hits the pool as overflow as your YOLO. 

I also hate how the phone broker platforms make you, the trader, the product. But that is a different story all together.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,We shall see!!!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is all new to me I‚Äôm an old guy been trading before cell phone even existed. Lol.... it will easily do 25 way before the end of the year I‚Äôd even say by the end of April. I wish you luck also you seem on top of it just different opinion than me. As far as GME that baby is done.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm going to come back to this comment in 2-8 weeks. Do not delete you account when you‚Äôre wrong
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That is also for a mutual fund. Jesus.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Class A common stock are the shares you own, and yes, it will dilute the pool."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Listen to your gut and common sense. These shares absolutely dilute the stock. No question about that. They already did this once in January and guess what it screwed any future squeeze. It's a lot harder to squeeze when you have to buy 300 million more bananas.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs not dilutive unless it‚Äôs used , would love to have the extra ammo if someone was trying to break into and take my home/business. Don‚Äôt need to use it unless ? So is it dilutive if it‚Äôs not used ?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thing is, AMC had blatant short selling, there is obvious media manipulation and even if the company does agree on 500,000,000 shares, they wont sell those shares until the stock is at least forced to be bought back first so they take maximum profit. Why would they sell 500,000,000 shares at 14$ when it should be at 20-30$+ from all the shorts? 

There is also the possibility of the shares being brought out to be used for a company buying. If someone were to buy AMC today they cant because of lack of shares. In buying the company off there is a possibility that all the shorted shares are forced to be bought back aswell.

Adam Aron the CEO has a lot of videos completely trashing short sellers."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,We still vote against more shares!!!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. All shareholders including myself were sent voting packages with all legally required background information this morning.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, you're an actual idiot if you think all of my posts unrelated to AMC are ""false flag"" posts designed to throw you off my secret ""deep state"" aka ""Hedge fund"" agenda. Go back to the QANON hole you crawled from you conspiratorial troglodyte.

PS: Hedge funds wouldn't be able to buy my account as my opinions are not for sale. All of the opinions on here are my own. If you look back in time at my posts, I Occupied Wall Street. Why would I then do a full reversal and work for Wall Street, LOL."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"What ever you say...
Question to yourself: why HF spends so much money on attacks to push price down if soon AMC put 500mil shares in public and the price will go down anyway to pennies and can super cheaply cover all shorts, naked shit and synthetic shares.."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"DTCC is completely another story... again, read that DTCC.. it also influence to shorts.. and its related to ALL stocks"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"They did this for the share count right now. Will MAYBE add shares down the road. They are GOOD ON CASH for the year. This is my take, straight from the CEO‚Äôs mouth."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree that is a possibility but so is the chance to make a shit ton of money with a squeeze. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not sure how they will vote
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well maybe actually read more then what a redditor posts on your investments.

The vote (not action) isnt until May 4th.

They explicitly said they wont be diluting shares with the 500,000,000.

In order to even do the vote they will need to account for all shares, which is what they began doing with Fidelity, hence the emails. All that shenanigans on Friday will be dealt with by counting back the stocks and forcing brokers to locate all the naked shorts."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thx man. Not so much about luck but good Die Diligence.

Hope the HF are paying you well"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôd love to
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably not wrong unless their fundamentals vastly improve.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,About to be bankrupt and can‚Äôt raise capital should never be a company your interested in
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs why lol
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They have to be. No doubt. Why would so many people waste time on the weekend shitposting in a thread lol.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm just gonna throw one word out there for you. Diversification.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not gonna delete anything since stocks are not even my main interest lol, i just go here as a curiosity. But do you seriously believe GME is gonna go higher? Like, I thought it was only memes lol you serious??"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol you can just call me marcopolette.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"But I'm a big enough person to admit when someone else is right and I was wrong.  While I still am bullish as fuck about AMC, and whether or not this vote goes through, you are right.  We hold Class A shares.  I've deleted my comments and I apologize.  shakes ape hand."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You gotta look at signals man, there‚Äôs only one reason they issue more shares, to SELL it and dilute the stock price"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Didnt they do an offering for like 200m more shares during the first big squeeze? Why do you assume they will refrain this time? The same people are in charge
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but is it transparent how they count it?  Or do they just get a bundle of your votes.  Count it behind closed doors and then tell you the results.  Is there any outside oversight?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha, good try, Melvin, and nice script. It's called ""deep cover""? Hello??? I'm not going to explain your own tactics to you, I'd rather just vote yes and fuck you over."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I started this whole thing all in amc, made a bit of money did some dd and studied best as I could and even at the high price, it still seems more likely of a gme squeeze. So I now have pretty much all gme with a little side of amc, just a bit unnerved by this, the proof will be on Tuesday when we hear gamestops financials and hear from Ryan Cohen. But I get a strong feeling he‚Äôs on our side. And he gets it"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well they recently cleared some debt with our money then gave some very nice bonuses out with it. Which was fine it needed to be done . I just think if this was to happen a second time it‚Äôs lie they are treating it as a fund raiser with our money to line their pockets personally. When have I said I‚Äôve got my info from a Redditor? Everyone on here is fine with you if it‚Äôs all confirmation bias but as soon as you question anything you get presumptions thrown at you like you‚Äôre a shill or you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about, or you get you‚Äôre info from other redditors. Thanks for the info of the date being in may, that gives me time to evaluate the situation at least and wait to see if and when a share recall happens"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs sad you don‚Äôt what stock dilution is or what it means for your money.  If you were smart you‚Äôd go to GME who‚Äôs executives have not diluted the stock and don‚Äôt have any plans to...
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,We're talking GME.  First we need to define how long.  It's clearly going to survive 2021 just on hype alone.  Would you agree?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah thats why its a meme - this sub was about yoloing into risky bets before gme became a movement.

&#x200B;

It was a desperate move - not a grimey one."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is WSB.

But seriously, diversification is good -- shotgunning into hundreds of positions at fractional holdings isn't my bag. Like I said, pick your cores, pick your outliers (fun stocks) and always have a nice theta crop to continually fill that pool. Then you can diversify all you want.

I believe my individual holdings span 20 offerings and of course boomer ETFs for the slow growth/don't touch it stuff. I am pretty tech skewed though, all things considered. Occupational hazard I suppose"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Check Friday AH, stock already down, if it continues to crash next week, will YOU apologize ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sell when ? I think that‚Äôs obviously what all what to know ? Hold until it‚Äôs advantageous, no company executive would look and throw a shit ton of shares out when they‚Äôre just rising ? To think so doesn‚Äôt make sense, it‚Äôs throwing shade . Now to have ammo to use when it‚Äôs sitting at a level steady for a period of time., y use it to gain traction, move the needle with say a merger with ? We have time to no one needs to vote till May , decide then . But to make a blanket it‚Äôs to be used to dilute ( in a bad way ) isn‚Äôt an argument."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wont care if they do this during a squeeze since I will sell during the squeeze too.

My point is they will first force the shorts to buy back before even thinking of selling those 500,000,000 shares which is a recipe for a squeeze."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can read about shareholder voting rights here: https://www.investor.gov/glossary-term-categories/shareholder-voting

SEC oversight."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You got me. I'm actually Gabe Plotkin. :)
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC will hit a huge spike and rise to around 100 shortly. You will make lots of cash.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think if all things remain the same and they don‚Äôt add stock, both will squeeze. It‚Äôs undeniable that HFS are messing with both for a reason. This dilution will definitely mess things up but could be opening the door for an Amazon acquisition. I‚Äôm gonna wait to see what AMC puts out in regards to this vote probably next week."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro the share price has literally 0 factor in determining a squeeze. Not only is Big Squeeze Hunting a horrible investment strategy, but you clearly don‚Äôt even understand how it works. GME is not a squeeze candidate any more, but based on the fact that it DOESNT NEED to dilute share holders and has the ability to become profitable again, they‚Äôre clearly the better choice. 

I feel bad for all you AMC bag holders that got tricked into buying this shitty stock. I‚Äôve held bags before in other companies and trust me when I say it‚Äôs better to cut your losses and move onto a better play. AMC is a a slow bleed to insolvency. Don‚Äôt let your money bleed out with it."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes this is WSB. I guess I just don't have enough money in this account to play if I want a few different 200 dollar stocks. It's my gambling account but Im not gambling with that much!

I have more fun if I have 9-10 stocks to watch."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Of course.  When you're wrong, you apologize."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Me and my 1000+ shares are ready to apologize if that happens.  But I'll still hold over 1000 shares no matter what.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,MODS! I found him!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hope it does, why 100 though?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hope it does, I want us all to do well. But the tactics of the people in charge does give me some doubts. All the best to you though üôèüèª"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs not what I said is it? I was a bit concerned at the price level I got in at with gme that‚Äôs why I thought not knowingly that AMC was the better play. Well I think the squeeze will happen with GME as there is at least 100% the float (I think over 500%) owned by retail and if nobody sells and there‚Äôs a catalyst - I.e a share recall, stock split etc they will have to buy the shares to cover. They‚Äôve over borrowed massively"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Got it I‚Äôll be back next Friday
2021-03-20 17:53:03,wallstreetbets,Am I reading this wrong or is some fuckery actually about to happen? #1 and #5 
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Things that are best for the company aren‚Äôt necessarily best in the short term for stock owners. If you are invested for a long term turnaround play then diluting the shares for more cash is a good thing. If you‚Äôre in it for a squeeze or run-up, that could hit some major roadblocks when they approve these to hit the market."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"1. Raising money to stay afloat. Not clear from whom   

2. Laying the ground for a massive executive bonanza later under the ‚ÄòEquity Incentive Plan‚Äô."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This was discussed two weeks ago folks. They are simply approving the ability to issue new shares if needed to help maintain corporate control. These shares are for internal holders if they do issue them. Which they have said in their sec filings that they are not immediately issuing any new shares. Read the full sec doc sections that reference this, the specifically address the importance of not diluting. #5 is also good because it means they are putting 35M shares in the hands of the employees, taking them off the market. 

I‚Äôm probably not explaining this the best but it‚Äôs important to know that this has no affect on the squeeze as no new shares would hit the market until likely 2022 if at all since they have ample cash on hand now. The hedges will try and use our misunderstanding of this info to scare a sell... we‚Äôre going to squeeze them."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"So many idiots, so little time."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt understand much but I do understand the ability to issue more shares will make the stock even more volatile. Talk about FUD when you don‚Äôt know when they could send them out into the market... Ugh. This would be a better plan AFTER summer once they see how everything is doing. I‚Äôll tell you this, the odds of AMC going bankrupt once they dilute their stock is 100% because retail will peace the hell out en masse with the middle finger up. Somethings fishy with this."

2. What? you mean I'm losing control of the company from all the shares I sold
3. Oh well,  better vote to give myself more shares. 

LOL.   Once again, retail holder will be left holding the bag."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,god i love this place. simple seaming words writen down yet there are many versions of what it means. gj
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Vote NO on adding 500M shares CLASS A shares.. The vote has absolutely nothing to do with ‚Äúexpediting a short squeeze by forcing and audit‚Äú. Read the documents! If you vote yes you are approving AMC to add a massivE number of shares to Class A common stock = very bad idea for stock holders or anyone here hoping for this to rapidly pass $20

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Amc management is honestly garbage. Saving amc is honourable, but they can‚Äôt be trusted, ceo will give himself another bonus the next chance he gets."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"5 is just corporate bosses giving themselves a bigger bonus plan while the stock is heating back up.

1 though. Hmm.... Not fuckery maybe...

There are roughly 1 Billion shares of AMC outstanding.
They want to raise the ceiling of newly issuable shares from half a billion to 1 Billion.

Prelude to a split? 1 Billion becomes 2 billion, 14$ price becomes 7$ price."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hmm stock dilution not good for short term investors.  

Looks like they're trying to raise some cash while there is interest in their stock, though by May I suspect that interest will be lower, and then they will be diluting an already cheap stock."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Oof they're asking to be compensated? For what? Did they do something other than get attacked by covid and shorts?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"When the CEO said ""thank you retail for saving AMC"" he really meant ""we are going to dilute retail so fucking hard to save our dying biz, and for that, we are thankful."""
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I been warning yall. AMC gonna dump on ya.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes they are about to fuck AMC holders. Stick with GME.

The reason people found out today is because brokers are being forced to locate all the shares now. Whether you agree or disagree the 500,000,000 stocks do not get voted on till May 4th, never mind the actual release."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Ouch.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"At the end of the day, the email provides enough insight to do your own DD and decide on the best course of action. 
Dilution can be good or bad.  It really depends on more information in this case."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I expected them to offer shares but doubling the float? Thats a little excessive
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"...And for that reason, I‚Äôm out."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"WOW WHO COULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT THE COMPANY WITH INSANE DEBT THAT DILUTED MULTIPLE TIMES IN 2020 WOULD DILUTE AGAIN

WHAT AN AMAZING DISCOVERY

lmao worst company to rally around, going to be some heavy bags incoming"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,There are still good investments out there that would love new investors. This isnt the only rocket ship trying to get to the  moon.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Authorized shares and issued shares are 2 entirely different things. AMC is doing what every big pub traded co does, making sure a mountain of authorized shares are available as a future tool if necessary. Dont overthink that. Look around the mkts and compare authorized vs outstanding on all well known companies and you'll breath easy

Eta: it's also common for companies to register a shelf after increasing authorized. Shelf registrations designate shares for future at the market dilution. But it doesnt mean immediate or inevitable dilution. If you guys see AMC register a 100M share shelf registration or whatever, dont worry about that either. That said, AMC will almost def dilute over the next couple years as re-opening and gradual rev ramp need a boost with fresh cash to keep the machine running."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao, they‚Äôre about to fuck over anyone holding"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Selling my AMC and going more in GME.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuckery for sure if approved
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"they will print more shares 

expect a massive a dump"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got downvoted to hell for saying they were going to dilute shares literally yesterday lmao

Everyone get out now and get into gme while you can"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well.....

&#x200B;

Guess I'm glad my portfolio is 90% GME and 10% AMC..."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm pretty retard, but what I‚Äôm understanding is they are going to add shares, and it will bring price down, yes? Are we on a moon schedule for before, Will this stop us once the time comes?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you were counting on something short term, this isn't it.  If you plan on holding long term it's a different story.

If this takes the share price down to 4 dollars but covers debts and allows the business to pivot then yeah it's a good thing and a good buy for an eventual down the road payday."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I voted against on everything just to make sure.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It looks like they're going to dilute again.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Guess who will sell its shares asap üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,TLDR: GET THE F OUT OF AMC WHILE THE GETTING IS GOOD
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs a lot of dilution.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Get in on gme. These old fucks are lucky we bailed em out
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes the CEO has used this to directly dilute their shares several times already. AMC was a good pick months ago but the actual squeeze play has and only ever has been GME. AMC was a hedgefund trap that anyone who was involved with GME pre-January saw coming. Cohen hasnt done a single share dilution yet. That should speak to you apes who keep buying AMC.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs a lot of dilution. Holy fudge! I‚Äôll vote No on 1.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I got out Friday. Will wait and see what happens

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Means that soon might be a good time to dump the AMC shares for those of you that were in it for the squeeze. But hey, we‚Äôll welcome you with open arms in GME. üòÇ"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Can‚Äôt wait to sell Monday
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC just wants to remain solvent. They don't care about some moon squeeze.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This whole thread seems biased. Makes me feel like the fuckery is right here.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm an ape, I know...but I can't understand how issuing that many more share will not dilute the share price. Could they not just do a stock split instead and make an already affordable share more attractive to.more investors? Ape is confused ü¶ç."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"No offense to all the AMC fanatics but this stock was trading below $7.00 way before Covid hit. The CEO doubled his salary in 2020 even though the company lost fuck loads of money. He goes on CNBC praising retail traders tickling your egos and then turns around and selling 50 million more shares fucking you with a smile. Go buy GME, RKT etc where the CEO's actually have our backs.
This is not financial advice, I'm a botched abortion ape...."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Can we fire them?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, you're reading it wrong. Kind of.

They are giving the company the authority to release shares to raise capital if they need it. Every company does this. They're not about to drop 100% more shares next week."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Was expecting my $9 PUT expiring worthless in a month, now I'm not so sure anymore."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao I don‚Äôt feel bad for any of you fools who got on this subreddit in the past 6 months and piled onto this garbage. Downvote me if you will, but there was literally 0 mathematic reasoning behind any investment in this stock, and now you are all caught with your dicks in your hands. Shoulda stuck to GME"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"So basic take away is either pull your shares and invest in an ACTUAL long term growth play or if you still intend to squeeze something GME. Either way not financial advice I never once bought AMC because I knew it was a trap like, BB, NOK and RKT. Either GME squeezes or it doesn‚Äôt either way you are definitely paying upper management bonuses buying and holding AMC."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The greedy morons on top are trying to take your hard earned cash. This is what they do, the capitalists see a bunch of people get excited about their company and they pounce in to steal it all from you, laughing their asses off to the bank. It‚Äôll probably just be for a bigger bonus for the CEO. NO NEW SHARES"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I've actually been impressed GME didn't already do this.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know we are all dumb apes but THIS IS NOT DILUTION. yes it provides the ability to convert at a later date.  It‚Äôs an insurance policy in case of emergency.  I hope people short on this misinformation because that will mean more people will get trapped and make the squeeze that much greater.

Shorts  are trying to spread FUD. Fear uncertainty doubt."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Assumptions are like assholes, everyone has one, and they all stink.""

Do you really think that AMC CEO loves HF shorters so much, that he's doing everything he can to fuck over retail? It just doesnt fucking add up! While you idiots are playing checkers, these guys are playing 3d chess. 

If you guys are so concern about this, then use your fucking vote to influence the result. You guys are so fucking brain dead, bad and good news are spun to deceive you, everyone  has their own agenda, so it's crucial that you do your own DD, OR you all will keep falling for idiots claiming the sky is falling constantly.

Things to consider:

Why would someone who has shares on AMC claim they'll publicly dump it asap because of this news? Would inducing panic a good idea before that person dumps his shares? Why is this news being spread around like crazy like the CEO's bonus?"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Aren't Class A shares not publicly traded. How is there dilution? They are more reserved for board member not retail investors. Correct me if am wrong.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Boggles my mind that people thought AMC was a good play.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The company lost money before the pandemic, during the pandemic and likely more after the pandemic. They even issued junk bonds. I'm sure this company will be around in the future, but at some smaller capacity. I would not doubt that one day the debt holders own it for 20c on the dollar. I'm not sure of the debt/equity ratio. These are a bit out of date:  [AMC Entertainment Holdings Financial Ratios for Analysis 2011-2021 | AMC | MacroTrends](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMC/amc-entertainment-holdings/financial-ratios)  ... it was 4:1 .. but they have made so many changes, who knows. Once they have a trillion shares outstanding then we all have a cause for concern :) I have no holdings and have day traded it and the odd time held overnight. I'm too scared to buy and hold so I'll miss out if it rockets."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"\#1 is completely normal. The share count increased when the bonds were converted. No company ever wants to be in a position with no more available shares for issuance. Since new shares can only be issued through annual meeting votes, companies always err on having plenty of potential shares authorized. This is purely ""authority to issue"" not actual issuance."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"My dudes, you get that with a GA meeting, owners will have to do a recall of the shares that are now borrowed in Market, right? And the public offering from the companies treasury will be done only after the recall of said shares? This might be the best thing that happens to the AMC retail investor."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Alot of paper handed bitches in this sub now
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmfao it makes sense. You retards just keep buying and by doing this, the price per share will tank, meaning more people will buy, and itll just keep netting amc more and more money.

You should truly go broke if you think amc is a sound investment"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"We need a better break down of this, everyone should wait before we vote, as apes we shroud all vote together"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"VOTE NO

vote no to new shares, we just need to squeeze the stock. this will fuck over the squeeze"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah this is pretty obviously a ‚Äúpoison pill‚Äù style tactic, and/or corporate control protection. They don‚Äôt want to issue stock and suddenly some group take over majority control.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,#6 sounds rad. Sounds like the value play to me.

I don't beleive that any issuance of anything would be in common stocks favor tbh."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Standard annual meeting stuff.  No need for concern
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Non of this makes sense and it wouldn't be happening if insider ownership wasn't only 3%.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok guys, we have to Understand that we want short squeze, they want to survive. We got diff targets"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd like a little help understanding; the voting choices specify that they'd give out more Class A shares, which according to investopedia are not available to the public, and can't be traded by the share holders. 

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/classashares.asp

Meanwhile retail investors (most of us) hold Class B shares. 

Am I correct so far? So giving out more shares would dilute it... but how is it affected if the shares aren't public? Are they able to decide to suddenly make them public?

I literally started a week and some change ago so I'm still figuring this out. I think the instant impulse is to vote no to all and that CEOs just want to give themselves a bigger paycheck but the nature of the shares gives me pause."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I got an email about this as well
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Real mixed on this and I did vote against it. When a company stock price goes up that does NOTHING for the actual company. All the shares have already been sold. AMC needs to raise more money. They are doing this by releasing additional stock into the market. This does two things, dilutes the existing stock and also gives capital to the company. For short term holding, the stock price will go down but in the long, it *might* come back depending on how the company is doing. Without raising additional capital, they might be at risk of bankruptcy. Anyone here ever been in a stock when that company announced bankruptcy? It‚Äôs a fucking bloodbath.

AMC obviously needs money to keep going. They are just starting to come out of all this bullshit."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I got the email to vote on this today too
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Class A shares are not sold to the public. 

No dilution ."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"AMC is on it's way to a 5th week of uptrend 

This won't happen and if it does it will in May... 2 months away... just sell before 

But it won't happen."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This was talked about 3 weeks ago. You are actually the one promoting fuckery. But it's ok it just means you know what's coming. üòÅ desperation move. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Old news you shill
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is good for us!

In order to increase the upper limit of rights, all shares must be. This is a legal way to catch Hedgie. When all the stocks are on balance and have pulled out more stocks than are being sold, Hedgies will need to buy stocks to cover all of the stocks they sold short. Will the price be what we want to sell ... $ 100, $ 500, $ 1000, $ 2000, $ 10,000 ??"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The ability to maintain corporate control makes logical sense... papa Aaron believes this is going to the moon and when shitadel is forced to buy back all their corrupt shares we do not want them as a majority shareholder.  I also believe that if this passes for said reason we‚Äôre going to get one shot to go to the moon!  It may squeeze over a couple days when it does but we must hold until we reach out destination.  With that amount of possible dilution it doesn‚Äôt seem likely we‚Äôd have a wash rinse repeat scenario like our brothers in gme??? Amc2008.01 ü¶çüöÄüåù
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, did the shorts get in cahoots with AMC saying we need real shares instead of these synthetic shares, when you ‚Äúhand them out‚Äù can we buy them for current rate first and then produce them to the market? 

The higher ups get their shorts covered by a portion of these shares and pay only marginally more for them than a squeeze, and they pay AMC a kick back. 

Is that possible?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can only laugh because many of us have been saying these things for a while now. AMC and GME have some things in common and some common enemies but are not the same. GME has a once in a blue moon visionary guiding us. AMC is run by the old rich white dudes that probably rub elbows and other body parts with other old rich white dudes.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7fc7l/comment/grbrerv"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like they want a lot of capital to expand or pivot. If you are truly invested in them for the long term you probably understand this needs to happen. If you are a trader this is a terrifying proposal.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So a stop loss order for me if it goes below $11.50...  I guess Fidelity made a bad move investing those millions at $13.26 per share.. this whole play for me was heads I win tails I don‚Äôt lose much
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't we trade class B shares not A? There is a difference right? This shouldn't effect the market price of shares.  Or i could be wrong. I don't know.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Kann das jemand √ºbersetzten?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe they are hoping it squeezes by then to capitalize on the price increase.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Looks like AMC is about to issue 500 million shares. If they can do that at a price of $10 per shares, that will be 5 billion for the company and they should be able to pay off all their debt. In effect, they have a chance to swap debt holder for equity holders."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tin foil hat theory time!

SLGG is going to acquire AMC. GME will acquire SLGG.

AMC is intentionally driving retail into GME to trigger the MOASS and to make the subsequent acquisitions less costly."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'll also add that things that are in the best short-term interest of the executive staff aren't always in the best long term interest of the shareholders, or the short term interest of the shareholders for that matter.

Maybe AMC is thinking about a long term plan and maybe AMC is thinking about how to get as many bonuses to executives as possible. Maybe they're concerned about a takeover and maybe they're thinking about how to get as many bonuses to executives as possible."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It should also be noted that heavily shorted stocks often have difficulties coming to a quorum when it comes to shareholder votes. These situations often put companies in a predicament where they can‚Äôt govern themselves.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Even if a poison pill, that is not beneficiary to our interest and should be voted against. 

I think you are misunderstanding the ramifications of allowing a board to dilute shareholders."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am not going to shit on $AMC, but I sure get tired of all this dilution at shareholder expense and $AMC is not the only company doing it (see $NNDM). 
I do like the fact company looks like it was saved by retail and they were to eliminate a lot of debt,  just no more share dilution as execs taking fat ass bonuses IMHO. 
Appreciate $GME not doing this frankly. I have been in and out of it and plan on getting back in at some point. 
Also nice when companies BUY back their shares too. 
Good luck retards!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are wrong. Clearly says 500M new shares will be issued and then 35M more for compensation plans.

Edit: 35M are reserved from the total for compensation plans."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It has a effect on everything don‚Äôt be stubborn
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,oops I said no on both... ape must learn to read first
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Ape like this explanation. You mind if I copy this text so other apes can understand/ comment on shill fear mongering posts.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Wouldnt a recount be the outcome? Therefore squeeze?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for the clarification.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The excuse is always in the comments
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way üíéü§≤üíé

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Their company is cooked, they are creating their failure plan and golden parachute."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"And what exactly stops them from passing a board resolution on May 31 issuing all 500m new shares?

We authorize it they exercise it. Just a question of when. Companies don‚Äôt ask for a permission to do something if they don‚Äôt expect to act on it."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I have similar built into my S Corp (not publicly traded but can never start too early). This definitely read as a Poison Pill style addition

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"People don't seem to remember that Friday had a massive sell wall at 14$. Someone is unloading a lot of stock at 14$. Could be that the HF's on GME are trying to get out of AMC with a profit to fight better in GME. A month ago AMC and GME's stock had a huge correlation. HF's were clearly shorting AMC and GME together. It may be that the HF's bought off the CEO which is where he got his ""bonus""."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You are reading it wrong. All employee issued. No market issued. No dilution. Scare tactic. Read full SEC disclosure.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"""But we saved them!""

No, they got a $1Billion working capital loan to help them pay their rent because they were about to go bankrupt.  That is not a good sign, first of all, and second, it's the only real reason the stock rallied."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Good thing GME is built different.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Selling soon, tbh most of this investment is ppl rallying together. Truth is covid or not movie theatre revenues were down pre pandemic. It‚Äôs a dying business mode IMO"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Actual retard here. What‚Äôs this mean?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,mmm can you remind me?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't get destroy by the cult .... they do not like this type of comments
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I have been SAYING THIS FOR **WEEKS**
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn, pigs without honor what a surprise"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So withdraw

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It sounds like they're going to dilute the share price by issuing more shares?(500 million more)...that would kinda suck. I guess in an effort to attract.more investors? Not sure. If that's the case, you just have to wait a little longer for the price to go up and past what u bought for. How much time do u have left...to live?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're about to get fucked, in the bad way."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Completely different scenario, but yea, Daddy RC wouldn't do us dirty like that. He doesn't need to. I don't think he'd ever dream of helping the HFs like that."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Perhaps hold off on that until after the earnings call. Anything can happen there.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Preach the word pastor ape
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"AMC is broke as fuck, GME is not."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because they legally cant since theyre close to earnings, there are rules about that. I guess you never heard about how many shares gamestop shelved to do this exact same thing after earnings lol. Its a smart move, you retards helped stop amc from going broke, isnt that what this stupid ‚Äòmovement‚Äô was all about? The friends you made along the way? Gme will do this to you too the second they‚Äôre legally allowed to, they wouldnt have shelved the shares otherwise.

https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-20-312781/"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They most likely will. Roughly 80% chance of that happening
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Seriously why don't the new shareholders vote?? You have all this time to post DD and spam comment threads.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Assumptions are like assholes, everyone has one, and they all stink.""

Do you really think that AMC CEO loves HF shorters so much, that he's doing everything he can to fuck over retail? It just doesnt fucking add up! While you idiots are playing checkers, these guys are playing 3d chess. 

If you guys are so concern about this, then use your fucking vote to influence the result. You guys are so fucking brain dead, bad and good news are spun to deceive you, everyone  has their own agenda, so it's crucial that you do your own DD, OR you all will keep falling for idiots claiming the sky is falling constantly.

Things to consider:

Why would someone who has shares on AMC claim they'll publicly dump it asap because of this news? Would inducing panic a good idea before that person dumps his shares? Why is this news being spread around like crazy like the CEO's bonus?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You are reading it wrong. All employee issued. No market issued. No dilution. Scare tactic. Read full SEC disclosure.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Mutual funds and insiders control the votes...
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You said it's a bad idea, and I agreed back in November when they did the exact same thing, diluting class A shares by adding 100% of available shares. And then the stock skyrocketed? Who knows now right?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"These votes are symbolic. The big boys are already on board, probably achieved quorum and can pass what ever they want."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You forgot to add ""This is no financial advice"", and considering you do not comprehend what is being said on that document, you should REALLY add that disclaimer. I suggest you leave the DD or interpretation of big worded documents to people who understand what they mean, you more than likely don't hold more than 10 if any shares of AMC, but yet you are here pretending to know what is going on causing creating panic over nothing. There won't be any dilution even if ""massivE"" number of shares were added, I would explain why but after reading your post I doubt you would understand unless it is explain with apples."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Learn what a class A share is then open your mouth
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Selling AMC, buying more GME so im still in the game ;)"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They have a viral movement behind them and instead of backing the people who believe in them they are going to take profits.  I've been questioning the AMC hype for a couple weeks now and at this point I'm convinced there's nothing here.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,More like $14 becomes $3. Because everyone panic sells. And rightly so.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,GME was (and is) always the real play anyway.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Means sell ur amc and gtfo before holding bags
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Vote yes ape lose money
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"No.  The shares just have to be identified, they don't have to actually hold them."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"As I understand it, if you loan your share out to a short seller, you lose your voting rights.  Only people who are holding onto actual shares in cash accounts (i.e. the 'holder of record') have voting rights.  I believe that if you have shares in a margin account that HAVEN'T been loaned out, your broker has the voting rights associated with those shares."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I heard someone talking about that, which means is a good thing for the squeeze because the suits will have to cover to get real share to the brokers"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Since the majority stakeholder in their shares has changed, they have to decide who the board of directors will be, if it will continue under the current leadership or if they will elect new board members. Consider that up until recently, a Chinese firm held a majority stake in AMC, and now it's wall st. investors. They now hold the power to elect new CEO's and etc.  


Corporate shakedowns happen like this all the time when shares change hands so drastically. AMC has new owners. There may or may not be a change in leadership."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucked more than once too
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's ridiculously overpriced now. It was failing even before covid.

I'm just pissed I sold my AMC puts on Thursday or maybe it was Friday I forget."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,OK but we can agree it is definitively bad if you‚Äôre looking for a short term squeeze.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The loss porn if any of the WSB noobs wanna post it is going to be LIKE HARDCORE BBC BUKKAKE
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"What publicly traded company and say that s&p 500 or as a market cap over a billion, has diluted stockholders by 100%, doubling the number of shares available?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,LOL FUCK OFF sorry but that is just utter DELUSION if you don't think this is AWFUL news for the share holder
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Reeeeeee confirmation bias reeee big word type!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Massive sale
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,From the sound of the document even if in a worst-case this were to dilute the share we won't see anything till at least late May gives AMC apes time to see where the stock goes first.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You are a pretty retard
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm retarded and don't like share shenanigans I'm dumping it
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They would have to issue all shares at current price to eliminate debt. But would greatly help the company regardless
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,">I voted against on everything just to make sure.

Not necessarily the best decision.  They need the cash to survive.  If they go bankrupt you're fucked."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,By doubling the available shares. Holy cow! That‚Äôs serious dilution.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What will that do to the price of stocks?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Does this shock anyone? Gme is coming too
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Race you to it, monday premarket for me"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy into GME afterwards, all you AMC apes can help GME squoze the squeeze!!!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Same
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the thing is it's a right not an obligation and it's not happening until May. There were an insane amount of shorts involved Friday to stop it from crossing $14.00. You'd be insane to fall for this FUD and cashout now, wait until closer to the shareholder meeting if that's the reason."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,If a company sells new shares the company gets money (and yes existing shares are diluted).
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You should have received an email from your broker
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It's not a split
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Ape confused. Isn't printing more shares going to cause inflation? For share price. Ape needs real clarification.ü§îü¶çü¶ç
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also a smart move by the company. You buying shares does NOT help the company. It raises the share price which give the company access to capital either through loans or share offerings. 

If you ran a company that was very close to bankruptcy just 6 months ago and were given an opportunity to raise a couple billion dollars to keep the company afloat a couple years while you try to turn things around, wouldn‚Äôt that make sense? 

Long term holders aren‚Äôt against this dilution, it‚Äôs us traders that do. For long term investors if they offered shares to raise $2B the company real value is now $2B higher and it‚Äôs a lot more stable of a company than it was even 2 years ago."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs true for other companies.  AMC does it the opposite way, with A shares being the publicly traded ‚Äúcommon‚Äù stock.  The vote proposal clearly states these are the common shares for public market trading."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Most people don't vote, big shareholders who stand to benefit from the bonuses of raised capital vote yes, so it'll pass"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,By doubling the shares you might get 50% of the stock value now or 0% of the stock if they go bankrupt from not paying off their massive load of debt.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let me stop u there, Amazon will never buy AMC, the people shilling that are shilling a pipe dream"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol this is fucking hilarious
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I think that could be a possibility.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its a proposal for May 4th, how is that related to when the bonds were converted back then"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop saying hedgies. Jesus.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You don't seem to understand wallstreet or bets, let alone wallstreetbets"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Too many fucktards and I am no sheep. I vote for me. If others vote same and prosper good for them but I vote for me.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs not true anymore. The major voting shares can be in any class now.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know almost nothing about trading but I do know what you just said is 100% wrong. 

Unless you‚Äôve a stupid definition of ‚Äúsold‚Äù or ‚Äúpublic‚Äù"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh my apologies for not living on a WSB forum 24/7. My bad. And I guess asking a question is misinformation, got it."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"New news to me, just received the email this morning. Not everyone trying to inform themselves here is a shill, you cult member. I probably own more AMC shares than you."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,are you a bot? fucking retard
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean no on 1 and 5
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They are probably also thinking about how to get as many bonuses to executives as possible.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs also definitely true. AMC has a history of doing this. In the last squeeze they took the opportunity to sell more shares and instantly gave millions worth of bonuses to the CEO and other executives. Just because they have a good opportunity doesn‚Äôt mean they won‚Äôt squander it for greed.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,agreed. As movie makers can buy theaters and are making contracts with HBO for release they are thinking about how to get as many bonuses to executives as possible with our bananas
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"[This seems relevant.](https://www.bloombergquint.com/onweb/amc-ceo-pay-rose-to-21-million-in-2020-as-covid-ravaged-cinemas) Seems kinda strange that a CEO's pay would increase in the middle of a global pandemic that shut down the movie theater industry almost entirely, but what do I know?

I know a lot of people like the stock etc and more power to em but their CEO seems like a shithead (including his response to COVID with attempts to reopen) and there's little I find to like about how they run their business."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"That is incorrect. It‚Äôs half a billion (doubling the current outstanding) class A common stock which is their on the market shares. The employee issue shares is only the 35 million referenced in #5. It would essentially be enabling the company to issue an additional 500 million shares and reserve 20 million of those new shares to give out as EIP (it states it is increasing their EIP to 35 million, currently it is 15 million so only 20 million is able to be set aside)"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Both Class A and Class B are the same functionally on the market. Both are the shares that retail trades with. The only designation between Class A and B is the amount of voting rights attributed to each share.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"No they don‚Äôt. This isn‚Äôt a stock split it‚Äôs a share dilution. It instantly decreases the value of the stock, which has a negative effect on calls"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I can't even read the full Wendy's menu
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Think of it like a long menu with allergy warnings.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This used to be a joke but 90% of the people here don't even know how to find the investor relations page of the companies they own.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a *Gamestop*."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Read the Jan board doc and the Sec filing and you‚Äôll understand. This has no impact on the squeeze.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agree with you, tbh I am holding $NNDM as well and was quite disgusted with the repeated share offering every 2 weeks when the price was rising.

I am still holding $NNDM because there is still potential if the CEO use the cash to buy some solid company but we will see.

For $AMC case seems like the CEO care more about their bonus then the share holder, it seems to me that they are just using share holder to get cash and try to stay alive for as long as possible and getting pay. 

\#Disclaimer: Just my feeling and opinion"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,To be fair the CFO of GME wanted to issue more shares n got shitcanned.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You need to read the filing, they state they won‚Äôt let this have a dilution affect. It‚Äôs for new controlled issue. Say you‚Äôre a friendly company looking to take over. You tell them you‚Äôll sell them 300M shares to ensure a 50%+ stake. They agree on the price and send you the money when you give them the shares. You and I are unaffected."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol GME cant do it until after ER. Too many regulatory hurdles. You better believe they will though. Book it.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Doesn‚Äôt say the 35M are additional
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Jan 28 account
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,January 28th account
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Well the effect it has this year is if we don‚Äôt understand and sell. And you better believe the hedges think this too. We had a lot of discussions here two weeks ago when the sec filing occurred and it seemed people started to understand but somehow now many people are being misled.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,By all means. Just encourage own DD
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"And a hard drop in price. Not to mention a much larger float, making the squeeze a near impossibility."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They are selling 500M shares how does that help a squeeze?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I try. I read sec filings all the time and know the public emails vs complex sec filings tell different stories.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah surprised how many hedgies are on this post trying to get people to sell
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,üòÇ yeah nope
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Logic stops it.  We knew about these shares in January
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great point. And I do not trust the amc ceo as far as I could throw his ass. Just having the proposal rn is sus af! They have shares they can release rn if they choose to, can‚Äôt remember the number but asking for more now?? Umm, no.. Also watched Trey read it a little while ago. It‚Äôs vague, looks like no acquisition in play either. Idk..."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So what happens when employees sell them?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,source to full SEC disclosure?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol what?

Are you having a giggle fam?

Read the bloody document again. It's literally the first fucking proposal. AMC bots are on another planet... in their heads."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly...and ngl, I dont think they will put the money to good use."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs the truth, ppl rallied in hopes to make buck like ppl did with GME. People can sit here and say it‚Äôs is vs the HF etc. Truth is they don‚Äôt give a fuck. The CEO paying himself a bonus gives you all the info you need!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,they were already doing shitty before covid.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You are reading it wrong. All employee issued. No market issued. No dilution. Scare tactic. Read full SEC disclosure.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Stock price will half.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"They are issuing more shares which dilutes the value of all the shares we bought. Basically hurts us retail folk.

What these companies SHOULD be doing is fucking with shortsellers by issuing special dividends or buying back shares. RKT did that."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I like to talk shit but sometimes a little bit of truth is good too.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They attacked me today when I posted this saying this is months old but Fidelity emailed it to me this morning LOL
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"What would you have done? Push the company into further debt and increase your odds of bankruptcy, or tap into the huge equity build up that came out of nowhere?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"??????

WE TOLD YOU THEY WOULD DO THIS"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah maybe they should run their company into the ground so a bunch of fucking dipshits on the internet can keep posting memes.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,In an effort to get more money into the hands of execs...
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"They raised enough capital to last to early next year, even if they have a busy ass summer. They are so upside-down on debt, that even a blow out year might not save them. This is why the stock was trading at $2.00 before they issues shares this year. The hype on the stock is disconnected from reality."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It's to avoid bankruptcy
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,RC has no control over that retard
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You know gamestop has a ton of shares shelved to do this exact same thing right? The only reason they havent yet is because you cant do the offering too close before earnings, so once they put out their er report keep your eyes peeled for the exact same news lol

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It says that the shares will be authorized but not issued. However, they could change their mind the next week and just issue them without warning or shareholder vote. As far as the hostile takeover goes, the document states that it will help prevent it but that is not what their objective is for this offering. So in other words they intend to use it to raise money at some point in the future but not right away. That doesn't help our cause at all. In fact, if you have tens of millions of dollars to give to your directors as bonuses, then you don't need to dilute your shares and screw over the people who got you out. I'm voting NO."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It skyrocketed because reddit dogpiled into it. It's real price has not skyrocketed,  it's current price is pretty obviously inflated and not due to business decisions."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The stock skyrocketed because those ""hedgies"" you despise have been absolutely hammering the SHIT out of other subreddits with shills, fake hype and misinformation. This one too. You can literally track it over time. 

A good data scientist would quickly recognise organic sentiment to AMC against unnatural. But... they demand 250k salaries so"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought at $14.50 in early January. Waiting for it to hit that price before dumping everything.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Anyone who wants to vote has to have a real share, but if there are enough people who don't want to vote they can move the real shares of the people who do and the loaned shares to the people who don't"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"They literally sold 45M shares for 600M debt during the height of the peak. They fucked with you retards during the peak and you are still trying to ""save"" it."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Overpriced, not really. The industry was falling pre-covid due to a lack of consumer interest. Consumers can be home and have a similar experience. Going to the theatres was only for a cinematic experience of really good movies.

If companies like AMC allowed indie moviemakers to screen their movie on their locations for a relatively small fee, they would easily grow as a company.

With shit like this, they will drop in value, but the post-covid boom will still be worth the investment. So sell now for a profit, wait for the price to inevitably tank, buy back before they open businesses post-covid and profit off the boom.

There is money to be made, but the shares are not worth holding long term."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dillution in the sense of devaluing individual stock price? Yes of course. What I'm trying to preach is to do your own DD.

 There is a bunch of manipulation going on right now. People need to chill and really read what they have available to them. This voting thing is essentially a multiple choice test. 

Google the words, spend a day doing some good ol fashioned DD.  

Where is the company going? What was happening before the craze took off and individual stock holders became important enough to be included in an important business decision?  Why would all these business moves be happening....now? Meetings on the 4th? I got some work to do.

Do some proper DD. Make your own decisions when voting. I don't want to speculate openly ya know? Too soon."

Do you really think that AMC CEO loves HF shorters so much, that he's doing everything he can to fuck over retail? It just doesnt fucking add up! While you idiots are playing checkers, these guys are playing 3d chess. 

If you guys are so concern about this, then use your fucking vote to influence the result. You guys are so fucking brain dead, bad and good news are spun to deceive you, everyone  has their own agenda, so it's crucial that you do your own DD, OR you all will keep falling for idiots claiming the sky is falling constantly.

Things to consider:

Why would someone who has shares on AMC claim they'll publicly dump it asap because of this news? Would inducing panic a good idea before that person dumps his shares? Why is this news being spread around like crazy like the CEO's bonus?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs great to have him out the door.

Increasing the number of shares they can issue doesn‚Äôt mean they will immediately sell more stock, it just provides them with more flexibility. But it would be dilutive."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, they don't state that they won't. Where in the fuck do you perceive that they put in a clause for a standard filing that they will ABSOLUTELY NOT issue common shares for public sale. No company puts that in those documents. It states the potential to issue new Class A won't have immediate effect. But, this says nothing about in the future after the lockup period. It gives the company the option without shareholder voting to publicly sale the same Class A common that other shareholders retain for capital seeking purposes. If the company needs capital in the future, then there are other risks that they and major shareholders can take on for the reward. This is the least risky option to the company and major shareholders. But at the expense of public share price reduction through dilution. It's not necessary. Vote against."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME raising $100M by issuing new shares at $200/share is--without any doubt--in the best interest of long-term shareholders.  That's the board's responsibility, not to support the potential of a short-term squeeze.  With that said, it's probably also conducive to a squeeze, as it substantially reduces the probability of bankruptcy, thereby disabling part of the short thesis."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They have zero incentive to do that.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It would be the logical move to make. They plan to make a transition play which will require a ton of capital. A share offering when their market value has risen significantly and been sustained presents a perfect opportunity for that. They could go through traditional lenders but since they already have a bleeding business model and their transition isn‚Äôt a proof of concept yet it would be harder to get traditional loans. It‚Äôs just speculation, but I as a shareholder am expecting it to happen"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So can I assume your next move is to dump AMC asswank?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"There track record is getting the authority to issue and then immediately issuing new shares. They had 106 million shares in August they now have over 460 million. They will issue new shares as fast as they can once approved.

They will probably set a price target of 9 or 10 dollars, and then keep issuing shares as long as the price is above that and then hold off if it dips below hoping that it bounces back. if it doesn't bounce back they'll probably just lower the price estimate and keep grinding out new shares as the price falls.

They look at it as if the company has lots of money, they can issue lots of bonuses. Nobody gets bonuses if there's no money available.

Just look at their track record over the last 8 months to see the fundamentals of the company don't matter, when they issue shares and get them sold they have money they pay it out.

It also looks like they're going to issue shares to their higher ups, just like the bonuses, and they need more authorized to do that with."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs not just double. That‚Äôs triple. That would make each share worth a third it‚Äôs current value if introduced.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Um except AAPL has a boatload of cash and has been buying back shares for years and AMC needs cash and has sold 300M new shares to the market in the last year.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,AAPL and AMC have two different management. AMC was a failing business pre pandemic for a reason.... because poor management. AMC wasn‚Äôt being managed by Steve Jobs or Tim Cook. You couldn‚Äôt even tell us who is their CEO without googling it.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So AMC needs to...where AAPL doesn‚Äôt...got it.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Not to pick too much on another meme stock. But look at sndl. There‚Äôs a company that has a track record of issuing more shares.

Giving fat bonuses is not at all inconsistent with bankruptcy. Don't pay your debts, pay yourselves and GTFO.  Lol.

I hope they survive, but it's a risky play and they need the flexibility to raise funds if they want to adapt and be viable in the future."

I'm going to AMC stock was worth three or four dollars a share, they were only 106 million, through dilution they have more than quadrupled that 106 million already, and then spent the vast majority (or will spend staying afloat) of that money for no increased value.

They did retire debt,  but I believe all of that was automatic through stock sale."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This. The CEO has proved with his bonus from the mini squeeze that his interests do not align with either the company or the shareholders. To claim that you deserve credit for an internet forum discovering that Hedge Funds are betting that you'll go bankrupt is being absurd.

There is bound to be someone or some fund who will sell as the risk is higher now which will lower the price because of this news. But when the actual shares do hit the market, it will be a big hit still on top of it. It‚Äôs a 50% dilution. They are doubling the amount of shares available which would cut the share price in half (at current rates that would put it around $7ish). As always, it‚Äôs not a guarantee to drop that smoothly since there‚Äôs other factors involved (shorts and gamma squeeze), but a drop will most likely happen"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Both Class A and Class B are the same functionally on the market. Both are the shares that retail trades with. The only designation between Class A and B is the amount of voting rights attributed to each share.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Who said absolutly not. The sec filing says they are not immediately issuing new shares. This is wordage you don‚Äôt put in if you are going to. Ffs people.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not if you read the report. It‚Äôs their concern they are losing corporate control. Every major company holds back shares from the market to be held internally otherwise they lose control over their own company. To raise capital and avoid bankruptcy they were forced to put a few hundred million in the market that they otherwise were holding themselves. These shares already existed but weren‚Äôt available to be bought... didn‚Äôt dilute. Now they need the ability to create more shares to ensure they maintain control. This is also why they agreed with Wanda to convert.

Also, that 500m as I understand it is from class B stock. The Chinese investors, who historically held those shares, have **all** already pulled out.

Chinese investors literally have their fingers IN EVERY GOD DAMN PIE ON EARTH.

Why would they leave? Because it isn't profitable to stay, or they got given a package to get out.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You shouldn't be ""saving"" a company.

Nobody is ""saving"" Gamestop. I bought Gamestop because the stock could potentially be worth thousands in a few years behind RC. Gamestop doesn't need saving, pal.

It isn't your job to do shit for the company.

Get out the burning boat."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So why say stuff like ‚Äòrc wouldnt do us dirty like that‚Äô when hes not even the person in control of that? I just think its crazy to push this notion that GME wouldn‚Äôt do this when they‚Äôve clearly planned on it for months now.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre basically confirming what I said, they shelved the shares for that reason. I didnt say it would crash the stock (although it obviously wont help it) but he said they have no incentive to do so which is just fucking dumb, considering they clearly do and plan on it."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same with AMC, doesnt stop apes from getting mad about it. And I dont see how selling 100m is going to start the squeeze lol nobody thinks theyre going bankrupt now, and from my perspective the squeeze already came and past but you do you."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So? Doesnt mean they cant do it lol and RC‚Äôs support is not required.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Since when is a shitton of money *not* an incentive? Why would those people holding shares from when gme was a pennystock not capitalize on the squeeze? And of they had no incentive to do it why did they go shelf the shares so they could? Theres no other reason for them to have done it, and any other business in their shoes would do the same (for example look what post we‚Äôre commenting under). Also its not even up to your ‚Äòdaddy‚Äô lol."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-20-312781/

Then why‚Äôd they file this? They filed it when gme was $20 you think they arent going to sell now that its 10x that?! You‚Äôre fucking retarded if you think they filed that for no reason and have no incentive to gain from making a ton of money. Use your brain kiddo."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"RC ran CHWY as a very capital efficient business. He is a subject matter expert on how to do just that. 

Let‚Äôs not forget that GME is grossing incredible revenues and now, as we emerge from the pandemic and begin the new console cycle, these revenues will only get stronger.

Shareholder dilution is not needed. 

But I‚Äôm glad to hear that you, as a fellow hodler, have enough trust in management to tolerate it if it were to happen.

Cheers."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea let me take this valuable asset I have and dilute it by 500%, sounds like a GREAT idea. As much as I want to love AMC for what it meant to me in my youth, u gotta take emotion out of it.

When I see a CEO of a near bankrupt company take a 20mil bonus while every other aspect of the company is near death, or when I see a proposal to continue milking every ounce of support this company has received, I'm a cautious holder who's already sold 75% of my assets."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,someone should ban your stupid ass. feels over reals pussy bullshit
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yikes. Its not alot so I'm just gonna have to cut my losses instead of holding the bags indefinitely. Thanks for the heads up.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree. Set up the strike price at at least $ 2,000"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,True. No acquisition is happening either. No more shares.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"YOU APEs SHOULD ONLY BE LOYAL TO EACH OTHER, not to any company. We are here for TENDIES ONLY.

BUY CALLS and PUTS after your own DD. Dont be a bagholder while AMC CEO takes a nice big bonus"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was only making the point that authorized share increase is not immediate dilution nor anything imminent to worry or be concerned about. It's 100% normal course of business. If a company is going to dilute they're going to do it no matter what. Having a big spread between authorized and outstanding isnt a way to judge that risk. That said, we all know AMC is going to need cash to float the next 2-3 years. Unavoidable imo."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pennies dilute all the time. That's why they're pennies in the first place like 99% of the time. Not a big deal really as big money knows this and big money moves stock price over longer time scales. However, heavily diluted pennies will reverse split at some point. Sometimes that's a benefit but it's often a curse. Sndl will most likely reverse split at some point in the next year or 2. To get quality institutional funding, stocks trading around $1 have a serious handicap. Sndl might climb to 5+ as is but if it doesn't, a 10-1 reverse split or something like that is on the menu (again imho only)"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It was a simple math comparison. I chose apple because everyone on earth and mars knows the company. Not to draw similarities between the 2 company's health and mkt caps. There are probably 50 companies with similar mkt caps as AMC that have twice the authorized shares as they do outstanding. My point is valid.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"They will dilute first chance they get. Amc has been poorly run long before this and will continue to be.  Giving them more shares hurts those who are in for the ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù regardless of if you think it‚Äôll happen or not.  There is no way they are waiting til 2022 to issue shares.  

It also gives HF a date of a fire sale to scoop up. Pay interest til 2022 vs potentially forever."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao so just to be clear you actually have no actual evidence to support that belief yet felt compelled to comment that why? 

Genuinely curious, I dont want to label you as just another classic bear shill trying to desperately manipulate forum sentiment in your favour but without a shred of factual evidence it's hard to support your claim my friend"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,_Cries in ape_
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Now if it's voted on ppl could always vote against it but wtf.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah uh what

Why would I think about buying?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôll counter. They bought whole foods and stared looking into limited opening of brick and mortar stores for diversification. 

They are very bullish on Prime Video content and may want to move into theater space with their products to tap into that audience. 

Also, some awards don‚Äôt allow you to qualify for nominations if you don‚Äôt screen at theaters and we all know those awards are just another great marketing gimmick so they are missing out. 

All that said, I see the probability of Amazon buying AMC as very low and voted no on increasing the cap on share issuance. Also, if Amazon didn‚Äôt buy them when they were worth 2.4 or 5 or 8 per share why would they change their mind now?

If they do want our stock though they can buy it in the open market at a market price."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean congrats, but this aimless buying without much change in fundamentals is pretty braindead"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre vote won‚Äôt matter if everyone votes the opposite
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Where are you getting ifs and buts? It‚Äôs a definition lol
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You retard, they're obvjously trying to figure out how to get as many bonuses to executives as possibro."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Almost got me
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea tbh unless they announce any board changes I may just sell. This CEO is a joke
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,take my frosty upvote
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you ***sure*** this isnt an option adjustment triggering event? I wasnt aware that only splits could trigger an adjustment. That much dilusion seems like it would affect the price massively.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"So somebody comes along and buys half the float, and they issue more shares to prevent that, and that is somehow not against our interest?

How much are they paying you?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think that the management of AMC is looking just for themself, EIP plan usually are for employers but managemnt level of employer, a lot of things already done smell to me like they are trying to gain as much as possible from retail investement in the stock.  
at the moment I have not too many shares in AMC and I don't have already sold them but I'm starting to think that this could be the right time, I will gain just +30% but dunno if all this will be approved how the stock will goes...  
IMO AMC is no more a squuezing stock, to be clear I have also GME, BB, NAKD, NOK but I see more potential in those compared to AMC."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"CEO didn‚Äôt buy shares. He was awarded RSU. There‚Äôs a difference dumb ass. Voting for allowing the potential of new stock issuance is not beneficial to publicly traded shares. You obviously don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.

https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/own-disp?action=getissuer&CIK=0001411579"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Every SEC filing for the option to issue new shares has this verbiage. It gives the company the liberty to issue new shares without the need for shareholder approval for seeking capital. There are other means to seek capital that's less risky for publicly traded share price. It's not necessary and is not in retail's best interest. It is the least risky for the company and their major 5%+ shareholders. I say if they have a prosperous outlook for recovery, then let the company and major shareholders take on the added risk with debt from private investor capital."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know you‚Äôre trying to rationalize this, but if you take your blinders off and look at it for what it is, this means they now have more shares issued, this dilutes the base, they are taking advantage of the run up"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Couldn't they instead just buy back shares?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"With a catchy beat in the background and some fly-ass bitches in the music video. Also blunts. Lots of blunts, more blunts than rappers and fly-ass bitches."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn ahahahaaha.
Learn to read mate. Calm down.

Nevertheless AMC is down 70% on Monday morning"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Such an idiot ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Yeah sure citadel is my boss , idiot ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,No it is not. They are holding them in reserves and wont be made available for public anyways.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They can easily issue them in Q2 and Q3 of this year if the reopening doesn‚Äôt bring enough immediate revenue. Why would you vote for any share issuance now?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,F AMC.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The board plans on just plainly releasing additional shares to the market? Imma need a source on that one bro.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Basically, but pointing out that they cannot in fact dilute a ""ton"" as you mentioned. It will be a drop in the bucket..."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd like to point out that they filed that in December, and the situation has quite obviously changed greatly since then."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This filling was already huge unpopular by the board and would now almost certainly be weighed against the negative sentiment it would generate as a result.

The new ecommerce business model is also way less cash intensive  and they are likely able to generate the cash required from the uptick in cash flow over the next few quarters as a result of the new console cycle and recent media attention.

Your fucking retarded if you think they will risk the insanely positive sentiment right now from not only a major shareholder but also a large demographic of their intended customer base moving forward."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This kids are so fucking dumb, they can't even read. They think this company boards care for their feelings.


This is 1929 all over again."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"In traditional terms, when you dilute the asset, you're selling those shares and getting value for the company when you sell them, so save you started as a 1 billion company and you deleted your shares 100%, you'd be a 1 billion dollar company with 1 billion dollars in the bank which you can hopefully grow at the same or better rates than your original company. Here's the problem with AMC having a billion dollar a year cashburn, they don't have a reasonable expectation of being worth more after selling those shares, they're just going to burn a lot of their capital."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You need a hug? Sounds like you need a hug
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy a proper stock next time and good luck.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell on premarket if you can might get more for it that way
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed. I was simply putting the math out there.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes authorized doesn‚Äôt mean they will issue and it makes sense they want to up their authorized shares as they only have around 50M shares authorized but not issued which doesn‚Äôt provide them much flexibility.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They are in spiraling debt and suddenly want the ability to issue more shares. I think you'd have to be a bit naive to not consider that they are thinking about dilution to gain short term liquidity
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve been cursed by it in the past for sure. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"No it‚Äôs not.
Having an offering on hand to DOUBLE the shares is unheard of.
Especially while handing out ‚Äògenerous‚Äô executive bonuses.
You wouldn‚Äôt run your family business like that, therefore you shouldn‚Äôt run a public company like that.

Prove me wrong. Please do."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Smooth brains
They filed in December for 300 million shares..the stock was cheaper so the CFO didn't care to follow thru....gme rises late January....he is punished and fired for his mistake... companies can not file close to a report unless they issue preliminary earnings...as amc has constantly said bankruptcy.....

Smooth brains should put a couple things together...good luck"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt get the play for AMC, GME is the way"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why do you think it's aimless? My purchases were based on reopening, and potential plans for adapting to the new market (e.g., potential partnerships with certain streaming services)."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Your vote won't do shit for YOU if you just vote with a majority who may be fucktards. Think for yourself bud. Buy and sell based on your research or explain to your old lady why her and her boyfriend need to sell their house.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The only thing that is clearly defined in that is that A, B, C is just a way to differentiate between share types. The differences between share types vary greatly from company to company. That link gives examples. With face book B type have more voting power that A which is not a common thing. 

That link says that how A share is defined is set by each company"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Well keep this to yourself but I‚Äôve heard from a lot of higher up sources that they‚Äôre obviously trying to figure out how to get as many bonuses to executives as possible
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh jez. Company A wants to buy into controlling stake of AMC. AMC says yeah, ok. 300M share outta do it. I need $$ per share. Sold. Company A isn‚Äôt putting their shares on the market or they lose their controlling stake. Corporate action for maintaining control. More shares on market yes. Higher market cap yes. Minimal affect on dilution. No affect on squeeze as shares aren‚Äôt on being traded, they are being bought. But what do I know in the financial service industry. Not my first rodeo."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Same I agreed with you. Seems like they are trying to milk for more bonus and trying keep the company alive just so they can get pay.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,No this isn‚Äôt common wordage. I‚Äôve looked at some like SNDL that put immediately in the filing. Boilerplate specifies now or later on terms.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,If you expect the squeeze to happen in 2022 then yeah it could stop it. For me and I suspect everyone else we are expecting the squeeze within weeks or organic growth to $25ish if not.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Um no, they have no money. They just SOLD 230M new shares in January."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Not with the price we have pushed now. Probably down the road yes.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I dont care about Monday I wont sell till you cucks buy back. Short it some more if you have to pay me more later. Those are IOUs.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"
""The company shall have the authority to issue...""

35 M from those 500 will be reserved for bonus yes.... Still issued and given out to people."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They won‚Äôt. They established the idea in January. They are just keeping their options open for 2022.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I guess thats kinda arguing over semantics then, my main point was that gme clearly has an incentive and will do this to apes too as soon as theyre legally able to, and that RC isnt the person in charge of that decision."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"They will, thats why they shelved them. Sorry if that makes you sad."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey I at least felt bad for the people in the great depression lol, Im going to be watching gme‚Äôs earnings with some drinks and popcorn."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,you're in the wrong sub if your pussy's getting sore over someone calling out a shit company.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I 100% agree. All I was originally trying to say was that an increase in auth shares isnt immediate dilution like the OP thought. At the mkt dilution is coming for sure. When and how much is a future disco. Shareholders better hope they dont do a convertible note deal though. While those deals defer the actual dilution, note holders almost always open short arbitage positions to hedge the notes. This can deflate share price and also raises debt service. I was in a spec bio trade in 2018-19 with VSTM. The second they announced the convertible note deal I sold. Price didnt stop falling for months after I sold. It wasnt all due to the note deal but some of it def was. I hate those deals"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I generally only trade pennies. Like 1-30 days tops. I only invest in stocks with a profitable future. Many pennies are debt zombies. If a company cant support itself with cashflow basically ever, it's a bad investment prone to dilution and depreciation. Anytime I'm in a penny that runs hard I immediately sell. Getting out when the final fomo momo traders are entering is the best time like 95% of the time."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They're not doing a 500M offering. They're just increasing the authorized shares of the company. Theoretically they could sell 500M shares and dilute all at once but the chance of that happening is close to zero. This change to the company is a long term thing. It opens up future funding for years.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you! That actually helps me see your side of the arguement and while I agree the December 8th S-3ASR filing could he a potential concern the subsequent 8-k filing the same day for $100 million was not viewed favorably by shareholders or the board.

It is far more likely in my opinion that this filing was an unpopular move by the CFO, and coupled with his inability to shed excess lease obligations from the balance sheet that led to his eventual 'resignation'.

Looking at the cited risk factors in their 8-k filing, they dont commit to actually issuing any and simply state that they will use any cash generated as basically working capital and to fund their new ecommerce pivot. Based in Ryan Cohens chewy interviews his ecommerce model is not capital intensive at all and riding the high of the new console cycle and global publicity I feel like they should generate more than enough short term capital to make this transition without needing to issue any of the shelf offing.

Ryan Cohen cancelling the offering would also be a huge statement for the company, and would be hugely favored by their enormous retail shareholder base who also happen to be a large part of their customer base as well.

In my opinion it just doesnt make sense for them to raise capital right now and fuck over their public image on the brink of an attempted business pivot. I think robinhood basically showed what happens when you fuck over your customers and are probably going to lose out on billions with their ipo here soon."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the thing the people that are in amc for the squeeze will vote against dilution, the people that in amc for the long term will vote for share dilution, knowing what everyone is voting is always helpful, either way I‚Äôm ok, I won‚Äôt go broke if amc is a bust, I‚Äôll hold it no matter what"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Right and with AMC it‚Äôs been said these class A shares would not effect public shares
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre all entitled to your opinion but after hours of dd and crunching numbers it has become extremely yet somewhat subtlety obvious that they‚Äôre trying to figure out how to get as many bonuses to executives as possible.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That's not how that works...
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It's common verbiage for the option to issue new shares for capital seeking requirements deemed necessary by the company. There are other means to raise capital through debt and private investor capital by way of other share class structures. This is the lowest risk option to the company and major shareholders that have 5%+ holdings. It passes on the most risk to publicly traded share prices which is retail.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre high if you think the squeeze can happen with how big the float is right now. And Its about to get a lot bigger. Join the GME train while you still have money. They won‚Äôt fuck over their customers like AMC.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"$308.3M in cash as of last quarterly balance sheet. They have cash, but more shares means more cash"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Then what's preventing them from waiting? Is this something that needs to be done immediately? If not, I would wait. Also I would be in support of proposal #5 where they are giving employees shares."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yikes dude you have a hedgie hate boner for AMC. Go get some air buddy, I will buy more next week before the hedge funds are forced to buy back. You literally confirmed what I said."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do ""this"" to apes is the point people disagree with you on. What do you mean by ""this""? 

Tesla issued 1% more shares and their stock went up. Issuing 500k new shares or even 2% new shares will not crater gme stock and might actually increase their value by loading their balance sheet with cash. 

Gme will not do ""this"" to apes unless your definition of ""this"" is just sell any amount of shares. If your definition of ""this"" is ""completely fuck over and dilute the shareholders tremendously"" then gme won't be doing ""this"" any time soon."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jesus this is your first rodeo eh kid...

Shelf offering is fucking fantastic and they have up to 3 years to sell them. If only there was an event coming up that could significantly increase the share price well beyond the current market price where shares would be dare I say *forced* to be purchased at whatever price they are trading at... ü§îü§îü§îü§î

Also RC is insanely bullish on the long term price and this will give them the flexibility to generate additional revenue freely over the next few years instead of diluting the shares all at once.

Sorry if that makes you confused and angry üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Me too lol. I fear for brokers. Robinhood is going down with this retards.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"And yet here you are having to go on an alt after you were called out for being an ignorant fool and lacking 1 braincell and probably a chromosome to understand what was being said in a document, I might also add that document was out 2-3 weeks ago and had already been discussed. Am I in the wrong sub or are you in the wrong sub?, It looks to me like the sub is mostly about said ""shit company"" and people buying the stock. I hope you are getting paid overtime for your failed attemtps at destabilizing a sub."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Point me to a company which has, even if it‚Äôs on the shelf, an offer for its whole share count.

Please do, I‚Äôm genuinely interested.

Shareholder dilution is not a desirable measure and should be done to the absolute necessary minimum."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately I disagree this is the best time ever!! Ever!!  The stock is at an insane parabolic nose bleed price..the company used to make loads of cashz pay dividends and in the golden years it was 60...now junk bonds... horrible leases declining sales 7 years in a row... negative cash flow....this is exactly when to immediately issue...in fact if they don't print at least 30 million after this report the new cfo should be fired immediately...the company needs this cash ..... immediately.... especially with parabolic prices...it doesn't matter what reddit or wallstreetbets thinks....they must stay in business and fund ventures somehow....

And if you think it's from the business that just makes me laugh.... though the 4th quarter will be profitable as it should it's video games....it's a nose dive any other time...get real....

Just because you made money on the stock or love the stock....the company got 0 from it until a capital raise...we will see shortly"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or decide for YOURSELF if you are long, squeeze or cash out."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Wrong-o.  Just go back and read the vote proposal.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, this is the only correct thing you have said ‚Äúit‚Äôs been said‚Äù before yes. But by you and the writer you are arguing in support of."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure or ya know, they might just be trying to figure out how to get as many bonuses to executives as possible"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,For corporate control components it does
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok paperhands. Sell. Us diamond hands are in it for gains
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,üòÜ nice try. If you knew how many AMC shares have to be bought to settle the shorts you‚Äôd be hard as hell and not trying to get people to sell their AMC. Hedge say what?!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"And that cash, even with being fully open this summer and having great sales will run out by early next year. They are still on the brink of bankruptcy. This is exactly why they are not worth what they are trading for. Squeeze or no squeeze."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC has like 10 billion in debt.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"No point in buying shares back when they are completely worthless in the first place.

Go read their 2020 balance sheet. -2.85B stockholders equity. They don‚Äôt give a shit about dilution because 450m shares or 1B shares, they are both equal to zero in the long run"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah #5 is a great thing. They are waiting. They just need the shares in case there is a takeover they don‚Äôt want since they know they are going to be stronger later but still somewhat exposed right now. I see it a lot with corporate protection initiatives
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Since you obviously missed this comment Ill just copy/paste this

> You‚Äôre basically confirming what I said, they shelved the shares for that reason. **I didnt say it would crash the stock** (although it obviously wont help it) but he said they have no incentive to do so which is just fucking dumb, considering they clearly do and plan on it.

The person I replied to said RC wouldnt let gme do an offering. i was just correcting them that he cant stop it and GME has said they planned on it. If you‚Äôre reading anything else into my comments its probably some mix of persecution complex and insecurity because you think this info is meant to attack you or something. Its not, its just the truth."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,When do you think they would choose to sell when the stocks at an ath or wait for it to be a penny stock again? RC is up billions of dollars retard he wont care if you apes lose your stimulus check. Have fun being the Alex Jones of wallstreet.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Man those ellipses just make your comments unbearable to read gotta say.

Yea I'm all for them issuing some new shares if they need too and now is a great time based on the share price that's pretty obvious but you are crazy if you think they are going to dump 300 million new shares on the market and fucking robinhood themselves here. They are not going to raise cash unless absolutely needed which will come on the heels of Ryan Cohen being appointed CEO and announcing the plans for the company and cash requirements moving forward.

I also disagree about the cash requirement they need '... immediately...' the 'golden years' you are referring too were in 2007 and 2013 - oddly enough right around the time the ps3, ps4, xbox 360, xbox 1, and Wii were all released. The ps5 and xbox 1x just came out after almost a decade wait and in case you have not been paying attention have been sold out for weeks, they literally cannot make them fast enough! Gamestop also recently just expanded their product line to include computer parts and accessories, another market that has just released some very hard to get and expensive products in the past few months. Combine these factors with the insane ammount of recent media attention and your foolish to think gamestop will not be cash flow positive for the foreseeable future."

2021-03-20 17:38:42,wallstreetbets,"Disproving claims published in CNBC using data on WSB discussion Yesterday, CNBC and Market Watch published [articles](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/19/stimulus-checks-unlikely-to-spur-another-gamestop-mania-says-bofa.html) on research concluding that we shouldn't expect people to use stimulus money to buy GameStop stock. One of the main justifications they gave for this conclusion was that ‚Äúthe number of recent conversations \[on Reddit\] including both GME and stimulus is low.‚Äù

As some of you know, I‚Äôve been collecting data on WSB discussion for quite a while now, and can quantitatively show that to be false.

I'll try to keep this brief, as I know attention spans here are short. Please don't hesitate to ask questions below, and [here's a longer write-up](https://www.reddit.com/user/pdwp90/comments/m8ogb0/the_stimmy_effect/) I did on the ""stimmy effect"" recently.

To start with, here is a graph of the total number of comments in my data mentioning ""stimulus"" or ""stimmy"" over time:

[Stimulus Comments](https://preview.redd.it/68304hkrr6o61.png?width=1730&format=png&auto=webp&s=89e506d66c60fcfdb2c7f615e53cf952fa4dd522)

Here is a graph of the number of comments in my data that mention BOTH stimulus & GME over time:

[WSB comments discussing stimulus & GME](https://preview.redd.it/f5ubk3hhq6o61.png?width=1730&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3b50e38cb0eafa490bcfeba1bda3b6e023409ce)

The drop off at the end reflects the fact that it was 3:00pm as I am writing this and the day is only partially completed. One could argue that these numbers should be normalized based on the total of number of comments per day and, while I'd disagree, I'll include that graph below as well:

[Normalized WSB comments discussing stimulus & GME](https://preview.redd.it/003y7k0mq6o61.png?width=1730&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b4b0762cf396708bdef53f795ce84ad7e0c4847)

From both of these graphs I see no indication of the number of recent conversations including both GME and stimulus being low, as a matter of fact it has hit all time highs over the last few days Here's a chart of the top 5 days in which stimulus was mentioned the most in my data of WSB daily discussion.

|**Day**|**Stimulus & GME mention count**|
|:-|:-|
|3/15/21|124|
|3/14/21|103|
|3/16/21|74|
|3/13/21|69|
|1/14/21|67|

To take it a step further, we can look at what % of comments mentioning different stocks also mention stimulus, as I did recently in the graphic below. A larger proportion of comments mentioning $GME on WSB also mention stimulus than for any other major meme stocks, save for $TSLA.

[Most-discussed stocks in 2021 w\/ \\""stimmy ratio\\""](https://preview.redd.it/d6gj9vj7r6o61.png?width=1072&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d7f1e3d99059a70494a08da9ea571f2832a2359)

I don't know how the conclusion was reached that the number of recent conversations on reddit including GME and stimulus is low. Assuming that this is an honest mistake, I'd encourage BofA, Market Watch, CNBC, or any of the other parties involved to get better data. There are a lot of people out there who have started collecting data on WSB, but not many who do it well and with good intentions. I've been doing it for a while now, and I like to think I fit both those criteria which is why I feel qualified to write this post.

Note:  I don‚Äôt have stake in $GME and don‚Äôt actively trade a portfolio, in order to avoid perceptions of bias in my analysis. This is not financial advice, or a recommendation to buy or sell any stock."

Also seen people referring it as Biden Bucks, but I'm sure the majority is stimulus or stimmy as you said. This is interesting, thanks for putting in the work."

This smooth brain made a post about the fucky but without DD"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bet there are a lot of people talking about **other** people putting their stimmy into GME though.

A possibly more accurate test would be to try to have some rudimentary NLP to determine agency. In other words, look for first-person pronouns like ""I"" or ""my"". If you're more familiar with NLP, you could dependency parse to eliminate first-person pronouns in cases like ""my wife's boyfriend"" where it's clear the commenter is not talking about their intentions, but someone else's.

It's totally possible that these media outlets have received data from some firm that's done analysis with these sorts of things in consideration. These aren't very complex NLP tactics, and any firm that analyzes anything on internet forums (a field that's been increasingly popular in the past few years) is likely to have taken these types of things into consideration.

tl;dr - you need to find instances of people saying ""I will"" or ""my stimmy"" in order to filter out all the people saying things like ""people are gonna put their stimmy into GME"". Those just build up confirmation bias in your data despite not actually showing any sign of it being a reality.

EDIT - I find it hilarious that Bank of America had a typo that doesn't get corrected in CNBC's article: ""Conservations involving"". MarketWatch throws in a ""[sic]"" and corrects it lmao. So who knows, maybe these idiots don't have any good data analysts running these numbers."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"JESUS FUCK. ANTHING that CNN says is at best, a lie, littered with intellectual dishonesty and bias. STOP caring about them and ignore them. They're a propaganda machine.

CNN provide ZERO valuable data points to put into your own THOUGHT processes. They are 100% a machine to get you to THINK a certain way. Effectively hijacking your cognitive ability to see the world as it is versus how they NEED you to see it. STOP WATCHING that garbage (or don't and suffer the consequences.)

BECAUSE CNN is so full of shit and creates false realities, you now spent valuable time and energy to combat their bullshit. - Fair enough and thank you for doing so. Unfortunately the laws allow them to say whatever the fuck they want and call it ""news""."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not sure if it matters how much stimulus is used, if they can naked short the stock as much as they want and use FTD's to cover it then what's the point? If 100M stock are bought by retail(say 20M people buy 5 with their stimulus) then what's the point? There are only around 2-5M floating if that.  Retail can buy and buy and buy and buy and it becomes pointless if the shorters can keep selling and selling and selling without any risk. Then they can just drive the price lower and lower and eventually come out on top."

just a question: how is it possible to have a stimmy ratio above 1for s&p500?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would say that roughly 100 mentions per day of ""GME"" and ""stimulus check"" are pretty low in comparison to the trading volume, wouldn't you agree? I mean, in order to argue that that's not actually low, you would have to make the case that for every such comment, roughly 10,000 people actually go and buy GME. Then we're talking. But in absolute numbers, one hundred schmucks buying GME after nothing that will influence the market in any noticable way."

Users have repeatedly shown they'll believe anything that confirms their bias, and then spam it in the daily and megathread non-stop.

It takes way more effort to prove something false than it does to make up bullshit to support your claim. Which is why killing misinformation at the source is important.

My dad's a pretty smart man, but I shit you not, he said something along the lines of ""I tried to get on The Reddit and all I saw was a whole bunch of people talking about being retards and apes, I don't get it""

I've been on Reddit for almost 8 years now and it's taken about 6 years for me to feel like I'm effectively utilizing this platform to find the content I'm looking for. Whether that's memes/gifs, stock (gambling) advice, or learning how to build a desktop computer.

My point being that Reddit isn't exactly the most intuitive platform until you fully understand that it's essentially just a bunch of communities. It's not all that easy to navigate if you have no idea what you're looking at. 

TLDR: I agree"

Don't get me wrong, he tells me I'm an idiot on the daily for holding my 100 shares of GME. But this whole situation has really changed my life, not just financially. I feel like I'm a part of something. It doesn't matter whether I'm right or wrong, honestly. I feel very strongly about my decision to hold, and I find it very empowering to be involved in a situation that has a chance to change some things that I don't agree with, and however big or small that chance is matters not. 

I don't even know if I'll ever sell my shares unless I absolutely need to for bills. This has been one of the most exciting adventures of my life, and I can't wait to keep holding.

I am so not emotional about my investments, I already did my ""holy shit I just YOLO'd money I shouldn't have"" movement. I cannot argue against the fact that I got lucky as fuck on that, but I did. 

Now, I'm very, very comfortable gambling with where I'm at on this situation. The money doesn't matter to me at this point unless I can retire early. As an individual, my decisions/actions are probably not the ""smartest"" thing I've ever done. If there's a bunch of dumbass mother fuckers just like me, maybe we're not as retarded as you think though? Maybe we are. Neither you nor I can answer that one. But I want to play the game, and I think the people that are actually serious about holding, like me, actually don't give a fuck. 

I don't need this. I want it. I'm ok if I lose it all. 

I truly don't know what is going on in anybody's head that isn't actually rooting for the little guy in this situation. I would never ask somebody to jump in on this, but I also cannot fathom the idea of people wanting this to be a ""failed investment"". 

I just want to be able to buy a house, and this isn't going to set me back very far if I literally lose everything.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What is sentiment?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I see what you're trying to do, but I kinda hate this and the Bloomberg social media tracker for trying to quantify this stuff. I get that it's not _useless_ but it can be so very misleading."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs GME?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sentiment is impossible to quantify even semi-accurately, I don‚Äôt care what metrics were used."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Your sentiment reading is shit. All the GME cheerleaders and only 15% positive sentiment. Are you not counting upvotes and downvotes?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Make it stop. This sub is a skidmark on the underpants of what it used to be

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,how does GME make you feel 1-100?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Sentiment is measured using a modified version of vadersentiment. The program analyzes comments mentioning a particular stock and then take an average across all the comments.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs how many rockets per mention or something.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Ask controlthenarrative what he thinks of AAPL lol.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs not even remotely true, I see AMC mentioned quite a bit throughout the day. It‚Äôs unfortunately eclipsed by GME because it *is* more talked about whether in comments or in posts. GME posts tend to gain the most traction as well, probably because more people have a vested interest in the stock than AMC. That doesn‚Äôt mean there aren‚Äôt a lot of people buying up AMC or talking about it, GME just happens to be the king of meme stonks right now."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Gamestop
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Holding UWMC brings me headaches.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hope you‚Äôre right. Seeing all the other threads about the Russell index thing is making me a bit nervous going into Monday, though."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Amc is voting to dilute at add 500,000 more shares. Shoet term that will deinetly bring the stock price down as there are 500,000 more shares avalible. Long term it will keep them out of bankruptcy for a year or 2. But amc will definitely not see a bump after this news...lol"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it still listed? Yes. Should you buy it? Probably not.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,BB is going to be huge. Top of the line security company. Partnership with Amazon. Tech going into EV vehicles etc.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Does it count üöÄ as positive assessments?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Vader is too forgiving. Need Emperorsentiment.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So this would factor in all of the negative comments made by the droves of shills. Got it.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Across all of twitter and reddit. So it includes gme meltdown too. Lol no wonder and it probably includes all the posts in gme about family members passing and the like. 

I wouldn't put too much emphasis on the sentiment scrapper."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay, fair enough."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have you tested the accuracy? If so, what has your margin of error been? That's a difficult challenge, and I assume there's a large possibility of error."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Very interesting, does the sentiment is influenced by the bots and fud shills too?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄno but üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I think the HF bots read rocket and silver and put out buy recommends for both.  They're more tarded than apes.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Upvote based on your username
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Nine out of ten weird stocks agree.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"thanks for clarifying. how do you compute it? is it:

    sentiment[%] = (n_of_buy_mentions-n_of_sell_mentions)*100/(n_of_buy_mentions+n_of_sell_mentions)

&nbsp;

edit: umm, not sure why the downvotes. was trying to ask a legit question as i [couldn't find it when i googled](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sentimentindicator.asp)"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Using APHA‚Äôs percent as the 100% positive is a bit misleading. On a true scale of -100% to 100%, all the stocks are slightly to the right of zero."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,There are so many eyes on us. So happy all they see is GME
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Wanna bet on it?

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I was just reading the DD that guy posted lmao good thing my options don't expire any time soon
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"People getting dividend on March 23rd were locked in on March 9th, so I doubt you‚Äôll see any movement this week."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ahh yes, good point. Hopefully the uplist to NASDAQ will occur soon!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. It comes on and off the top 10 list regularly.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buying Apple options was ballsy, that stock been trapped in a $20 channel for months."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've tried to post about AMC on Wall Street bets probably close to 10 times since the beginning of February and each time my post is deleted. I haven't been banned but I decided not to post on Wall Street bets anymore because it seems like if you try to talk about AMC they delete you. 

This is just from my point of view, maybe it's not happening to other people but it's definitely happening to me."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It does like to tease you hard

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Russel index did UWMC dirty and didnt add them. doesnt mean its still not undervalued. Just have to scratch that off as one of the catalyst for the stock. They can still be added in the next subsequent quarters
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It wont be included unfortunately... Thats was a Major catalyst

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It sucks for sure, but I really see the new push they have for the non-exclusivity deal from rkt puts them at a price point just below rkt then. I mean they are last I heard one of the top mortgage companies after rkt"

It's fun and interesting. Check out GPT-3."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah got too optimistic me thinks. Cheap buy might need to get some 12/17 12c to make myself feel better. Love throwing good money at bad.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Well guess so looks like they didn‚Äôt make it probably why it slipped Friday
2021-03-20 17:19:46,wallstreetbets,US Cannabis YOLO 
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,SAFE act re-introduced in the House. Could be a game changer!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm with you on Cresco and Jushi. I like Cresco the most out of the big 4. Like Jushi as a second tier MSO, they get no love I think they're being overlooked by a lot of people. I also feel good about Planet 13, got another superstore opening in CA this year. Good luck to us!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Cresco is a decent bet
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,whats your take on MSOS?  I have some at 47
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm with you OP. Just a little less diversified.

^^go ^^cresco"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have been balls deep in the MJ space since 2017. In my opinion, your US MJ yolo is extreamly solid. Well done OP. üëèüëèüëè"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Love it.  

Trulieve / Green Thumb / Cresco / Curaleaf are going to the moon when they finally uplist, and I will be holding when it happens.  

I went with Columbia Care and AYR as my second tier MSO picks - haven't read enough about Jushi but will have to do some looking around."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Same play here. We will be very rich soon
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh. I thought this was going to be about $YOLO
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Since when is buying a bunch of shares a YOLO? Options or stfu nerd.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You're going to be busting open some of that Tres Comas tequila before too long. Godspeed my friend.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd throw some GRUSF on there
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn bro and still probably room to run. Congrats and fuck you.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right with you on these and love the potential for the best positioned US MSO's. There are a lot of positive upcoming catalysts ahead with potential to pass STATES Act, MORE Act, Fed decriminalization, removal of 280e tax, up-listing to NASDAQ and NYSE, along with the organic shift of more states going rec legal every year. I have a substantial amount of my port in GTBIF, CRLBF, CURLF, TCNNF, and HRVSF (as well as MSOS). Have trimmed and re-bought at different times, but have been in a core positions in most since 2018."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have a look at MJNA. Super cheep. Bought 10,000 @ 0.02c now at 0.063. Did hit 0.17 last month. Lots of room to grow once it's legalize."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The marijuana banking bill was reintroduced to the House on Thursday. I think if banks are allowed to do business with weed companies, there could be some money to be made there. Unfortunately, that might already been priced in the weed stocks (overpriced already). My thinking with weed stocks now is for swing trading. Since it‚Äôs volatile, I try to buy low then sell high. It requires bag holding & patience. I‚Äôve made over $6k on APHA. I still have 1000 THCX. I‚Äôve been kicking myself for not selling those around $30 when I had a chance. I‚Äôm hoping to get another chance as it gets closer to 4/20."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,OTC Market weed stocks - you have any plans to take profit?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I dont think weed will be a priority when theres so many things to worry about.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope so this is everything I have
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,‚ÄúBest dabs around.‚Äù Now that‚Äôs DD you can take to the bank. The MONEY bank

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Biden, didn‚Äôt do shit. The staffers were fired under policy that was already established."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you sure his practices will be reflective of his policies?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fine by me. Legalization isn't good for MSOs if it means all the Canadian companies get to swoop into the US market.

These companies have shown they can put up good earnings in a heavily restricted industry. Even small changes like SAFE banking are big wins."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup......we see how that ones gonna go. Glad I didn't invest yet. I was waiting to see if it would pass or not, and he just gave us our answer."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They were fired for using harder drugs it had nothing to do with marijuana just to clarify it. You just read the headline not the story.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, what do you mean by that? That the house doesn't pass anything but the most important bills? That cannibus isn't making good money and expanding right now? Both are wrong."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Cresco is my only weed stonk. Long position is loooong
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have a DD post about US operators from a few months ago if you wanna read it


I would add to that DD that SAFE Banking before full legalization would allow US operators to further expand their moat and market share from the Candian companies

Alternatively, if they jump straight to legalization it becomes a literal race... SAFE Banking first gives US operators another head start

Furthermore, once these guys get up listed, Candian operators will lose their scarcity premium.. cgc trades at a 3x premium to Curaleaf despite having dog shit finances and numbers.. once Curaleaf is listed, one of three things happens 

(1) Curaleaf 3x's to meet CGC valuation

(2) CGC -66% to meet Curaleaf valuation, or

(3) they meet in the middle, Curaleaf multiples expand 1.5x and CGC's contract (most likely scenario)"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I concur I‚Äôve also been in for years and those are some of the top performers, best positioned to scale etc. 
The only thing I would suggest is rebalancing a little bit to go heavier on Curaleaf and possibly adding harvest, Ayr, Columbia care? Just a thought, but very nice!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The restrictions are just solidifying their market share now and that'll have lasting impact on the future. Look at how restrictive alcohol distribution still is in the US a century later
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's why you buy APHA, you get best of both nations, and end up with the largest week manufacturer in the world."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Under-understood point here... SAFE Banking and then legalization is the most profitable path for US operators long term... SAFE banking allows US operators to continue expanding their lead and take market share without competing with Candian operators


By the time Candian companies are allowed in, they'll be fighting over crumbs"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,name checks out.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I read the story and some were asked to resign for cannabis use specifically

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea I'll only be in Greenthumb and Curaleaf
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The SAFE act will üöÄ these stocks.  I don't know if federal decriminalization matters as much if this is passed.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"!remindme 3 years

You're probably right if the senate is lost in midterms and they haven't done anything by then, but will be interesting to watch nonetheless.

Meanwhile, I'll have a small position in MSOs and larger, already long-term position in $APHA (realized cost basis) and $CGC."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The answer is in the question my man.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Does the christmas of weed affect weed stocks?

IDK, does a large influx of sales affect retail stocks? Black Friday? Christmas? Back to School?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It may or it may not. This is a casino, sir."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is good DD. SOME smokers tend to buy a little more than they usually would to give away at fests and parties on 4/20. Calling it the Xmas of weed is overselling it IMO but he‚Äôs not wrong in that there is a guaranteed bump for retail on Hitler‚Äôs birthday. Party on apes....
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"its about as close to a holiday for weed as you're gonna get.

I mean they have literal festivals to celebrate 4/20. Someone has to buy that product from somewhere."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I mentioned the fests and the extra purchasing. It‚Äôs not a Xmas level event. Many people have no idea that 4/20 is significant to anyone. You can‚Äôt say that about Xmas so therefore 4/20<Xmas you got it?
2021-03-20 17:15:18,wallstreetbets,"Why I'm buying puts on AAL the next week **Preamble**

I'm as close to being retarded as one can be. You're almost guaranteed to profit by betting against me and as such, neither is financial advise. The following is my observations.

Generally speaking I genuinely believe that immunity and the progress of vaccination  is oversold and that the broader market is hyped on fugazi. The facts remain:

The projected immunity of the US population (stated that 70-90% being fully vaccinated) is around Oct-Nov^(1).

The US awaits the Trial of AstraZeneca before FDA approval (I'll return to why I estimate this approval won't change much).

""Only"" 12.x% of the US is currently 2-dose vaccinated.

AAL is nearing in on the stock price around $30 prior to Covid-19 restrictions and the market fall in March 2020 - and that's even with their own projections of Q1 capacity being down 45%^(2).

The projection^(1) estimates \~50% being 2-dose vaccinated during the summer months (June-August).

&#x200B;

**Why FDA approval of AstraZeneca won't change the projections imo**

CVST is the short answer. I know fuck-shit about medice or the likes however, I do follow the vaccine status of the EU where I'm residing and the increased number of reports of Blood Clots in the brain (the ones being smooth on you) post AstraZeneca Jabs (*I'm not myself saying they are directly linked, others are indicating this though*). As of writing there has been:

* 2 Deaths in Denmark
* 1 Death in Norway
* 1 Death in Spain
* 1 Death in Austria

That *may* have been linked to the injection of AstraZeneca. The EMA had a conclusion on their hearing the 18th that stated ""The benefint (READ: Herd immunity) outweighs the risk""^(3). Norwegian researches came to the conclusion that it was linked to the Astra vaccine^(4). 

And in the context of the US we'll need to look at **risk factors** for CVST, where one in adults is Obesity^(5). According to CDC above 40% was Obese through 2017-2018^(6) (too lazy to find newer numbers).

All the above nonsense is fine, what matters is **public perception**. Choose between Pfizer/Moderna or a Vaccine that in the media is portrayed as only \~60% effective^(7) and has resulted in blood clots. *I know which one I'd prefer.*

Oh yeah, Ursula von der Leyen threatens to halt export of Astra jabs until the EU has had their promised deliveries, which are delayed and pose a risk to the EU herd immunity progress. (*Tinfoil-hat on* which may be why the EMA and WHO really needs to calm the tits down of the general public surrounding the vaccine? *Tinfoil-hat off*).

&#x200B;

**So, back to AAL**

How will this affect AAL leading into the summer you ask. Less travel. Less travel than anticipated at least.  

But, what about easing the travel restrictions? 

Well, there may be *domestically*, idk about internal US policy but from my point of view, jamming many people together in a metal tube for hours while still not immune in the herd might be just about as dumb as buying these puts. 

Internationally, I highly doubt we'll see travel unless the vaccination pasport is introduced, which projection wise only half of the US population would be able to supply at that time. Iceland already did this.

We're seeing more and more evidence for a third wave in Europe with Paris going in lockdown^(8).

Oh, right, the negative impact 2020 had and Covid overall on flying, cruises and the likes is also underplayed imo. I think we'll see some time go by before we're back to anything remotely close to pre-covid, if we ever get there..

Another observation is that the reported passengers while increasing in to double and nearly tripple from Q2 to Q3 and Q4 respectively, there isn't much upside to be seen in the Qx reportings that yield -2.07B, -2.4B and -2.18B.

&#x200B;

I've excluded all the posts that goes against but you can do a quick search yourself: [https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=aal](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=aal)

&#x200B;

**What am I looking at buying**

PUTS. Puts around a strike price of $24 since I'm too scared to go hardcore short via CFDs (which we Europoors can). I also need to keep up my trackrecord of shorting via Puts which is 100% loss üòé

I'll be attempting to gather Put options with strike $24, Expiry  20th of August and hopefully a premium of 2.0-3.0 which seems about adequate for my pessimistic perception of the aviation sector going into Q2-Q3 2021.

Im poor af so may only be able to get 2 contracts at this premium. We'll see. I'll update when (if i get the premium i want) the options.

 

As always, *not financial advise.*

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I think your missing the Johnson and Johnson single dose vaccine which is starting to be broadly used

He did add that it may take over a year for people to realize this and for the stock prices to come down... Would keep that in mind if you have short-term positions"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm not going to critique your market choices but hold fuck man your understanding of the pandemic/vaccination situation gave me brain cancer and I can confirm you are retarded.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I think you might be right but your timing might bite you in the ass. People are ITCHING to travel and are going to do so regardless of the exact numbers of people fully vaccinated this summer. Especially us dumb fucking Americans who barely locked down as it is. So summer numbers for AAL might look quite nice considering all of the cost slashing they've been doing in response to COVID. Best of luck though!

Greedily double booking vaccine appointments to give themselves options, not showing up to one or more, and wasting those doses. 7.) Refusing to get the vaccine because vaccines cause autism which is bad for the economy. IX.) refusing to get the vaccine because its all part of the liberal mind control agenda. 

By the time 60% are vaccinated there will be a new resistant variant and it's groundhog year 2020 edition  for the next decade. 

LEAPS calls on acne medication and eye & forehead facial recognition companies because we are wearing masks for fucking ever."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Wouldnt be my play
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This ain‚Äôt the way man
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think this will be an interesting thesis to watch play out. We know America isn‚Äôt going to vaccinate correctly or continue following the advice of health experts, so you might fuck up your streak and make money off states potentially shutting down again. Honestly I think it‚Äôs 50/50. Especially, since wsb thinks you‚Äôre wrong."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is retarded. But hey, retarded plays are the best plays."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,lol i bought puts before this dd i am genius
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actually you will make money. Airline is great short.
Sell the news type stock"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Throw in the fact that airlines make the bulk of their revenue via business travel - flights, upgrades, in-flight purchases, etc. You might be on to the something."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. Plus they still say you can still get covid and you still need to wear the mask after the shot....that‚Äôs like saying I can still get polio and measles...I mean I‚Äôm not a Q person but this reeks of mass stupidity, and it‚Äôs likely people will still be hypochondriacs and avoid tourism."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You don‚Äôt need to vaccinate everyone. Jesus Christ. The coronavirus only really has a severe effect on certain populations. Those groups were first. Vaccinating the at-risk population would be enough for reopening the economy as a whole.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,IDK if baby-dinosaur Biden accomplish his goal of vaccination in May airlines should go to the moon
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,France was the country in Europe on fastest path to heard immunity thru vaccinating majority of population.  Estimated time of this event being achieved was late 22 if my memory serves me right.  I know it was 22 for sure tho.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look, none of your DD will matter because the buyers of this stock are too bullish."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So y'all still scared of Covid?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre assuming 70-90% of Americans are going to get vaccinated
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,!wsbgold
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What is the usual incidence rate of CVST? How does that compare with people who took the AstraZeneca vaccine? Why not buy AstraZeneca puts instead?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre going to end up being catastrophically wrong about the pandemic. Life will be back to normal by midsummer.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"And Novavax, which won‚Äôt be far behind."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I think that vax will have some pr issues to deal with at least in the US...being that it is the only one containing human tissue. And aborted fetal tissue at that. Might be a complex social issue for many.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This. 

Don‚Äôt bet against airlines when tech is hemorrhaging value lol"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Using Internet Explorer has its downsides my man
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Replied to another comment about the business side which I totally agree upon. That‚Äôs one thing COVID has learnt us, being remote.  
Edit: My bet, while agreeing long term on the business aspect, is that we‚Äôve bought too optimistic into vaccine and herd immunity to think we all will be flying this summer."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Shit literally can‚Äôt go tits up.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Which moon are you shooting for? I‚Äôm thinking io
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck I need b117 to make my tech leaps fly
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The J&J vaccine has a 67% efficiency and the rumblings about DNA could linger off some of the extremely conservatives. The US is at 12.x% having received 2 doses while liberally opening the country. Planes won‚Äôt be packed this summer since you won‚Äôt have anywhere to fly. Other countries will require vaccine passport which not enough can supply and you‚Äôll have wave three outbreak on the non vaccinated population.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love your idea about acne and facial recon. Completely agree about your other statement. Also, the current projection for immunity leaves no room for supply disruption which I find highly unlikely tbh. Herd immunity in one country does not do much since we all globally depend on each other i some form or way - especially airlines.."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,50/50 - that‚Äôs the best odds I‚Äôve had in years!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just read more comments agreeing with you, so now I‚Äôm concerned."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Good luck on the calls!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,On the business side I firmly believe that COVID has learnt us how to do business while being remote. A father of a friend just closed a deal on a construction deal while being 100% remote which pre COVID was unheard of in his line of work. I genuinely believe the workforce and mobility requirement will be different going forward.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The reason we're still recommended to mask up is to prevent the spread of variants that the vaccine may not protect against.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I doubt tourism will be as it were pre COVID for the next 5 years. Vaccine and positives from less restriction is far too overplayed and overvalued and I estimate we‚Äôll see this as a major setback in Q2-Q3 market wide.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I was in Dallas yesterday and Spring Break is in full swing. Literally every hotel under $150/night was booked near downtown. Parking garage had to be shut down too because it had no more space. I know that's not reflective of the entire country but there is a huge subset of people that are ready to go spend money..and will go wherever they are allowed.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Young and healthy people have had terrible outcomes with the virus. Everyone can have their own opinion about what's the best approach but when the vast majority of countries around the globe are handling the virus in the same manner, there probably something that they know that you may not."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,~~Yet Paris just entered lockdown?~~ misread the year as a date - nvm!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,May be. I‚Äôll post my loss porn then for a quick relief in that case
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not as much anymore, because I‚Äôve already had one dose of Pfizer - in CA some counties are allowing any ape over 16 years to get the jab.
My parents, and wife‚Äôs have already been vaccinated. My kids are back in school.  They will be eligible soon.
I took my first business flight in over a year a week ago."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Assuming not only increase my bias for the bet
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Huh?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I did last week. Didn‚Äôt work as planned. Although the stock fell I guess I had a too early strike date for the fear to settle into the stock. I‚Äôd rather bet on the more market wide optimism and the sudden reality wake up come ending of Q2 though.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You're actually un-ironically a retard. This is not true at all.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Airlines will have enourmous pricing power do to supply/demand in the short to mid term tho during the summer so they may take until the fall their numbers to fall off a cliff
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"So yes I'm in on Monday , ty"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah and I‚Äôm her majesty Old Queen Liz
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It makes no sense how can you say you can still get a virus after getting a vax for a virus. And then we‚Äôre gonna be required to get like 5 before traveling? I‚Äôm fucking perplexed by how stupid everyone is.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd politely disagree about tourism. I live in FL and people are coming here as one of few places to come.  There is a large population that isn't worried about COVID and they will go where they can live like it's 2019.   If a tourist location has restrictions that are onerous they will see a hit, but there will possibly be a boost to those 100% open states.

That said, business airline travel will likely be lower as businesses save money and have gotten used to zoom as standard business."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You know Texas State is 100% fully open, because of the governor, right? That is not the case for all the other states. I think only two other states are 100% open with no mask restrictions, 3 out of 50 in the USA, and I don't know going 100% right now is the best way to go."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Still very risky, viruses mutate so getting vaccinated isn't a fully sure thing ""you're safe to do whatever"", thing is those kids don't give a shit and just want to get drunk and do stupid shit which is the mentality that will see this thing go on forever."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,And that‚Äôs how the third wave hits..
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"And so does the yearly influenza - in fact, it is much more deadly for young people (under 24), coronavirus and the influenza have approximately the same case fatality rate up to ~50."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So.you agree with me.  I'm saying it supposed to be almost 2 years before they reach adequate vaccination levels so yes the shit show shall continue. I agree with OP.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Another thing about that play was shorting the rumour and expected payday on the news.  
In the long run EU are forced to continue using the Astra vaccine to get anywhere remotely close to their immunity plans. As written in the title: my reading on EMA verdict is that the benefit of herd immunity is outweighing the deaths from CVST."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would you bet on the whole market when the whole market is influenced by MANY factors completely unrated to AstraZeneca?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"While not directly in the shot you receive, fetal cells (which may come from abortions) has been used during development and testing:

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,When I‚Äôm looking at AAL quarters compared to increased passengers the increase in Q3 and Q4 did nothing for their billion negative earnings compared to Q2 though

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Well I didn't vote for you
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm not sure which direction you are heading. The virus mutates. There‚Äôs doubt the Astra is effective against the African mutation. That‚Äôs why people are talking next gen. vaccines and why biotech still invest into this subject.  
https://www.bioworld.com/articles/504058-ema-advises-on-next-gen-covid-19-vaccines  
  
The same logic applies to why we create a new flu vaccine each year. The antibodies aren‚Äôt suggested to last very long and if I recall correctly the estimate is 90 days after having contracted the virus with the bodies own response. The vaccines will last longer but not for eternity."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you dont understand, go read a book about virology then"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs because the vax isn‚Äôt for the virus, it to reduce the symptoms of the virus. And yeah. People are really that fucking stupid. ü•¥"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I can respect that and you may absolutely be right that there still will be niche spots around the world that won‚Äôt take a hit. I‚Äôm more on the broader tourism globally.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Right or wrong travel to Florida also booming.   Spring breakers just aren't worried about Rona.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agree with you. Texas' governor is a retarded,  not retarded as we Apes, he is another kind of retarded, opening the state commerce at full capacity and removing the mask restrictions, is a no-no in my point of view at this moment."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"i'm genuinely blown away by how dumb these comments are. most major international travel companies are putting years like 2026 or 2028 for recovery. I'm in colombia and I can tell you flights and cruises to and from here are YEARS away from coming back. they have vaccinated less than a million people. also taking into account mutations and vaccine acceptance, these airlines, especially the airlines with mass international exposure, are overvalued by double. But I won't be buying puts until they peak in a few weeks with re-opening irrational exuberance."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The real time intelligence countries around the world are gathering are all leading to the same recommended action which they have all taken. Leaders in all US states regardless of political affiliation have also implemented similar policies at one point during last year even if their messaging contradicts their own actions. Same with countries that are adversarial and allied to the USA.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup. Updated my comment.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because the only reason the Astra segment is in this post is to describe why I don‚Äôt think it will change the current projection.  
Astra is so much more than the vaccine.  
This play requires the current projection to hold or experiencing setback due to supply issues or vaccine refusals (which I think is fairly plausible also)."

You don‚Äôt see the profitability in saying ‚Äúoh there‚Äôs 69,420 variants now you need 69,420 shots‚Äù? It‚Äôs called marketing. I had this nonsense already it‚Äôs just a cold plus you lose your smell and taste. Why the fuck should I be forced to get 70,000 shots (and pay for them) and get sick from their side effects instead of just living my life? This goes against all normal vax science if you have the disease you don‚Äôt get a shot for it. Fucking retards you‚Äôll believe anything you see on the internet then call me Q for being a skeptic. You gotta think for yourself once in a while."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The üëèüèºvaccines üëèüèºdon‚Äôt üëèüèºstop üëèüèºthe üëèüèºvirus. It‚Äôs bullshit. Mutations happen just like the cold and flu every year. The vax is for the symptoms. To POSSIBLY make them less severe. The whole thing is a big scam. Vaccines for tetanus, diphtheria, MMR, polio=good. Vax for SARS COV-2 for the first time in human history, with a year of trials or less, after trying with CV and HIV for decades=stupid. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have a bachelors in biology. A vax is not a cure but it sure as hell is supposed to be a preventative. Science is not a religion and it encourages skepticism, it doesn‚Äôt engage in an inquisition of censorship and imprisonment"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's all political messaging. No mandate and it's personal choice for people to protect themselves is what they're saying. They still recommend it but don't want a scary mandate. They trust too much that people will ""do the right thing""."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I think puts on cruiselines might go further.  They don't get bailouts.  They dilute shares. Airlines  continue to operate atleast showing signs of recovery wearas cruise lines are fuk. Planes still fly. Boats sit there needing maintained to generate no revenue.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You get the vax before you get the disease usually. Also variants are normal, majority of them are unconcerning since the vaccine works against them. Current fear is just speculation on what if there's a variant that the vaccine doesn't work against but still a good thing to consider incase it actually happens. Preventative measure to lower the risk of that happening is good as well. Most likely it won't occur but always better to play it safe.


Edit: I don't believe the internet but my science education."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,thank you for calling people idiots while making the dumbest argument i have ever seen on WSB. it's hilarious.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, it seems having a bachelors in biology doesnt mean you understand virology and mutation"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That is the thing. We people are stupid.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I haven‚Äôt looked at cruise lines but the same logic should absolutely apply.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"God damn, I can't imagine going through life being this fucking dumb. Good luck to you, you'll need it. 

You said the vaccine contains aborted fetal tissue. It doesn't. End of store. There's no argument to be made. Not going to waste my time responding to you anymore when you're clearly a lost cause."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I already had it and theyll probably put a gun to my head to get it anyways despite it going against all science. Meanwhile redditards praise the new Nazi regime literally experimenting on everyone with shit that didn‚Äôt go through proper FDA channels. I have an actual bachelors degree in actual biology from UCI unlike whatever ridiculous printed out degree these politicians in lab coats got. But fuck me im a drumpftard for actually tapping in to what I learned about science from a fairly prestigious university and saying don‚Äôt believe everything hedge fund-funded TV/politicians say (despite being the most left wing person in my family and T man praising the vax)

It gets old. If you had a disease taking a vax for it is worthless that‚Äôs the first thing people learn. But nope the cult continues and I‚Äôm called every name in the book. Common sense is a rarity."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You call it dumb I don‚Äôt see any valid argument besides ‚Äúthe doctor on the tv said so‚Äù meanwhile 50 other doctors who don‚Äôt get a big money platform say the opposite. You gullible you obviously never had someone lie to you before.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it mutates why take the shot and get sick in the first place. Obviously you need a vax that covers the bases, preferably one that goes through actual FDA approval channels. You want to be experimented on be my guest just don‚Äôt demand it be mandated on people who care about their health on pain of death/complete banishment from society. If you had any idea the actual science behind these new shots you would hide in a hole for 10 years."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,No we take booster shots for a reason. Antibodies don't last forever and it's currently unknown the duration and strength of antibodies produced from an actual infection. I graduated in Chemical Engineering at UCB so Biology was definitely part of my general education as well.

The point is not all vaccines are bad i took plenty in the service I‚Äôm a fan of them when proven safe through years of proper research and I‚Äôm fine as far as I know. But to rush out this mass experiment, and then insist on mandating it, is Nazi cult like mentality, and it‚Äôs scary when people who don‚Äôt know what a covalent bond is start spamming praise for it on the internet, literally insisting vax skeptics be killed, without knowing a single shred of the topic they‚Äôre spewing shit about."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"All the actual scientists said that this shit was man made, released on purpose and permanently mutates in cycles so no vaccine could affect it but of course they‚Äôre immediately censored. If someone is censoring they‚Äôre the ones wrong. Period. This is something proven throughout history and as an actual educated liberal open thinker I can‚Äôt believe all my peers fall for this cult and then ostracize me for speaking common sense. 

Do you not see how profitable it is to be saying ‚ÄúOK GUISE WE NEED 69,420 SHOTS FOR 69,420 VARIANTS WITH YOUR TAX DOLLARS PLS GIBS‚Äù? If you ever wanted to take a stand for real science buddy this is the time to do it cause everyone‚Äôs going real stupid real quick. Second graders can tell you how wrong this ‚Äúscience‚Äù is."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes I agree that concerns on the expedited process are valid and we should be on the lookout of any undetected side effect that wasn't picked up in the trials. I believe alot of countries are doing that actually which is why the temporarily stopped the Astrazeneca vaccine while they investigated it. It's personal choice to get the vaccine or not imo. More time is always good and if you're not at risk there no rush to get it.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are soooo right! The first mRNA vaccine in human history but yeah ‚Äústick me.‚Äù When people starting dying of organ failure because every cell in their body is coated with it and when their body does what it does and attacks, maybe, just maybe people will at least question it. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èBut the big money boys will just blame it on a ‚Äúmutation.‚Äù üôÑ"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"From what I've read, the investigation team the WHO sent to China came to the same conclusions that it emerged from the wild. Not sure if the government of China did anything to guide them to that conclusion though but so far that's the current most likely origin of the virus.


Yes it would be profitable for companies to continue to sell vaccines to the government but so far they've only produced one and hopefully that one is good enough for any future variants that may crop up. So far it's looking like it's good enough to reduce severe outcomes so any new variant won't be harmful enough to warrant a second new vaccine. All speculation of course."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao dude I am glad your so-called doctor friends who totally exist lost everything. it means the system works.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs not gonna be personal choice soon with these nazis. Most of my old extended family were wiped out 80 years ago by a similarly thinking crowd. I almost have an ancestral sense of what‚Äôs to come. You can‚Äôt tell me you don‚Äôt see a pattern here saying we need more tax funded shots for a million new variants that just conveniently pop up. I have $3k in Pfizer calls for this very purpose. If they mandate shots I make bank hopefully I can run to Mexico before then. If someone forces something on you you KNOW not to trust it, if you don‚Äôt well then you‚Äôre 90% of Americans it seems.  After seeing people‚Äôs side effects and the desperation to say ITS SAFE DONT DOUBT IT OR YOURE A QTARD NAZI it‚Äôs clear there‚Äôs an ulterior motive to all this.

Actually Pfizer 2023s guess they‚Äôre a bit safer than calls lol"

Anyone who supports this is a Nazi, not in the definition widely used in this mass stupidity known as the internet but the actual one, where a medical dictatorship chose who got experimented on with untested unsafe chemicals. I wish my grandad was still alive to see all he lived through fucking Auschwitz for 4 years all was for nothing because of gullible shitweasels.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,All speculation though. I doubt that vaccines will be mandatory for domestic travel. International travel may have requirements however if those countries impose it.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"They already have the laws pre written to require a vax pass what rock are you living under? Do you not see your mainstream bs views are what allows this to continue? If you‚Äôre a scientist stand up to this shit that you KNOW is wrong instead of trying to acquiesce to people‚Äôs stupidity. 

And another thing. A fucking cheap, hole ridden piece of crap cloth handled in unsanitary conditions by poor sweatshop workers who bathe once a month, or anything less than a Hazmat suit for that matter, does not protect you against a nanoparticle virus fucking shit for brains retards a nine year old can tell you that.

2021-03-20 13:32:25,wallstreetbets,"UWMC not added to Russel Indices...What now? Why you shouldn‚Äôt panic sell. A value play and long term hold: Part 2 So, the news broke yesterday that UWMC will not be included in the Russell 1000 or 3000. This justifiably has some investors upset and ready to sell. I‚Äôm going to make a case for holding, or even adding more. 

I previously made a DD that was fairly popular where I called UWMC a swing play, a value play, and a long term hold rolled into one. Well, the swing play already happened with the run to $12. There was another run to $10 recently as well. We could have seen a bigger swing with index inclusion, but that‚Äôs not happening now. I banked $4,000 on those swings, so I can‚Äôt complain too much there. However, I understand that some people bought in the run-up with higher prices in mind. There were some posts on here with stupid price targets and ‚Äúshort squeeze‚Äù hype. I called these posts out as I saw them. I never thought UWM was wise to jump into for a squeeze alone, even with high short interest, and some here definitely FOMOd into some really bad DD. In fact, I think the guy who kept hyping a squeeze deleted his account. 

But the truth is that many bought at the $10+ mark and now feel lost. Well, this post is for you. 

First of all, I agree that not being included in the indices is bad news. I thought this would be a good catalyst myself. However, I also believe that there is an overreaction here. UWMC may very well have ticked up a couple of percentage points on Russell inclusions, but I think that for the long term, this doesn‚Äôt change too much. 

This is why, even without Russell inclusion, UWMC may be a worthy part of your portfolio:


- Price targets and analyst ratings for UWMC:

4 buys, 1 hold.

Low: 10.50
Average: 11.70
High: 13.50

This represents a 19-53% upside from current share price. 

https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/UWMC/research-ratings

- This company is trading at value multiples, with a P/E in the 6-7 range and 1.83b revenue in the most recent quarter. More quarters with minuscule interest rates are on the horizon, and I would be shocked if UWM doesn‚Äôt put up monster numbers. I think they will likely upgrade their dividend and make a run up over the course of the year. Analysts seem to agree with this outlook. The fed reiterated that rates are going nowhere.

- There was recently an insider buy of 60,000 shares at around $8. This was more than a double down on his previous 50,000 shares. If he‚Äôs that bullish at $8, then I would say anything below $8.50 is a great buy. Even at the current $8.80 price, we are only 10% above the insider purchase. 

- Even if there is no dividend upgrade, the current dividend is 40 cents a year, which comes out to 4.5% of the current price. This is a very solid dividend for an income play. 

- Earnings will likely be in early May. With no index inclusion, I would say late April would be the next catalyst to watch for a run up. If you really want to sell, I would advise waiting until that time rather than taking a big loss Monday. 

- As a result of the recent spat with RKT, UWMC has enlisted a minimum of 65% and likely in the end around 75-80% of independent brokers who previously worked with UWMC and RKT to sign an addendum that restricts them from working with RKT. Considering the wholesale channel is expected to increase its share of the market until 2025, this gives UWMC a giant advantage in capturing more market share. (I‚Äôm bullish on RKT too for different reasons, but UWMC is the king of brokers in the mortgage industry and will win the broker battle IMO)

- EPS is expected to INCREASE in 2021 per analyst estimates. This is opposed to competitors that are expected to have a slower 2021. And when interest rates do increase, UWM expects to become an even more powerful influence in the industry due to their reliance on purchase business rather than refinance. 

- UWM is investing in technology by the billions, and they already have far and away the fastest closing times in the industry. They hold what one might call a ‚Äúmoat.‚Äù That‚Äôs how you grow a company. 

Some bear points:

- The RKT ultimatum could lead to litigation and bad press. I don‚Äôt think anything will come of it, but bad press could bring the share price down. 

- The market could collapse/the housing market could cool off. I‚Äôd say that if you‚Äôre in the industry, you know that the housing market isn‚Äôt cooling off any time soon. However, I won‚Äôt claim to be all-knowing, so perhaps this could happen.

- Interest rates could rise substantially, and much sooner than expected. Highly unlikely, but possible. 

- Maybe the RKT ultimatum pushes business away from UWM, and they lose out to RKT. I‚Äôd say this is the biggest risk right now to be honest, but I do believe UWM will come out on top based on my experience in the industry and based off of what is being reported. I have also heard some personal stories about the situation. However, if UWM starts to lose more market share, that changes everything. 

- The stock market simply undervalues mortgage companies right now, and one could argue that this may never change. I would say that we are already seeing it change with RKT and UWM, and that it will gradually change as these companies continue to put up huge numbers. 


Let me reiterate: UWMC was never a GME type play. It was a good swing play, and now it is a great value and long term play. I would spend some time thinking about whether that matches your investing goals, and if not, get out on Monday or hold until the earnings run-up.

I am personally going to be buying the dip if it comes on Monday. Considering the current share price provides 20% upside to the LOWEST analyst estimates, I am excited to buy the dip to be honest. 

This post is not for my own benefit. My average is pretty good and I am prepared to average down. I just know that some of the people here really got screwed by some bad DD, and wanted to provide my own outlook on why you may be fine. My current position is 1250 @ 8.47."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,RKT is the play. I nearly got caught up in UWMC but it doesn't trade on Wealthsimple.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes!  This is a very sound company with great leadership and the best brokerage model out there.  Rates are likely to go up but the crazy demand means home sales will not go down and UWMCs revenue will increase.  RKT is doing a lot of damage to brokers and UWMCs stand is supported by the majority of their broker network. Putting on my tinfoil hat, I've wondered if the shorting and greatly undervalued stock price of UWMC is due to some hedgie support/friends of RKT.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe, but I think that people are seriously overestimating the effect that index inclusion has on stock price. It may have brought it up a couple of ticks, but that‚Äôs it really. If you look at other stocks that have been included, it‚Äôs a minor effect, if any

I think it‚Äôs more likely that he simply realized that $8 for a stock that IPOd at 10, has seen the 12-13 range, and is going to keep putting up big numbers, is likely towards the bottom of its trading range with limited downside"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey bro, we get it. You don‚Äôt like the stock. We disagree. No need for fighting words or profanity.

Move along to one of the plays you‚Äôre happy with, and I hope you profit deep üí™"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This isn't supposed to be a squeeze. It's undervalued.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs obvious I have different views of this play, but my point is justifiable. I didn‚Äôt attack anyone who invested their life savings into it. Im stating, based of recent performance, and underachieving to this threads expectation, this is indeed, a money pit. Look at the loss porn here. Also, A big catalyst of the hype was based off inclusion to the Russel Index. That didn‚Äôt happen. Could there be a conspiracy behind that? Maybe - I wouldn‚Äôt put it against the big cats, but that‚Äôs a different discussion for a different day, but the point remains the same. Constructive conversations, and solutions are formed from opposing ideas, or views. If this thread was more open to that philosophy,  instead of the ‚ÄúpAPeR HaND, dIamond HanDs 4 LiFe‚Äù (which I see a lot for option plays, unfortunately, theta decay doesn‚Äôt give a shit about irrational pride), we could actually start getting shit done."

Companys been sub $10 most of its lifetime. Usually around $9. 

Recently it‚Äôs had a huge spike to a whopping $13 from all the pushing on wsb. Most volume it‚Äôs ever seen in the last couple months.

Good luck bag holders. Pretty sad that you guys honestly think this is some undervalued company."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice man. I'll prob get downvoted for this but I've been trading and investing for longer than a lot of peeps here have been alive. When I hit a multibagger, at some point I always pull my initial investment out and go for it again with a different stock and let the remaining profit ride until it's time to pull more off the table. Stacking gains like this is efficient AF at compounding gains and diversifying risk. Not telling a single person what to do. Just giving you something to consider.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sooo earnings can often bring extended volatility to a stock. Both before and after depending on the earnings statement. As GME doesn‚Äôt even have a profitable business model at this point, I don‚Äôt expect their earnings to be stellar. Bc of this, it could drive people to sell before earnings (bc of this fear) AND potentially sell after if their earnings are even worse than forecasted which could 100% be the case. 

I would‚Äôve just waited until earnings were out then bought the dippp"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Hi Melvin.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,But In some cases the most logical model to pursue when presented with overwhelming estimates would be to take the loss knowing that you‚Äôll make it back in no time somewhere else... possible?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Personally I think it‚Äôs going up from Monday Tuesday
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmfao, I don't think anyone is buying or selling GME at 200 because of EARNINGS...Ryan Cohen tweets, Ape brains and Hedgie hubris are driving this thing.

It's like last March for gme rn, earnings are either priced in or irrelevant"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You will be wrong sir! Anyone who sold before Tuesday clearly needs to rethink investing. Tuesday will make history.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs defiantly going up and will most likely hit new highs.

2021-03-20 11:29:09,wallstreetbets,"Stop being robbed of call premium for the mirage of a gamma squeeze This advice was posted here countless times and yet here we go again. If implied volatility is over 100-200%, there's very little money to be made with calls. Your dumbass wants to start a gamma squeeze? Well it won't fucking happen if you're paying so much per delta that the option seller will have cash left over even after hedging.

You would be much more powerful if you bought shares instead of calls. The cheapest and most permanent way to increase the share price is to buy shares. Gamma squeezes are only possible when call premiums are too low to begin with. Also that hefty call premium you're paying goes to those betting against GME. Stop giving them your power (money) to use against you.

It pisses me off to see normies and OG retards lose all their savings despite the best intentions. Yes this is a casino, but at least act like you're trying to win damnit.

Edit: here's a great comment that explains this in more detail
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9229p/stop_being_robbed_of_call_premium_for_the_mirage/grm4fi2?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely, no one has any idea when a squeeze will happen.  You just need to invest in the company by buying shares and holding.  The option writers are making a killing off selling and making a ton on premiums.  This battle may drag out for months or longer, the longs aren't losing money, the shorts are - and they are being bled out slowly

This is not investment advice and I'm a moron and I don't know what I'm doing."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Just buy shares ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"To add: for those with some wrinkles. The reason options are ‚Äúattractive‚Äù to buy is their convexity. You have limited downside and unlimited upside, and before expiration the payoff profile is convex. Higher gamma = higher convexity. The higher the implied volatility of an option, all else equal, the **lower the gamma** is, and the less convex the payoff profile is.

Thus GME (and any other options with >100% ivol) offer a less attractive payoff profile. 
You can think of this in terms of convexity, or the simpler version which is just $$- you pay a lot thus your breakeven are much higher than the strike price. 

Also people are evaluating ‚Äúbreakevens‚Äù the wrong way. You should look at breakeven on your option investment (where your pnl is $0) AND breakeven versus just buying stock. This is unusually unattractive for GME haha.

*Example* April 16 $240 calls are about $45 at mid. You could buy these for $4500 and your breakeven is $285. **or** you could buy the stock. $4500 of stock at $200 a share = 22.5 shares. 

April 16th 
‚Ä¢stock $285, options profit = $0, stock profit = $1912.5 (42%)

‚Ä¢Stock $300, options profit = $1500, stock profit = $2250 (+50%)

‚Ä¢Stock $310, options profit = $2500, stock profit = $2475

**So your breakeven on the option is $285 but breakeven vs buying stock is just under $310** 
You can calculate this by 
# shares * (x-share purchase price) = # options * (x - options breakeven) and solving for x
22.5*(x-$200)=100*(x-285)
X=$309.67"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,">*They don‚Äôt realize that trading is a minus-sum game.*

>*Winners receive less than what losers lose because the industry drains money from the markets.*

>*For example, roulette in a casino is a minus-sum game because the casino sweeps away between three and six percent of every bet.This makes roulette unwinnable in the long run.You and I can get into in a minus-sum game if we make the same $20 bet on the next 100-point move in the Dow through brokers. When we settle, the loser will be out $23, and the winner will collect only $17, while two brokers will smile on their way to the bank.*

>*Commissions and slippage are to traders what death and taxes are to all of us. They take some fun out of life and ultimately bring it to an end.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,yes it's true. all these naked call sellers are laughing at you buying them while they get tendies.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm guilty of this. I lost 18k this week. I‚Äôm an idiot, won‚Äôt honor myself even with retard. I truly thought I knew what I was doing until it was too late for me to save my position. Thanks very much for the education. I‚Äôm gonna stick to shares and cc‚Äôs here on out. One gets stuck on this thinking we can only make it ‚Äúbig‚Äù with options. Also my funds are now in a different bracket. No choice. UGH."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed and they are selling naked...this leads to the question: why doesn‚Äôt everyone just exercise ‚ÄúITM‚Äù calls?  Calls can be exercised at anytime so no need to wait for them to expire ‚ÄúITM‚Äù.  With all the FTDs and other shenanigans why would anyone want to put themselves up against the clock and risk not having shares to hold or sell.  The one thing shorts are counting on you not to do is exercise your calls early because if you do the clock starts working against them and they need to deliver those shares.  Most importantly As the OP mentioned you like the stock, you like the company, you want to own a piece of the company so you need shares not options."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"TRUTH HURTS! 

But they‚Äôll still do it anyways. Too many chasing dreams and just wanna hit a big one."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Momma always said to share...  so I buy them
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"True, i have the impression this is all dancing around options tbh. But while stock had little variation today, option trading had 100% gaps."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gonna point out I talked a redditor out of buying 420c 3/12 for 9.80. Next day it was 2.50 and he decided to buy 2, and buy 2 stock. He tried to convince me to do the same. I held my shares. Today I have made more profit. 

But what if it did hit 430? If he bought the premium for $980 I would still have made more profit. With 4 shares of equivalent value."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This sub has completely gone to shit
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This can't be stressed enough.  Hope enough people in here realize this
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,All these idiots have no idea that calls were less than $1.00 when the actual gamma squeeze happened
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I still don‚Äôt know what is a gamma squeeze. I am just here because I like the stock.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,But can I use deep ITM options as proxies for shares so that I get more leverage? Theyre'almost 100% intrinsic.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,lost about $4k on options (a lot for me) this week. Decided to take it as a learning experience and look up options strategies. I plan on working on executing the theta wheel going forward and less FD's.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Careful. Thetagang might call out a hit on you.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think a lot of noobs and new people don't know that the options they're buying are being written by Market Makers and usually have their expected profits baked into the calculations. These are ppl paying - and risking - a lot here so they're only going to write these calls in their favor right now.

$480 for a single option right now? You coulda bought two shares, Ape....

Calls are great for those who know how to use them but don't think they're a get rish quick scheme cause that's some REAL autism thinking right there."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"1. Buy shares  
2. HOLD  
3. Buy Lambo"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I have made so much money selling covered calls on spikes and buying them back when it drops on GME
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"IV is relative. 200% is small relative to 800%.  


All these anti-options posts make me think it's the right time to load up on leaps."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Hear hear!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs the MM‚Äôs infinite money glitch.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,">[Citadel  are spending millions on shorting to keep prices below certain option  strike prices, so as to make more money from the premium gained by  writing high-price naked calls and selling them on the market](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8ef72/hey_crayon_munchers_want_to_know_why_the_gme) \- the  takeaway is: if you want to buy options, only buy leaps and avoid  weeklies like the plague as you are literally funding Citadel"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy shares, sell covered calls or cash secured puts. That‚Äôs what I would be doing if I could afford it."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The best time to buy calls was before the run up. Be autistic not full retard.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It's pretty sad when someone can sell you a $200 call that expires in a week. The stock finishes the week at $205 and the person selling the option makes money on the call even if they were naked selling it. I've looked at both AMC and GME options many times and have never been a buyer after doing the math. Think you are better off selling bull or bear vertical spreads and then taking the profit to buy more shares.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,When a retail investor places a buy order citidel has the option of letting that go on to the open market or not.  If they instead create an offsetting position then your buy order never increases the price and it creates a synthetic short which drives the price down when it's sold on the open market.  Buying itm or atm calls costs more than buying shares but at least you can affect the price of the stock in a positive direction.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,My April 20-30c gme calls were 150-200% IV. I would argue that high iv can still be profitable
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,80% shares 20% calls this is the way
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs good $ per delta my bro
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Options still make money just don‚Äôt buy near expiry. 


Source: made 1,000% on GME round 1. Made 300% on GME round 2."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Nothing more WSB than paying $500 for a call that is $600 OTM.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Stick to the basics people... smooth out that brain and just keep it simple stupid #hodl

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Keep buying!!! I'm slowly averaging up.

Hahaha IRK... maybe try buying low and selling high.

&#x200B;

Edit: Not investment advice"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah this. If you think wall street institutions have an unfair advantage against us when dealing with share purchases, don't even look into the options market. Options writers can write you out of the game so fast if they need to that on a stock as damaging for MM's as GME you're basically throwing your money away.

I know this is WSBets, not WSInvestments, I get that, take mental options risks by all means, but pick a different stock because if you do that on GME you will be manipulated out of the game."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm fairly new at all this but before I started buying, I had read someone writing this and I followed it since then. It's pretty logical after all."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Won't make that mistake again. Shares only from now on.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,JUST BUY SHARES AND HOLD!!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't know what this post means, just gonna HODL"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This needs upvotes badly!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy shares. They don‚Äôt expire
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"all the true apes have been saying SHARES ONLY since after the first Gamma squeeze in January. After that, everyone just started piling on and trying to replicate that, which will not happen."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree with you that buying shares and holding  is a sure fire way to support. Buying options ITM or just OTM is also important if not have gamma squeeze to gain increased leverage when MM hedge. 

When IV drops between now and 4/16, calls should be loaded up again. Not $800 ones , but ladder up ...$225, $275, $300....$500. Stacking when IV is down will allow our broke asses to gain some leverage. 

This is not investment advice, I‚Äôm retarded holding 3,993 shares"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"New Ape with zero understanding of calls, but I got in at $80, grabbed a couple more on the way down for grand total of 5 shares at $67.  Also have 10 AMERICAN AMericanCinema, and 5 Blackberries...I like the stocks. 

Since I have 2 ex wives, and 5 kids, not a lot of scratch laying around to get in the game. Especially since the youngest has a $300 a week daycare habit, another $100 in diapers and formula. (Fucking little humans are terrible investment...must be a real long term hold strat.)

I keep seeing these posts about thousands in loss on calls. My smooth brain thinks, wouldn't it be better to hoover shares with that cash to limit the number of shares on the board? Like a balloon. If you slowly keep squeezing up on it, won't it eventually burst?

Again, fucking retarded before I got here (see above about X-Wives), but especially on those really long $800 calls, it seems like you're just handing cash over to the enemy. 

Anyone with three üñçand two üçå, please feel free to educate my dumb ass. Buy and Hodl...there is no Cell. ü¶çüôåüíéüöÄüåõ"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve said this over and over again. The premiums are so rich anyone shorting right now is making a killing off premiums alone. Especially this week with the stock running flat and reducing volatility a bit which allows them to buy back much lower and profit. With GME to make money buying calls you need ITM calls or huge movement in share price The breakevens are ridiculous.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Shares and shares I like!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a call seller who rightly has his nuts in a vice until the 16th, I can tell you the IV crush is starting. The call I sold was worth more than the shares until this week."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Makes me wonder if HF are the ultimate theta thieves
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,If buying calls is too volatile sell puts instead ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Too bad not everyone could see this post. I‚Äôve learned a lot since jumping on the band wagon.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Upvote x9000 if I could.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes the premiums have been very juicy.  ThetaGangBanged the shit out of these retards the past 2 weeks
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The thing that gets me is we might have squeezed by now if all the people who bought 500+ calls bought shares instead.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Great time to own high Iv stocks and sell calls
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Im not reading that, but congrats, or sorry that it happened."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I buy shares with ITM options. It's like a revolving door if you do it right.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This in combination with DD posts tying the squeeze to specific dates giving said option buyers confidence to make THE BIG YOLO. Stop. Buy shares and be patient
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just sold a 3/26 500c for $6.50 premium.  That's $650 easy money in my pocket, doing nothing but holding my shares for a week.  If they get called away at $500 I'm still netting a nice profit from my low cost basis.  The following week--rinse and repeat.  

Buy shares and hold, +/- sell covered calls if you can get decent premium.

This is not investment advice, I'm a newbie, have only been doing this for a few months."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"As my dad would say ""well son sometimes you have to learn the hard way""  I made $10k last week and rolled that into 2 300 call contracts that expired worthless yesterday.  should have bought 50 shares instead.  But I'm most disappointed that I got cat fished on some Swedish titties.  Should have know better about that promise.

Anyway this is great advice.  But you can't be ""that guy"" because I am ""that guy""

This was the money I was supposed to pay Uncle Sam but the bozo gave me a 31 day extension."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shares all the way for me. I will hodl until the end of time if I need to. No fuss, no muss...I have my tickets and don't need it to hit a certain price at any particular time.

GME will go when its ready to go."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This whole discussion is SUS AF.

Sell calls during a squeeze.

Hah.   
Ok shills- good try but wont work on us APES."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"For example, Bill Gross is selling Call options of $250 and $300 whilst betting against by shorting GME. I just hope he lost a ton on Friday like the SHFs."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Options buyers are freeloading cheap asses if they are buying naked options. The stock buyers have to buy the expensive parts while a cheap option can generate absolute gold with little investment. Really, if you want to help triggering a squeeze: don‚Äôt go above 25% options. Everything above that is just not helping with the stockprice and guess what: if everyone just went asshole the price would be around $10 again. SO JUST BUY THE ACTUAL FUCKING STOCK, with an option on the side as desert."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean they can still borrow out your shares on most platforms so you‚Äôre fucked no matter which option (no pun intended) you pick. üò™
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its like calling a card in black jack with 15 on hand and the guy next to you has an A 

Might work (most likely not) but you fuck the guy next to you"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"good advice.... Apes, buying 100s of 800 strike price call 1 day from expiry is not going to help anyone but sellers of the call. even if the stock increases by 20/30 % and ur option goes up significantly on paper, if it's not hitting 800 by Friday 4 PM, it's still worthless. 

buy the shares and HODL...."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,If IV is that high you should look at selling instead of buying
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Rick ross - buy back the shares
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Theta gangs loves it when you buy them fds
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This exactly.

If you didn't buy calls in 2019 or 2020, it's not really worth it.

BUY SHARES."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,There's so much stupid in one short post it's maddening and hilarious at the same time. What are you people even doing on this planet.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Calls on GME around the $300 strike were chilling around 900-1000% implied volatility yesterday. Shit is wild. Don't chase that.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve made more money off calls than I ever would have with stocks. It‚Äôs called a calculated risk you should try it sometime.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is my problem anymore. I love loss porn as much as the next guy but holy fuck. I don‚Äôt want to see you throw away money on shitty 70c $SNAP. That shit ain‚Äôt going anywhere. Find a borderline bankrupt company or something..
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought five 3/19 300c for 8.8, sold two for 31.25. The other three expired worthless.

Made some money and bought a few more shares. But I'm not doing anymore options on GME, I know I was just very lucky with these."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I had a quantity of GME shares, even if they were under water, I‚Äôd be writing OTM calls and making bank."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This cannot be said enough. If you HAVE to play with options do it with another stock. Leave GME and AMC alone, it is a losing game. Pigs get fed, hogs get slaughtered. Don't be an options hog."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I can not believe people are buying calls on GME what a clown world. You might as well mail a check straight to Melvin. They can see the calls and just keep the price under and collect lol. They are making so much money off this ffs. Also I have no clue what I am talking about this is not financial advice.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"DFV likes the stock, not the options.

*The stock.*"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly this! Buy shares, or sell them otm puts!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was about to make 2k on a GME call.... on the morning of the flash crash.  Had a work meeting, bottomed out to nothing 30 min after.  Was thinking about selling it too.

No more GME options until post squeeze for me."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is WSB. Since when did this become a place we pussy out and just long term hold?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,How isn't it common knowledge that you need to buy shares instead of calls?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,As if retail had any impact whatsoever.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"i've been buying both puts and calls all week, i plan to keep doing this as long as it keeps trading sideways"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,TLDR: BUY SHARES
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I saw what was going on at the start of the week. anyone who bought at open took it in the ass and anyone who bought options all week aside from the 180s took it. Price was gonna drop all week from the gamma squeezs, all we could do is take it in the rear and hold"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Could always sell puts üßê that way your betting against the shit stain put option buyers
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't understand options. They are scarwy. I buy stock so I don't lose thousands of dollars if the share price fails to move.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Options work just like goddamn stocks. You‚Äôre supposed to buy low and sell high and everyone is buying high and losing all. They go up and down in price with supply and demand as the underlying moves up and down the strikes. That‚Äôs all. 

And just like stocks, you can risk a little to win a little‚Äîthis is selling OTM for premium. Sell puts at strikes you have the cash to buy that nets a decent 5% - 10% return within a month or so and will score you cheap shares now at discount if exercised. Or sell calls against shares you own at strikes that net you the same in premium plus bonus if exercised. 

You can risk a little to win a lot‚Äîthis is buying OTM calls or puts with near dates‚Äîwhat all y‚Äôall retards do, like sitting at a slot machine throwing nickels in hoping to score the jackpot but are just bleeding your money out. Moreover, when IV is high, it‚Äôs like an expensive slot machine where each play is $100 and you *might* win $500, when you‚Äôre *supposed* to find the slot that is 1 cent but is broken and will pay out $5,000 more often than not. So you retards are actually risking a lot to win a little, which is the anti-thesis to investing. 

You can spend a lot to make a little with little risk‚Äîthis is buying ITM calls or puts at far out dates. The deeper ITM and the further out the smaller the risk if the premium is closer to half the cost of the shares than not‚Äîyou‚Äôll at least probably break even. 

Finally, you can risk a lot AND spend a lot to make a lot‚Äîthis is selling ITM calls and puts or some combination thereof (multi-leg). 

In all of this, you‚Äôre supposed to buy low and sell high, or sell high and buy low, whether you‚Äôre buying to close or selling to close.

That‚Äôs all there is to it. Now get off the damn expensive slot machines and come play some craps goddamn it."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the way

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Guys the gamma squeeze happened. Robinhood botched it and we exposed our hand. If you are in this for the fight to bring down the Hedgies then buy and hold. If you wanna make bets don‚Äôt do it on GME. This movement has surpassed the realm of WSB and its time to start thinking about your strategy if you actually want this stonk to preform above its legitimate value of bout $20-$30 a share.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,If they listened or have any critical thinking skills they would never buy and hold meme stocks.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is exactly why I scalp option premium to to buy more stock.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"we are too greedy for that... the stock has to double in price for us to make 100%... in options we can get that much faster, of course, the few times we get it right!! options is part of the yolo way of investing! but don't get me wrong, I know you are correct, and that I should buy the stock, and that in 10 years I would have a lot of money, and if done in the past I would be rich already, but, but, but... but it's stronger than me!!! ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|dizzy_face)

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,THIS
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The call volume is far too high. People buying calls like a year out at 800. I mean, I get it, but it's ridiculous. Just buy one share instead of going for that insane longshot."

Problem is the short interest is now lower than15%, according to this analytics firm that specializes in short squeezes:

His data is usually quite good, from my observations and from their own research is around 90% accurate. Take this with a grain of salt though, they may be flattering themselves on the accuracy of their ML algo.

Either way though, Ortex data shows an similar story, with short interest now the lowest it's been in months. Here is the ortex data from a few days ago:

[https://imgur.com/a/UODnjsy](https://imgur.com/a/UODnjsy)

The question I'd be asking myself, if I was holding, is that IF the gamma squeeze and short squeeze are over, what will keep the stock at 200$? Every analyst see the fundamental value of the company at less than 30$ ( average price target is 14$ on IBKR - based on 7 equity analysts ) . So clearly nobody who is serious or know what they are doing will argue that the stock is worth 200$ now, so the problem is what will keep this stock up if they hype dies down and the apes get nervous? In my opinion we will either see a drastic drop (if we get a panic sell situation) or a slow bleed down with the shorters staying liquid longer than the holders and profiting as it declines."

This is a fight between whales. Every week whales eat up big money calls on GME in attempt to prop it up or tear it down.

That said, buying calls do not effect the underlying price."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I used to play the horses sometimes and the setup is pretty similar to options trading. There are three kinds of betters:
* gamblers (aka most wsb types) 
*  formula betters ( aka TA nerds)
* trip handicappers ( aka people that get paid ) 

The gamblers occasionally win on luck. The formula guys get ground down by the takeout. The track takes 15% off the top and divides it something like 40/60 between the winning horse owners and the track / state. This will absolutely KILL you medium / long term.  There is no way around the takeout. 

The trip handicappers are simply DD lunatics. They watch and take notes on every race. They are looking to exploit anaomies.  When they find something of value they go in. Sometimes the trip handicappers will sit out the whole season. An old timer told me once that horse betting is like playing poker on a boat going down a river. I think the analogy holds for options trading as well."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Puts went up in price as GME went up because people were betting on the bubble popping and the stock crashing.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It was at 900-1200% at one point on some strikes
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Day trading calls can work but I agree. Watched the 3/19 200c go from 3.00 to 21.00 in about 5 minutes Friday

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Normally I‚Äôd be all for buying options and betting for an asymmetric payoff, but it‚Äôs hard to bet for something when you don‚Äôt know who the players are, you don‚Äôt have all the information on current FTD‚Äôs/SI/etc, and there are powers beyond our control that are invested.  You can risk and YOLO and make a ton or you can lose a ton. Right now after the initial YOLO‚Äôs (going from 50 to 100), the IV just spiked.  It may be more attractive if the price stabilized and IV deceases to where options are more affordable.  But IV crush and theta decay are killing right now.  (I have 300k in shares but my 50k in options are dying bad, so I regret it, but I‚Äôm holding)

Buying shares right now at 200 with how much volatility is already a heavy risk.   But at the same time, the spirit of WSB is to do dumb bets.  But at the same time, the biggest winners are those that played it methodically (eg DFV, spy puts during pandemic, etc). Right now we are playing partially blind in GME and just hoping the whales on the long side will pull us through since they have much more information on the situation than we do.  Unfortunately they‚Äôll always be 1 step ahead of us, and we can only react.

Again, not investment advice and I‚Äôm a moron"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Most of the peeps in gme can‚Äôt afford to exercise and are only in the calls to sell it to the next sucker.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,">  why doesn‚Äôt everyone just exercise ‚ÄúITM‚Äù calls?

Because unless they bought it at a hilariously low strike price, they probably don't have the liquidity to do so; a $200 call option would take ***$20,000*** of liquid capital to exercise. Considering how many people are yoloing all-in on GME, they probably just don't have the cash to execute the contract. Maybe they can sit there and excursive it peacemeal, but I'm way too small time to have the money to do it."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That makes literally no sense. Exercising before expiration very rarely makes sense. An obvious reason for that is that the option still has extrinsic value and exercising an ITM call just gets rid of that. Selling the call and buying the shares would get the same end goal but cost less.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You don't exercise your options because it would cost you more than just buying the stock outright.  Even if you bought your options months ago when they were dirt cheap it would still be more cost effective to sell the options and then buy the stock than to exercise your options.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because they are incredibly expensive.

Edit: You‚Äôd also need to be down to about one brain cell left to exercise them."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"My impression is that the calls needed to cause a squeeze were already purchased a year ago, when they were dirt cheap. We should just be buying shares and holding. New apes want to join the fun and think an 800c is a good purchase because its cheap"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,this

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"sure it has, in these niches it supplies a significant part of premium earned by sellers. because no pro is going to be long on these short horizon options at these premiums if they can help it. if they use long calls to hedge, they hedge long duration while shorting short duration. short duration long calls at extreme IV are bag holder territory. especially in US options."

I've been buying and selling calls on GME for months, and it's made me a shit ton of money, because I'm not retarded."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've kept track.  Three weeks ago it was gonna be $800.   The week after,  $600.  Last week, $800.   Please correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't the last monthly report of short percentage for GME only at 30%?   How hard is 30% gonna squeeze?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup. Came for the meme, staying for the turnaround. I don‚Äôt wanna pay a fuck ton of cap gains either. Cohens investment thesis of dominating a niche is ripe for deployment here"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only if it squeezes. Thats whats holding me back. That $5k+ (from option selling smooth brained retards) has been tormenting me since late February, and as this keeps progressing, I am getting the feeling that powerful people are preventing those options from expiring ITM. I know that as soon I as I sell them, we will squeeze hard because my luck is shit. Doing nothing seems to work well in this situation."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs interesting. I‚Äôm not in a position to write covered calls, but who‚Äôs the buyer for that item at this time? Seems like a market for fellow apes who don‚Äôt understand they are wasting their money.

Beyond that, IF it hits 600 (biiiig fuckin IF, imo), it‚Äôs gonna sail right on through to 800 or 1000 and at that point the buyer is probably some short with bigger problems I‚Äôm helping solve.

Idk I‚Äôm a moron."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"However ‚Äúcovering‚Äù one call is 100 shares = $20,000 invested in shares of GME. 

How much premium do you need to make to make up for the $200 loss you take on the shares for every 1% it goes down? If you look at the premium on $300 calls you‚Äôd break even as it passes about -16% from where you bought the shares on 4/16 calls. That could happen in a day or two. 

There‚Äôs an enormous amount of people in this sub that shouldn‚Äôt be putting $20k into one stock, let alone this one. 

This isn‚Äôt investment advice but I do own cats and cats are smarter than dogs."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish I had 100 shares to do that with. They‚Äôre so expensive now.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah this is good advice, I was able to get a couple thousand $ premium from 4/16 $700 calls that I sold covered."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was saying this in other threads and a lot of chimps doubted me.

I sold 2 contracts 11/19 800C nearly 2 weeks ago for 20K because the premium was over $100.

Best case - they expire worthless. Medium case - I buy back or they exercise. Worst case - they exercise and it miraculously does go over $1000/share"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The problem is that your shares won‚Äôt get called away at $600. The squeeze will likely go up and right back down (well below $600) in the matter of one day. No one is going to exercise during the squeeze and your contract isn‚Äôt going to expire with the SP above $600.

If you don‚Äôt care about the squeeze, then it is a very good tactic - just know that you‚Äôll 100% miss it if it does happen."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,i had the last couple weeks. free money literally
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone that believes in a real squeeze would be dumb to do this. Just a way for the hedgies to pay 600 a share instead of 1m a share.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea, I thought about that too. Then I realized I‚Äôm risking selling my shares for a measly $20 extra, plus $600/share, when the price is on the rise to $10k"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Halts don‚Äôt actually directly impact price and are generally automatic when a stock‚Äôs volatility spikes. While there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical of certain dates or price targets, trading halts don‚Äôt make the list."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Halts happen as a percentage (10%) of movement in a stock within any 5 minute time span. So as the price of the underlying increases the number to reach that 10% threshold also increase. That being said, if a stock is only being sold for 20% over the current price then that stock will get sold at market triggering a halt but not staying within the 10% confinement."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Halts occur with a 10% change in price in less than 5 minutes. So even if it just barely trips that rule 5 minutes of trading and 5 of halt it's possible for a 500% increase in a day. It could trip the rule in less time and cycle through 10% increases even faster. My math might be off its early.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It will not and I had a thread nuked by some p'tahk of a mod for pointing this out. Could GME hit 10k per share over a long period of time - absolutely.  Could it Moon to 10k+ - in the course of a en epic gamma --> short squeeze?  Not a chance in hell.

Loose 1bn - it's your problem, loose 100bn and it's the feds problem.

See [LTCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management) for precedence on what happens when a hedge fund over-leverages (27 to 1) into a bad position and is facing a margin call of 100bn; with potential of derivative losses exceeding 1 Trillion.  The fed stepped in, liquidated the firm and forced every major bank/counter-party to take and hold the underlying positions.

Also see [Wamu](https://www.thebalance.com/washington-mutual-how-wamu-went-bankrupt-3305620) or [Bear Stearns](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/bear-stearns-collapse.asp) for other examples of how the Fed can and will step into to stop systemic risk.

If GME start's mooning and gets to the point where hedge funds are dumping otherwise unrelated stock to cover margin calls that's where the Fed will step in, and it's probably at a price point not too much north of about $2,500 per share (putting GME's market cap at 125bn)

How can the Fed act if you diamond handed apes don't sell your shares cause you are setting your own price to stick it to the hedgies?  They will force other market makers to offset the shorts at a price the fed decides - which will effectively crash the price back down to pre-moon levels.

Why would a market maker agree to this?  Ask [bear-stearns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_Stearns#Fed_bailout_and_sale_to_JPMorgan_Chase) how rebuffing the LTCM bailout went for them."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Personally my hope is for a TSLA esque squeeze where the stock squeezes up to $500-$1000 a share over the next 3-9 months. 

That was my hope when I bought back in at $45 a month ago.

At this point though it seems too volatile to do that."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Remember sir, this is a casino."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not just talking about the current price.  It is dynamic, including the money they'll need to put up as collateral.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôd buy more calls if the IV was lower, otherwise IV keeps dropping.  Price of GameStop is mostly sideways, not good for buying calls until IV drops.  Good for selling calls.  Once IV drops enough you can load up and not lose much in terms of IV and theta.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"We're not just buying GME options. Low IV stocks can yield immediate gains. Try a non-shit broker and get 0dte SPY calls or puts in a peak or valley and watch a $600 investment turn into $1,200 in 5 minutes. Or go to $200. That's the fun part. SPY's IV ranges 20-30%."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,He is assuming it reaches BE only on the day of expiration. I turned 5k into 32k when IV was more than 300%.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Um. Sure. If GME goes to $2000 owning calls will be hugely profitable. Good luck.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"What is it, the rule of 16? So if IV is 100, then that means 6.25% shift is needed to yield profit by expiry. IV gets high, like you said, when there are dramatic swings. It's best to be in early but if not, and if you can anticipate an up/down swing, you'll still profit."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct. People can sell earlier, if the stock spikes, they will make money. 

However, many people do a quick breakeven calculation in their head and don‚Äôt consider breakeven vs owning stock. 

Also I haven‚Äôt been here long but seems like this sub is fucking terrible at selling options before expiration."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Um. In which case you are better off owning shares than options. Stock at $150 April 16th: example above shares are worth $3375. Options are worth a big fat zero. Max loss in both is $4500, if you buy shares that only happens if stock goes to $0 if you buy options that happens if stock isn‚Äôt > Strike on expiration and you haven‚Äôt sold."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Very logically this should be the last GME week, the MM releasing millions of shares Monday and the earning Tuesday evening will bring everybody back on Earth. The reality is going to hardly beat some kids!"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The implied volatility (IV) could be going down based on the decline in volume at certain points. It‚Äôs still crazy.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's how they work, lower security price, higher premium for the put."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you mean ""puts going down"""
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They are the ones selling calls and collecting premium
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve made some good change selling 800s.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I blew 2,400 on options that expired yesterday too. Figured 300 would have hit this week, was wrong. Very, very wrong. Haha"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Welcome. First ones free
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah then you are even more retarded because thats Not how you force a Gamma Squeeze
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean if people were smart, they‚Äôd sell the contract if, they bought monthlys, as weeklies instead of always buying dailies."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"you can sell 10-20% of the options (or 50%, i don't know) and exercise the rest."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Perfect, Im qualified"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's a possibility that those 800 calls are sold both by MM and whales to pray on smaller retails. 
Same for low puts. If you have 100 shares it's free money. Multiply it by thousands and it's lots of free money. Again using hype to profit. This is smart money in play.

 Imagine DFV with 100k shares selling 1000 of those 800 calls for a 1.5 premium (many were sold at higher during high IV), 150 grands there on weeklies. And if it really hits the 800 strike, can't really whine on selling for that price.

At the same time, can easily sell covered puts for free money.

Point still stands, more money makes money."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Breaks even around $460 with shares if you buy a 420c for next week. 

Might as well buy 2.3 shares and reduce risk. If it hits $500 the option would make you a few bucks more than shares.

It would have e to hit 480 or so on Monday to double share profit."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I was there man lol. I watched one guy turn $100 into $100k in one day. The calls were $0.03. Don‚Äôt believe me scroll back like 8 weeks. The posts are there.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am holding and I‚Äôm selling covered calls as well. Not all of them because I want some deep powder. But enough on the BI-weeklies to collect premium at exits that I would be totally satisfied with. 

Thank you for the reco though. It is solid advice with the IV where it‚Äôs at and I‚Äôm an idiot, so you never know."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They‚Äôre not selling calls. They‚Äôre selling Puts.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm a realist.  That's the chance I am willing to take.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL, apparently Mr. Chopsticks doesn't know Friday's closing price"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly .

It also drives me crazy that people don‚Äôt seem to understand options at all. Yes, premiums on shit like GME have been insanely high lately. But you don‚Äôt need to be ITM to make a profit. People here see posts about ‚Äúway to light your money on fire , idiot‚Äù, yet they don‚Äôt realize you can sell the option again prior to expiration . I can make money on options with super high premium if I don‚Äôt hold until expiration.

Show me the days of wallstreetbets when we ONLY did idiotic options plays . This ‚Äúbuy and hold forever !!!‚Äù  Belongs in /personalfinance ."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, whatever. But can you refute my points or not? It doesn't matter how smart I think you are or vice versa. I'm looking for reasoned debate not petty insults."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks however i have read this before, and I believe its still true that calls make more money than shares"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,tail risk.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,At $800 strike prices?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Well maybe it‚Äôs best you sell so we get the squeeze we‚Äôve been waiting for. Always one retard has to take the hit. You 1st.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just buy 200 and use half for covered calls. With your luck, your covered calls will trigger the moass and you'll have 100 shares worth 69420.69 leftover!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I can promise you now it‚Äôs not going 5k+ I will personally cut off my toes and eat them if that happens
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell a call and buy a higher call. Sell one at $600 and buy an $800 one and you should still be able to make some good money on the spread.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Just sell a call that you‚Äôll be happy selling for. If you are comfortable letting some go for 800 then choose that.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is me. I'm comfortable with the amount of money I put into it, but also can‚Äôt really afford to buy more. If shit hits the fan, I‚Äôll sleep better blaming fate than an uninformed emotion fueled decision I made.

I‚Äôve accepted my buy-in as the price of admission for this wild ride that, if nothing else, has been quite an enlightening experience."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Here‚Äôs how you game the ‚Äúshit luck‚Äù persona. Sell half of your shares and hold the other half. No matter what you win.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just buy a 1y call option and sell deep otm weeklies against it. You are neutral in the case of a squeeze regarding options, and you have your shares as well. If we do squeeze, buy back the one you wrote, break the 1Y into a couple monthlies and put the rest back into shares.

You get to make a weekly profit, your shares are protected against an overnight gap up, and you have enough money in the leap to split it and increase your leverage."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You can sell calls and always roll them out if it touches the share price and continue collecting higher premiums.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Man I‚Äôve been 100% on board with the GameStop short squeeze thesis since I first heard of it back in like October of last year, but let‚Äôs be real here... it already happened. The Volkswagen infinity squeeze in 08 sent the stock from 200 to 1000 in a few days, that‚Äôs a 400% increase. GameStop on the other hand went from 20 to 483 in a few days, that‚Äôs a 2,315% increase. 

I‚Äôm not saying there couldn‚Äôt be another squeeze, because the mechanism behind what‚Äôs causing this one is much more long lasting than the mechanism that caused the VW squeeze, but if there is one it won‚Äôt be anywhere close to the first one. That‚Äôs because every player in this game right now KNOWS what‚Äôs going on. 

There was a minute there where the hedge funds didn‚Äôt know what was brewing against them but now there is no question. It‚Äôs an in your face out in the open battle vs a guerrilla warfare type battle."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"tl;cr... Yo, tell my girlfriend to move her fat ass.

Need something to squeeze over here."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It is kind of like one ape eating another
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Writing $250 calls and buying $350. My theory is that if we move, we move hard, so might as well take advantage of the IV."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably a good amount of buyers of these options are apes but not necessarily.

During GMEs first run up CNBCs Fast Money (show at noon) ignored it for the first few days. Then once it hit in the 300s I remember Steve Weiss (CIO of Short Hills Capital) said on air that he just bought $45p expiring mid March.

I‚Äôm sure he probably sold those as GME tanked but if he held to this point those options are still OTM. A lot of big buyers have a bit of hubris concerning GME and think they know which way it will trade.

For the most part I respect a lot of what Steve Weiss says on that show, he seems to be fairly level headed and more aligned with my mindset than the others, but when he said he was buying puts on GME I immediately thought it was a dumb idea and that he didn‚Äôt actually understand the reason for the run up."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for this outstanding observation. Totally adjusting my options strategy now. Are you doing this, and are you using 2 week expirations for selling covered calls?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,People would be better off writing cash secured puts in the $50-100 strike range.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Your assuming everyones cost basis is 200.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If someone is holding 1000+ shares then selling calls wouldn't be bad passive income. Let's say 1 each at 300, 400, 500, 600 which would be at roughly 10, 5, 3, 2 respectively for 3/26. That would be $2,000 actual earnings for the week. The risk would be loosing out of the moon above the strike price."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same. Sell 2 week out way OTM, close with a week left and wash, rinse, repeat. The theta is too great on these to ignore."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct if the stock is going to $10,000 covered call writing wouldn‚Äôt be a good strategy. But I‚Äôd be writing calls around the 10,000 level for sure"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"In the interest of full disclosure I do not own GME. It‚Äôs too risky for me. Having said that it‚Äôs my belief that the majority of the WSB longs in this name will be long whether it is $1,000 or $25. If that is your mindset and your not selling at least you can earn some juicy premium to cushion a big fall if it happens. For anyone who can truly trade the name I wouldn‚Äôt contemplate this. It is still a risky trade even writing calls."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,how can this be true? after halting the price gap up or down
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is just toilet thoughts so bear with me. 390 minutes in the trading day and 5 minute halts. If it halted the second it started moving again would be 78 halts throughout the day. And a 10% increase each time. So a possible 780% increase? But no, it's some exponential bullshit like 100 to 110 to 121 to 133.10 is 3 separate 10% increases but 100 to 133.10 isn't a 30% increase. I'm probably wrong but it might be x=1.1^78. if you started with $100 it would be x=100(1.1)^78. And x is what you'd end up with after 10% increases every 5 minutes for 6.5 hours. Someone with math help.

Just did that math. And it comes to $169,289.27.

*Flush*"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It can start off from the halt at any price, there's no cap on gains in a single day.

Hell it could jump up up 500% in a single trade and then be halted. There's no cap."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I conceptually agree with you, although the actual price point they step in is anyone's guess. The timing will be lousy and they are guaranteed to screw retail somehow, that much is certain. Federal government has never, not once, taken the side of the common person in these scenarios.

Will probably get downvoted for saying this, but in a completely sentiment-based situation, should definitely be selling at different price points on the way up. The way you become a bag holder is to try and time a top. Would hate to see a lot of peoples hopes get crushed by the scenario you describe."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd be more then happy with $800-$1000 a share.. it's just sad to see so many people genuinely believe that gme is gonna go to 100k a share.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Interesting. So you think the liquidation of Bear Stearns was in revenge for them refusing to the LTCM terms? Crazy to think about.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"People forget about the institutional holders.  They will sell their shares, before the price reaches $10k/share. The short interest ratio would drop, due to the increase in the float(denominator)."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It wont.  Tsla and GME are different.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It went sideways all week.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have four pieces of evidence showing that the short squeeze did in fact happen Friday to Tuesday January 22‚Äì26, and that the short interest currently is approx 30%. It‚Äôs summarised below with links to relevant sources. 

Du you reject these facts? And what is your evidence that GME has 130% short interest?

1.	The volume during the three days of the short squeeze spiked to an insane almost 200 million shares per day, compared to a normal less than 10 million before January. On Wednesday when the short squeeze was over volume subsided to less than 100 million despite a massive media hype, and it has never been near 200 million shares since. 
2.	Melvin capital admitted to losing about 7 BILLION Dollars in January which is fully sufficient to explain the massive drop in short interest before January 29 (approx 40 million shares)
3.	Short interest peaked at 70M shares in December but dropped to 60M in mid January and 20M by January 29. It is now below 14M.
4.	Cost to borrow GME shares peaked at an insane 84% during the short squeeze in January but has dropped since and is now more than 100x lower at a historical low of 0.5%.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just want to point out that my OP was a response to this post:

>	What company has a 30% SI? If you know basic mathematics and aren‚Äôt new to trading, you would know GME has an SI over over 130% at the very least still. Nothing was covered. Doesn‚Äôt take much work to figure it out either. So fuck off shill

I think I have shown that the poster was way out of line. There was a massive short squeeze back in January were most shorts were covered. What you are saying is that we don‚Äôt know what kind of bets have been placed outside of exchanges. And I agree, we don‚Äôt. But we also have no evidence of a future short squeeze in GME or that 130% of the float is currently shorted (as the post I replayed to claimed)."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you do not anticipate a substantial rise in the price of GME, then you don‚Äôt buy calls. 

If, however, you do anticipate a substantial rise, IV doesn‚Äôt matter. Sure, you run the risk of IV crush, but if GME pops, the IV will pop with it.

It‚Äôs moot.

OP‚Äôs retarded. I wouldn‚Äôt mind had this retarded cult not taken over this sub.

Edit: also this ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a financial advisor‚Äù line is stupid. No one is going to sue you for a comment on what is essentially an anonymous forum."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah. Options don't have to be as risky as some of the absolute bat shit crazy bets on here. A deep OTM call option could be worth nothing at expiration and is essentially gambling. But the market can make millionares by some small anomalies that make crazy rallies. Thus the obsession with WSB to find those plays. Typically people on here are willing to take much more risk for the chance at a some awe inspiring reward.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Minor correction--you don't need to be exactly right on the price.  The general direction is fine.  Option value goes up with volatility and as the price approaches your strike.

If you bought GME 800c's when the price was $100 and sold when it was $300, you made a TON of money.  You just have to be right about the direction and upcoming volatility.  The option price will be higher if GME does $100 -> $300 -> $250 -> $300 -> $200 than if it slowly climbed gradually from $100 to $200 in the same time period.  People are getting crushed by GME options because the price is already way high due to the volatility.  If you buy options in a stock trading sideways that suddenly shoots up, even if it doesn't shoot up to your strike price, you can easily 5x your money.

Options are a way to leverage change in stock, sort of like a mega leveraged equity with an expiration date.

Since stonks always go up, if you bought long SPY calls instead of SPY shares, you'd have made way more money."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Or you need to own enough volume to force a security to hit your price target when you need it to...

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Noob here, so are you saying you can sell the option prior to it's expiration when it's in a positive position?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Um rule of 16 converts annual to daily. So 100% implied vol means 6.25% *per day.* GME options implying 300% vol mean you are paying for it to move 18.75% per day, or $37.50 per day based on $200 stock price."

Take $40K of that premium and buy 200 shares at the current market of $200.

If GME dropped to $64 and someone bought my contract or it expired at that price I'd be -$12K (according to online calc), but sell my 200 shares for $12.8K to cover leaving the extra $800.

I don't know why anyone would buy this put from me so guessing this would just expire. Is this correct or am I still not getting this?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôd have to spend $20,000 to hedge it. The max right now is $690 strike 41 days it at $14.20. $1420 right now with a $20,000 investment to get it doesn‚Äôt sound worth it, especially if gme drops $14.20/share. Even $300 is $45.93"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I frankly can‚Äôt imagine DFV doing that.

MMs sure. That‚Äôs a pretty easy win."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt mess with options at all yet, but I‚Äôm pretty sure when I read up on puts that selling a put was a contract that guaranteed you will ‚Äúbuy‚Äù shares at the strike. They‚Äôre just giving you the premium to lock it in. And since you‚Äôre buying for more than they give you it‚Äôs not free money unless the price is going up."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What? That has literally 0 relevance to the 'actual gamma squeeze happened when options were cheap'.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, people are selling 800c weeklies and making money, not as near as much as a 300c or 400c, but still.

A part of me suspects everyone is going to wise up at the same time and cause a market crash. Then options are going to get regulated to hell.

It should be criminal for me to bank 20-30% of a shares value in days or weeks. 

EDIT: repeatedly. over. and over."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I wouldn't sell put unless the strike was under 60-70. I think it's safe around there. 

My risk tolerance is different, but I truly believe this is a $100+ ticker with the current market cap"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Profit is profit.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, sure. One, SI is likely inaccurate as SI decrease from over 100% to where you put it would have caused much more obvious price movement. Two, $GME is being shorted through ETFs. Both of these pieces of information have been talked to death on this sub for the past forever. This leads me to believe that you are either a shill spreading FUD or you're a bit of a dip."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah, I personally don't believe it will get there, but I hope I'm wrong. 

I truly think shorts got off (for the most part) when RH and citadel restricted trading and people panic sold on the way down from the 1st squeeze. At least the larger positions that could vault this to 1k+. That asshole on Bloomberg event admitted that it would have maybe hit 2k. Which would have made me a multi millionaire. So trust me, I'm pissed, and have been in this trade since NOV2020.

I could see this trading anywhere from 100-400 for awhile, because people genuinely are rooting for a turnaround, and it's happening rapidly happening. But the premiums are so nice. Weeklies are making me a ton of money, and safely too."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Risking $20k for $400?  Nice advice retard
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Very well said. I totally agree. WSB brilliantly exploited a perfect storm of technical factors and caught HFS with their pants down. They won‚Äôt let that happen again.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Word. Post the porn please.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've just barely figured out the basics of what calls are, gonna have to go figure out how puts work to understand your comment lol. 

If Weiss is still holding those puts, the person who sold those puts can now demand Weiss cough up 100shares per put at $45 per share, even though the current exchange price is ~$200? I get that they're basically inverse calls and I know where to go learn more, but my brain struggles with puts for some reason. Like I said, I'm a moron.

If I've got that wrong, I think I still understand the core of your point: he (a bigger player, not an ape) bet it would be way lower now than it is, and he did it out of hubris and failure to understand the GME market. Therefore, there are probably more big players playing the call game, too, not just small apes. Great counter example. Thanks."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just remember selling covered calls isn‚Äôt really a bullish or bearish idea over the length of the options contract. You‚Äôd prefer the stock to stay relatively stable. If it‚Äôs just not a stable stock, you have higher call premiums due to the volatility and the chance that it might moon/tank. Long term if you‚Äôre selling covered calls you are bullish on the stock. You‚Äôd just prefer it to go up in between when you have call options written.  

All you need to remember is that options are a bet with a time frame. Start by thinking what YOU think will happen over x period of time, and then buy/write/combine whatever options you want just knowing that you‚Äôre totally guessing. Know what your best case, worst case and in the middle case turnouts are. If you do all that options are pretty simple. 

In the case of the guy you‚Äôre responding to he‚Äôs just talking about the simple fact that GameStop could go down a LOT. Sure writing covered calls is nice and guaranteed money, but that means nothing I‚Äôd the stock drops a ton and you‚Äôre left holding bags. BUT that‚Äôs also why you can get such high premiums so as a bet, you should be happy that this scenario is available. It‚Äôs a higher risk higher reward play. If you‚Äôre not into the higher risk higher reward plays there are a jillion other stocks/options to play."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Unfortunately my account isn't big enough to want to tie up $5k to $10k. I did make some money selling csps in the 30s but I think the premium is too low at this point.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Just checking prices.  IV died down quite a bit last week with the prices going pretty much sideways.   50 strike CSP only nets you about 32 bucks for Mar 26.  Holding up 5k for 32 bucks doesn't seem worth it.  Unless your long the stock and want to wheel it.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm currently deploying this strategy with a slightly higher strike and making absolute bank.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actually no, that is the current price so even if you paid a dollar for those shares you do in fact have $20k worth of shares (with a sweet gain) and those shares have a risk of losing value (some of your sweet gain). The break even in this example is based on the premium you‚Äôre getting for the options and how that isn‚Äôt just all gravy if the stock drops 20%. 

My point is selling covered calls isn‚Äôt some utopia with no downside. There is a downside and the risk of that downside is why you‚Äôre getting so much in premium. 

No free lunches."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"All I know is that with just 100+ shares I am regularly making $1400 a week and I'm not selling calls lower than 300, I'm essentially lowering my cost average 10% every week we don't moon. Of course if we moon I'm gonna miss out on the shares under contract..but I keep buying more shares with the premiums"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You are only talking about opportunity risk. You‚Äôre not talking about the risk of holding $200k+ in shares that has a downside break even point with the ‚Äúincome‚Äù you‚Äôre getting for those covered calls.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Risk it mooning, then coming back to normal levels while you're stuck holding your shares because it's 2 weeks before expiration"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Another risk is having your hands tied if the price starts to collapse.

Price starts to collapse ape panics and decides its over sells his shares before he closes his calls, Order Filled: 1000 GME @ 170. Then it happens. The thrusters turn on. 50k\\Share. The first notice comes in.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,üòÇ I think you would be an idiot if you didn‚Äôt try to. Someone buying it at that price would be a whole different story. It is a sound strategy on a relatively stabilized stock for something extra. But GME has shown that it is anything but stable.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well if you have bought the underlying stock when the price was close to 40, writing the calls are not that risky. Especially if it is part of a spread."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This year I think 4/20 is on April 23th because of some leap years not accounted for

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"> I'm probably wrong but it might be x=1.1^78

You‚Äôre not wrong, that‚Äôs the correct formula for compounding interest.

I think the full version is something like *T*=*x*(*c*)^*n* where *x* is your initial value, *c* is the interest rate as a form of 1 for multiplication, and *n* is the number of cycles for interest to compound, and *T* is the final number."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sonofamelvin, this is a home for retards. You‚Äôre way to smart. But pretty numbers!!!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your scenario is possible, there is a lot of assumptions to it's a big range. The price can also jump over 10% for example if the base was $100 and the bid went from $109.95 right to $110.50. It would halt there with a 10.5% increase. There is also a rule at the end of the day, I'm too lazy to look it up but I think, if it halts and would unhalt after 3:45 then it's done for the day."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn, you can think that clearly when you're on the toilet? Well done."

Yeah - I got thoroughly roasted for posting my position

* In at 118 
* 37% out at 325 on 3/10
* 37% out at 265 on 3/11
* 25% out at 241 on 3/15

Why I sold

* 325 safed my initial investment
* 265 - Volume/volatility had collapsed at this point.  We had needed to crack 350 the prior day to put the options at $500+ in play as these were some of the last big option tranches written on the old risk models.  This was really the last shot of a realistic moon
* 240 - Felt there was a better chance of another price collapse than there was a moon-shot.  Took my chips off the table to play again.

I doubled up after accounting for taxes in the span of 2 weeks.  I'm good with that."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a price I'll be happy to sell at - but I'll be sure to keep one in no matter what to YOLO that shit as high as it can go! 100k is the dream baby
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I assume we've read the same DD. So why do you think this is going to 1k maximum?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wondered about that number so went ahead and ""researched""(googled highest stock prices) and learned pretty quickly that most of the numbers being thrown out are ridiculous. 

The interview on YouTube with the Wolf of Wallstreet was insightful. If you get greedy and try to time the peak, you're going to lose."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"People forget too that if the stock soars to an absolutely insane price, absolutely no one will be buying on the way down. Say it climbs up to $800 a share and people start selling there; the price tanks and if you‚Äôre still holding, you‚Äôll be holding all the way down."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"That what I'm afraid of, the only real chance of reaching astronomical prices would be if both insiders and institutions went through a blackout period, say appointment of a new CEO."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think we've already seen that. On the Wednesday when it dropped 150 in a matter of minutes people were wondering why there wasn't a huge drop in available short shares. The easiest explanation was that it was genuine selling rather than short selling. 

We've also seen articles suggesting that institutional investors are making money selling covered calls. It's not a leap to think that maybe a large investor had sold a lot of 350 calls and noped the price down so their calls didn't bite them."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Completely different.

But what it has that is similar is a charismatic CEO with a history of success and beating the odds.

So traditional valuations aren't necessarily applicable to GME at any point in the near future.

*I guess Ryan Cohen isn't the CEO yet. But he does own somewhere between 14% and 20% of the company, just got a seat on the board of directors, a bunch of his friends/former employees just got hired, and there is a push for him to become the CEO and/or chairman of the board."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"1. Volume by itself indicates nothing about short interest or short squeezes. 
2. Melvin also lied about closing their positions before the first spike, why trust them now? 
3. Even the GME hearings have now acknowledged there are ways to hide SI including ETF shorting, dark pool/OTC trading, total return swaps, synthetic shares and more. 
4. Cost to borrow shares is less now , sure.

You also don't acknowledge all the recent media manipulation/misdirection/distractions we have seen recently, nor does it mention citadel recently raising capital, nor anything about that 10 minutes being removed from the hearing."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I almost feel bad for you. However, just almost."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you remember the last time you got laid? Must been years with that attitude.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The problem is that there are unknown forces that are in the game.  We retailers don‚Äôt have all the data to make a smart play without risking losing money from theta.  I‚Äôve made some money by buying 1-2DTE calls when the prices tanked and selling 0DTE when there was a small push raising it enough, but overall it‚Äôs risky for most investors.  I have a few long calls along with my basic shares as well, but I‚Äôm not a pure YOLO‚Äôer and it is high risk (but my regular income can support it).  Most people who just want to invest and support GameStop can buy the shares and hold and hope that Cohen has a great plan or the long whales outlast and push.

In the spirit of WSB, sure going YOLO on calls is what this sub was about.  But a lot of people jumped into this sub without spending time to read before hand and are making poor decisions off bad DD.  The best play for them is to buy long term and invest (which isn‚Äôt what this sub is for).

Again not investment advice."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tbf if you simply bought monthlies on any tech ticker this past year they would‚Äôve printed massively and you would probably think you‚Äôre a genius, thus serving as a gateway toward weekly calls where you end up losing your shirt"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Rule of the thumb is : buy weeklies when they are 600% otm to maximise your potential returns
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably not actually. If you bought GME 800c's when the price was 100 and sold when it was 300, then you had 1 -2 weeks of theta killing your option's value. Maybe if you bought a monthly for April or May then maybe theta would have mattered less than the price increase. But the last few weeks saw something like 100k 800c's expire."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I kinda agree with him.  There used to be other meme stocks on here and I'd make good money from them if I chose my plays carefully and confirmed DD with my own research.  Even though I do like making money off of GME, this isn't the same sub anymore.  And there are way too many comments claiming that GME will go to $10,000 which is incredibly unrealistic.  I get that it's a meme, but it's becoming a stupid circlejerk with every post being about GME.  At least with TSLA and others there was still variety"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Time travel back a year or five ago? When r/wsb was a fun time of degenerate gamblers, not zealots praying for a lottery ticket. 

If you want option plays, maybe try r/thetagang, but you better have your big boy pants on for options."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you want to learn about them, the important parts are: theta (how much it loses every day), IV (if it's high, you better be betting a huge swing to get $ back), and delta (higher the #, the more the option price changes as the stock goes up or down). 


So for SPY, it's like 390 now. Look at the website https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html 

Enter SpY as the ticker, choose a call like 1 month away @ 400 for example. 

Now look at the screenshot - https://imgur.com/AsnoxXK 

This is showing you how every day, the value of this 4/16 SPY 400C goes down by about 6 dollars. If you bought it today, it would cost about $183. Tomorrow, if the stock didnt change AT ALL, it would be worth $177. BUT if Monday, SPY rocketed to 400 in one day, you would have paid $183 and watched as your option went up to $612. 

This is just one example, then you have covered calls/puts and other strategies. Check youtube and you'll find good explainers for this stuff.

It all depends on what you want out of this - actual steady gains? Probably just get stocks, and maybe solid ETFs. Want dividend payments? Research that too. Or just straight up gambling and don't expect to get your money back? Then do calls or puts."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. In fact it doesnt even have to break even for you to make money. Look ip how delta and gamma works for a better explanation.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah this happened to me with GME but the stock jumped like 1000% fml
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,If you sold covered calls you could buy back the calls at any time and then sell the stock.    You are not locked in.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Some guy bought both calls and puts, price changed, and both rose in price. But I won't teach you options. If you dont get them, stay away."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're missing the last step.  You wrote puts at 600.  So whoever bought it has the right to force you to buy 100 shares at 600.  If GME drops to $64, they're going to exercise that option, and you will have to pay $60,000 to buy another 100 shares which are now worth $64."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree to a certain extent. I think for options to exist premium needs to have major upside. 

Hoping there is no regulation, the IV will naturally drop from from Time, then we can load up again. Hard to buy a monthly call at 50% premium. 

But a ladder could speed this up.  At the same time, in the shower this morning, I realized that I am comfortable being here 3/19/22 and beyond. Never leaving before the mission is complete. Then never fully exiting because GME changed my families life.

If on Friday the stock is up, I just roll it out to next week and collect more premium. If you never plan on selling the shares... might as well. Using CC's to hedge against drop in share price and also make a bit of ""passive"" income. I never hold the option until expiration.

Each week drops your cost basis by like $20-30. So by now after a couple weeks my AVG share price is about $70."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,MODS!!!

Wait. What kind of chips?"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"No shit. Joking is fine, but this is a serious line to cross."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Its not happening my dude. Hell I would say it‚Äôs probably not ever going to see north of 600$ again this year. But thats not something I would bet against.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"oh yeah, you goofed bruh"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,ü§£ü§£ü§£ I've used reddit since you were in diapers sucking on your mom's tiddies.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn't it strange how many times these shill accounts are exactly 38 days old at the time of the shill posts?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you even know what a shill is?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Then it will collapse prior to expiration and you never get your shares called and youre stuck with a bunch of limp already squoze shares and shame.  


Let's be real though you're probably going to diamond hand to 1k\\share and then get greedy and watch it fall back to 100\\share then we will have 3 more months of apes begging for the rocket to come back and pick them up at 600 while the entirety of WSB talks about phantom shares with ladders."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I keep seeing people talk about SI being high, but how do we know this? It feels like there's no reliable reporting on it. Not trying to spread fud, and I am a patient ape and have no problem holding, but I can't help but wonder what happens if we're hoping for a squeeze but there's nothing there to be squozen? Are there any accurate, reliable reports on SI? Or are we just assuming there's so much shady market fuckery that something has to be going on? Either way I'm holding just to see what happens."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,üòÇüòÇüòÇ $5k per share. Amazing.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You're comparing Tesla to GameStop üòÇ
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,comparing Tesla to gamestop lmfao its never going above 1k i hate to break it to you
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"News flash: the short interest is not enormous anymore. Are you still living in January?

""Very easily surpass $5k/share"" so eeeeasy üòÇ"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I'm thinking this will place out more like that as long as Cohen keeps executing."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Short interest has been decreasing since January
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,lmao if you actually think 5k+ is a possibility
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, because it's never happening."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It's never happening. Not 5000. In what world does gamestop legitimately achieve a 300+ billion market cap?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,And yet one month later it went from 40 to 300.  There had not been a short squeeze only gamma squeezes
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"He made $10million from his puts.

Put is the option (but not the obligation) to sell stocks at strike price. So if it goes below, market price - strike price - premium is the margin you profit from. You can also sell it at anytime even if the target is not hit. So you can still make money if it goes towards the direction your predicting enough with sufficient time left."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see IV pick up just before earnings announcement. Apes will jack IV to stupid levels. Perfect time to sell calls
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Considering he's saying people shouldnt be putting 20k into one stock. Well if their cost basis is 5,10,15,20,40 bucks they didnt put in 20k to get 100 shares regardless of the current market value"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can retire on $2,000 per week though."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Well don't go naked silly ape
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,2 weeks out is more time to hit but generally sells for more.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I sold $400s on Monday, expiring this coming week for $20; bought for $6 or $7 yesterday. 

Week before I sold the $800s for $12, bought for $~2

I could wait but I didn‚Äôt want to be short during earnings as this can go anywhere. 

But still... $1300 for something I wasn‚Äôt going to sell and if it jumped to $400... oh well I still made 10x my purchase price and there are worse problems to have."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,True. The way I look at it writing covered calls OTM is something for Apes in Captivity to consider. They clearly don‚Äôt have the ability to get out of captivity and sell their shares. At least they can earn some money while in captivity.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,no
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because there are way too many institutions and retail investors that would have sky-high profits at $800-$1000 for them not to sell, causing the price to plummet."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not that I think GME will ever hit these prices but the highest stock price currently is BRK.A and it is trading at just north of $380,000 per share."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The people pushing that are also holding on to one metric fuckton of GME shares. I believe we all have voting rights now.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt agree with everything he‚Äôs saying but I have exited my GME position now because of his 4th point. They are paying 1% interest on their borrowed shares, unless the price has a hiuuuuge spike there‚Äôs literally no pressure on them to cover."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,">	Volume by itself indicates nothing about short interest or short squeezes.

Well, good then it wasn‚Äôt by itself. 

I also gave you short interest data, Melvin‚Äôs own account as well as borrowing fees. All four pieces of evidence points to the same thing: the short squeeze happened on January 22‚Äì26."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"ShillBot.exe stopped working, do you want to report the problem?


                       Yes                          No"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You know what, that is investment advice and I‚Äôm suing you!

Nah not really. You make good points about the risks newbies are unwittingly taking. But to your broader point on risk, that‚Äôs applicable to most securities. We retailers don‚Äôt know anything, we can only react. Whether it‚Äôs GME or KO."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What happens to the shirt?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Apparently I just like to watch my options go red no matter how far out I buy. I made a quick $100 off a $10 option when I first started, then bought $100 worth of $10 options aaaaaaaaand it‚Äôs gone. 

Am poor ape with very little invested and only 3 gme but gotta start somewhere. Much wrkinles to gain, many smooths now for investing"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, Dad (:"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I read a book called lifecycle investing that recommended this strat, like a leveraged passive investing."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I still wear diapers.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. I'm working my way there. I take it in parts and try to digest them and take my time. I currently only own shares. I see the allure of options. It really turns on hardcore mode for this stock game. Most expensive game I've ever played btw. I'm currently content on normal mode until I get it all down. Even then I have a tendency to second guess myself which isn't the best thing for a gambler to do. Takes all the fun out of it and replaces it with stress. Either way, I'll cross that bridge once I understand how its built.

I appreciate you taking the time to help educate myself. It has been helpful."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, wallstreetBETS is about options, not safe stock. Hence why I said you might as well go into VTSAX"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"True, but currently 100% in GME shares so if I sold the covered call now and the price went to $800 I wouldn't have enough to buy the call back."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't worry I have no intention, especially knowing so little on the subject. My question was based on my lack of knowledge but assumption on how people hedge. Typically they use calls but I used buying shares for simplicity."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,We only have bananas.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Love that channel. Watched his longer explanations of options, understood pretty much nothing but the basic math, went and found a few cheap calls I think have a chance of printing (not GME), bought em and now watching and learning."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The pricing models are heavily reliant on calc.  If you want to invest, you need to understand the mechanics of the market.  If you place bets, knowing long calls go up when stocks go up is sufficient"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I think he was getting at that it would be helpful...more knowledge the better I presume.  I'm willing to explore anything to help make informed bets on options when the time comes.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Appreciate you letting me know that, though.  It definitely eases my mind some lol"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you kind of do but people over estimate calc. It's hard to solve calculus problems, but if you can understand velocity and acceleration, you're pretty much there."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Specialism? Like concentration or field of study? Sounds like you might have been a grad student. 

I only have a B.S. in applied math. But I‚Äôd assume pricing options would require a masters minimum given the sheer complexity of options. I have passed 5 of the actuary exams, so I feel like I may have the right foundations in probability theory, financial markets, risk, and finance math to make use of math in trading/options strategies, but who knows lol"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You don't have to be very smart to get the basics.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Time will tell my guess is they were naked on the 800s the 400s is the interesting one.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh, your theory is that the MM are selling covered OTM calls. Maybe. It would be a safe, easy way to make money. I doubt the covered part."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"So TSLA options are cheaper than SNDL options? If he said a dropping security price can have positive price movement on some put options pricing variables, fine. But delta and IV drop considerably as the price of a security drops.

""lower security price, higher premium for the put"" is a factually incorrect statement"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can't imagine it because it's preying on unwitting small fries. That's not his MO.

It would see more crazy to me for him to suddenly start pouncing on little guys."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been trying to find writings and thoughts of Michael Burry since learning he went long on GME.  I found this graduation speech; the whole thing is worth watching, but this one part struck me in particular. [https://youtu.be/1CLhqjOzoyE?t=1127](https://youtu.be/1CLhqjOzoyE?t=1127)

Basically he says lucrative trades are not worth the profit if they do harm.  I don't know Keith Gill personally, but I have an unexplainable faith he would feel the same.  I'm not a financial advisor.  I like bananas."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You dont know what a gamma squeeze is. The height of it was in the original run to 300+ 

The stock going from 30 -> 70 > 60 in 1 day wasnt the gamma squeeze retard.."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"same, but we can expect regulation if the market crashes."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Smh
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,":)

You better hope there is positive vibe out of a conference call as the fun might be on its last legs. Whether it's you idiots shopping at GameStop and causing upward guidance or some monkey-ass PR spin about the future pray that there is no theme of realism.

I'm going all-in the other way."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Crowds choice
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Something so fiendishly decadent you have to hide your face from god when you eat them. 


Could go two ways either really bad chips or chips that are hard to eat just one. I pick bad chips. Like limon or ghost pepper chips.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Again?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Put your money where your mouth is then and sell some naked calls
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sooooo we have all read the multitude of DD that says it will. Let‚Äôs see your DD saying it won‚Äôt? You don‚Äôt have any, you‚Äôre just an asshole that spews bullshit."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,lmao these people are fucking delusional theres no way its ever hitting even 1k a share
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I've used reddit since I was wearing diapers and sucking on your mom's tiddies.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôll gladly wear a diaper if I can suck on someone‚Äôs moms titties
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"We can all claim that. And I wasn‚Äôt referring to you. am in my second reddit account this one started 6 years ago. I posted to Reddit back before anyone heard of it my first account in 2008. Lol. The fact is the account I commented u/RushBsukaBlat here is 38 days. Nothing here to argue or disagree about move along.

Edit added user I referred to as shill and your user  is 49 days."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,And lots of hate back for pointing out the fact.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok wrinkle brain thanks for the info..take a look at the institutional owned shares of the company and their respective % ownership..already well over 100% legit shares not including a fuck ton of retail buyers and diamond handed ü¶çü¶çü¶ç There‚Äôs been some decent DD from our Northern Europoor Apes in Sweden of all places & from one of their brokers they have 20k+ retards owning GME, there‚Äôs still Denmark, Norway, Finland up there, a drop in the ocean compared to the rest of Europe and the fuck ton of retard apes all over, Germany, Netherlands, UK, Ireland,etc..all full of degens, and this doesn‚Äôt even include US, Canada, South America...

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are some reputable reports for SI, but the DDs don't trust it cause it doesn't fuel their dream of 100K a share dream. Hopefully the mad conspiracies are right for my few remaining shares I haven't sold yet, but I'm not counting on it."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"350B market cap?

Me thinks not .
 but I'll take it!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Tbh I'm not out til 5m per share. Need my .5 shares to make me a millionaire.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Right?  At least Gamestop is fairly valued
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you not see the document FROM THE SEC about how funds can and do hide their shorts so they don‚Äôt appear as short interest..?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Bad kind of retards man
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Famous last words.... good luck
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe a world with an orange reality show president, a meme god landing orbital class rockets, and WallStreetBets taking Wall Street by storm. Crazier shit happens quarterly at this point.

E words"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"There‚Äôs a few points here. 

1. Covered calls give you a premium which only helps cover so much if the stock starts to tank. 

2. There are plenty of people here with $30k account balances (or less) with more than half of that being held in one meme stock regardless of if they are the lucky ones who bought it at $40 or the risky ones that bought it at $200."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That's not bad at all considering how volatile gme options prices are right now. Thanks for the info.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I was holding shares of GME, I wouldn‚Äôt lend them, or risk them. Plenty of other stocks to screw around with."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"And if they held past 1k, they would gain more profits, no?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean under the CFD trading theory they were never responsible for paying the interest in the first place. But if you want reassurance to sell, I'm sure you'll have no problem finding it."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"And yet Gabe Plotkin himself said that the surge on the 27th and 28th was not a short squeeze or gamma squeeze when questioned by congress.

He stated that it was simply retail buying frenzy, and that he was out earlier that week, and that he doubted anyone else who was short actually covered. Or are you just skipping like 10 minutes of testimony he gave?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It was by itself, since you did not mention any of the criticisms of your view. I didn't hear you mention the inaccuracy of the short interest data and we know Melvin's account was a lie, we have clear evidence of that. The rest is you spouting random facts and saying ""therefore, squeeze happen"""
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs not letting me report the problem, what‚Äôs wrong?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are absolutely right that nothing is guaranteed and there are always risks involved.

I just don't think these newer people who joined understand the risk, especially when they read DD's telling them that a squeeze is going to happen on a certain date and they buy a bunch of calls.  They can't discern 1) who is writing the DD and what their motivations are 2) whether the information is correct or not because they prefer confirmation bias, and these DD's are heavily upvoted without people doing their own DD.

Which is why if they still want to invest, the safer of the routes would be to buy shares - but that is definitely not in the spirit of this sub when it is about YOLO and get rich quick."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Then be confident in your strategy. You got info from a presumably well researched, published source and you want reassurance from us retards?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ya don't mind me, I got distracted by banana after I read ""target date fund""."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If that's the case and you don't have the margin required I guess you are right, you can't do it."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You should be able to set up an inverse buy-write where it will automatically buy back the option and sell the share if the total return exceeds some value (which will be less than your strike due to extrinsic value, but that will go to zero as the option goes more ITM)."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh mate you definitely have enough brains to trade them!

Look up tastytrade and InTheMoney on YouTube. They explain the concepts. For trading them successfully you really only need basic arithmetic. 

Worrying about theoretically optimal options pricing is something market makers do in the back end, when writing their algorithms."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am a total shill yes. That is definitely why I think 5k+ is not possible. You guys keep on moving the goalposts, don't be greedy and take your gains so you do not end up like those who bought in at 400+ and have yet to break even. Could it go up? Yeah. 5k+ ? No. You are fucking stupid if you expect 5k+ Also you guys are kidding yourselves if you don't think the big players are making bank off this. Sure, Melvin lost money and so did some other players, but there are more who have made fuck tons off of this. So the whole ""stick it to the man"" schtick doesn't make any sense."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Word. I love GME as much as the next guy, but ya the cultish mentality can get a little annoying. I'm definitely not throwing my life savings into it. But it would be nice if something crazy happened and it somehow shot the moon again. Eh here's to hoping I guess."

But, and I may be completely wrong here, if retail owns as much of the float as is expected (not what the official numbers show), they still have enough control to continue driving the price up, even after whales leave. No?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't trust his account; I trust that he skewed the account. But the poster above is making a point that ""Melvin is out"" and that ""the squeeze happened"". 

So, if the first point is true, then his other testimony indicates that there are other shorts that did not escape, but hid their short interest.

knappis cannot think that his points are made in good faith; the very source for these points he's resting his argument on indicate that the squeeze has not happened."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,">	Melvin was only about 15% of the short interest.

Melvin lost about 7 billion, most on GME. Do you know how many shares that buys you? 4 billion buys you 40 million shares @ $100, which coincidentally accounts for the full drop in short interest during the last week of January (from 60M to 20M shares). 

>	There was a short attack (not ladder, not anything else) on Monday to the tune of 3 million shares offloaded in 15 minutes.

Volume was only 5 million total for 45 minutes during the drop, so 15 million shares is impossible. The drop was also almost $50 which gave them a nice *profit* when they bought back and closed their position at the bottom. 

>	ETFs containing GME are heavily, and I mean heavily shorted.

Nobody shorts an ETF to short a single stock, that‚Äôs insanity. You short an ETF if you expect a wider market correction, like the one we have seen lately on Nasdaq. 

There is more, but I am sorry to say that you are too sloppy with your data quality checks, and a bit too much of a tinfoil hat to be taken seriously."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You don‚Äôt present any evidence that short interest is very high in GME at the moment or that a cornering/short squeeze is imminent. 

What you do show is that there are many ways to bet on the market, for example using synthetic shorts (which is an options strategy) or swaps (that are traded off exchanges). 

I don‚Äôt dispute that. For all I know Jeff Bezos could have placed a 10 billion bet that GME will beat Valve at their own game before midsummer. Or maybe he bet the other way around. 

But that does not dispute that a massive short squeeze happened in January, and it does not in anyway indicate that another short squeeze will happen next week."

Hardly a good scale of someones intelligence. You dont need to be smart (unless you are doing comsci/compeng/softeng) at a top University and came out with a high GPA. Then Id agree that you are quite intelligent.

You still have absolutely no idea of what a gamma squeeze is and shouldnt call other people idiots for something you dont understand."
2021-03-20 10:10:06,wallstreetbets,"UWMC is not on the final Russell Index inclusion list We all got played my friends. UWMC CEO, Mat Ishibia is too stubborn. I read somewhere he holds 90% of the company. No wonder index did not want to get involved. If you want to hold 90% of the company you should have left it private. Why even go public?

Index or no index, the stock is still undervalued by all metrics. The only problem in my opinion is that CEO is holding too much stake in the company. He wants to get rich of index buying, but they are not stupid. Why would one single person hold 90% of the company? If you want your company to be private then don't go public. There are many great companies like IKEA and Lego that are private because the families that own them did not want to sell their shares.

Brace yourself for bagholding. If you ask me, you should be selling options on this confusing stock. Don't get fooled into buying options. This one is not a stock for the beginners. You need to play intelligently. You need to play the strategies that pay you, not the other way around.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can I ask why is everyone blaming the CEO.. he put out the information he holds. 
I‚Äôm sure Monday we will have more information.
This stock is still worth 10.50-12.75 so unless you got in high, you are still ok. 
The market will be good this summer. 
Not everything is a squeeze. 
Thankfully I have read from a few people that work there and hold stock. The company is good. This is mid/long.. they all said that. 
No one fucked y‚Äôall over. 
Y‚Äôall are just mad you can‚Äôt squeeze it. 
Go squeeze your nuts maybe that will make you feel better."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They played us like a damn fiddle!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Why would one single person hold 90% of the company? If you want your company to be private then don't go public.

If you can sell only 10% and raise millions, why not?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,WHAT THE FUCK DOES THIS MEAN FOR MY 23.56 SHARES
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bummer.
But...
The fact that UWMC made it into preliminary list is reassuring.
If UWMC for any reason (%of shares floating, etc) isn't enough qualified to enter on the indexes, they won't even be in the preliminary list.
Next Russell timeframes are May/June for next Annual reconstitution and next quarter for other IPO inclusion.

Now, if monday the dip is big enough, I'll be buying it.
The company is still a good one (I've invested in far more shitty company, like WKHS) and the Russell inclusion is still a play, just not this quarter.

Anyway. I held VALE for a year, and closed with a good 30% gain. I will do it with this one, also.

Monday we'll see, I guess. If the dip bring the stock 15-20% below my entry price, I will buy the dip"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Upvote OP post! 

People bought into all the dookie that Russell was a sure thing this quarter."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The stock still has a strong buy and price target value of 12.00 high 10.00 low. Might be worth holding onto if you at least intend to break even, (assuming you bought it within the range)."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Gotta give em props.. played us good. What a trap smfh
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it falls big on Monday, that would be a great time to buy the dip. The dividend it pays simply won't let it go below $8 for a long time."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,But UWMC isn‚Äôt an IPO. Was it supposed to be on this list or am I missing something
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I always thought Rocket (rkt) was the better play in this space. Hoping that investment pays off long term
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think this is bad news of course, but there is definitely an overreaction here. The fundamentals of the company haven‚Äôt changed at all, and if you are investing and not trading then this isn‚Äôt a huge deal

Might be some selling on Monday, but this will run up next month into earnings in my opinion. Still undervalued with good PTs and likely a strong income play with the possibility for dividend upgrades

Honestly, I‚Äôm kind of hype if this drops. I already have a low average and would love to add more"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,If people sell monday im buying your losses. I Will bank on better quarter earnings and fundamentally stock worth more than $8 or $9. there will be more chances every quarter for the russel to pick up uwmc they update stock index/indices every quarter.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I had a weird feeling about this stock, almost pulled the trigger the other day."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,*continues to quietly stroke his RKT shares like his wife‚Äôs boyfriends cock
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, but saying you ‚Äúread somewhere‚Äù doesn‚Äôt sound like a reliable source for information..."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,My calls were up 180% and I didn't sell. Fuck my ass
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"my calls are for 4/16, think ill ride it out and see. if they were next week then i might sell."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,If he owns 90% that is a great thing for stock prices. Locks up the available float and makes it easier to squeeze. I don't think he does but it is Saturday so I am too lazy to actually look. Index isn't important. It is and always has been a long hold. It will get indexed eventually. The revenues matter most.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The reaction on here is from ignorance, which is understandable because I thought index inclusion meant something before I researched it as well. Do some research, index inclusion doesn‚Äôt make for any boost in a stocks price outside of the news itself. An index addition was positive news but not something that makes the company more valuable. It was never the reason to buy. The reason to buy is the stock being undervalued."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly I don't care about the index. I like the stocks potential. Profits are great. Market cap low. Fundamentals are great. If people can't see that and are only on board for a listing then see ya later.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Meh, might just hold this one until I can at least break even. Expensive mistake, but one that I wont make again. I'm only in for 50 so I can afford to wait a bit."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hopefully this post gets removed. You should not be telling people what to do with their shares/options.

Describing new sentiment, or what you will be doing with your position is one thing, and hell I even appreciate that angle of these posts, because now I won't be going into Monday blindsided by this...but :

>""If you ask me, you should be selling options on this confusing stock. Don't get fooled into buying options. This one is not a stock for the beginners. You need to play intelligently. You need to play the strategies that pay you, not the other way around.""

is a huge fucken no-no."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nothing changes about the fundamentals, I wouldn't make an option play but I'm not gonna stop loading up on a 1000 shares a week. This most likely has to do with the available float and I and you should of known that the float for $UWMC is very small which is one reason I am excited about the stock. Easy 50% gain from the price point if the have the capital."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,RKT baby
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I passed on this hype
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"saw my call go from +300% gain to -40% in a day (to worthless)

weewoo UWMC options go brrrrr"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Guess I should sell the calls I bought last week before I lose all of the premium, then?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Ain't russell index purely based on market cap? There is close to no subjective factors in russell selection.  No?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Pulling my cash out.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Now I feel even better selling in pre market for 9.50
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The plot thickens... wtf are they gonna say on Sunday? ‚ÄúWe have formed an alliance with RKT and will be merging‚Äù lol
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Time to dump on Monday
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What does this mean for RKT? I got roped into holding both
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well I guess this just means I‚Äôll be averaging down early next week and coming back for more pain later 

hype"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt see how someone holding 90% doesn‚Äôt help with price movement. Supply and demand
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the IPO list. They aren't an IPO. This was a SPAC. I see this everywhere but I am wondering if this is even where they would be listed anyway.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, RKT holds most of their shares as well. Seems to be a trend."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck. Pulling out my 1k worth of shares at open.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Still undervalued
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Literally fucking told you guys RKT was the play , they were pushing this narrative for a fucking reason y'all."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"he may own over 90% of the company, but he ""only"" has 79% total voting power according to the [S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001783398/000119312521016729/d89622ds1.htm#rom89622_15), page 131."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know ‚Äúpast performance does not guarantee blahblahblah‚Äù but the 6 month chart for RKT is cyclic pulses, including the latest boom and crash. They‚Äôre about 1 month apart and we‚Äôre 3 weeks from the last one. Not financial advice, just seeing a pattern."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Guy pays himself 7mm just in salary, never trust a company milking their accounts dry."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It might drop a lot before you can even get in a premarket order. So, just remember you only lose if you sell, unless it goes down so much that if you buy back in you end up with more shares for your buck. Can‚Äôt predict that kinda thing though. This stock seems to do its own thing at times. Be safe my fellow apes. I‚Äôm holding until it gets to at least 12.50 I‚Äôll just buy more when it dips. Plus I like the stock and dividends."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"guys. just fucking buy rkt.

bigger co. 40% over ipo vs 30% under.

uwmc is a garbage spac ( hello chamath)

great company! shitty stock.

uwmc ceo is weak.

dan gilbert a fucking G.

rkt took a 50% haircut in 2 weeks and the shareholders are still ahead of uwmc.

lets review. 

uwmc forces brokers to choose between the 2 cos.
tease the russell and dont get it.
2strikes so far. yellow flag on the play.

keep waiting for bad news on rkt. still waiting."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not really sure what them not being included on the final list has to do with the CEO being stubborn, or what you‚Äôre implying there"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"fck, i only bought 50 shares because my spider sense told me yolo-ing on another RKT-ish stock is gonna be a bad idea.

Gonna sell all on Monday with 50$ profit!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck that cocksucker
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'll make a bet the market reacts to this by pushing RKT 
Just a thought and I have many shares of UWMC but I'd bet this thing hits rock bottom in premarket before a slow painful recovery"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly not even trying to troll here, but if you want a great name in the space, consider RKT... Feuding aside, it's an excellent company that has a lot of promise, and is way oversold."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn! I‚Äôm probably going to get out Monday and go all in on gme
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You cucks should have stuck with RKT, sorry not sorry"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"fuck uwmc, lost so much money with them hope they go bankrupt"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs not getting added on Monday?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Wonder if I should write covered calls on this? Never wrote a call before. How and when do you get the premium for those calls? Guess I know what to do this weekend
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,lol
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Although everyone does not like to read bad news like this, it happens. 

Now, I am curious how the rumor/story started that UWMC WOULD be listed on the indices so I won't get fooled again."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank God my transfer took so slow on webull. I never got a chance to buy my calls.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What time was the announcement?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I sold all my shares at $8.45 only to see them jump to $10 for a brief period the next day.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait, got played? By something I saw on r/WSB?

Well, good. Because this time, I was ""smart"" and instead of buying shares, overpaid for fucking 90DTE calls, so instead of being able to hold, they'll expire totally worthless.   


Am I doing it right?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seems shady... then add Cramer‚Äôs exhanche with him on Twitter about being on Mad Money, feels even more shady considering he holds 90%.  #FHN"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Can I see an actual article  that says specifically uwmc isn‚Äôt going to be added. Also can someone clue me in on the IPO reference
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Another distraction from GME lol
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is what happens on the market. It throws you curve balls. WSB got overconfident with GME, trended UWMC to be the 2nd most talked about stock this week, and this is what happens."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Inverse Cramer. I closed my GME positions as soon as I saw that he recommended GME and then I reopened my positions after the circuit breakers. Saved me $100 per share.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Held PLUG since it was 1.50 while it stayed flat for years.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mine too. I'll see where the price is at Monday,¬†if I can roll them out longer I'll think about that. This was my first big option buy, I'm pretty new to it, gonna have to be very careful."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,My fear is that institutional traders do not want to get involved with a stock with low available float.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,If there is time to pull out. Monday could be fast and painful.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Same
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"RKT and UWMC both go up, profits get spewed into GME lol"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not sure to be honest. If there is a huge dump, I will be buying the dip. You gotta play the game until the end."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I would definitely not sell on Monday for a 20% loss.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Good thing I didn't buy calls for next week .
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,shit.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"700 shares in both companies. If I see green next week, I‚Äôll sell some options for the premium and continue holding."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It means everybody should put their volume into RKT. Once we have volume it pops.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"cant have institutional investors if u hold the largest chunk.

same with rkt and dan gilbert though rkt is a behemoth and dan will start making deals with his stock.

uwmc is fuk.

spac garbage"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Not blaming you brother. Any company that plays with shareholders like this is gonna be a rocky ride.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Very.. everything I search Search .. 10.50-12.75.
The stock is fine."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,But UWMC is underpriced compared to RKT on multiple metrics.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,51% is all you need.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here is what I don' get. It shows SFS holdings as having 1.5B shares and that is 93.6% of shares. it then shows Gores as having 13.3% of shares. Blackrock having 11.2% of shares, and brandeerian as having 7.3%.

this means there are 125% of shares owned by insiders and institutions. So what do I have in my account? The numbers don't make sense."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Hunh. Would be nice if I could unload the shares I FOMO'ed into at the top. Maybe the CEO will say something about how he hates HF this week.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,UWMC FY20 net income was more than 3 billion dollars my man. Not sure whether 7mil would be considered milking the accounts dry.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"the ""you only lose if you sell"" mentality is super retarded"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bad news on RKT? Man I wish those waiting god speed, lol. 40% of my pf is basically RKT shares. People complaining that RKT isn't growing rapidly across multiple channels has their heads up their asses."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You get paid the premium when the order fills.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Both Russell Index and UWMC investor relations both said it was on preliminary list... but remember prelim is not final and final list is out and its not there but all other prelims are... so either there is a major typo which I doubt or Russell sending a big fu to reddit which is more than likely due to increased volatility. Only loser here is investors either way. This makes more sense now why rocket is up AH and UWMC didn't take its normal AH recovery. Itll recover by rest assured this beeeeotch is gonna drill for oil premarket so either average down, take the loss, or hang in there for a few months while it recovers is about only options I see worth playing right now.. although I'd bet puts would be good play Monday 
Now other side investors coukd react positively about not being on Russell or ceo and investor relations dept at UWM could get off their assets and rally the investor base with good news but.... this is more doubtful"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Been in since it got announced as ‚Äúthe biggest spac GHIV ever‚Äù hype, 70% of my portfolio smh. Let‚Äôs hope it still stays around the analyst prediction since lowest is $10.50"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Overconfident with GME? Lol okay.

You bozos got overconfident with UWMC which everyone already tried to push a month ago. That‚Äôs all."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Overconfident with GME? GME is very much the play especially with news + earnings coming out next week. UWMC has been a diversion from GME and many knows this.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"or ‚Äúhow i learned to stop worrying and not buy another GeM diversion‚Äù (obviously speaking to non-experienced apes who all hopped on the bandwagon, i‚Äôve been scalping Rekt and Usmc ;) to finance more GeM"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,First time i heard about it wow
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Smart. I‚Äôve always wondered about Cramer. if he is such an excellent stock screener, why in the hell is he on TV talking about stocks so much? I have a feeling talking about stocks on TV is the better play as opposed to actually trading."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They pay dividends?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh, good. I'll just hold my April calls until next year and enjoy the dividends on them. 

That's how it works, right?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Much more likely to see RKT included first, given the Financials, don't you think."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I upvoted. Thanks for telling me, I bought UWMC because of the inclusion. Now that it's not in, I'll be considering selling it. Unless there's a dip below my average cost, of course."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm in n at 9.30. I think holding through may/June.. that‚Äôs a high months for homes.. I‚Äôm not sure yet, I think my average is low so it‚Äôs not to bad. 
I see it drop and going back up to 9.. so I may need to average down a little more."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Fyi nobody was expecting rkt to be included into russel etfs. This news is definitely bad for uwmc though since lot of people bought into it with the Russel expectation.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,RKT investors weren't gambling on getting included on an index. UWMC buyers got fucked.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao yep. They didn't got played and it's a shame
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Which was a distraction from the massive squeeze we had on GME.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought in at $21 and sold at $40. All I see now here are bagholders who want it to pop off again.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, why trust someone who lied to me?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It will with time because nothing has negatively  changed about the fundamentals of Rocket.  They just had their credit limit increased the other day, business is going great for them."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"RKT is on fucking discount, my 3/19 calls may have been worthless so fuck it we buy more shares"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm almost out of red crayons.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"But then you have SEC documents like this, and that suggests if he owned 94%, and susquehana owned 6.2%. nobody else owns shares at all and already more than 100% is allocated. Someone is wrong with their numbers, and I would bet it is the bloomberg article.

https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-21-023560/


EDIT: I think I found what they are talking about. One of the holders is SFS holdings. 

https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-024755/

Not entirely sure what I'm reading, but it suggests there was class B and Class D stock allocated at 1.5B shares. 

The interesting bit seems to be this I guess:
> The 1,502,069,787 shares of Class A Stock beneficially owned by the Reporting Persons represent 93.6% of the outstanding shares of Class A Stock based upon 103,104,205 shares of Class A Stock outstanding as of January 21, 2021, as stated in the Issuer‚Äôs Current Report


In other words, they have a ton of class B/D shares, that allocates them 10 votes / share but no financial benefits (so no dividends). They can sell those shares or transfer them to another owner, but it converts to Class A shares and restores them to 1 vote per.  At least that is how I read it..."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"My biggest play is this one right now, feel it out come Monday and see, can tell you from the little 1 month experience I have, I‚Äôve missed out on a lot of money panic selling"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah well best I can do is put a stop loss in place at this stage.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,UWMC doesn‚Äôt have much going for it besides the potential squeeze and the russel index
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,My call expire in May. Someone hold me
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I honestly hope they go tits up
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,comparing RKT and UWMC on metrics alone is your mistake. RKT is a diversified business with strong tech valuation potentials. UWMC only has one core business and they use 3rd party software for their broker platforms.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Be me, hold both. See what happens. Got in at 9.50 on UWMC and back in on RKT at 23.10. And tomorrow I'll have purple for breakfast cuz it's Saturday!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Why do you say that?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"same dude 40% LOL.

gilbert has to use those shares soon and show us something."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the info. My intention was to hold until April 6 when the reinvested dividends would hit my account. I will have to see what happens between now and then.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I'll pray for you brother.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"They can't admit that this was just a situation by shills to push people away from GME. No different from AMC, Silver, RKT, pot stocks, etc. 

Some Apes don't want to learn lol"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't be offended.  GME made a lot of people a lot of money, people that are good at trading.  It also left a lot of bagholders because there's the ""1m is not a meme"" (it is) hype.  I imagine when OP says people got overconfident with gme he is referring to that.  A lot of people weren't afraid of buying it at 250, 300, 350, because they thought it was actually going to go to 100,000."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You think GME earnings report is going to be a good one?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Conspiritards should know there‚Äôs a whole stock market worth of plays that were here to discuss, it‚Äôs not ‚Äúdistractions‚Äù.  If you just want a GMEanon echo chamber there‚Äôs a whole fucking subreddit dedicated to just that where you can jerk off to whatever the latest tinfoil hat theory is."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cramer is CNBC's circus monkey. If you really knew how to make money on the market, you sure wouldn't be a monkey on CNBC."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Talk show analysts are reacting to the news instead of predicting the news. Predicting the news is a coin flip, while reacting to the news is generally more accurate."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Those who can, do. Those who can't, teach. Those who can't teach, teach on TV."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They do and their CEO is collecting something like $600 million per year since he holds 94% of the company.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Some of us are in both. 
I personally hold stock in both companies. 
Both are very good companies."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,He tweeted that he was happy they were added to the preliminary list which wasn't a lie. The OP is making a huge leap as to the reason they weren't included.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"When you shit it out, recycle"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats the last dip before exploding... Bad news are when you buy and good news are when you sell! Thats what i learned and Lost Money on this market
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Index or no index, the stock is still undervalued by all metrics. The only problem in my opinion is that CEO is holding too much stake in the company."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,UWMC is focusing on making its own software.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hold both.
I swear some of these people act like doing 2 things at once is impossible.
This is a good housing market. This summer should be fine for both companies."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Opportunity cost
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because if a stock goes down, and you believe it some day gonna go up, then sell as high as you can, even for a loss, and buy more shares at the bottom. It's like averaging down, just more clever. If you think the stock is gonna fall more.
Obviously if you think this is the bottom, selling is stupid."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,While you're waiting months/years for it to go back up and break even (or it doesn't go up and trades sideways) you could cut your losses and invest in something else and make money.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Some other stocks are not distractions. RKT had many DDs and posts before the GME saga. It had high short interest already last year. In fact it's probably shorted by the same HFs.

You do realize that if HFs make money elsewhere, it's more ammo for them for the GME fight?

On the other hand, UWMC started to appear out of nowhere, with initial DDs posted by accounts whose first posts are on UWMC."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"But everyone made money from amc, slv, RKT, and greenery, don‚Äôt be mad cause u got in too late"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"They fall for this bullshit every time a new stock pops up, which is about every week lol. Like how many times yall wanna get played like a fucking fiddle?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You're the most delusional person in this thread.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don‚Äôt be offended? lol okay.

Currently 77% of GME holders are in profit. 90%+ of them from the January run up could have sold for a profit or broke even if they weren‚Äôt impatient.

It‚Äôs your bad decision making, & your fault you can‚Äôt hold on to a stock for more than a week because you‚Äôre looking for the ‚Äúnext big squeeze‚Äù."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I have no doubt he knows how to make money on the market. That's not his job though. His job is to mass manipulation and he is good at it. That why people who see through his shtick hate him so much.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôd disagree. I think that Cramer‚Äôs strategy when he talks about scamming retail investors is absolutely crucial to today‚Äôs market environment, so much so that the hedge funds have used his tactics since it was published. For instance, look at how tlt is heavily shorted, and a lot of people are likely making money from tech puts because of it. People like Bill Scamming(Ackman) going on CNBC trying to scare retail into panic selling and causing a collapse in the economy only to make money, or companies like citadel who has a strategy of literally driving stocks to the ground for profit(not even just GME, but bonds which have a correlation with the overall market and effect the holdings your parents have in their passively managed retirement fund)."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea the guy told people to stay in bear sterns the day before it died.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What trash
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you know the percentage per stock?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are you sure the CEO holds the right class of shares that receive dividends? It‚Äôs not uncommon, for example, for class A shares to receive them, while the class B or whatever held by CEO‚Äôs don‚Äôt."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"94% can't be true!!!  

18.6% of the UWMC is owned by institutional investors.    The numbers don't add up to 100%."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,As a RKT yolo'er I'm so conflicted over hearing this news.  I'm equally happy and sad.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fair point. If it dips big time, I'll be adding."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you read UWMC's IPO prospectus? They have a pay-per-use contract with a 3rd party developer that extends to 2024. The only software they made are a mobile app for brokers that has a 2.x rating and some document uploader/signer. RKT has spent billions of dollars creating their own software ecosystem. Are you sure after doing the same UWMC will be as undervalued as you think?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cool, while they focus on making it RKT already has it.
Tutes were mass buying all meme stocks (rkt,amc,gme,etc) except for UWMC."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, RKT had been here for a while, like pre gme. I remember cus I bought leaps and shit didn‚Äôt move for months, bled theta but thankfully caught the spike."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wasn't a bag holder for gme.  I made plenty money off of it, because I sold before it tanked, both times.  Its probably going to continue to dip, then slowly ride back up as long term growth as it develops e-commerce.  This isn't about patience, its about knowing when to sell and buy, and im not gonna miss out of profits that I can put right back into gme when I get a chance to buy low and pay with house money.  Im not going to make a play based on pie in the sky dreams thinking gme will hit 100,000.  Thats not gonna happen.  This second ""squeeze"" is over, and it's very unlikely it'll squeeze again.  Hopefully im wrong though, and you make a shit ton of tendies from it."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,4-5% Pretty good dividend if you ask me.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol fuck them, RKT was and has been a legit play and the apes shat all over it because it was GME or nothing at the time. Im surprised this even got their attention. If they didn't shit all over RKT and got onboard that week instead of trashing the mega thread with FUD spam all day we would all collectively be laughing right now as two major companies saw a short squeeze this year which retail investors got involved in."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I have like 3K shares already bought @9.76. I Can buy 1K more but there's not much downside from here so i am not worried
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Brokers are going with UWMC instead of RKT. No offense but RKT is not a growth story in my opinion. It had its moment.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. They will make more then I understand
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Go on, tell me more about how much you‚Äôve made."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol, looks like I am a dividend investor now"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's actually not bad. So, maybe sell at open, then buy the dip."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Dont be a salty bitch
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell covered calls on it and get yourself a hooker.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That not may not be true RKT CEO said broker business is up 40% still. Also they have been posting tweets all week from brokers who did not sing. Did they get some sure but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as much as they are saying.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey man you're entitled to your own opinions. I'm just imploring you to do some more DD and research yourself on top of what's posted in WSB (which may not be accurate). Good luck with your investments!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thats it, there's nothing more to say, I've made off of it? There's nothing more to elaborate on, not sure what you're getting at.  I bought and sold, like everyone else."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,If it really dips much.  It may get the dip out of the way in pre-trade.  I'm gonna hold.  I'm in at 8.45 and it's gonna hit 10 after everyone is done screaming
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can't do that from Italy. I opened another bank account with a different bank and they had like options on only 20 US companies  lol. On the phone i asked like do you have options on UWMC and they told me ""yes we have then"". Then i found out that its not true"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for pointing it out. I did not know the details you posted.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Guess you‚Äôll just have to bag hold UWMC like everyone else too üíéüëê
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Interactive Brokers. Check them out.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe, those risks are part of this game, doubtful though as I'm sitting on a profit right now and will probably sell Monday after finding out they aren't really being added to the Russell 3000 right now.  It did burn me once before, however I got in a earlier this go around.  Got a couple contracts that I will probably lose money on but ill make up for it in share profit.  Thats the name of the game, win some/lose some."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't like them. I Will go all in with shares everytime, what to do? I have like 70K invested so i can make Money even with shares if i get the right plays.
Currently i hold :
3K shares UWMC
1.3K shares S0S 
And the rest Is in other stocks. 
If UWMC dips again then i'm going  all in with all i have"
2021-03-20 10:09:22,wallstreetbets,"Rubadubdub ITUB (2.0) Fresh off a 100% loss on short dated Brazilian oil calls (PBR, 50% overall account loss) AND 3 day ban for the original post, I'm back.

Positions: 1.4K ITUB 9/17 $6 C CB 0.23

**The Pledge**

Itau is the largest banking institution in Brazil, has a rigorous history of merger and aquisition strategy to increase market share, \~8% revenue decline in 2020 compared to \~20% for the industry big dogs (JPM, Citi), increasing tech investment and my Brazilian friend said they were the best out of Itau, Bradesco and Santander.

The bull market in value stocks since November was prematurely aborted in Brazil for obvious, public reasons <political statements deleted>. The stock is still \~50% off Jan 2020 highs, IMO putting it solidly in undervalued territory.

**The Turn**

<political statements deleted>, one analysis is that things might not be as bad as they seem in the Florida of South America (shoutout to @[CallsOnAlcoholism](https://www.reddit.com/user/CallsOnAlcoholism/)) and even if they are, they have until September to figure it out. Other bullish signals:

\- The Brazilian Central Bank made use of a recently passed autonomy law (limiting exec/legislative interference) by increasing its benchmark interest rate to 2.75% \[larger than expected 75 bp increase compared to 50 bp expected\] and they signalled a repeat at their next meeting in May. Rising interest rates are generally good for bank stocks as they increase revenue/margins. Whether they are similarly good for emerging economy bank stocks, I guess I will find out.

\- The three analysts I could find that follow this stock returned an average price target of %7.50 (just confirmation bias, analysts are mostly tea-leaf readers).

\- Minimal short interest 25M shares (0.6% of float).

**The Prestige**

Brazil has a funny trend of shitting the bed when you expect it to pay off, and paying off when you expect it to shit the bed. My analysis is that the negative catalysts have been priced in, blood is in the streets, and the probability of positive catalysts appearing before September is greater than 0.5. Shares are likely a better play than options, substantial return potential and lower risk.

Obviously the best play is to avoid entirely (see previous 100% loss), Brazil is a crazy place.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,No one can predict the future price ranges so don‚Äôt beat yourself up on that. I.e the day you bought had massive manipulation that restricted retail buyers. That‚Äôs the real reason we are bag holders at a price we felt maybe not the best investment entry point.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,yes idk wtf u/En4cr is talking about but at least in the us it is free for me and I don't make nearly that many trades.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Only if you do over 150 trades per month. I wish I had enough savings to do that.üòÖ

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've cashed out from my average price of $63 during the last weeks. Call me paperhands or w/e, I made a shit ton of money. I'm ready for the next round though üòé

I guess I'll keep trading this up and down movement and eventually transition into a long term investment of the turnaround which I genuinely believe in."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're not being a paper hand... you're just hurting the squeeze potential.

Like we get it, you don't trust it can happen.

You're afraid, so you're settling for smaller margins of profits... but if you believe in long term value or a squeeze when margin calls kick in... just buy and hold.

Everybody counts. Every share."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same, but it dipped as soon as I bought back in the last two times.  I 4x'ed, then I lost 30%, now I'm back down 10%"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'll need a somewhat opening guidance from next week before executing my move but one thing is for sure, I'll be a GME shareholder in the long run."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The best bet was buying back when it was $20 a share, covering investment at $400+ and buying back in at $40.

I fucked up and did Buy 150@$38, sell 75@$68, Buy 75@$48

I had a sell order at $500 but didn‚Äôt have after-hours trading, so I missed the $512 high before the crash. Should have taken some profit on the way down but I was adamant at that point to hold. 

My goal however has always been long-term; I bought in on Ryan Cohen news, pre-squeeze frenzy. Even if I had managed to sell at $500 I would have spent all the gains on buying back in at $40"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So is GME still worth investing in? I know I missed the huge jump til now but is this till going to increase at a potential rate like previously or somewhat similarly? I‚Äôm completely new to the stock market & really am not knowledgeable just trying to learn from anyone willing to help. I saw RH was doing shady stuff to withhold people from selling & buying. What would be a good platform to use or is there a credible guide to everything related on wanting to be apart of this & potentially do this full time.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I will again buy in on the Cohen turnaround but I think there is more potential for bouncy bouncy which I‚Äôll try to ride along
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I think the playing field is so muddy now we probably can‚Äôt see the forest for trees. I‚Äôm awaiting a somewhat indication next week. When all this quiets down I‚Äôll buy GME for the fundamental turnaround.
2021-03-20 09:46:40,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôll never forget when I found out about options and WSB üöÄüöÄ 
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not proud but I went from +8,500 to - 1700"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Reminiscing about those good ol' days when WSB would make fun of people holding shares... Man those days are gone
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Is your trading goal 420.69$ ?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sad. Take profit when you can. A lesson that needs to be learned by all. Diamond hands shouldn‚Äôt mean that you can‚Äôt sell and buy back shares. Especially for smaller investors. 

I continually advise myself to limit to 100% profit on options when some of mine pop. Even if it‚Äôs early in the expiration, I‚Äôll still sell and take profits then simply look for a new entry and do it again. I used to get greedy, and I‚Äôd hold, always eager that if I waited until near expiration I‚Äôd profit more. I‚Äôd always, always come out losing way more than if I had sold at 100% profit. 

Diamond hands, while def a motto of WSB, has also led to extreme losses for traders and def isn‚Äôt the best advice."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a question about options. I bought a call option for $ORCL when it gapped down on Mar 11 (thinking it would bounce back up and close the gap). It has a strike of $68 and expires on Apr 9. But it keeps going down and closed on Fri at around $66. If I now think it's not going to to go up can I lose less money if I sell it back now? Or if it stays OTM do I lose the same amount whether I sell now or just let it expire? TIA.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not proud but I went from 200->10,000->350"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Idc I'm holding

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"For my past month of messing with options, I *would be green and up like 10k*, except I've held too long due to greed, trying to get more out of it and then start rationalizing after a fortuitous pop that it's going back up. It never goes back up.

From unrealized gains to expiring worthless like 5 times now."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Rational advice!? Take this to the daily GME thread and you'll be downvoted to oblivion
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is what I've been doing holding LEAPS and selling calls against them. Some days I'll get a 20% in an hour and immediately just close out. Almost always turns out to be the right decision, with a new entry point a few hours away at most.

  


  


My LEAPS are red but my account is green this month, just from sensible profit taking on my theta farm"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Options, sure.  
Conventional stocks, absolutely.

GME shares specifically, no.

GME is literally once in a generation opportunity that isn't going to present itself again.

I will **HAPPILY** ride my portfolio down to -90% **AGAIN**, because I know that $40 is undervalue if RC even succeeds just a little.

Let me tell you something. I listened to your 100% advice once before. On something some 8 or 9 years ago. 20 B coins. Yeah. Bought them as a joke for 10 cents a pop. Sold when they doubled to 20 cents. Sold them as a joke. Who would ever use a digital coin? Right?

I didn't realise I was an early adopter of that once in a **lifetime** event. I could be a millionaire? I could have sold them in the hundreds instead and be ""glad i got out early.""

Maybe I'm over emotional about it because I see symmetries between GME and my past failure?

This isnt even that scary a gamble. People panic when they see -10% but we haven't even HAD Ryan Cohen officially take over. 

Buy on rumour. And if you see that it's *criminally* undervalue, why the HELL would you ever sell at just 100%?

GME can quite literally disrupt the entire gaming and pc sector. There is a huge gap and Gamestop has brand recognition, available capital and an experienced team.

And that is IRRESPECTIVE of the absolute bullshit that retail only owns 8% of the shares and the SI of float is only 40%."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not necessarily. 

When Gamestop was sitting at $40 and IV was low on the calls, an option play could have made sense but shares were just as good. As soon as it shot up to $90 and implied volatility of the options shot up to 600% options DID not make sense for a beginner. When I was looking at options when I bought in at $140, shares made a lot more sense and offered a lot higher return than holding options until expiration.

Also the market can offer really good bets on options (see my position in my post history) but you really need to know what the fuck you're doing. Just buying options and hoping to get lucky is dumb. You're playing against a casino and the people on the other end have the odds down to a goddamn science."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also with shares you can scale out and in into positions more easily. Options its way harder.  Another thing is when volatility decreases with OTMs all that you gain gets lost pretty easy. Options are great for unexpected things or big movements, for anything else shares."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"First spike was actually AMC 5c 1/27 - $135 to 3k overnight... needless to say I was hooked. 

Used that to buy GME shares between $150-185ish, held past the peak and sold at a loss. 

Played with some other stuff, bought more GME end of feb at 125, then yolo‚Äôd into weeklies"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds funüé¢. Next time don‚Äôt put on the seatbelt and jump ship at the top.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know right... This is what happens when you go on mainstream media, and draw in normies."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The thing that gets me is that most of the people who are posting telling others to avoid options are doing so because they do not understand how options work.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha I‚Äôm actually surprised I didn‚Äôt get downvoted here! WSB getting all the wiser and more rational day by day.

And I have never gone to the GME thread nor do I ever plan to. To have such benevolent intentions only to finally succumb to disillusionment...it gets repetitive."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The first rule, is to count your potential losses, not your potential wins. This is how you get to stay and play."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are in a game of risk, there is no end all be all"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You mean naked options. Spreads behave in a more sane way. Buying, selling, pinning to your wall. Spreads are good."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Add salt to the wound, I even have a ss from the top and didn't sell."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Or they are people who understand options but they're taking about one stock. Buying calls or puts on a stock that's got an IV in the 400-500s ATM and way higher OTM is a stupid casino. You don't unusually need the stock to rise or fall by 25+% or more to break even.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME is becoming a cult that doesn't accept outside perspectives. 

I understand they're aversion to the rude single line ""you're all idiots who are going to lose money"" posts. But the ignoring and downvoting of anything that doesn't their conspiracy narrative is annoying."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Those people are still saying to buy GME stock though. I could understand somesone saying avoid GME entirely because of the volatility. But, IMO, people saying someone should avoid GME options but still buy GME stock don't appreciate how risky GME stock actually is, or understand that there are more options available than just weeklies."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buying the stock is way less risky for GME than options. When the stock tanks to 40, you will have lost $160/share, but you'll still have $40/share. When the stock tanks to $40, your option will be worth $0 and expiring soon. Even a put might be worth less after the stock's drop than it is right now due to the need for the stock to move so much for breakeven and how IV crush tends to work (i.e. as the stock goes down, the IV will also go down so even selling your put may be harder as it may be worth less)."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're still only thinking of weekly options. Other call options could actually be less risky than buying GME outright IMO. Here's a look:

The current stock price of GME is about $200. If you're going to buy 100 shares, that's $20k. Now GME drops to $40 and stays there, so you've lost 80% value- those stocks are now worth $4k total. You've lost $16k.

Now let's say instead you're looking at GME options expiring in 2023 (two years from now). Right now, an ATM call option with that expiry on GME would cost roughly $12k. Let's say you buy the option and the price drops down to $40. Now, you've lost that entire $12k investment because the option is worthless. If you had bought the stock, however, you would have lost an additional $4k.

And that's just looking at ATM call options in 2023. You could even do a $100 call which is going for $14.9k and in that case even if GME dropped to $120 the option would still have value. Alternatively, you could do an OTM call and risk less - a $300 call with 2023 expiry is going for about $10.7k.

What strategy would be best depends on what your investment thesis on GME is, but with all the DD that's been happening on GME it seems most likely that in the next two years either GME will moon and go sky high, or will crash down and stay down. In either of those scenarios, the call option would've been the better bet."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was thinking monthlies rather than weeklies, but that's largely irrelevant. You're right in that it all depends on your thesis. 

Leaps, however, are nuts. Especially ITM leaps. 

You're right that if it drops to 40 then you've lost 16k with shares and only 12k in leaps. If you go with your 100k for 14.9k and it drops to 120, then you've lost 12.9k instead of losing only 8k.

By owning shares you can write covered calls. Yes, you can write covered calls on a leap too, but man that sucks if you get exercised and have to give up all of that extrinsic value. So to avoid that you write calls that are further OTM, which means making less on your call writing. If you had 100 shares right now, you could be making bank writing way OTM covered calls. A 600 call right now gets you \~$250 and at no point during this recent rise has the stock ended a week up 3x from the previous week so that's likely pretty safe. So if you were to buy 100 shares now, they're only costing 19750. Keep doing it and you'll drive that price down. 

Also, shares can be in values other than 100. If you only have 12k to spend, then you can risk your leap and maybe 0 out or maybe make a lot. Or you can have 60 shares. 

But again, ultimately it comes to your thesis. Mine is that GME has never in its life been worth more than 60/share and when this craziness is over it will drop to reality. Maybe in 3 - 5 years it'll be able to transition appropriately to a tech stock. But right now and for the short to mid-term future, it's a retail stock and retail stocks trade much lower than tech stocks."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. Point being, anyone suggesting to just buy GME stock and not think about options at all doesn't understand how options work."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Fair point.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This tells me you‚Äôre trading on margin...you realize that is why you get called, yes? Margin can eat your lunch if you don‚Äôt understand it."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,even more risky when you don't even know/underestand the actual requirements.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,$20 is $20.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It took me a long time to figure out what was wrong with TDAMERICATRADE. Going back to bed.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah he probably fucked up, but I‚Äôve been called for ridiculous amounts on defined loss spreads before because the sell side will assign before the buy side gets assigned in ToS"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy gets it
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,everyone line up. This dude has a long way to go $20 at a time.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I made $450.05 in a day.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-03-20 09:22:15,wallstreetbets,I was 100k away from my retirement number. So close. 
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Took the elevator to the top floor and forgot his keys in the car. GUH
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ngl, February hurt."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Fap fap fap...
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre 384k closer than I am.  You did something right.  Do it again.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You could‚Äôve been slapping my wife‚Äôs ass right now but you lost everything so good luck next time ape
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What a journey that was. All good man try again. You‚Äôre in a better spot than you started.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,100k *is* my retirement number.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I would've gotten a üìú üëê tattoo on my ass at that 1.5M.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,January 28th was a dark day for many of us
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve had 250k+ twice now in GME and didn‚Äôt sell the first time, lost it all, and second ironically was signing paper work in HR for my new wage slave job and missed the second GME spike and another chance at 250k. Hurts like hell."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Shoulda quit. You had it
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs a lot easier to make 100k then it is to make 1.4m
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,we go agane
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Brutal.

$100k is 6% of $1.7M. When you get to that point, you stop yoloing and buy VTI and just wait a few months. I know that is not the way, but seriously.

Thank you for your loss."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm at work and had to scroll this off the screen ASAP before someone caught me looking at porn
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The way it would‚Äôve gone down if op hit his retirement number:      

May comes around and OP has to pay Uncle Sam Capital Gains Tax.      

Finds out his taxes will exceed 30% of gains.       

Comes back by June to start a yolo power trip."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel for ya. But $384k would be my retirement number, so it could be worse."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't GUHve up now, you still have 380k left"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"We've got some maniacs on these forums. After your account size gets big enough, why aren't people content with boring ass ETFs? 20% gains on $1.5M per year ain't good enough?  Risk is vastly reduced."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Faaack once you have $1M that‚Äôs your retirement right there.

Just sell options and make $100k a year and you never have to work at Wendy‚Äôs again"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mmmm losses, my precious ü§§"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Based on your chart you should test 300k before going up again ü§£

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fudge and I‚Äôm here crying in the corner seeing my 5k go up to 25k and back down 18k(6.5k is margined, yes I‚Äôm stupid)

Godspeed OP"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would've sold, and bought blue chip dividend stocks at 4-5% reliable in growth and dividend income for the next +25 years."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs what greed does to you, my friend. Always take profit when the stock has surged. This doesn‚Äôt always mean you‚Äôre done with that stock... You can always buy back in. As soon as this saw 1.5 mill, I‚Äôd be out 100%. Then buy back in at current low price. Silly really of you to even let it get that low, when you‚Äôre talking big numbers like that. If you saw it drop from 1.6 mill, to 950,000... Why not sell there? Silly really."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Shoulda retired in Feb
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Fawk!  At least you still have some ammo to hit your goal still!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,ah yes... love the smell of retard in the morning. thank you kind sir ü¶ç ü¶ç
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just.... don't get it.... cash out that money. Go buy homes, rent them out for income. Retire early with no gambles. Ffs"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"That looks like mine.  My non qualified account was at the point I could pay off my mortgage and my Ira was just shy of retirement.  I‚Äôm early 40‚Äôs.  72t plus what I had in the bank, I was good.  

Like Kenny Rogers says, you‚Äôve got to know when to walk away and when to run.  Me, I like roller coasters."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This was me too. About the same numbers. The only consolation for me is that even if I sold at top, I would have piled into tech like SE, SQ, and NVDA. I would have gave up a lot during the last month. Greed kills. The only way is to be satisfied when you decide to walk way and fully de-risk. Problem is, when nearing 2M, I upped my goal to 5M."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You got the ‚Äúhold your winners‚Äù part down, now you just need to master cutting losers"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This pisses me off.  100k can be made just working for a while you dickhead
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This hurts to see but you're still better off than a year ago
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,First time?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Based on my technical analysis this stock is in for another ride to the moon
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,250k would've been my get out. It would've paid off my house and made life for me and my family so much easier.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Similar circumstance with GME getting crashed at 350. Roughly 880k in unrealized gains to 450.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,For 100k you should have sold and work one more year. What a dumb move.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So what were your positions?  What lead you to 1.65m?  That was some life changing tendies. What lead you to loosing it?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Should‚Äôve sold off when you hit 1M
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't beat yourself up. You were only up that high for what it seems like a day. I've been doing GME and you always feel like it can keep going up. That's why scaling out and in into positions is a must. Sorry for your loss

""Unzips"""
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Greed,pure and simple. 1.6 mil is adequate for a retirement unless you're very young or lead a yolo life"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,My retirement plan is a shotgun and a couple buckshot laying in the shed. I'm spending every last dime before I die.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre an actual idiot that doesn‚Äôt deserve to retire then.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Meanwhile my negative bank account tightens the chain around my foot.

Nah jk, I'm not retarded. I'm one 50k option trade away from either getting to your max or being in the above scenario."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs like they knew.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôd you do?! If you were still holding GME you would have bounced back up in March. My chart is a ‚ÄúU‚Äù
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You will be 10x up your retirement amount
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You still have 380k FFS lol - easy to make that back
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt know when to take a profit and diamond handed his holdings as it kept dropping.  Nice!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What happened? Why such a drop?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I could draw a line on your upward trend you should hit 2.25m within 6 months retard
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You could have sold and earn the extra 100k by the end of the year with any boomer stock.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Not no mo!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn dude? So you had some short term calls huh?

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,oh my God....
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy hell. You were at 1.6 million. Sorry for your loss. But thank you for sharing. The dumbassness is all around. Greed is a bitch. I know from experience.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,How does it feel to know you would have hit your retirement number by repositioning to bonds at the top üò≠
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Now you're like 1.5 million away from your retirement number
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is hard to look at.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Gme and you be few mil over from retirement
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Still got 300k left to lose there bubby.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,At least your heart is much stronger now.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,If u were 100k you are an idiot for not putting it in something boring.  7% makes you 100k in only 1 fucking year....
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honest question, how would a retirement on that amount look?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The fair value of your account is 380k
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love you fucking apes. This is retarded level amazing. 1.3 million dollars of losses, boy you really needed that extra 100k didn't you! You could probably have made that extra 100k at McDonald's bro, or just sell some drugs for a minute."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"what stocks fuelled that huge spike and drop?  Can't be only GameStop, or you'd be up around the 900k mark still..."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Ride the waves
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude... Get in a monthly dividend stock with 200k your looking at over 3k a month....
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you would‚Äôve hit 100k higher I have a feeling your ‚Äúretirement number‚Äù would have gone up as well.
I get this is a casino but secure some damn profits on the way up dude."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol the painful thing is if you are that close to your retirement goal you may as well shove it in a fucking ETF or Mutual Fund for a year and get more than $100k on your 10% return. Sorry for your loss, hombre."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Something something pigs something something jim cramer
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Greed give you everything that you need

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Retire? I‚Äôm surprised someone even employs you, cause you are clearly dumb as hell"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Literally could have taken that 1.6 mil, put it in boomer funds/stocks and live the rest of your life making 100k/year"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like a double bottom to me bro you‚Äôre gonna bounce back
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,lofty goals if i had your current amount i could retire.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"One good thing is, it looks like you‚Äôve reached a support level around that 380 mark, if that breaks I‚Äôd look around 280 for support.  But you are in dip buy territory for this ticker.  Strong dip by at 280 as that looks like a key support level"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"WTF are you trading??

from peak to valley its a swing of 1.3 million?

dayum bro. sometimes u just have to take some profits along the way."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Hold.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"wow,  a lot of options in GME?

you wanted to retire off of $1.75M?  Is this a ROTH accoun?  just wondering, if there are taxes.  Dunno your age, so not sure if 1.75M - Taxes, would be enough to retire on."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,F

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Up 220% in taking some profits I‚Äôm happy already...

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,How does the retirement number work? You're gunna just leave that money in an s&p tracking fund?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,1.5 mil not enough to retire on?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Good job you didnt sell. More wants more ;) next time you dont dont Do the same mistake. Always sell 50% at 500x Thats the Golden rule of investment.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know this hurts, but I would not be worried for your portfolio. Your portfolio is very volatile and has experienced dips exactly like this several times (Nov ‚Äò20, Jan ‚Äò21). It looks like you‚Äôre just near the bottom of one of those."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm up 100% in the last 12 months thanks to covid unfortunately.

Yes I buy and hold, yes I know I'm retarded, thanks."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't hold until you hit your retirement number.  If you get within 5% you'll make that in less than a year in plain jane index funds.  If you get within 20%, that's just 2-3 years without adding anything else to it.  Now you're back down to a couple decades (unless of course whatever you're doing yields returns like that again).  I'd just be ready to sell if you even get within the ballpark again."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably, but I was being sarcastic. Selling options provides more stable results, since you win more often than not. The rare times when it does go tits up it can hurt like hell though. Imagine selling a 10-bagger and holding till expiry.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,And I was thinking... I've already sold my positions to take profit. You are probably holding which means you can't use that capital for other investments.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Think about this:


You set trailing stop loss. You reap nearly max profits. 


You set a limit buy for lower price to pickup on the dip."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not necessarily true, there are many reasons to do so. In a total market or sector correction, there‚Äôs reason to sell your lower conviction positions to go more heavy into your higher conviction positions and getting that capital loss down on paper.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it's a big dip, the stop loss lets you skip the drop and buy the dip."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Price is 200 now. I won't sell. I will put in an order that I sell when it hits 150.""

Yes, smart people orders.

Why are you even putting your money into a company, if you don't think it will go up in your goal timeframe?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Small correction

A stop loss is a sell order where you set a price below the current trading price, and that order will automatically convert to a market sell order if the stock price hits the stop price.

A stop limit is the same sell order, except you put a stop and a limit price, and the difference is when the stock hits your stop price, your order will covert to a limit sell order at your limit price."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,exactly
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"yes but thats because they have regulations and clients who they have to report to, its litteraly their job to be exposed to as little risk as possible(coincidentally this is also a big reason why they struggle to beat a diversified etf portfolio nowadays)"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Selling options beats low cost index funds or dividend funds over the long period.

I think selling options and going for a 20% return is low risk. 

Sell covered calls on good stocks like apple/ Visa etc at 10% OTM over 30-40 is easy money with little risk. They will never completely drop in price.

You just need the initial capital! This is the hard part."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Correct me if I'm wrong here(Still learning options) but wouldn't an assigned CC not be the end of the world at all? You'd be selling at a higher price then you're holding already so would just get more capital out of it than when you sold the CC to begin with. Even if share price is a little higher than what you end up selling for couldn't you just buy back in and get back to business?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know what dividends are, it's my main interest in investing. I was talking about receiving a steady income using covered calls. I thought you could only cash in a profit once, not generate a steady income from covered calls."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah. To sell or not to sell. And uncle sam takes half of my bag
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That's what I do. If I'm up a lot on one stock I set a stop loss to grab a portion of the gains and use that to spread the wealth to other similarly hit stocks that will be new to my portfolio.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If its available, I buy with a stop loss 100% of the time. It guarantees that the price doesn't drop right through you buying it. It can bump up a little and then drop again, but way better than a limit buy imo"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Source?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You put it to prevent a large loss and if it does plummet then you sold at $150 and if you want to buy back it at a much lower price you can and possibly come out on top.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"And if you get assigned just roll into cc, still have premium to collect."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Never get assigned until you do. And then IV plummets
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So with $80k I could pull in $1k to $2k a week and never get assigned? Or do I need more than $80k?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Eli5?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,you can't go 10% OTM if you want any premium.  Needs to be like 3% OTM
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think that‚Äôs the kicker tho, having a ton of upfront capital and still taking on (albeit small) risks for relatively small returns ain‚Äôt everyone‚Äôs bag, especially with inflation fears."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are correct. You miss out on potential upside gains but that‚Äôs not your play.

You have a stock that is trading at 100.

You sell a call at 115 45 days out.
If it goes past 115 you must sell at 115. You collect the premium and the 15 increase. Not a terrible deal. 
If the stock goes to 150 you miss out on a lot of upside gains but you still got some of it.

The risk is the stock goes down below 100 (your cost price). But you can continue with your CC generating income."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you write and sell a call, you pocket the premium. If the stock never reaches strike then you keep your shares and get to write another call."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"At the time though, did you sell to secure profits or was there fishy stuff going on or too much risk/uncertainty? In hindsight, no, you shouldn't have sold but i'm sure it was the right choice at the time."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The apartment probably consists of more than just the 1 bedroom lol
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"A one bedroom apartment means the entire flat.

So 800sqft is the combined size of the entire apartment--the bedroom, the living room, the kitchen, the bathroom and even the closets.

A ""studio apartment"" or ""bachelor apartment"" doesn't have a bedroom--the bedroom/living room/kitchen are all the same room. 

Personally I lived for about 5 years in a one bedroom apartment in LA that was only ~500 square feet--an 800 square foot one bedroom apartment isn't really that small. There are houses in LA that only have ~1000 or ~1200 square feet of living space."

I‚Äôm talking about taking low risk so 10% OTM for 30-40 days out and maybe making 2-3%.
Then repeating this 9/10 times over a year and making annual returns of approx 20%.

On a million capital this is 200k a year working from anywhere and only requires an hour work each day. That‚Äôs how you retire and live comfortably."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, but then there's no way it can generate a steady passive income like dividends. That was the whole original topic."

If you set up a stop loss on a long position, you will literally sell on the dip, not buy.  

What /u/gamma55 is saying is absolutely correct.

Stop loss is better used for TRADING, which is playing options, INVESTING is for long term positions."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your death rate is 2% of infections, 0.09% of population, with 5% population infected.

Mississippi's death rate is 2.3% of infections, 0.23% of population (unfortunately testing was lax so this may not be accurate), with 10% of population infected.

your lockdowns are DEFINITELY making a difference, it's literally cutting your deaths in half compared to areas not locking down, it's bad there but it's 2-3x as bad in the US states that stayed full open.

To compare to my state, which did strict lockdowns early and kept stuff locked down (though not as strict as Ireland), Minnesota has a 1.4% death rate of infections, 0.12% of population, with 8.9% of population infected (thankfully social distancing was practiced here pre-covid)"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Now correct for population density and adherence to rules.

Honestly from where I stand, the stats look a lot different.  The fact Chicago was able to maintain rates remotely close (hell, in many cases far better) than the surrounding middle-of-bumblefuck midwestern states basically speaks volumes that incredibly weak forms of ""lockdowns"" work very effectively when you have a modicum of respect for your fellow human beings.

I've certainly learned a lot of lessons from this pandemic about my fellow humans I live with.  They are not the lessons you have learned, and that's why this country is done for.  I grew up around tons of folks like you, only to have to run even further to get away from the idiocy.

And I agree no one is looking great here.  Tons of stupidity all around, lockdown camp included.  The solutions are pretty dead-on simple, but with American's being who they are as shit-tier human beings those solutions were not tenable.

So instead of nuance and soberly combing through the decision making process while information was sparse, we're just going to screech about how everyone was wrong.  All nuance will be lost - the fact we should have different rules for different population densities/demographics/climates has been completely lost on practically everyone.

About the only thing I know for a 100% fact?  What little faith I had in the American social contract is now officially dead.  I no longer will contribute to the system, and will actively take on a ""Got mine, fuck you"" attitude.  It seems to be the only way for my family and intimate friends to survive the coming few decades.  This event has shown the American social contract as seen from at least the WWII generation is officially gone - we are no longer a unified nation at any level whatsoever.  We had a baby pandemic and almost fell apart as a nation.  The first true stressor is going to end us instantly."

And you have the gall to say living like this isn't worth living??? 

What a fucking dumb opinion to parade around with no shame or thought for the wider implication. You don't think temporary lockdown is life worth living when you're alive - while others don't have that luxury. Two days ago, a woman fainted at her home was rushed to the hospital and was dead upon arrival from complications due to covid. Not immunocompromised, not elderly by any stretch. Lost consciousness and died.

There are some real fucking dumbasses here who are the core part of the problem with the US, UK, and other regions. These ""lockdowns don't work"" types are going to be a fucking problem when something worse comes along that affects all ages equally. Scientific studies, rather than AP news articles, have shown that lockdowns work for lessening burden on the HCS and allowing us to treat patients when they're not fighting for space and there are ventilators available. 

I fucking hate every single one of the pricks here who try and say ""life isn't worth living in lockdown"" when they're alive and others aren't - because of people like them being flippant and ignoring protocols."

2021-03-20 09:08:48,wallstreetbets,"ASO Apes Like the stocks - Rednecks like Guns and Ammo &#x200B;

[Positions](https://preview.redd.it/znukp6db54o61.png?width=955&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b3d022c5731443cc5da11f7bba78e4540c531fc)

So I will start with I saw someone's DD the past two weeks and I started diving in and I like where ASO is at.  I am going to keep this short and sweet.  Last quarters earnings proj at .36, actual was .91.  This was early December.  Christmas and two damn  stimmys later and this quarter is March 30th for earnings release with the Trailing 12 looking very nice (Up 10% rev).  ""But stimmys go to GME like good ape should"" ... and I agree.  But the customers they cater to are not apes my fellow apes.  They are of the reddest of necks.  And rednecks don't need bananas, they need guns and ammo! (Cue 80's Rock mix)

Here is their company description.

The company sells a range of sporting and outdoor recreation products, including sporting equipment, apparel, footwear, camping gear, patio furniture, outdoor cooking equipment, and hunting and fishing gears primarily under the Academy Sports + Outdoors, Magellan Outdoors, BCG, O'rageous, and Outdoor Gourmet brand names. As of August 1, 2020, it operated 259 Academy Sports + Outdoors retail locations in 16 states and three distribution centers located in Katy, Texas, Twiggs County, Georgia, and Cookeville, Tennessee. The company also sells merchandise to customers via academy.com website. Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc. was founded in 1938 and is based in Katy, Texas.

&#x200B;

I even saw one that described the company as ""catering to local flavor"" by selling crawfish boilers....

&#x200B;

Need more info?  90 mil outstanding shares, 30 mil float and 12.5 mil shares shorted (40.3%) as of 2/26/21

&#x200B;

TL;DR   Potential to Squeeze?  Who the fuck knows.  Potential to pop off naturally?  Fucking Maybe.  All I know is rednecks arent buying GME and they have too many damn kids so their Stimmys are huge.  What do you do when your trailer is paid off?  Buy more guns and Ammo.  $ASO Q4 looks amazing to me.

&#x200B;

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,From Houston and I love Academy. They're the official retailer for the Astros afaik and in the last few years after every postseason win there are lines out the door for merchandise. They do pretty damn well for themselves.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Earnings are scheduled for 3/30 and insider lockup period expires 3/31. Makes me even more bullish. Surely ASO management is expecting extremely good earnings so they can sell at a high price after their lockup period ends. Surely they wouldn't schedule an earnings call before they can sell their shares if they are expecting the stock to tank. 

Also there is a high short interest - blowout earnings could be the catalyst for a short squeeze."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,i like this stock too. looking at TDA it says it has 92% institutional ownership with 42% si.

The store is always busy.

They sell out of ammo every Monday wed and friday when the truck arrive.

And the gun racks are empty."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the stock. I have shares and call for 4/16. They do earnings 3/30. ASO is primed and ready for take off. HODL
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I would lump Vista Outdoors with this. They are a leading ammunition manufacturer with Federal ammo.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm a redneck ape, and I like the stock."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Problem with this thesis as there are few guns and almost zero ammo to be found. Even if the demand is there they can‚Äôt sell what they don‚Äôt have.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"A little fucked up with your attitude towards people from the south.  Owning guns and gme is not an either/or.  Be careful trying to package a large group of people like that, sound familiar?"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah buddy ASO retards unite!!! I got 300 shares of this bad boy cause everything's bigger in Texas haha. Guns and Ammo and Tents, everything a man needs in summer."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,ASO is solid it had volume for one day shot up to 27 then lost all volume and hasn't been steady for a minute .
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"ehhh. I am just a retard ape, but personally... looks more like it is getting ready to trade sideways or correct down slightly for a while until earnings come out.

EDIT: To add on to what someone said below. there hasn't been a whole lot of ammo to go around since rednecks have constantly bought it out. It is never in stock, but that is kind of a moot point cause even though it has constantly been sold out since before the election. It can't have that much margin or volume on it. 

Sure summer is coming around and a lot of people picked up outdoor activities already. Some will choose to this year as well, but I doubt it will be near the levels of last year. People are itching to go back to movies, baseball games, and all that other bullshit I cant be bothered to do."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,All the outdoor goods stocks are running up as part of rotation expect ASO. It is been siting tight at 25 for enough time now. I expect after earning on 3/30 it will pop....
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look for more anti gun legislature, rednecks panic and buy shit tons of ammo and guns every time

Big money won't buy in knowing that lockup expiry is the next day. Even if earnings are spectacular, they *know* a dip is coming. It would be pretty dumb to significantly buy in before April 1st. And then, they'll largely just be offsetting the dip.

I could see it going up, but I'm skeptical of a massive boost."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What ‚Äúsector‚Äù Youconsider yourself?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Has it not rotated? I have some ASO but I figured the run-up to $25 was the rotation

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"At least you used the correct term, redneck is a racist and offensive term to average white southern people."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs not strictly guns and ammo, it‚Äôs outdoor activities in general"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice I'm in 400 shares and got 8 30strike calls for 4/16 witch theta  been kicking my ass in
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"My guess would be political and social crazy times plus incoming democratic president. Either one would make gun lovers line up, both at the same time? Cash register go brrrrrrrrrrrrr"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is true. Will think about closing my position during the run up if it's significant. Wouldn't institutions buy in before/right after earnings and then sell before lockup expiry? There's a full day between earnings and  before the lockup expires.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes I too want to see the result of this.  Long shares here, on the fence about options"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The Democrats funded by Bloomberg are trying to take our guns. They‚Äôre not liberals, they‚Äôre authoritarians under a Progressive mask. Liberals are the opposite of authoritarian, the NeoLiberals just corrupted the meaning."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Well... they didn‚Äôt load up on guns and ammo because they where worried about murder hornets.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol, ok."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs 75% of the reason I bought my guns. Wasn‚Äôt gonna get murdered by a hornet. Need to protect my self
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This isn‚Äôt a politics sub but I‚Äôm happy to direct you to all sorts of mainstream media articles talking about the anti-gun funding by Bloomberg. Heck, you can find a video with [Bloomberg saying he paid for Democrats to win seats](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/02/25/mike-bloomberg-congress-donations/). Do you think the guy that charges $24k a year for a terminal is spending $100 MM of his own money for 21 Congressional seats out of the goodness of his heart and for no reward?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol, ok."
2021-03-20 08:56:46,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs a share? IRA rollover 
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol literally following Michael Burrys play with options? You forgot the prison company.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Good luck on that Tesla put.. I see it going to -80% if you hold for a few more months but that‚Äôs just my opinion.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Nio and Tesla are going to ruin this for you.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Very nice op. Any thesis behind the kraft calls?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt get buying the Kraft call when it‚Äôs in the money. It‚Äôs $40 now so why would you buy a call option for $20 and pay $20 per option? Isn‚Äôt that the same as just buying the stock now?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve got some low bids waiting to be filled on it
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"-80% if tsla at over 1k, very possible.  Looking for a 500 dip before switching sides."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought it before inclusion.... held through the peak and was actually in the money a week or so again.  Still holding will see
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Most likely!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Lots of Americans staying home = lots of Mac n Cheese
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Momentum seems to be building, potential gap to fill if you zoom out on the daily or weekly candlestick

On the 20 year/month and macro trends market cap charts close to all time lows. 

Burry holding 20M KHC calls (supposedly) 

starting long dated and ITM,  let‚Äôs see if it jumps over the next month or so, if so will hang on and buy more.  This time shorter dates and otm and shares.  If not... still have some time to pull out without getting completely burned ü§ûüèΩ 

Plus who doesn‚Äôt like ketchup, ballgames, restaurants, mac and cheese? Fuck it let‚Äôs go."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs risky, but leverage. You can buy twice as many calls as stock and since it‚Äôs deep ITM the delta is virtually 1. So if the stock goes up by a dollar you make twice as much as you would have with stock. (I‚Äôm kind of assuming there is enough volume on these options that they‚Äôd be able to unload them if it peaked)"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôd be fine with a quick dip so I can get more calls haha. Best of luck! üöÄ
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm just saying tesla long term will go up IMO as it has since IPO, so it‚Äôs always a dangerous game betting against them lol."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Whoa!! This level of DD. Good thing the market‚Äôs not open. I‚Äôd be smashing that buy button.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought into KHC with the last of my portfolio. I truly thought I lost all my money on stupid options trades over the past year and a half. Changed my strat to longer dated exp and put all $5,700 on 4/16 $37.5calls around feb 11. Within 2-3 weeks my port was worth $32,000. I truly believe in this play."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This... that deep in the money it almost prices out like a spread.  tickers pretty slow moving so dont want to lose money weekly if it stays flat
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Well done!  How many of them have you closed?
2021-03-20 08:38:33,wallstreetbets,GNUS fam... It's getting real bois. üíé‚úã Im all in #YOLO. See you on the literal moon. üåù 
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lots of good stuff going on. Arnold Schwarzenegger is an investor and producer and developing a show, Shaq developing a show, Marvel partnership, RBLX shows, Stan Lee properties, lots of shares shorts so could see a squeeze, and insiders have been buying up their own shares, this is going to moon."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oof thanks for giving me a flashback of my low... buying in at $5+ after the Arnold news. Ultimate lowlight, but I recovered after 10 rehab sessions."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Stan Lee‚Äôs last kid animated series is coming out from genius games soon
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have 110 shares @ $2.24

A 4/1 $2c
A 4/16 $3c
A 4/30 $2.50c

Every call I've bought for any other stock has expired worthless, or looks like it will. I'm REALLY hoping these pay off. I need a win."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"What's up with GNUS? Good luck bro. 5 year chart looks decent but not sure what's been going on in the business?

Nice return today btw, it's on the upswing"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Not gonna play it into earnings?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! One week
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Show your average price.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Try betting on a company that actually makes a profit üôÑ
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt think this guy knows what literal means...

Also when the fuck did $6K become YOLO. BAN."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I jumped ship when I heard there was a class action against GNUS.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dont have that much in there, but I am with you and will add a few hundred more in next week before March 31! To the fucking moon!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Mods. Why are you guys not banning this ticker. It‚Äôs a huge scam.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good job hedging, exactly our purpose rn is sending ambiguous option screen shots on Robin Hood. Proof or ban."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also forgot to add - check out who's leading their Kartoon Channel.  Some serious heavy hitters.  In her last gig Loesch founded and then sold Fox Kids to Disney for $5.5 Billion.  Neuman was President of Disney Television.  So major connections in the industry, long track record of major success.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You can see that I'm down. So I bought them for higher than what they are now...
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha, so when TSLA was losing money no one should have invested?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,How about SPCE which went from $7 to $60....or FCEL which went from .20 to $30....oh wait those don't make profit either. Ya fuckin' clown.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao gtfo you fucking boomer
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Get a grip dude - I don't think you understand colloquialism.  I can LITERALLY find tons of other examples where people use ""literally"" colloquially.  

Also who's to say 6K isn't a YOLO?  I've seen tons (not literally ""tons"") of posts here where people invest under $5K and its a YOLO."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you have $6000?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Some fucking idiots who are suing because they lost money in the stock market. They're probably some retards from this forum.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I've got 141 shares @2.20. Holding til the moon
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The proof is in the screenshot boss man!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice! Good job staying on top of it. I'll have to read up on it.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,TONS of development. 2020 was the starting point. Stacked board and executive members. Celebrity + Buffet involvement. It's definitely a good long term investment.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"haha, pwned"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Keep buying Tesla. I‚Äôm buying the people who mine materials like lithium and graphite. Keep chasing fads...
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or ocugen, mvis, zom"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh yea, that‚Äôs the strategy! Let‚Äôs just look to the past to predict the future.... genius! üôÑ"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Name calling is always a good replacement for a solid theory... I can‚Äôt wait to see what you call Tesla after it loses your money
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,No it was actually because the CEO made false claims regarding a partnership.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Is that Robinhood?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Not buying TSLA now. But was when it was losing money and am up big.  A huge part of investing is seeing what is possible into the future.  Just because a company is losing money right now doesn't mean it won't be big in the future.  Are your lithium and graphite companies making a profit right now?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That's not what I said. Not sure if you're retarded or just trolling.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I was just joking man
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do you even know what these supposed ""false claims"" were, dummy? Heyward said something and the price of the stock went up. Then later the stock price went down. Amazing. Stocks go up and down. Welcome to the market.

What he said wasn't false, GNUS still owns Stan Lee IP and is working with Marvel. Execution of deals just didn't happen on the timeline the retards suing wanted it to. So they lost money and now they are suing like the retards they are. Tilray gets sued almost every quarter and it still has 5b market cap. Nobody cares about clowns who think they lost money because of ""misleading statements"".

Stop being a fucking retard for once and try to use what little brain cells you have left."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yikes
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Fosho
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Big part of investing is doing your research and being truly diamond hands to be ahead of trends. You should be on r/stocks with no theory behind your shit
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Half the value of Tesla was the bets against it. You know about the volume of shorts? Or are you just guessing when would be a good time to buy?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm retarded enough to try to help traders who have no idea what they are doing üòâ
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha guess we struck a nerve? Have fun being invested in that dumpster fire.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You do this to support Robinhood or loss porn? I don‚Äôt understand spam posts like this tbh. Don‚Äôt yolo a shitty investment strategy 10 months down the line.. you sucked then and you suck now.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha, dude you're profile is literally 1 month old and you're on here talking ""diamond hands"" like you been on wsb for years.  Funny."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Define ""value"""
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro I‚Äôve been making money for more years than GNUS, that‚Äôs the funniest shit about it. I‚Äôm just trying to give you a free kick in the ass instead of the market nailing you in the nuts üòâ"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"So you are going to help me by giving me a free kick in the ass?  Ok, lay it on me, give your words of wisdom!  Haha, love to hear it."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, you could have been head fry cook on the night shift at Wendy‚Äôs for the last 3 years and netted more than GNUS, that‚Äôs not counting the extra income from the things that go on behind the dumpster."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"So ""value"" is the price of a stock?

Oh, no sorry.  That's the wrong answer.  Thanks for playing though."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Pay attention to the rising 10 year yield and how it effects the market‚Äôs attitude for future projected growth. Pay your P/E multiples a little bit more attention
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What have you got against head fry cooks at Wendy's?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe you should take the hint that you both need training in order to be better traders. At least getting trained at Wendy‚Äôs wouldn‚Äôt have cost you your life savings in the process
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Enlighten me üôÑ
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yields and stocks are not necessarily correlated.  There is some recent correlation but it hasn't been the case for much of this past century.  New investors seem to think so, but its just not true.  Also PE is maybe good for mature stocks, but terrible tool for growth stocks."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nothing at all. I hear after 7 years as a fry cook, they let you begin the training to fry the tendies."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha, no."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs funny how rookies discredit fundamental investment knowledge when they don‚Äôt agree with it

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I held but then people kept spending insane amounts of money on ridiciulous strike OTM calls  while the price was dropping... I took my profits and will be watching from the sidelines, maybe rebuy for a third time when i see some positive signs."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You joke but after missing the first peak in January I bought in at $50. Feb 25 I was literally making my kids tendies for dinner, checked my portfolio and found it up damn near 200%."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought more yesterday
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not a financial advisor but... flip a coin, heads you buy, tails you buy"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought at 43.61, still bought at 202.11. Plan on buying more in the dips. Don't care if I average up because I know the value of this stock will be more in the future."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I wanna touch it though.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, OP is using Cricket Wireless.That's all I needed to see."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Underrated comment... probably OP is a shill. We didn‚Äôt ‚ÄúhAd‚Äù to hold, we STILL NEED TO HODL!"

EDIT: That was kinda dik of me to say, but it's rooted in a interesting and possibly good idea. If you constantly find yourself in losing trades like this. Consider betting against your thesis x2 and then bet on actual thesis x1. So try this 2:1 method on a couple of trades and see if it works out."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Dang what really made you thought it was gonna moon?  There was a shitload of hype on wsb about uwmc. I thought it was gonna moon too but I had some uwmc calls that was getting near worthless so I just let it ride instead of buying more.

2021-03-20 06:42:38,wallstreetbets,"GameStop.com Ok so here‚Äôs some real fucking numbers for everyone. Hey Citadel/Melvin how you like these fucking Apples.

GameStop.com
4.15 million visitors/month over the past 6. 

That‚Äôs before all the mess they created and all the PR. I might add THEY paid for. Yes, even the FUD is free advertising. Remember there‚Äôs no such thing as BAD press. 
(The visitor rate is an actual number from the internet anyone can look it up) 

I ran an e-commerce site I know how this shit works and you‚Äôre sooooooooo fucked!!!!!

If you use normal website sale conversations it‚Äôs usually about 10% of visitors. So GameStop right now gets about 415,000 orders a month on their site and if you just say each one of them is JUST a game nothing else you‚Äôre looking at probably an avg sale of $60. So if we just say the site does this piddly little amount /sale you have about 24.9 mill in sales/month. Now as we all know but maybe Melvin/citadel haven‚Äôt figured it out yet they have made massive enemies out of every single stockholder. Meaning that each and every single GameStop holder will never buy anything with regards to gaming anywhere else.....EVER. Along with the fact that now every single fucking person on Planet earth has and will hear about GameStop. So now let‚Äôs say that visitor rate increases 3x that‚Äôs 12mill/month and that turns into 1.2 mill sales/month with an avg of $60. Woof you can see where this is going. Can‚Äôt you? You(Melvin/Citadel) have created a fully functional lifestyle gaming brand that HASN‚ÄôT even started yet and you‚Äôre shorting has given it a share price of $200. As investors we thank you so much for believing in our fledging company and what it has to offer the gaming community. Hahahaha man would I love to be on the GameStop board even just apart of the marketing team. You‚Äôre so fucked it‚Äôs not even funny. This is a marketing/comms team slam fucking dunk and it‚Äôs not even started. The shorters better get their shit together because imma go so fucking long on this investment I ain‚Äôt never letting go. I don‚Äôt even really want a squeeze I just want a $1,000 share price just by fundamentals so we can all shove it down your fucking boomer throats. God damn I can‚Äôt wait to watch Cramer suck RC‚Äôs dick live on air. That will taste so good. Imma lick the tears off Melvin‚Äôs and Citadel‚Äôs cheeks."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,We just spent 400k adopting apes....  in a week.. thats just one wildlife site... you dont think apes spent $50/month x 10% of wsb members? I have a 10yr old kid.  Ive spent $100min./month since xmas alone in ps4 gear/pokemon/merchandise
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,2% conversion is considered very good. 1% is average.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I spend ~2k each year on graphics cards upgrades alone. I can‚Äôt wait until gamestop carries pc parts so i can never use amazon again
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,As a web dev I can tell you that 10% is high asf... You're looking at more like 1-3% conversion rates
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"yoo, i got an idea to promote GME and WSB.. Has anybody pitched an idea of having a WSB funko? IDK who own the rights to the WSB logo but seems like a great marketing idea! 

Shows support from both sides and it will generate more revenue for GameStop."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would love an out of the blue marketing stunt from gamestop. Sure, they could issue stocks and get heaps of money, they could do a stocksplit and give dividends. But imagine the PR madness if they did something crazy.

I would love to see Reggie announce that through his connections with Nintendo they will make a gamestop exclusive Donkey Kong amiibo that looks as if it's made out of diamonds, and all the profits of the sales goes directly to Dian Fossey gorilla fund.

Just imagine the headlines!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Gamestop should have a promocode like WSB25
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look, I hold 82 @ 201 since January but I  have run an eccomerce brand for the last 10 years and you're a little off. 10% conversion rates are insanely high. They may pull that off and I'm bullish on GME (If I hadn't YOLOD I would have bought more shared during the mnay dips) but let's be real and not make stuff up for the sake of confirmation bias."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Would like to point out that bots generate a shit ton of page visits when they cop ps5s

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry to be nagging here, but it is called conversion rate and 10% is an extremely good rate in my experience. 

Pos. 400+ shares and holding."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Does reading 10% average conversion make my average conversion rate 10%?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"A lot of factors at play.

Upon purchasing from GameStop you get competitive prices,  good service on all the top brands. Which is what most people would be happy with alone.. Myself included.

But for the low low fee of 'where you choose to shop' you get to support the average Joe retail investors (many could be family) and every company that has ever been shorted and drove into the ground at ever given opportunity (Tesla/RKT you name it)...With the extra bonus of shitting on the guilty hedgeglfunds and proving a point to the 1%.

Suddenly it all becomes a bit of a bargain.

Finally, I wasn't going to buy the new Xbox, but I'll likely be buying it now and it's an easy guess where I'll be buying it."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd buy off of Gamestop if they shipped to my country but they don't, sadly."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I love the pure bitter taste of hedge fund tears in the morning.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,If I were GameStop is be running some funny meme tv ads. Keep it viral.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I think I will........ BUY MORE!! üòÄ got a sweet discount yesterday at 190.60$!!!! ü¶ßüíé
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If GameStop comes up with a platform to rival steam I am never using any other platform again. I like the stock, I like the company."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look I like the attitude but those numbers are pulled straight out of your $ASS. 10% of customers does not mean customers visiting due to hype. Dont know why you think 3x an already hyped number for no reason is realistic. 

Stats are based of specific circumstances. Changing the circumstances changes the stats."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy wall o text Batman. 


Needs a TL;DR"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I'm sure Citadel and Melvin had absolutely no idea that Gamestop had a website."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Even if this never squeezes keeping the share price up above $200+long term would still be massive losses for the shorts

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets," i like the stock i keep it and i will keep it, i have seen many people adopt monkeys (i'm not saying it's wrong) but they could support gamestop by buying from their site, all charity can be done later, this is not financial advice, i'm stupid monkey."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought a mousepad and some screen cleaning wipes. Best $15.00 I ever spent. I even paid for shipping. My mouse was getting rug burn from all the shares I've been buying, so their QCK medium-sized mousepad was the best solution. It has my mouse singing better than those Charmin' toilet paper bears.

This mousepad was directly responsible for me executing my last buy order before market close yesterday. Now both me, and my mouse, are happy."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think the issue is what GS has done, it is what it is going to do. I never gave a shit about GS before... but if GME moons you can bet I will spend some money there to buy shit. I'm not really a gamer(I used to be a little but I feel it is mainly a waste of time) but I see VR as potentially having major applications in many areas(mainly I am interested in educational aspects and I might, if GME were to moon, go in to developing some VR applications for education that I think would be very successful). Imagine GS leveraging VR with say tournaments. There used to be laser tag... imagine that with VR where the GS stores setup different virtual environments and run tournamets. Given how everyone wants to get back to normal, it could become a socializing thing. Who the hell knows. What matters is what RC does. If he does a few key things GME will most likely moon. He might spread them out, he might sell retail out(I doubt it but you never know, he might be forced to by the government or the HF's might put CP on his computer).

I'm sure a lot of people bought stuff from GS during the pandemic such as the consoles and some games for their kids. It doesn't really even matter if the turned a profit last year... it really matters what is going to happen on Tuesday. Maybe RC will do nothing and wait or maybe he will trigger the MOASS. Time is ticking."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Anyone here holding $GME needs to go visit gamestop.com immediately and spend a little time poking around seeing what they sell these days and spend money.


Buy stuff from their site. Need a gift for your kids classmate? Buy it from gamestop. Need a new mug for work? Buy it at Gamestop. Whatever you're buying, go to gamestop.com first and look for it there. 


Get your friends and family on board with that. Send them to gamestop.com."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Without knowing the demographics of the visitors of the site we can‚Äôt confidently expect that 10% conversion rate to be accurate. While I agree a traffic spike like this likely added to their bottom line. It‚Äôs also likely that a lot of the traffic was not their primary sales demographic. With how heavily this has been in the news many people probably just googled them because they didn‚Äôt know what GameStop was. Like most of the older generations who didn‚Äôt grow up with Video games or go to GameStop. Additionally, oversees traffic that don‚Äôt have GameStop in their country. 

If this was a spike in purely their primary target audience the 10% number would have a higher confidence interval. 

I agree they probably saw an uptick in sales but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to be that dramatic to their bottom line. At least not enough to make their current valuation stick around beyond the squeeze.

That said I think they have potential to trade at $60-100 a share after the squeeze happens. With more long term potential if they can actually right the ship and build out their e-commerce as they have been planning. This could also be their first profitable year since 2017, which would obviously help prop up the stock price. 

This is not financial advice. I just like the stock."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I still buy my games through my Xbox. Maybe because I'm old and a little lazy to figure it out. But I have made a killing on some $8 and $9 calls from AMC so far. And holding 614 shares at 8.09

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I gotta be honest, GameStop has never and probably will never be the place I buy games. There's a reason there have been so many memes prior to this year that focused on GameStop's exceedingly poor trade-in and exchange rates. When a new game costs $60 no matter where I go, I'm going to head to my local game shop each and every time.

Let's not pretend that HF shorting this company somehow turned it into a stellar business that treated its customers fairly. Prior to this year, ""Power to the Player"" was a joke. Downvote me all you want, but I bought shares in GME for the same reason I buy shares anywhere else: because I believe it will make me money, not because I believe the company is worth my business. I mean, shit, I'm a dude but I'd invest in a tampon company if it gave good dividends."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This may actually be the way.  Consume our way to stock riches!

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea. This needs to be higher.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been working in SEO for past few years. I agree, 10% is simply unachievable. 1-2% is average, but considering all the hype and people googling it out of curiosity, I'd say 0.5-1% is more likely"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Edit out the position.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That site is doing 4.15 million visitors over the past 6 months as feb that‚Äôs before all this. The hype hasn‚Äôt even been reported yet I‚Äôm using numbers from sept 20-feb 21. So maybe a bit of hype but nothing that would change this. I mean chewy has a visitor rate if 43 mill/ 6months and that‚Äôs just pet stuff. So I‚Äôll just go with RC replicating his numbers from that enterprise. But now he has higher ticket items with an almost weekly turnover of new content to sell. Along with a 4-6 year console life cycle that seems to tightening up.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer said in his 2006 book. Hedge fund guys don't know much about gaming.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean I‚Äôm not going after you - my buddy manages a decent client base for a specific sector of a specific industry and he doesn‚Äôt really even understand his own stuff.

The problem - and we‚Äôve spoken about it - is that you can either deep dive on 1-3 equities and truly understand them or you can broad dive on a dozen or so, or you can try to manage 50+. Intelligent people who focus on 1-3 will mostly far exceed the performance of the 50+. I feel Ark is a testament to this. 

When looking at a fund like Melvin...I don‚Äôt know how they operate - but briefly looking at their portfolio - they‚Äôre looking at literally everything, super brain dilutive. Maybe highly intelligent people doing good work (well, I mean except the whole losing more than half of worth in 1 month...), but they cannot possibly dedicate the time to the minutia."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôll be in the next report unless this was back in Jan
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think i read somewhere that expectations would be +15% in revenue, so they'll have to beat that number."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"ecommerce sites generally have a P/E ratio of 10 to 1. GME was traiding at 20$ 2 years ago. That means the stock should be worth 200$ if they convert, at a minimum. This would assume nothing else changed. If GME moons then GS will be worth hundreds of billions, this will allow them to do far more + all the exposure they get. Note that Tesla has a P/E ratio of 1000 to 1. We could literally see GME at 2k-20k if the right circumstances hit. Of course people won't hold enough to allow it to get that high but again, if the right circumstances occurred."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,POSSIBLE...
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs with an avg of $60. That doesn‚Äôt take into account of consoles and other items which would drive your sale price very high. I was going lower end just for arguments sake.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Would they let the mods run wild and let a handful control the top 100? If they‚Äôre more transparent in governance, share the power with the users better, and maintain a stance of ‚Äúneutral as long as it‚Äôs legal‚Äù, they‚Äôd bury Reddit.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"$1,000/Share is FUD - during the squeeze it will go much higher."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre not. Just got a Switch with two games this month and have since purchased three more physical and one digital game all online. Renewed the PowerUp Card last month.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"ngl, i bought two switches and like 10 games this month... got a powerup thing too. and all the pops were on sale. I guess i could have bought an ape, but i went full ape instead."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They should name their rewards program ‚ÄúDiamond Hands‚Äù

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah they're kinda sold out.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm still waiting for them to have stock. Not buying from any other place or on the black market. Fuck you Sony and Microsoft, get your shit together"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This. Take into consideration how many people have visited the site exclusively to try and get a next gen system, and have not been able to. Therefore only to try again each restock. These are not small numbers. I‚Äôm all for this movement but I‚Äôm cautiously optimistic about earnings. I am excited about RC and what he will bring to the table."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably lower for GameStop as many people outside the US have been going to their website but are unable to buy anything. I'm in the UK and they don't have any stores in here :(

Although, the US version is blocked for me and I can only enter the European website. Not sure how this changes the data"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Newegg's return policy is shit. 15%-30% restocking fee, god forbid you have to return anything."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Although I'm sure they did have more buyers through all of this, a lot of visits to the site were probably people checking out what all this fuzz is about. If you're buying GME, the least you can do is check their site.   
I just visited them to compare some prices with other stores to see how competitive they are and I assume there're a lot of people who did something similar without actually buying something.

Just make sure you take everything in consideration when throwing around with numbers. In my opinion we can't compare anything Gamestop related with normal everyday events, because this is clearly not a normal situation."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good point, conversion rates should be dependent on product mix on offer"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nope, you‚Äôre ~~wrong~~ delusional. It‚Äôs 1-3% at best."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,heck yeah a wsb diamondhands funko would be sick
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôll be my third one but my favorite one. 

Cheers! to good memories and money üçª"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I will buy this series. Get on it Funko!!! At the very least we need WSB logo kid, DFV, and an ape (cosponsor or cobrand with Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund for extra karma)."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,it took GameStop a couple of days to deliver my stuff in my area but i got it and that is what matters.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"But how often are the PS5s in stock with how many times they check? The bots could be run on a loop to check out GameStop every few minutes, most likely faster, to see if they have new consoles. Guess what. Consoles aren't restocked that fast. The amount of times the bot visits their page is probably insanely higher than the amount of times it actually purchases a PS5 or Xbox.

I myself have probably gone to GameStop.com around 30 times since January trying to get one. Each time they are sold out. I would even go like 20 minutes after they would tweet they are back in stock. Everytime they sell out before I can get one."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You can edit your bot‚Äôs user agent
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You go on about boomers but here you are equating site visits into sales. How many times do you visit a website to determine that you should have bought that thing *elsewhere*. 

You need click rate data to determine this, otherwise it‚Äôs just delusional."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Before all of this? Where do you get the idea there was no hype about GME in January and February? I don't have any numbers, but I'm pretty sure most visits out of that 4.15 mil happened during those 2 months."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Are u fucking high?? 10 to 1 is not normal for ecommerce
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bam, boom dada boom..."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Savage
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,OP Is a total retard- can he not think of *one* reason why people might be more likely to visit GameStop at the moment ahahah
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Fair enough
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs stupid nobody really owns anything. It‚Äôs all an illusion we have all just accepted.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,$1M is the floor
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's 60 bucks a month or 720 a year, you don't buy consoles everyone you dimwit,  60 a month is on a high end of sales and 24 or even 50m a year is not much considering their annual earnings is 8 billion"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not sure if I believe Melvin, Citadel, and the other shorts will get caught with their pants down again.  In the meantime, they'll keep kicking the can down the road while we slowly bleed them dry and the MM makes bank selling way OTM calls to gamblers."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,He said 1K based on fundamentals not because of the squeeze
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,No smarter way than to leverage what WSB has created. They need to take notes from Diane Fosseys marketing team. Hell even if GameStop came out with some t shirt acknowledging our bond and loyalty they could make a $10mil off t shirts alone
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Update that*
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,How much money do you think Melvindel will lose by then
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This ER includes up until January 30th, meaning it includes the 3 days of madness. I'd imagine it's going to be a little split, but for reference: there were 5 million paying rewards members and a little over 40 million rewards members as of February 1st 2020, the most recent data I can find."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"just signed up after this, or going to, point is yeah... Citadel fucking made a lifestyle brand that is about to facefuck them into the ether"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I went in to a local store. Dude was so happy I was buying the super duper $20 gold mega pass super card in store. Asked if buying in store makes a difference for them. The answer was oh hell yes sir. Buy from the store dude. Make their day.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Whatever is best.  Everything counts
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fill out all the info related to the card too, every bit helps them"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I would go in. I think they are using DoorDash for delivery abs DoorDash will take some profits. Woupdvt he surprised if GameStop using DoorDash is a net loss for them. Just go to the store
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro, there's component shortages. Relax. Not sure if you heard but there was this pandemic thing for most of 2020 and it's not gone yet."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I get emails from gamestop every two weeks that they're getting more stock in. If all my money wasn't tied up rn in gme and other investments I'd have gotten a ps5 by now. Soon the tendie man will come for us
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,If you are power reward member you get notifications when PS5 and Xboxs are back in stock online and your local store.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gamestop.ie is where you want to go! They have stores in Ireland (Republic, not Northern)"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I got a GameStop logo t-shirt last week.  I want to wear it walking down Wall Street when this is over.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Not sure.  I feel very few people would have access to data that would allow you to make those type of projections.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm saying it may be counter productive not to. I‚Äôve done my fair share of automated scanning and Akamai and cloudflare are quite fast at nuking my bots when not adhering to good faith. Couple that with JS tracking where most simple bots don‚Äôt include a JS engine I‚Äôd estimate that there is a good probability that bots are largely tracked as bots.

If 10 apes come to gamestop website, and 1 ape, a month (note not the same ape idiot, that's why there is 10), buys a game, that's what 10% is. Now plug in the numbers given above and assume it's not the same 41.5 million people every month (because no fucking shit?). You have indeed earned your crayon and smooth brain though. Congrats."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is on the slim side of % of average people buying stuff, and what they buy. Obviously the numbers are much larger and don't include stuff like brick and mortar things. Just use your fucking head for two seconds while it's not up your ass. Also this number is increasing exponentially with the ""free bad press"", along with a very hardcore fanbase from this sub and likely many other normal people just buying shit for their kids or themselves. 

Everyone here is now dumber for having read what you have typed, I award you no points, and may god have mercy on your soul."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Did I say it's not? Since the sub exploded from 2 million to 9.5 million the mean IQ has dropped to single digit. All I said the 3% is not a WOW OMG IM CUMMING SO HARD MELVIN I FKED kinda thing he make it out to be

He is saying the bad publicity could potential transfer into 450k x $60 a month more business to its website,  its really not a very complicated thing I don't know why you have a such a hard time understanding that. So I said that 450k x $60 new money is not a big deal relative to gme revenue"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC flashbacks intensify
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I was there...at the battle for 14.01.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Literally me except her boyfriend would be sleeping in between us.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What if your into it? And it's like the only thing that turns you on because your just numb to reality and it makes you feel something?...... just asking for a friend.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seriously though, my wife confronted me about my obsessive behaviour with my phone over the past year. She actually asked me last month whether I was cheating on her. Started sending me picture quotes of why it was wrong to cheat and such.

I explained to her that I was addicted to trading like a retard and started sending her tons of links to WSB posts. She was pleasantly amused. She was especially happy to see my GME gains over the last couple of months.

Heck I sent her this post just now. I laughed, my wife laughed, and my wife's boyfriend laughed. It was quite good."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This gives me anxiety

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It would be horrible if I dated a guy as obsessed with this shit as me. You'd have to shop a phone into his hand so it would represent me pretending not to look over his shoulder at AH price action.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, he's also cheating."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,i was there during the algo trade war of 13.99-14.01. Many lives were lost i still remember holding freds hands as they turned to papyrus and he gave into the evil. i lay here wounded on the battlefield at 13.56 but i got one sensu bean in my pocket for next week.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gorwsch, at least AMC is no longer tracking GME so nobody thinks will ever suspect there's manipulation."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This hits way too close to home.

I stay up until 5 am monitoring trades, and my wife tried sneaking behind me a few times to make sure I wasn't watching porn.

I still watch porn though. I'm just smart enough to not get caught."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,‚ÄúHe‚Äôs probably cheating on me‚Äù as she lays right next to him
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Caption should have been, ""He's probably cheating on GME"""
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"We won this month. We won last week. We won this week. We won today. Don‚Äôt let negative media mess with you. Stay positive!

Their only method to stop us was by ‚Äúcrushing people‚Äôs hopes‚Äù when we set price targets on specific dates. They hope negative media can scare us away when they manipulate the price target under our ‚Äúgoal‚Äù.

I‚Äôm glad March 19 is over... 

No more setting specific price targets on specific dates.

AMC is naturally growing regardless üìà

üö® Here‚Äôs why I think we won today:

‚úÖ We still closed over $13.50 (21.5 million shorts must be bought back which isn‚Äôt even far from the 25 million we could have received if we closed over $14)

‚úÖ They wasted millions of bullets for a cute little dip (Short shares available went from 4.8 million to 600k + the true borrow rate fee has grown behind the scenes)

‚úÖ Today they exposed themselves to major manipulation

‚úÖ People are reporting them to the SEC to raise awareness of their illegal actions today

‚úÖ The shorting today will backfire in the future

‚úÖ The results of the quadruple witching effect actually kicks in starting next week

‚úÖ Our community is very quick to call out the hedge fund‚Äôs tricks. Today the fear some people felt when we closed below $14 was unnecessary and exaggerated. However, posts like this one here are all over the internet by now so that ‚Äúfear‚Äù is already fading away.

This is just the beginning... üòâ

The only way they can stop this is by shutting off internet access across the entire world which isn‚Äôt ever happening.

Don‚Äôt forget GME took 5 months to go from $5 to $482...

AMC is following a similar path (But don‚Äôt worry, it won‚Äôt take 5 months in this case since AMC has been mainstream since January)

Buy and hodl üíé"

Without HF‚Äôs trying to profit from option expiry could the price explode higher? Yes. But the price could also crater in no time flat from paper hands. Always remember it‚Äôs not someone rooting against a stock that causes crashes, but rather shareholders who no longer believe trying to get out.

I've never seen it phrased like that."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,**‚ÄùThe fire rises‚Äù**
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I believe today was to get everyone to FUD all weekend and sell regardless if it dips or rises on Monday. 

AMC is a profitable company and you don‚Äôt have to be a stock expert to know that. Movie companies have been saving moves especially for when the theaters open. As well as AMC pretty much holds the monopoly on Theaters. Even if there was non of this market manipulation mess AMC would still be a good BET. The only reason they were hurting last year was because of COVID mixed in with not many great movie hits came out the year before. But if you look at 2018 and before they were doing very well. 

Now that going to the movie is big again it should rise regardless. 

Not financial advise. I‚Äôm still new to all this and could be completely wrong. If so please correct me I am very open minded and willing to learn."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the same noise they always spout about GME as it death spirals. You talk about some magical price point that you are glad you made it over even though it is spiraling down and then it literally doesn't matter. Ever. Just stop.

I mean that's like 2 years of work right there. I'd lose sleep too."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Just invest more so it's worth worrying about
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I haven't lost any sleep over GME. Animal Crossing Pocket Camp fucked me the fuck up though
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish I had 10k to lose sleep over lol
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Just buy some ETFs with the bulk and keep 5-10% as play money. I sleep much better now
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,this is why i just have stop loss take profits and any loss i take is a loss i can afford etc. im not going to lose sleep over this like so many do. Sometimes i get to wakeup and my stock sold AH PM at my target and its a nice little bonus.  Also sorry but i dont follow the SET THE LIMIT TO 2000$ crew im not a pure autist here if i can get 100% return im more than happy with it. My goal is to get 50% return YTD so anything extra is cool/
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,At what point is it worth losing sleep? 100k? 500k? 1M? 5M? 10M?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They call him Mr Snugglesworth and he's only allowed in bed when his positions are in profit

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is literally a violation of the Geneva Convention (or it would be if someone else was doing it to you). Just sleep.

If the GME thesis is correct, you'll have days to exit your position during the short squeeze. If it is wrong, it won't matter and you'll have sacrificed sleep and health for nothing."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,wtf is wrong with you? See a doctor man.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Check at 12:30 and then wake at 6:30, if you‚Äôre Aussie, just seems to be the first hour, lunch hour or last hour that seems to make a difference so far, but twice would suffice if you worry.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao that's impossible, you'd never reach stages of sleep that are actually important for your health. You'd be half dead."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I moved quickly on Thursday to do the same.  Ended up making money rolling out to next week with a $16 CC.  Timing was the key to catching the momentum.  Typically tough to do rolling out.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Sadly not the same outcome ü§ï

I don't mean any of this in a downer way, more perspective I guess. But what the fuck do I know.... seriously. I am a fuxkkng idiot alot of the time. But we do out best and soldier on!

Edit: don't get me wrong, I do drugs. I like drugs hahaha but for enhancement purposes only ofcourse and always allegedly.

Edit2: and fuxk you, not enhancements for my penis. I just read what I wrote and I have had about a 40 of vodka plus about 5 or 6 bowls in my bong but I get how that sounded when I wrote it.... after reading it again.... you understand.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,SNDL spent the whole week teasing then coming back down and the week before that. That stock cucks anyone buying calls on it....which is why I had a spread of covered calls I cashed in on.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"So reddit rallying to force a short squeeze, not manipulation. Tutes buying and selling at a certain price based on their holdings ILLEGAL.

Like I'm all for calling the bullshit that happened back in January that was fucking criminal. But today? Today was a function of the markets, massive options and other derivatives expiring. Don't look into it too much."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Makes me wonder if they are gonna start tanking these stocks next week. Us suckers who were selling CCs of these stocks at these strike price will own shit next week.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"One of these is not like the other.

GME is far enough away and just above the strike"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sold 53 CCs at $18 for next Friday $2700ish premium 

I could get used to this"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I sold 5 at 15.5. easy $550.

Though as soon as I sold them the price jumped from like 12 to 13.50. Sweaty."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes like 40-50% of us have amc and GME
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Nope.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That and SNDL. Like why am I bothering to look?!?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It takes like an hour tops. You just gotta want it.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You know what was meant by that. Dont be a fuckface.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Man the hedges were trying to press it down hard with their manipulation

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So is your wife's girlfriend your girlfriend too?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Basically if your wife tells you she‚Äôs girlfriending while you‚Äôre worrying about the stock market you‚Äôve already won.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"A wife's girlfriend is just a girl who is a friend of your wife, so you basically have nothing to worry about

Wives do this all the time. You don't expect your wife to be a loner right?"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I want to hear about her gf

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't tell her anymore but I try to be on toddler duty so i can let the kid play and I sneakily check WSb and the stocks
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's okay, once you've been to the moon you can get your wife a new boyfriend."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, the *rational* reaction to being ignored in favor of ""smart""phone usage is to just buy life insurance, 'cause the fucker is eventually going to ""smart""phone zombie themselves into heavy traffic."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here is my trick if I have open option positions: (Pacific Time)

1. Go to sleep around 11pm. Set alarm at 6:15am. Set limit orders high enough to feel good closing (not GME). Never stop loss orders. 
2. Wake up. Go to the bathroom. Check prices if it's after 1:00am to see the pre-market. Adjust limits. Change alarm to 7:15 if the market is calm. 
3. If I wake up again repeat no. 2, but if the market is crazy I can't go back to sleep.
4. Wake up at 6:15 or 7:15 am and adjust limit orders or trade according to my plan. Go to work. 

Now that I wrote this I know why I have a persistent headache."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I care but not a lot. I guess it depends on what losing the money means. To me no much. Only that it would be back to the drawing board.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"How to stock market 

1. Alexithymia 

2. Not to care"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok hedgie
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not setting stop losses again, made that mistake in January thinking GME won't drop as far as I set it. Bought back in at not much of a loss and not making that mistake again."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but it fun to watch number go up and down

I still have shares in Stake but don't want to sell and xfer the money to Selfwealth as that will take a week probably, and don't want to transfer accounts because they charge $100!

went from 187 to 160 from jan to feb strictly from shit sleep and exhaustion due to market im not investing my 800$ paycheck in the market i have over 271k in there thats why 50% returns are far more than good enough for the YTD for me and thats why watching my stock is far more stressfull than 90% of the people here who hold 8 shares and scream  HODL DIAMOND HANDSSSS 4EVER because they dont care about losing there 500$ investment they wanna see if they can make 5000$ off i got enough in some stocks to buy a home im not going to be getting my DDs on reddit and chanting on webull to hold in the comments. id rather take calculated risks and profits to ensure i have the best capabilty of profit ytd.

That and not trading meme stocks with you guys really has eased the stress. Im just going to invest in what i know has been working for me the last 5 years it was a fun ride on gme but as summer approaches i already know half the retards in here will blow there paychecks on vacations and other worthless crap and money will drain from the meme stocks im not sticking around for that.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah when it got up there to $1.75 on Tuesday then the second spike on Thursday to $1.68 was the time to sell those and just take the profit. Waiting for expiry unless you really want the stock is a disaster waiting to happen. Will see how things go next week. There was momentum there from stimulus it just didn't stick.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"$6B isn‚Äôt really smaller cap. The way HFT goes absolutely. It was probably 3-4 different players each with 100-200k shares just passing them back and forth netting essentially $0 but keeping the price stable so that they make money on the options. 

I‚Äôm of the opinion that the only reason why it hasn‚Äôt fallen back to $10 is because they all had skin in the game. Seems like everyone on here is hating on hedges when they are probably the only reason for price stability at these high levels. 

Think about it, if they really thought the price would skyrocket why would they not just go long and let it run up further before pulling the rug? Today was a big game of chicken.

The couple 1 second drops from $14 to around $13.73 was somebody hitting the eject button with a high volume sweep. 

I think we see three scenarios Monday. 1) slow trickle lower with price battles every $0.10, most likely. 2) circuit breakers down, I give it 20% chance. 3) price still pegged at $14 as the Mexican standoff continues. 10% chance"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like ARK, and own a Tesla, but this is so wildly optimistic it‚Äôs insane. 

Tesla‚Äôs current valuation is already baking in at least a decade of growth. And now to this already extreme valuation, she is saying the bear case is more than double and the expected value 5x in 4 years...

Her model includes something like 30% of revenue from ride hailing. 

It also includes around 80% annual growth in car sales, and good margins. I guess there will be no EV competition? 

As a general point, I fail to understand why EV companies in general will deserve so much higher multiples than ICE companies? Regardless if it‚Äôs EV or ICE, car production is a capital intensive business with high competition and relatively low margins - they are not SaaS companies who generate nearly 100% profit for each extra unit sold. 

These astronomical valuations for every EV company do not seem sustainable in the long run."

This gives me a raging eggplant üçÜ üçÜ"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Hell yeah üòé buying Tesla Monday
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I saw her model's numbers. That's some good weed ARK's been smoking and I want some.

That's a fuck ton of Tesla cars sold in her bear case. Insurance figures are unrealistic due to strong ties with autonomous driving which isn't happening soon. Tesla has no ride hailing service yet and somehow they can have more revenue from it than several existing such services in <5 years.

I'm just going to halve those numbers on paper to give a more realistic figure that is still higher than today's price anyway. /shrug"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So you‚Äôre sayin‚Äô there‚Äôs a (25%) chance?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,When I saw us politicians buying tesl leaps I knew what to do
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,how is the bear case 1500 thats not being bearish thats just being bullish
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I like Cathie at first... But this is so overly optimistic it's insane
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd love to understand the details behind this.  I think it seriously underestimates the competition they will face by 2025.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Cathy is using casino tactics to beat the house.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Her analysis is definatly correct. With the amount of printing fed is doing, tesla in 2025 will be $3000 and a Big Mac at mcdonalds will be $100. Its called inflation"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone wanting to buy tsla leaps please watch this video - https://youtu.be/antLneVlxcs
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Pure unadulterated brain aids stupidity retardation. ‚ÄúUh duh it could be here it could be there so it‚Äôs in the middul!‚Äù
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm curious what outside factors this takes into acct, I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs skewed, im genuinely interested whether they‚Äôve played the probability of Ford, vw, bmw, Hyundai (everyone else) extending their presence. I think it‚Äôs reasonable to see stock prices in general inflate to this %point across the board as retail investors continue to saturate the market."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,she knows apes would throw all GME tendies into TSLA by 2025
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs like 80% of my normal portfolio üçª
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Which is why I try to hang on the the majority of the shares I get vested to me each quarter. 

Well, except this time, when I sold off 19 shares before the $300 dip and turned that into AMC and GME positions. Worked out pretty well."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"They are so hyped up right now, they can't define a proper bear case because then people would pull their money"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,She‚Äôs needs to add PLTR in there.. what‚Äôs PLTR‚Äôs price target lol
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,cathie is really a new variant of autist immune to vaccine
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wish TSLA would go into a slow steady price drop for a few months until it‚Äôs accurately valued. I don‚Äôt want the company to crash and burn because of dumb fuck investors expecting the unreasonable. White knight here, I invest in TSLA because I want to support e-cars and my city‚Äôs air is fucking disgusting. I hate American McDonald‚Äôs mobiles and I fucking hate breathing shit air. Every time I leave and go to the mountains I feel absolutely incredible. So I have a vested interest in TSLA sticking around and forcing change, I was also a super early investor. If the stock crashes then it could ruin this new push for electric vehicles."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,leaps only go to 2023 ü•≤
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Will PLTR RECOVER it's ATH? Technical Analysis https://youtu.be/qx3lt0b7Fr0
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"They're just like ""we changed our mind"" lol like they weren't trying to influence the stock"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If interest rates go higher, then Tesla will have to be re-evaluated. Fundamentals matter when other options to stocks become attractive."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe this. I also believe that by 2025 it will cost 50 dollars for a candy bar
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"For TSLA to hit this target they must have full autonomous driving with customers paying $100 per month for that service. They must have a completely autonomous taxi service. In 4 years? That tech seems to be more like a decade or two away. The current FSD is not even close to full autonomy.

The we have the China issue. China will be the biggest EV market by far. Is the CCP really going to let a US company dominate their EV market? Not likely. More than likely Chinese companies will get the lions share with Tesla, Ford, GM and VW battling for the scraps.

We would also need interest rates to remain low for the next 10 years. Could that happen? Sure. But just as likely (market seems to be saying more than likely) is that the Fed induced inflation quickly becomes more than transitory and with their new reactive rather than proactive approach they will have to ratchet rates up quickly because they will be so far behind the curve. Tech valuations would suffer for many many years.

Then we have to assume Ford, GM, and VW who all plan to move to fully electric in various capacities by 2030 completely crash and burn. I find that hard to believe and these guys dominate Tesla on the manufacturing, quality, and customer service side of things, as well as being much more adept at not pissing off China. Likely these 3 companies start stealing Tesla market share as the Tesla moat starts thinning.

Everybody is a genius in a bull market. Not saying Cathie is not a genius but lets see a few decades and a few bear markets before I start putting her in the same conversation as a Buffet or a Munger."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Monte Carlo analysis is a casino gamble?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The FSD beta is shit! EV competition growing by the hour. Not sure what will support that valuation. The only way this is possible if cathie end up owning the whole float. The energy business will start seeing competition too.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,anyone else reading this like they're downgrading?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,yeah 3000 in 2025 when every car manufacturer and companies like apple are making EVs too. Or maybe the goverment printed so much money that every stock is worth 3000 dollars.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is what I‚Äôm talking about
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine thinking this overvalued car company will have a market cap more than apple amazon and Microsoft combined and it can‚Äôt even make a billion in profit a year lol
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Of course ARK comes out with this price target AFTER cathie blew her load on tesla when it was 800+ a share, they're desperate for that price to go back up."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It will be so. And for the weenie babies who don‚Äôt believe, we‚Äôll see who‚Äôs laughing in 2025.

Don‚Äôt be a mommyburger!! BUY TSLA!!!!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait.. an ETF who basically rescued the TSLA free fall just put out a bullish price target? No way
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Monte Carlo analysis is not a very sophisticated tool to be using...
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I love Tesla but this is ridiculous
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Tesla would loose most of its shares to GM Lucid Ford in us and Nio Xpev and Li in China and rest of the world
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Going in after game
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,If you had $3000 to invest what would you pick ARKK or TESLA
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hmm, maybe.  Numbers seem high due to increased competition. Maybe."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,2025 calls it is
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,If we can actually afford those leaps
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Dat premium thou

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I prefer the el camino method
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't get these percentages. It's always 50%. It is or it isn't
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They aren't even including energy storage or solar in their models. Does anyone take this seriously?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I like Monte Cristo sammiches
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,...and they didn't even account for the solar and battery side of the business.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Too bad I‚Äôm too broke to get into Tesla lol
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I fully expect to buy a tesla with my teslas.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish I could eat as many crayons as cathy.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,n00b question here... is it possible to invest in ark?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"March 2023 leap is around $10,000. I wonder should I.."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"So whatre we buying? ARKX, Tesla?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This makes me happy about tsla call bot today :)
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Funnily enough I came to the same conclusion of $7000 a share by 2024 by shaking my poop divination jar. It also said $CUM will reach 8 million a share.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,ARK is awesome. Got into it sub 100 and even with the latest drop it's still on the green. All the cool companies wrapped up in one managed and founded by Cathie Wood. She's pretty smart unlike my smooth brain.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn‚Äôt that MOON these days? Half the stocks in that ETF don‚Äôt even have working products on the market yet
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"My boomer parents told me I needed to invest some of my money into something safer like ETF‚Äôs, so took Tesla tendies and opened a ark IRA. Now not only Papa Elon guiding me to the moon, but momma wood too, no stopping this ape. üöÄüöÄüöÄüåôü¶ß"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Elon said they expect 20 million cars by 2030 but growth would be front loaded and more than 50% the next few years. From the last earnings call, ""Am I right thinking next year, we should expect you to deliver, like somewhere between 840,000 and one million cars during the year?"" Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research asked.

""It's in that vicinity,"" Musk said. ""You're not far off.""

I find a lot of things even in their bear case optimistic like insurance and ride hailing. Not selling any of my ~3,500 shares though. Elon is going to get us to early retirement."

Luckily though, you made so much money from TSLA(12k a share) that you paid me handsomely to come back in time to warn you.

WARNING: After you become a Billionaire from selling GME, you generously create a Gorilla Sanctuary in 2022. But a disgraced former CNBC host wanders into your Sanctuary one evening, coked out of his mind, he grabs his bananas and begins some monkey business with your Gorillas.

You wake up fearful for your gorillas safety, as you hear them retardedly screeching for help.

In a mad rush, you slip through the sea of titties and ass, of your many wives and concubines, that usually blanket you while you slumber.

After sprinting to the scene, you have no time to catch your breath, as you are horrified to see a little bald goblin yelling, ""This Sanctuary is  Cramerica now! I used to be Mad Money, but now I am Mad for Monkey!""

As you desperately try to apprehend the former CNBC host, he scratches at your face while staring directly into your soul with his dead eyes, gently imploring you, ""BUY Bear, BUY Bear, I love Bear Stearns, BEARS A BUY!!!""

His words will haunt you forever, but at least you got him to the ground detained and begin to dial 911. But out of the bushes comes a CNBC camera crew. They had filmed the whole thing. And with new state of the art deep fake technology, they set you up!

Replacing the disgraced former CNBC host and his disgusting acts with a digital replica of your likeness.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The biggest issue I find is that TSLA's current price never ran up due to fundamentals. TSLA was the very first company to absolutely run up in price due to gamma squeeze/short squeeze. If you think about it, very few people actually bought TSLA stock and most just played options, both on WSB and big whales (SoftBank). 

People were literally gaming TSLA and kept buying calls nonstop and caused media hysteria due them being unable to shut up about it for months and months similar to GameStop. With enough time when the price stays flat, boomers wrong and wrong again will eventually throw in the towel and accept it. Now whether they continue to jack up the price I doubt it. Options volume on TSLA is no longer what it used to be and I'm sure the majority of the shorts no longer short the stock but limit risk with options so you wouldn't see the kinds of gains TSLA once had."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"She‚Äôs not wrong tho. The competition REALLY isn‚Äôt there, if you actually dig and look. At best it‚Äôs a slightly worse car for the money. Tesla‚Äôs market share in EVs is continually higher than what Cathie projected at first.

Like no one can do this? It's impossible? Because right now Tesla is the leader in FSD software. So guess who is most likely going to be first to get it."

Fundamentals haven‚Äôt really applied for at least the last year or two"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe US competition has not heated up yet, but it‚Äôs starting to show up in other parts of the world, especially Europe. 

How much revenue is Tesla making from insurance and FSD today? What kind of certainty is there that these will be legitimate sources of earnings by 2025?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The competition isn't there today, but this is a multi year forward looking forecast. The competition has time to release several competitor models _each_ between now and then but the bear case is priced like they won't. It's impossible. 

When your market share is 100% you only have one direction you can go from there."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Michael burry also said index funds are going to implode. You know those funds that are super low risk that everyone has in their portfolio that contains the whole market pretty much...
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Internal combustion engines gain efficiency in total production costs and performance capacity every million that are built through improvements in logistics and design as well as raw material procurement.

Once lithium engines are going to be built in the millions similar efficiencies will take place. $25,000 4 door sedans with 500 mile range per charge and over 1 million battery/engine lifetime will be a possibility and that possibility will erase internal combustion engines from transportation the same way internal combustion engines erased horses from transportation. 

Innovations from SpaceX, StarLink, Neuralink, and the Boring company will offer further advantages to Tesla. 


I think TESLA reaching 3000 is possible by 2025 - but if Elon Musk makes his private companies public then funds may diverge from Tesla. 

Efficiency in Tesla batteries will allow for improvements in the energy sector that will be significant. 

And the autonomy pathway for vehicles, while a significant cultural, social, and political development - will also be enough of an economic trigger to change the picture of the whole market the same way the internet changed society. 

3000 a share will make for a total market capitalization that is a possibility by 2025 - though that is valuing total public potential access to Elon Musks companies, not just TSLA."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,right. So it took them 20 years and many many successful products and services to reach to $1T cap. Apparently TSLA already has solved all automotive problems and already valued at $800B and 3x in next 5 years.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They‚Äôll prefer their own before American since they have more choices. Chinese government employees are not allowed to own Tesla.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yet nobody‚Äôs willing to accept how bullish that is for GME. You‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs been a meme for 3 years to buy and hold Tesla and it‚Äôs made a lot of people rich."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro... it has though. The competition is here, it‚Äôs just not competitive. Please go do your research. The only people buying non Tesla evs are anti Tesla hardos"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The traditional manufacturer competition already announced what they are planning to produce by 2025 and they suck. Small expected sales volumes, very high CapEx to get them there. The cars they plan for 2025 are competitive with Tesla from 2018, about a generation behind, not what Tesla will have in 2025."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but without major changes to battery chemistry they won‚Äôt be capability or price competitive
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Perhaps

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Check the returns on TQQQ and ARKK

(tqqq is a 3x leveraged qqq etc)

TQQQ beat ARKK 2 to 1. Comes to show it's not her portfolio thesis, but just tech in general doing well."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm with you here. I bought a little ARKK for too much just before it recently fell, and realized afterwards that if I had done my DD on her previous record I wouldn‚Äôt have bought it. I‚Äôll let it sleep for five years and hope that she becomes brilliant again."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Aren‚Äôt index funds literally imploding as we speak? Didn‚Äôt QQQ drop 3% 2 days ago?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That is an interesting point on how bringing his other companies public will take away funds from Tesla.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The problem with Tesla now is the fact that all other companies are going after EV. GM, Ford, VW... etc the fact of the matter is that they could really take down Tesla in a 10 year span. Look at Porche EV. MKBHD even said that he would buy a porche over a Tesla bc they are better designed.

So we will see. I do agree with what you say. ELON is the future no matter what"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,He announced he was short at 585ish barely a few months ago. So yeah .. very doubtful these puny declines so far would have led him to close.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Theoretical max in 2025, it'll still be in its infancy  then!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,And Tesla is gonna make most of its money from batteries and fsd
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Who buys phones every 1/2 years? normal people last 4-5 years at least or resell it back to market
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Burry is the gayest of bears. He‚Äôs all doom and gloom.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Remember what happened to the phone market when the first iphone went on  sale for 600$? Everyone thought it was overpriced and laughed. Now we will never see those price points again, and its a race to 2000.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,electric cars have been around forever. check the Nissan Leaf. making a quality one that people want to buy is very very hard. there is a reason why tsla has 80% market share.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Investing in pre-profit hyper growth stocks is kind of indirect leverage. In both cases you are taking more risk in return for more reward. The market is efficient enough to ensure that's the case.

QQQ and Ark have similar risk adjusted returns, so Cathie Wood arguably isn't  outperforming the tech index (i.e. producing alpha), she's just taking more risk. I like her philosophy and most of her commentary on the happenings in the markets, I just don't believe in fund managers beating the index over the long run, history has zero examples of it but is littered with funds that did well for a few years or a decade, then underperformed.

I'd rather put my money in QLD (2x QQQ), since that way I never have to worry about Wood retiring and some chump running things into the ground."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Past performance is not an indicator of future success. You also want to look into the whys behind her predictions. A large part of her reasoning for why Tesla would go to $800 post-split involved autonomous driving and while the price did hit her target, her reasoning has been more wrong than right; Tesla is still far from that, let alone those fantastic taxi networks she keeps dreaming about."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Personally I think the fact that Tesla is at 1k roughly (in that range) is pricing in what it'll do in 2025.

Self driving and robo taxis are hard problems, I know because ive worked in the space; and looking at the recent vids on how it can't even do unprotected left turns well doesn't give me such confidence."

- Apple has a 15.9% Market Share of the Smartphone market
- Tesla has a 0.9% Market Share of the car market

Apple doesn't only sell phones (138B$), which is only a bit over 50% of their rev. You also have Macs (29B$), Ipads (24B$), Wearables home and accessories (31B$) and Services (54B$). Tesla has a total revenue of 32B$ in an industry with very low margins. I have no idea how you expect them to get anywhere near the figures Apple is posting for example in the next 5 years, which is basically what they need to get to Cathy's ""bearish"" price target"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"A house doesn't depreciate in value like there is no tomorrow though. Quite the contrary, real property value goes up up up.

Hence why you will not get a loan from a bank to buy a car unless you put down the surplus value in your house as security. No bank or other creditor is ever going to accept only the car itself as security for a loan to buy a car because the car will be worth 20% less the very moment you take it out from the dealer.

It seems quite retarded in my eyes to bet on that the automobile industry would change in less than four years and suddenly become worth a thousand times more out of nowhere just because Musk has a ""vision"". As I said, this valuation puts Tesla at a higher value than the combined value of the entire automobile industry of today, Tesla included.

Do you really think cars will be selling for ten times the prices they are today in four years?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would say this... Tesla has had a hell of a head start, and had this market to themselves for quite awhile... though Ford, GM etc are behind, never underestimate their ability to push steel.

The first two months of every quarter will be basically flat since there are no cars to sell and they go HAM the last few weeks. 

When the factory in Berlin ramps up production we would get a true indication of demand since there won‚Äôt be the shipping delay from California for the Y and eventually the 3.

Before I begin, let me just start by saying that I am in no way, shape, or form a financial advisor, and may in fact be legally retarded. So please take what I say here with a grain of salt. Just know that just like yourselves, I'm balls deep in the GME // AMC phenomenon, and the past two months have been the most interesting in all of my life.

Also, please note that I'm on a laptop, so I'll likely come back and edit this to make it look more enjoyable on a phone. Please forgive the lack of \[rocket emoji\]s! EDIT: üöÄüöÄüöÄü¶çü¶çüçåüçåüåùüåï

EDITED TO REMOVE POSITIONSüõë

**A BRIEF LOOK BACK**

So as we all know, GameStop took off in January. A lot went into it, and a hero was born. We know him as r/DeepF\*ckingValue, otherwise known as RoaringKitty on YouTube and Twitter. His ape name is Keith Gill, and was recently put in the hot seat at the recent Hearing regarding the trading halts that occurred in January, which ultimately prevented the squeeze from being squoze by eliminating a vast percentage of buying pressure. 

He likes the stock, but is not recommending that we buy it. He's recommending that we do our own DD, and dive into the rabbit hole of a crooked-fucked market ran by greed and manipulation that we've been watching day in, and day out for the past two months now, and the mess that they've created regarding short interest, failed to delivers, etc.

AMC happened to be in the mix during all this, and up to this point has survived as capable, and has saved AMC entirely. 

Both of these stocks have a great support system behind them, and that in and of itself is why we will not fail.

All we have to do is put up with the bullshit that is coming our way, and man, it's quite spectacular the lengths that these hedgefucks are willing to go to in order to try and shake us out of our positions.

ITS NOT FUCKING WORKING.

**WHERE ARE WE NOW?**

Here we fucking are, March of 2021, and GameStop is trading at $200/share after reaching a peak of $350 last week before the stoploss jerkfest of the century took place. 

AMC has been receiving great news as of late, and has had a lot of insider buying taking place that points to positive outlook moving forward. They now have 98% of theatres open, and the remaining will follow suit later this month.

EDIT: HERE ARE LINKS TO THE AQUISITIONS

These are just a few. There are more.

Below is a list of positive reasons why we need to hold on to these two stocks until this event plays out, as we're living in times that are uncharted and have not yet been witnessed in finance. We are all a little piece of collective history!

Remember, apes, when in doubt, remember these things:

1. The hedgefunds are BLATANTLY manipulating the system in their favor using various methods such as naked shorting, short laddering, bid/ask spread manipulation, etc. Why would they be performing all of this fuckery? Because we have them by the balls. All we have to do is continue to buy and hold until they destroy themselves from the inside out.

2. A news article was released today stating that the Fed will no longer be providing ""Emergency Relief"" to big banks on Wal Street. Interesting timing, don't you think? A link to this article can be found here:  [Federal Reserve to End Emergency Capital Relief for Big Banks - WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-reserve-to-end-emergency-capital-relief-for-big-banks-11616158811) 

3. We've determined Robinhood needs to be crucified, as all they've done is essentially take your money, data, and export it to a third party for insane amounts of cash, all while providing bogus shares to its' customers, and while causing the trading halt that prevented the squeeze in January. HOWEVER! Think of what this means. They fucked up big time. Not only did this action spark an investigation into their fuckery, but has also lead to two Hearings, with a third to follow. Not sure if anything will come of it, but the best part and silver lining is that ROBINHOOD IS NOW EXPOSED TO RETAIL TRADERS LIKE YOU AND I. They're the first domino in this corrupt witch-hunt to fall, and they won't be the last. Not only that, but now the squeeze will be even bigger than it could've been before, which will make for more tendies. :)

4. There has been a DTCC rule change that will go into effect at some point. If someone has some information on this that is VERIFIABLE, please share, as there seems to be no clear cut answer for when and if this rule has been taken into effect. In a nutshell, the rule change is allowing the DTCC to have daily calls to determine short positions, and the second part would allow the DTCC to forcibly liquidate any short positions that they feel would be too risky or abusive in nature. THIS IS HUGE. If it comes to fruition? We'll have to wait and see.

5. GME has an earnings report that is due next week. If they crush EPS, I strongly feel this could potentially be a catalyst going into next week. 

6. Bots and shills have been filling the comment sections trying to get us out of our positions. Why the fuck would they be doing this? Because again, they're desperate, and will do anything for your shares, because they know they'll be way more expensive as time progresses. Ignore these fucks. Block them, and move on with your day. If you read ANY NEGATIVE NEWS about GME or AMC via comments, always verify that they're at least not a bot/shill first. Let the hedgefunds waste their money there.

7. DFV IS LIKELY STILL HOLDING. - even if he sells, we've seen the numbers, the data, the hearing, the documentary..this game hasn't Stopped. üöÄ

8. Both of these companies are doing great things for their business, shareholders, and future outlook. We should all be excited, and come together during this time and find support through each other. If we hold tight and ride this wave together, we cannot falter. 


We're living something spectacular right now, apes, and the progress we've made up to this point is simply astonishing given the forces that we're up against.

I'm here to ride this thing until the end, and I hope you all are too. Let's keep each other in the loop, and find ways to collaboratively take back from these greedy shits what has belonged to us since they first took it back in 2008.

To the hedgefunds? I hope you're scared. I hope you're nervous. I hope that you see the way of life you've so selfishly lived crumbling around you, as the average Joe takes back what is his, and with a burning vengeance. You can keep trying to cheat, steal, and manipulate your way to our shares, but the vast majority of our effort has become more resilient than you can tolerate.  If you read this, just know that you're fucked, and nobody is going to come running to save your ass this time. 

To all my fellow apes? Hold strong, warriors. That is what you truly are.

Losing your option virginity on GME is full retard.

Just buy shares for the same amount of money and hold. There‚Äôs a realistic return on investment with it and no one but you will make money from it.

This isn't a shot saying ur a paper handed bitch for not yoloing ur entire life.  If all ur gonna do is stress and bite your nails the entire time. Don't put in that much money. Just looking out for your baby apes is all.

I monitor through the day on investing.com usually and even their chat is getting bombarded. What I find hilarious is it seems like we've shaken off so many paper hands, that it's almost boring at this point. People are starting to just ignore them. Which is good because there's reason to believe they get paid bonuses if we interact with them, so over there, we've taken to mostly not replying or voting on shill/bot comments

>DFV IS STILL HOLDING. If he's still in it, we're still in it. Look to his tweets.

I'm a dumb ape but I figure that while he will hold, he wouldn't sell anyways because of all the legal proceedings. My feeling is he would wait until he feels legally in the clear."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,GME has helped me to stop masturbating. I'm using my death grip to hodl the stock instead of my tiny cock.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"We won this month. We won last week. We won this week. We won today. Don‚Äôt let negative media mess with you. Stay positive!

Their only method to stop us was by ‚Äúcrushing people‚Äôs hopes‚Äù when we set price targets on specific dates. They hope negative media can scare us away when they manipulate the price target under our ‚Äúgoal‚Äù.

I‚Äôm glad March 19 is over... 

No more setting specific price targets on specific dates.

AMC is naturally growing regardless üìà

üö® Here‚Äôs why I think we won today:

‚úÖ We still closed over $13.50 (21.5 million shorts must be bought back which isn‚Äôt even far from the 25 million we could have received if we closed over $14)

‚úÖ They wasted millions of bullets for a cute little dip (Short shares available went from 4.8 million to 600k + the true borrow rate fee has grown behind the scenes)

‚úÖ Today they exposed themselves to major manipulation

‚úÖ People are reporting them to the SEC to raise awareness of their illegal actions today

‚úÖ The shorting today will backfire in the future

‚úÖ The results of the quadruple witching effect actually kicks in starting next week

‚úÖ Our community is very quick to call out the hedge fund‚Äôs tricks. Today the fear some people felt when we closed below $14 was unnecessary and exaggerated. However, posts like this one here are all over the internet by now so that ‚Äúfear‚Äù is already fading away.

This is just the beginning... üòâ

The only way they can stop this is by shutting off internet access across the entire world which isn‚Äôt ever happening.

Don‚Äôt forget GME took 5 months to go from $5 to $482...

AMC is following a similar path (But don‚Äôt worry, it won‚Äôt take 5 months in this case since AMC has been mainstream since January)

Buy and hodl üíé"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just to be clear I‚Äôm actually retarded. I just learned most of the common trading terms this month. I don‚Äôt understand how the stock market works. That being said, I like AMC for 3 reasons.

1. I believe it‚Äôs undervalued. Between the shorts and the pandemic the stock is unusually low.

2. The removal of antitrust laws can bring in more money to theaters. 

3. The company already figured out a financial plan to stay solvent this year. I‚Äôm not worried about bankruptcy before they have a chance to recover."

Monday it will be in the registry.  From what I can understand there will be daily reporting of their activity and positions instead of monthly.  Failure to report appears to be a slap on the wrist of $300.  I don't know how many accounts they have or if that's 300 per account.  90 days from Monday this seems to be a possibility."

I believe it's always good to consider other arguments   to your own as maybe I have missed something important. Problem is, it's  really, really hard to filter the 'real' dd's that are actually credible  through all the conspiracy and speculation nonsense. I'm sure there are must be some higher quality dd's on GME out there with sound evidence and logic - even if they are only moderately bullish that will d.  **If some  of you guys could point me to where I  could find what you consider the  most credible, solid and convincing  dd's here or on WSB it would be  greatly appreciated?!**

Wasnt quite old enough to make it through 2007 with many worries but this woman and countless others have been through it to spread the word and to help prevent us and our children from letting these assholes to continue their fuckery!! We hold for r/clean_chick and her children, all of our other predecessors that have lived it and all of our children so they don't have to!! LFG!!"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats of being sober for 8 years. You are a strong women who inspire other to be better. Thank you for the good example
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I was stupid and in my early 20's with no knowledge of homeownership when I got mine in 2007 and lost it a year later due to foreclosure. I remember having to drop out of college to work two jobs and sometimes not have enough to pay the utilities. I remember taking showers at work because my water got cut off. I too am also here to learn and invest in my future and my pets future. (No kids in my future plans)

First time, I bought just one GME share, I panicked and sold at a 30% loss

Second time, again just bouhght one GME share, I panicked and sold at a smaller loss

Third time, I dumped 40% of my savings on 19 shares and now I just ride the waves with little stress."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The DTCC ruling is the ignition that we need
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Those are my thoughts as well
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or they are just manipulating both media and market so people continue to play options in hopes of making it rich? Is the only way for us to beat the hedge funds to buy and hold shares only? I mean even I'm in despite calling out people for getting in at 188 two days ago(mainly because market usually dips early on and they could've got like 4 more shares). One share at $190, which I intend to hold until it meets my limit price. (In other words a $190 lotto ticket with a high chance of 50-100% returns, a 90% loss, or a ticket sending me to the moon).

Also get off of 'free' stock apps like RH. Your watchlists, buys, sells are all information hedge funds use AGAINST retail investors. Go to an actual broker that won't sell out your information because they view you as customers and not a product(at least in relative terms)."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"They're going to make a movie of it, when the plot is figured out. Some possible titles: ""Crowd Stupidity"", ""Congo"". With people encouraging each other to hold and never sell, there's a lot of unrealized gains, but eventually WSB is going to make a lot of people experience a lot of pain, and there are a lot of ruined lives still to come. I don't know yet if the main plot is that a lot of people deciding to do something retarded, if there are enough of them escaping the zoo, are able to control the narrative. Or, if it's that you can't prop up a bad company forever.

GME had a process in place to issue shares to strategically raise cash, so I no longer think they'll go bankrupt. They could create even a dubious online games distribution service and WSB would encourage each other to support them, even if it means buying worse games just to protect your investment. Either way, there are people who are able to extract cash from our willingness to hold ""at all cost"", and people will be extracting cash from this situation for as long as it goes on. WSB may be able to keep GME up if they're willing to keep paying. For certain, we're funding some pretty big bonuses for GME execs whether they become profitable or not."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm patient. Tendies @ reduced tax rate spend even better.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Im making it a goal to buy at least 1-2 shares a week. Nothing too  crazy thats gonna leave me potentially homeless.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Amen
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I have about $1000 on GME and and $500 on AMC. My plan for the squeez is to hold till one share will cover each respective investment in full. Then play with house money till we are on the downside of the peak so no ape is left behind.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,FOMO is real
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I started with the ""what the fuck did I just do"" level of YOLO for me.

I'm holding 100 shares and ~20k would be nice, but I need another comma minimum."

How do you think it's holding $200 for 2 weeks with no volume?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol. Sir, I'm simply buying and holding. This is not financial advice, as stated at the start of this post. You eat some stale crayons?"

Now why the fuck isn't it tanking with so many people betting against it?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Why
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Nobody ever said anything about the 19th other than it being quad witching. Your posts get dumber each time!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You sound like a sour puss. Did you forget gamestop is still at 200 fucking dollars? If there's so much money to be made shorting, then why the fuck isn't the price going down, but up?

You need to pull your head out of your ass, because until then you don't even have the wherewithal to shit on anything, bitch."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"As far as I understand, GME is sitting on shares that they can release into the market. Why haven't they yet? Maybe they don't want to for cheap. 

Just an idea. My guess is they'll sell the shares once the price raises higher so that they can raise capital."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Um, maybe because there's a fucking hearing going on, and he's trying to do keep his exposure limited.

Why don't you take your shitty opinion and shove it back up your ass.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Now just imagine if they called back the shares (its actually pretty likely they do if they're restructuring their board)
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,And the DTCC rule was more than likely conceived of because the DTCC knew there was a major problem coming and they needed a way to keep themselves from becoming the bag holders when the hedgies are bankrupt.

Also valuing stock is more than trends. Movies are going through some major changes and I‚Äôm watching AMC change with it. Again the antitrust laws changing bring the possibility of mergers and more cost effective movies."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean usually that‚Äôs very true. Yet this is significantly harder when your business was forced to shut down for a long period of time. Just being near other people who own businesses staying solvent really seems to be the goal.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It wouldn't wipe out retail investing. The tax could be as low as one penny. The purpose is to make high frequency trading less viable.

I‚Äôm long on GME but I think you‚Äôre the one who should pull their head out of their ass. Your response to someone telling you the actual truth of what‚Äôs happened shows your maturity level. 

Hedge funds have made a shit load of money shorting this stock throughout this process. These funds have more money than all of us combined multiple times over. They have the power to move the market. We are a drop in the bucket."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs not going up moron. It‚Äôs down 80 bucks this week. What world do you live in?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, but you said he is still holding as if you were certain of it, and said check twitter as your proof. Unless meme posts about cats is somehow a coded message, you don't know his position.

As for youtube, his last post was a short video for St. Patricks Day. No information was put in the video other than him drinking and saying have a happy holiday. the one before that is a meme posting of the interview. Again no information about his personal position.

So instead of being an ass, how about you stop trying to make a buck off his shoulders and fuck right off with your ""DFV IS STILL IN SO YOU SHOULD BE"" so that you can blame him when he sells or if people lose out money. Take your own damn position and own it."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Every retard and/or kid with a smartphone being able to trade fucking options is relatively new. I cannot stress enough how dangerous this is. That was the whole point of this sub lmao.
However, every person should be responsible enough to actually *know* what they're getting themselves into. That's generally speaking, not *just* in trading options. We all know goddamn well that that's *never* been the fucking case, What. So. Ever. 

I'm gonna be completely blunt here so make what you will of it -as a retail trader that trades his own money, I feel personally threatened by the sheer amount of stupidity influx to market trading. Coming into the market, day in day out, you *know* the spread is top game and that the brokers are those who profit off everything, whether it's winning or losing you go through them. They know this shit inside out and in fact everyone who trades, imho, should have spent at least a couple of years working there. So yes, options are a way to hedge larger positions. They're risk management you need to do if you manage a lot of OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY. That's what HeDGiEs do also. But a broker can do this to further profit off the outcome of the market on top of what they make already. They kinda really want/need you to lose too. And they SEE your bets and your assets. Even if they didn't, they could swing by here and see all your positions, apparently. They can literally choose if they want to remain delta or you're just an idiot and you're gonna lose so they won't have to buy anything. Go ahead, buy more way otm calls. They love that shit. Trading options with no intention of ever exercising them is a way to make a quick buck but also stupid and dangerous. Not saying it shouldn't be done. Just need to know what in the fuck you're doing. You can trade options from a mobile app, but you need to understand how options work. You need to understand your OS of choice, you need to understand how that particular app works. You have to *think* about that shit not just blindly deciding something means what you want it to mean.

For you see, to really understand the market you'd have to have been on every side of it. Managing large portfolios, knowing what ""risk"" actually means for banks, hedgefunds, everyone. Retail trading should kinda come last lol. When you've been *inside* the machine you know exactly how it operates looking from the outside. That's also computer network hacking 101 right there for ya."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would advise you to take a look at [/u/Verb0182's comment history](https://www.reddit.com/user/Verb0182). 

Whether you like it or not, she clearly knows what she is talking about. I spent most of last night/this morning  going through her comments (that's how I found this comment thread) because ""It's only a 2 month account, that isn't spouting confirmation bias! Must be a hedgie!""

Needless to say, she is very well versed in investing, can/has explained many of these misconceptions about a million times, and clearly wants to help educate people/set the record straight because she keeps commenting/posting (A LOT... She probably has more comments in her history than me, and my account is 9 years old).

As for her response to this post, I think she's frustrated from correcting the same misinformation over and over and over and over and.....

Feel free to downvote me, too, if you think that I'm a shill, but as you can see from my comment history, I have been parroting a lot of the misinformation, as well. We all need to be better at confirming/researching things, before we repeat them.

All that being said...

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because a guy going by the moniker roaring kitty, and has latched on to the ""I am not a cat"" meme has cats in his video, it is somehow a suggestion that he holds his position? 

So first, check twitter. Twitter had nothing. The check youtube, it also had nothing. Why can't you just admit you have no idea what his position is, and you just like using the perception that he is still in because it bolsters your position? You mean nothing to anyone, so you point to DFV and suggest he be followed. When challenged you call people names and suggest they are shills or stupid.

Youre just too fucking retarded and keep writing these novellas displaying that further.

You're just an angry shill.

Is DFV being in it a reason to hold in and of itself? Nope. Never said that.

Still laughing at the fact that you're clueless.

I'll be waiting for your next novella, grandpa."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm not calling you a liar. I was seriously asking where you were seeing it. Can you post a screen shot showing buying?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's really pathetic. Their whole approach is predicated on the expectation that you will be mortified by being challenged, and receiving ad hominem attacks.

Really tells you a lot about who these shills are: empty suits that fold for whoever is loudest and/or sounds most confident.

Fuck critical thinking and persuasive writing, amirite?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Another zero experience hype man repeating what he heard somewhere else
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay bud. When they tank the price 180 dollars in less than 20 minutes, who do you think is making money off of that play?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, I'm the shill. Yet you are the one who changed your wording on the post. You know you were wrong. Just own your mistakes man.

> DFV IS LIKELY STILL HOLDING.


Btw, I never shilled a position. I didn't say not to buy, hold, or interact with GME. I didn't say anything else you posted was wrong. I merely pointed out you were riding the DFV still holding comment to remove the focus from you suggesting things are rosy with GME and instead use the clout of DFV to bolster your position. Maybe take 2 seconds next time and put on your big boy pants before throwing your feces because you don't understand anything not  posted in ELI5 format with small words and many pictures."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I just edited the post. No worries. You can go and look now.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I'm a shill. Maybe you should go to r/conspiracy with all your worries and theories."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"1) You're cornered, and you're flailing. You're either a shill, or a loudmouth hater. Maybe both. But you're certainly not in a position to question anyone providing data that can be challenged. 

All you're offering is opinion.

2) That's a completely different question. 

If I buy at 200 and sell at 250, but I owed 1000, how much money have I made?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did what you suggested and looked through your comments.

Constantly defending against being called a bot.

I changed the text to prevent any more fucks like yourself from coming out of the woodwork.

Not my fault you can't put 2 and 2 together.

Again, just an angry shill."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actually, no

You know what, fuckwit? I'm going to spell it out for you.

Here are three reasons why you're a fucking imbecile for suggesting that DFV sold while you're hiding behind your monitor making absolutely no valid arguments. Just as bad as a fucking flat Easter. Demands proof for the glove, but offers none himself for his own point.

1. There's a congressional hearing related to Gamestop. Did you watch the fucking hearing? Do you know the details of the hearing? He's A PART OF THE FUCKING HEARING. He stopped doing his updates on March 8th, that's the ONLY fucking thing you're getting credit for, shit for brains. Go back to that post and use your ""big boy"" brain. BASED ON CONTEXT HE NEVER SAID THAT WOULD BE THE LAST UPDATE YOU FUCKWIT.


2. His Tweets are relevant. I gave you three attempts to use that fucking ""big boy"" brain of yours, but you stuck out my ignorant little fuckboy. I guess you went to his Twitter page, saw a cat video, and declared victory. This is why you'll always be considered a shill  in my eyes. If you would just use that oversized thumb of yours and scroll down, you can see tweets that a 4year old would understand. I'm not going any further than that, as you don't deserve my time to begin with, and are probably just a piece of shit trying to extract info.

3. His YouTube video, which he also Tweeted a clip from, also has reason to believe that he's holding WITHOUT SAYING A FUCKING WORD. This protects himself, and keeps pieces of shit like you who can't understand how a lightswitch works running on a hamster-wheel of redundancy.

He hasn't directly came out and stated his position, be cause he doesn't fucking need to dumbass. You seem to be the only dumbfuck who even brought this up, because you're too busy working on your e-thug skills to see a snake 1inch from your asshole.

Keep pretending like you've done anything other than show how mundane someone can be in the face of retardation."

Was thinking the other days, which is something I rarely do, that the subreddit at this stage needs a wallstreetbets hall of heroes. To be an inductee the particular individual would need to have made either the dankest trade or the most guh trade. It could be in the form of a post or other form of medium (maybe images or emojis for the illiterate) and it would explain the story and the reasons why the individual is being inducted. We already have some users worthy of an induction into the mighty halls of glory, the question is who is going to be responsible for the selection process or is there going to be some form of voting in regards to selection.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôd shave 75% and ride the rest. Market is getting cooked could be another week of red. Always better to secure profits. 

Edit: root is a 3B company, not sure what the open interest is on root, but you need to be careful of raping the IV yourself by selling too many at once especially in red days when option buying volume is low, could see this go to -30% very fast especially bc you only hold 1 call option. I would sell 10-20% a day next week until you sell 75% of those call options, if the market bounces back solid on 1 of those days I would look to dump a large majority. Secure your bottom but leave yourself plenty of room for tendies. I mean holding 5k+ in 1 option is still a solid yolo. Shares are fine to hold"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Reason ROOT was my best candidate is the heavy shorts, and way below IPO price. No brained for me at the 11 range. I could have had a better entry, and i could have had a worse one in the last 3 days..."

They are sitting on the other side having bought 100 shares of GME and making $200 per week selling these crazy 800 calls that will never hit."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I wonder if he was actually hoping for GME to hit 800 ü§î
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You can sell him the options if you want.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It is the way if you were the one who sold that 800c to OP!

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah so what do you guys think about my AMD calls and MARA.......thinking maybe to average down on Monday .
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That's hot.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm rather shy and taking baby steps since using real money. But 0.5% a week so far.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice roller coaster ride you had there, all it takes is one 10 bagger"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Mara at 70? You belong here.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Very nice
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like how as the portfolio drops, you‚Äôd expect the loss curve to shallow out.  Because it‚Äôs measuring in dollars and ‚ÄúI lost 5% of my $1000‚Äù isn‚Äôt as much as ‚ÄúI lost 5% of my $5000‚Äù.  But it doesn‚Äôt.  The loss curve keeps getting steeper you beautiful ape."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre pretty good at losing money. You should go pro.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,All good thats how my robinhood portfolio looks like. I decided to delete it.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you tried not being retarded
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,All I have to say is. You will make your money back if you switch to DD.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You'll be alright. Decending wedges are bullish.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, it‚Äôs ‚Äúloss porn‚Äù. Unless you‚Äôre some pervert and feds raided your hard drive."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,No...I just discovered Robinhood then lol oh and very new to options ..
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but it seems like a slow income to sell them ....
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It's.. spikey. At least I can see WHY your wife has a boyfriend now.

If not, sign up for a paper account (practice) at TD and try out out"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol she has a BF because I only pay attention to the stock market and not her ..
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol bro anytime I looked at AMD it was at 90 or somewhere around ..so when it dropped my first thought was its going back up to 90 ....and without thinking I started loading up on calls ....then I realized that the 10 year yield was important for tech stocks .
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,How much can you make a week if your good at it?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh, and I'll never ever short naked calls.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You know things are really screwed up when you see ""this lawsuit could be good for us""."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I almost bought this stock back in December then decided to go with other ev companies as well as lithium mining companies. Lucky dodge...
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Glad I dodged that bullet. Now I can go back to bleeding on AMD.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've compiled a list of companies to watch for put action. All are either being sued, or were exposed in the last couple of weeks as frauds. All were green today."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Nikola is in serious trouble lol.  I'll not sure they can even finish building their factory if they don't raise that additional 100m offering.  Putting even more pressure on the stock.  If they lose the AB contract its game over.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The USPS contract isn‚Äôt the only think workhorse had going for it. Other companies have orders their trucks and just think of how the shift in the future is not only EVs, but also buying online. Which means more and more deliveries. It‚Äôs at an attractive price right now especially considering how overpriced most EVs are.

Not to mention, ARK is very bullish."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Opportunistic law firms open cases against listed companies all the time. I doubt it will make a material difference to the share price. Seriously, google: class action lawsuit [stock ticker], and there will probably have been some frivolous law suit announced in the last couple of years by a shady law firm regarding false or misleading statements."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Hmmm posted on wsb by bot account I'm thinking fd's Monday morning
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Workhorse and lordstown are scams. Which is a shame as they had good designs
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,All these dot coms finally going down.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Ban
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,My Workhorse puts are going to brrrrrr
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know it‚Äôs the future but I don‚Äôt like EV. A workhorse built chasis with an 8.2l GM gasoline engine is the shit! Can‚Äôt speak on their EV ideas but I‚Äôve driven quite a few different gas and diesel trucks, Workhorse, by a mile, is the best built."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"headed back to $4.

dang."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Invest in nikola. All those ev spacs will soon go bankrupt anyway :)
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,As someone who bought $15p 4/9 this is good for me.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't know what a put is?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, profitable last quarter with around 20 PE in an industry that will be growing? I've sold some puts I'm about to be assigned on with a small loss, might be worth buying more stock now and starting the wheel early"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It outsources all its parts it can‚Äôt even get one truck going what world do you live in
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Buying on a dip might not be a bad idea.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agree, sucks though"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Workhorse is currently building 3 trucks a week.  Lordstown, we'll have to see how this plays out.  They do have several prototype trucks, and I think they're building more.

My opinion on why the USPS chose Oshkosh over Workhorse was the Postmaster General being a Trump appointee, was trying to thumb his nose at Biden, and using the excuse that Congress hadn't given them enough money.

He would only had 10% of the fleet electrified, instead of 100% like Biden wanted."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn you old
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You should‚Äôve got them last month lmao
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It will eventually be the future but ev still has a lot of catching up to do.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,U can buy ev or any other vehicle with RKT auto!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,">Invest in nikola

Only recommended if you live downhill from the post office."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I assume your a $90 bag holder?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Its a bet that the share price will drop.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"History repeats, bruh. Dot com had plenty of popping up stocks just to go bankrupt in everyone's face. These EVs are no different, just a different asset."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I did lol.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The whole economy makes 0 sense right now we should be inflated to hell and back already. The dollar isn‚Äôt worth shit if every bum gets handed $10 grand printed from nothing. So I don‚Äôt know what to make of any of it.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,And you held through that crash? Can I get tree fiddy for the bus? I got a nice behind
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's not how inflation works. Banks for given leverages to give out loans which is probably why interest was so low. Using the deficit to pay everyone was something they were going to do because it was rather lower than if the covid didnt happen. Funds are being redirected from future projects that arent necessary at the time. And bonds are being bought to counter the losses of stimi. All-in-all, the only people affected the worst were the lower working class. Everyone else was doing fine (following the sp500 jumping double rather than the 10% course it was suppose to have). What do I mean by that? Those before the covid that were doing well were playing stock market. After the covid crash they're doing extremely well. All the lower working class not apart of the stock market just lost their jobs. That was it. This was a huge example of the rich getting richer and the poor getting worse. The thing is, rich people need poor people to get richer. So you give them a stimi to spend it. The money goes right back into the rich pockets. Everyone is happy."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep. I figured there‚Äôd be some further politicking, and bullshit after. Workhorse will try to cling to life one more time. There‚Äôs no way this doesn‚Äôt go to OSK."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You need to get acquainted with the creature of Jekyll island mate. You don‚Äôt get it their fractional reserve lending massive national debt and printing money from nowhere meanwhile having 0 productivity put back into the economy SHOULD make a dollar worth a cent.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ha I did the opposite I got 3/26 calls at the dip and it spiked to $18
It‚Äôs just not practical to give it to a shit outsourcing company making one truck a week plus Ford does all the lobbying in dc."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Give a man a fish, he eats for a day. Teach the men how to fish, the Fishermen are out of the profession. Instead of teaching everyone to fish, the government is feeding fish to those that cant fish. The fishermen are complaining because they're giving fish for free when they had to work hard to be well off. The fisherman dont see the big picture. You feed the less fortunate so they can buy fish in the future from the fisherman."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep. And OSK is a gigantic employer in Wisconsin which is also an incredibly important swing state that dems won.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah wink wink the dems ‚Äúwon‚Äù
2021-03-20 04:59:13,wallstreetbets,AAPL earnings play-calls June 18 125c. Sitting at a loss of -16% now. Should I wait it out? 
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh man, you're real fucked if you're asking us for advice."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,üìÑ üôåüèª üí© HODL you still got ‚è∞
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think we're at bottom man, I'm holding 123.75c 4/16 thats down like 60% so im hoping things turn around at least."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"They apparently have a product release coming up in March or April.

This will give the shares a boost.

This stock won‚Äôt stay below 125 for long."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You realize you‚Äôre asking ppl if you should hold a top 5 company in the world with one of the best track records in history. A company so embedded in our current society that you could show someone the font Apple uses and they‚Äôd know where it‚Äôs from. You‚Äôre asking if you should hold on to that...
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The moment you sell for a loss the stock will skyrocket upwards. This is the way.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You still got time hold and forget for now
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shit I wanna know too, Tim Apple doing me wrong this year"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hello, I have 140 call expiring in July I'm down quite a bit but I am still holding. The shift is slowly changing Tech will take over soon. Cyclical stocks had their fill already and its time to shift again. As you can see banks is done for the run. (Just be aware of the yields though). Do your best!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Stocks go up
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The chances of AAPL not going above at least 130 between now and June are exactly zero.

Even just thinking about getting out of the trade with a loss at 120 after a month where the stock went from 128 to 118 to 127 to 120...

Not to mention they have a rumored event coming up next week or the week after with new products.

Just how much thought have you actually put in these 100k worth of calls?
Cause it sounds like that answer would also be zero. :P"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This isn't even a bad play. Just sell out prior to earnings. rise in IV will probably save you.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey. Wait it out. I‚Äôm an Apple shareholder at avg cost of $139. I even forgot all about Apple, because it‚Äôs a solid company and mainstream  consumer base will purchase anything Apple make. Wait it out."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"All you ever get here is ""HODL THA LEIN"" and ape emojis. Personally I have a Samsung phone and a Windows computer."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,No.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre an investor so you should know that apple has there event coming up in March. Which is a big catalyst. I have positions as well July 150c
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I was the seller of your calls!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell everything and use it to buy RKT
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"We‚Äôre on the brink of a bubble. The biggest bubble in US history... by far. The smart money is pulling out and shifting portfolios.

Tech is not where I would want to be right now. In a year or more though...

Or maybe nothing happens and we just continue growing forever. That‚Äôs probably what‚Äôll happen"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,the only thing that will move this stock pre earnings announcement is interest rates -- you're essentially betting on the direction like a true ape not knowing you are.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Always hodl apple. Apes love apples.  *this is not trading advice*
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Never play earnings, I repeat never play earnings. Your better off buying weeklies on a meme stock"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just bought 2 MacBook Airs, one for me and one for my wife.  So far we both really like them.  This is my first Mac in 10 years."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you should sell this, then buy a call well within the money a year out and play poor man's cover calls to recover your losses. Apple will grow but at an incredibly slow rate."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Keep at it bro words of a true retard
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Long term hold. I would suggest.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Red is the way
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,June is a way away. You could roll them into next year and probably salvage that loss
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs at 2T market value. Seems like a bubble but I just brought 38 share before closing. It‚Äôs been in on a  decline for few months which should make the pendulum swing on the other side in coming months
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,How can you call this an earnings play If you are thinking of selling more than 1 month before earnings?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This just feels like buying the dip for me bro, I bought it at $113 a few months ago, nothing to regret, maybe I regret not selling at $140 and rebuying at $120"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,How much did you pay for the contracts?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You still have April earnings. You'll be fine
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Plenty of time. Hold it out.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You should be fine
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Definitely hold that. All it takes is one or two solid days to be in the green
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Just hold retard ü§°
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy shit lol
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah comrade, hope we pass $125 by Apr 1st week!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn‚Äôt worry if it was shares, I am new to options and considered AAPL to be a safe play, it dropped 4% in two days and options lost 16%. So gauging what others think"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, then he needs to sell and take one for the team. My 600 shares have been bleeding for 2 months."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Alright then selling 50% for loss will fire up the other 50% ? üí°üí°üí°üí°
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Post before you sell, I‚Äôll buy calls 3 minutes before."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs exactly how I would play this hand
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I cannot comprehend apple being less than $198 eoy but that‚Äôs a loooinnnggg time away
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The price was totally being manipulated to keep it below $120 never tot even AAPL could be manipulated. 170 Million shares traded today compared to avg volume of 110 M yet price dropped 50 cents lol
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hah I didn‚Äôt randomly buy it though

I timed it based on the rumored event for next week and the earnings for next month. Plus it was at $124.76 the day before so the dip to $122 looked attractive. I do strongly believe it will go up to $130!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,How can you not give ur money to Apple? I have an iPad dont know why I bought it
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Same here. It seems like Google is king.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve had the same iPad since.... Jesus long enough I‚Äôve passed it to my kids, they‚Äôll probably break it tomorrow now that I‚Äôve typed this. And then I‚Äôll buy a new one. They fn got me"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same here. I make some Crapple plays here and there for some quick gains, but I don't buy the products. I'll never understand the appeal."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Event is in April.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone didn‚Äôt invest in the future 30 years ago and still thinks they‚Äôre right haha.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"wtf ... we're anticipating fucking nano inflation and the fake news is all like ""omg sector rotation out of tech""  lmaoooooo.  We've been at negative real rates for quite a while!  Tech is definitely not hosed.  As long as they're inventing new things that bring people greater value, the money will be there."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"He is in the right sub, thats for sure"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Play earnings and dump week before I swear earnings cause a dip in like 90% of cases based on my completely unofficial poll that might be fueled by alcohol rn.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Preach. It‚Äôs a roulette table
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Usually they start ramping up during the last week of prior month prior to the earnings month.. so i tot I am getting in cheap lol .. it was at $125 a day before I bought tot too good a dip to pass when it dropped to $122 ... so now am worried it will have more downside before ramping up
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol so you‚Äôre new to options and put 100k on one play?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You still have a lot of time before expiration, I would hold."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Realistically, you‚Äôll probably hit the 125 within a week or so unless something drastic happens to apple. I‚Äôd hold and use small amounts on options"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Hold
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Madness apple last result where ridiculous since then a 7 dollar drop makes 0 sense
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh it's easy. When they required iTunes on literally everything if you wanted to access so much as the pictures on your iPhone from your computer, I knew it was time for me to bounce. Got out of there quicker than M.C. Hammers money."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure it‚Äôs like Mar 23?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,If they can just till after April monthlies expire that would be great.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol I‚Äôm barely 30. And I‚Äôm still investing. Just not in tech at the moment. Everything is insanely overvalued
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Long term? I certainly think so. But that doesn‚Äôt keep them from being overvalued currently. IMO
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, Nothing to see here...

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That hasn‚Äôt been the case for like 5 years
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, sometime in April this year."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ditto. I wish my grandparents bought apple stock instead those stupid ass bonds that burnt up in my childhood house fire the day after Christmas...... I wish I was kidding.  NEVER PLAY WITH MATCHES.  
If everything is overvalued I wouldn‚Äôt point fingers at a certain sector though."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs not over valued haven‚Äôt you heard we just make more money problem of over value solved
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Graphs like this are part of the wall street news cycle meant to generate volatility and liquidity.  Taken alone, it might seem to paint a grim picture, but there's so much that it doesn't show that would need to be seen to make sense of it.

2021-03-20 04:31:29,wallstreetbets,"UWMC Russell Inclusion --------------------

EDIT:  This is moot now since it didn't get included, but u/thefinnishsisu reached out to me and pointed out that Russell indexes are actually float-adjusted market cap weighted, meaning that for the purposes of the index, they will be treated as a $100M market cap company if they ever get included.

https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMCShareholders/comments/m9kp1n/some_more_dd_about_the_russell_inclusion_since/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

---------------------

Ok so I have a decent position in UWMC, picture in another post.  I was curious to try to predict exactly what Russell 1000 and 3000 inclusion would do.

For those who don't know, these are both market-cap weighted funds.  The Russell 3000 is the 3000 biggest companies in the US, which makes them about 98% of the US stock market by market cap.  The Russell 1000 is the biggest 1000 of the Russell 3000, which makes them about 90% of the stock market.

Since the whole US stock market is a bit above $50T, that makes the Russell 3000 about $50T and the Russell 1000 about $45T.  They are honestly not that different, the Russell 3000 just contains an extra 2000 companies which barely move the needle, because it's market-cap weighted (not equal-weight)

Ok so once I figured that out, my next question was, exactly how many funds track these indexes?  The answer was disappointing.  There are two main ETFs for each (iShares and Vanguard).   And then there are a bunch of little mutual funds.  I couldn't get a complete list but I doubt that all of this combined adds up to much more than $50B in assets (comparitively, SPY is just one ETF and it has $330B in net assets, and that doesn't count all the mutual funds that track the S&P 500)

So as a really rough estimate, 0.11% of a Russell 1000 company's market cap will be in these funds.  (maybe a little more, like 0.12% or 0.13%)

The one thing that UWMC had going for it is that it's market cap is large and the float is small -- only 6% of the market cap.  So that means that in order to buy 0.11% of the market cap, they have to buy about 1.83% of the float.  Let's round up to 2% because I didn't look at all the mutual funds.  I could not really find a good source of data here.

Conclusion:  ETFs and mutual funds need to buy about 2% of UWMC's float.  That's about 2 million shares.  Average daily volume is about 10M shares.  There might be a small boost but this is not a massive squeeze or anything.

S&P 500 would be a much bigger deal but they have requirements on the float for precisely this reason.  UWMC will never be in the S&P until they release more shares into the float."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hi. So I‚Äôm not arguing that inclusion will make a HUGE difference but you‚Äôre a little off on your calcs. 

That‚Äôs because in addition to ‚ÄúRussell 1000‚Äù ETFs there are also ‚ÄúRussell 1000 Value‚Äù and ‚ÄúRussell 1000 Growth‚Äù ETFs, which are actually more popular and have more assets. 
Safe to assume that UWMC will be in R1000 Value. The iShares ETF (IWD) has $50B in AUM. Vanguard,s is much smaller ($5B) 
So iShares R1000 (IWB) has $26B its R1000 Value has $50B, Vanguard‚Äôs R1000 (VONE) has $5B and its R1000 Value (VONV) has $5B.

There are other funds and ETFs that track the Russell 1000 as well. Question is how big UWMC would be in it and I don‚Äôt know the calcs."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Wtf it didn‚Äôt make Russell March22 list.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"UWMC got a little shaken up by the rate increases this week. Next week when the inclusion is official, and the rates calm a bit. This will pop. Most likely Tuesday or Wednesday. Don't forget housing data comes out next week."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I am 100% certain that this stock might be a good investment.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Uwmc is not being added to the Russell indexes. The ceo owns 94% of the stock. So unfortunately will not be getting added
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The inclusion will be a temporary boost, the news will help next week, the boost from shares being bought by the index won‚Äôt be until late June, as said (but again an index inclusion doesn‚Äôt make the company more valuable). I think this stock is going to have an upward trajectory for months but don‚Äôt expect it to just launch (it might happen but don‚Äôt expect it). It will stair step up over time, probably with some blips on the way. I think we will be stable at 13-14 over a few months and future news will support higher price targets. (Not investment advice, just speculation)"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I have $10 calls
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't forget that some funds are pre-buying it rather than being reactive.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for post

I'm still nervous about my $11 april 16th strike options (naked calls this play I was sure of it)

I firmly believe it will be above $11 at some point this year, easily, I just don't know when. Ive made some money selling $15 CCs. 

April 1st price prediction OP?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I really want these stocks to pop and thought it would the past two days with great premarket and then market open crash.  I think the shares for the Russel Index may of been bought during this time in after / premarket.

It's a good company and I'm in it for the long haul.  I have dreams of a squeeze and cashing out a million dollar profit in a week but it's not very realistic.  Hope I'm wrong!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,No clue.  I am short April $9 puts; happy to buy more at that price.  On Monday I will be the proud owner of 10k more share since I was also short March $9 puts and they (just barely) are ITM.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Try to think longer term.  I believe that this stock is undervalued and will eventually go up to its fair valuation.  If it takes a year, that's fine."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"So it‚Äôs an actual index maintained by Russell. What most people don‚Äôt realize Is the Growth and Value indices aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive. A ton of companies are in both, the weightings are just different. (Ie MSFT is 9.5% of R1000 growth and might be like... .4% of value) https://research.ftserussell.com/products/downloads/Russell-US-indexes.pdf?_ga=2.254655880.1854386095.1616204085-2116325175.1616204085

I‚Äôm 90% sure that a company added to R1000 after an IPO is also added to the growth and/or value index at the same time but I‚Äôm not positive and I skimmed that long document and couldn‚Äôt find that specific into."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Source? I was on Russell's site yesterday. They were listed on there.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The whole reason it's not included is BECAUSE it is currently a meme stock. It's a great company and has a bright future and will be included eventually.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Does loaning out shares preclude you from selling covered calls?  There's something that feels odd about loaning out shares to help somebody drive down the value of your shares.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did they actually give a reason?  Did it have anything to do with the liquidity?  They really have a very small float compared to their outstanding shares.

The shares are already outstanding so putting more into the float is not dilutive.

I do not consider this a meme stock.  They have a very strong balance sheet, they make tons of cash, and they pay a dividend.  This is a boomer stock if there ever was one."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can't sell covered calls but I can sell naked ones.  If I end up short I can cover with the loaned shares.

It's only different from a margin standpoint.  From a risk standpoint it's the same.

Shorts don't really drive the price down.  There might be a momentary impact but share price is driven by the market's perception of valuation.  The price should always return there.  Also it's free money for me."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,We‚Äôll know Monday I think??

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It's not a meme I guess but it's on WSB's top ten most discussed. They will keep it down until we forget about it.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depending on your risk profile the return on covered calls is usually a fair chunk higher than 1.75%.  It also appeals to me from the perspective of selling it to someone who wants the underlying to appreciate  even more than I do.  Yes it caps the maximum possible gain, but it's also a steady return.  The stocks I'm doing this to also pull a nice dividend."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I got 100 shares and one leap at least I got em at 7.60
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Wth happened
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"But like I said I can sell the calls anyway.  If I get assigned it will take my loaned shares.

I'm free to sell the shares whenever I want.  They will be recalled to settle the trade.

It's just that for Reg T and exchange margin purposes I don't have them.  For house margin requirements it's as if I have them."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Welcome to 8am this morning.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,#HAHAHAHA THIRTEEN YEARS TOO LATE BUT FUCK BIG BANKS
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"For reference, the SLR rule was in place before the pandemic started. During the pandemic, the when the did the *SLR exemption was in place*, what happened?

1) All of us on RH started massively investing in the market & trading with options (large amount of margin debt in the market)

2) Bond yields (interest rates) significantly dropped

3) The USD has been consistently tanking

If we try to inverse these, the picture going forward isn't as clear. However, it should be noted that **primary dealers are sitting on a huge stock pile of bonds right now and they haven't been selling bonds,** unlike what MSM has been saying. In fact, they've been buying up more and more bonds during 2020. [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/counterparties/primary-dealers-statistics](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/counterparties/primary-dealers-statistics)

Now, ask yourself, why would your drub dealer be loading up on supply if word on the street is that everyone and their mother are building drubs now? Maybe they're trying to hoard supply while it's cheap? Seems odd that they've been consistently buying up supply when everyone is saying bonds are super shit (aside from the QE supply).

We don't know exactly how the SLR rule applies to banks' internal plumbing, but... Let's say the primary dealers have a few wrinkles and somehow know that banks **have to** buy up a bunch of treasuries **once the SLR rule is re-implemented**? What's the easiest way to get supply for cheap? Lots of FUD about the SLR rule, plus people fucking hate bonds. Maybe we'll through some hyper-inflation scares in there and BAM bond prices tank across the board.

Anyhow, I'm retard and just thinking out loud right now, but let's try and inverse what's changed in the last year:

1) ~~Retail traders start stop massively investing in the market~~ (LOL fuck off)

2) Bond yields (interest rates) significantly rise. This would follow the hyper-inflation and V-Shaped recovery, but I don't think this is a likely scenario. Why? *Mortgage applications have significantly declining for the last 2 months slowing.* **<insert Interest Rates are Too Damn High>.** And banks are still not lending with unemployment this high, so I see interest rates falling more. In this case, stonks should keep going up?

3) The USD rallies. This seems likely to me, given how little money is flowing in the economy right now (people sitting on stimmies & throwing money into the market). It also fits into my understanding of how QE works, so this could just be an after-effect of QE. So, if we rally, it would drive yields down and it stonks would likely drop as well. This kind of plays into 2 as well.

TLDR: Always inverse the banks & media."

The fed changing this emergency capital relief is the correct move as we come out of covid.  Large and complex banks are reverting to a less conservative approach as basically they‚Äôre sitting on a ton of cash.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"wouldn‚Äôt it mean tighter capital restrictions, meaning that banks need more cash in their vault, meaning they have less money to loan, meaning there‚Äôs less money going around?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Ramen or Lambos.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's both, but not at the same time!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why not both? We can bull run till august or September then eat a giant dick once everyone realizes the world isn‚Äôt reopening to how it was but to a scorched earth fucking economic apocalypse and once that sets in and the interest rates can‚Äôt go lower we can see a 30% correction.

Or not, who the fuck knows. I‚Äôm retarded."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Basically Fed thinks shit is good and are moving in to control inflation from getting too big as growth accelerates in the near future by limiting lending a bit.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Bruh I did this too when I was a kid. Pierced my ear with a needle. My ears are now professionally pierced but the bump is still there. I‚Äôm actually glad I‚Äôm not the only one with it tbh ...

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,so like every week then
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. It could be seen as anti-flationary. Fed is demanding capital be stored in banks to make money the old fashioned way - lending to boost the economy.


Yields went up today."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"> does this reduce inflation since banks can‚Äôt loan out as much capital?

Yes and no, remember banks lend out your deposits. Fiscal policies are direct injection of capital into the financial system, monetary policies are indirect injection of capital to create liquidity, and we're getting a lot of direct injection in forms of stimulus. 

Basically, Feds do not want to double up unlimited liquidity provided to banks while Congress is directing funds to increase overall money supply as that will lead to hyperinflation in the intermediate terms. Inflation due to stimulus is a given, that will happen. The point being that we don't cause inflation to the point where our money is worthless and where inflation becomes harmful. 

Short terms, it's borderline bearish. Money supply bumps aren't immediate, so banks will likely have to reposition their assets as a result. Which means they could be selling stocks to raise capital, selling bonds to raise cash reserves, etc. Basically continuing the trend we're seeing banks selling stocks and bonds to raise reserves...meaning yields go up, and growth stocks trend down."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Banks now need more liquidity soon and the past year they bought up a metric fuck ton of bonds. Now they can either dump them or slowly dump them. Jpow had to do it slowly so it doesn‚Äôt rocket up the yield. Hedge funds lobbied against for stonks sake. 

Now we wait."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I have no fucking clue lmao
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"In isolation, this move would cause inflation because it floods the market with treasury bonds. The treasury bonds become cheaper (more of them) so the yield increases (cheaper bond, same return = higher yield). Since the opportunity cost of money goes up, interests rates go up. 

However, this isn‚Äôt the only thing that is happening: the fed is buying bonds and is not releasing anymore. That should offset the excess demand (edit: I meant supply). 

Why you here FUD about increasing interest rates is because banks don‚Äôt want to give up their bonds. If they do, they‚Äôll actually have to do their fucking job and lend out money instead of playing the stock market with that cash the bonds free up. So, as retaliation, bond market spikes are occurring to get people on the side of the banks. It‚Äôs just smoke and mirrors. 

Also, the whole inflation thing is more FUD or just wrong (even Michael Burry gets it wrong every now and again). Yes, there is a lot more M2 out there but M2 hasn‚Äôt mattered for 40 years. What matters is money in the pockets of those who actually spend it, the lower and middle class. You could multiply the wealth of the billionaires by 1000X and it wouldn‚Äôt cause inflation except in private islands. 

Unfortunately, the lower and middle class isn‚Äôt any better off. The latest annual inflation was in bottom 30% over the past 80years. The economy isn‚Äôt good and inflation isn‚Äôt going to be a problem anytime soon. 

Finally, the stock market is a massive fucking bubble propped up by banks investing in stocks (instead of doing their fucking job) and retail not having vacations and entertainment to spend money on. When both of those stop, down goes the market.

P.S. GME is a great stock for this scenario. The banks didn‚Äôt touch it from what I can see. Also, the gaming market spiked during covid restrictions (people needed something to do) and it‚Äôs an addictive activity. So, no reason to believe the gamer market is going to go down. Further, there is the console cycle (couldn‚Äôt be better timing) and Ryan Cohen (couldn‚Äôt be better for the face of the company). It is a perfect storm and short it at your peril."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Slows down the economy with the same amount of dollars are out there. I‚Äôm dumb but I think that causes inflation.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've drank ripple, purple crayon flavor"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would argue that yes it does curb inflation. 

Now one could argue that it will slow down lending and also cool down the housing sector as refi/mortgages are not gonna be as easy to get. Puts on RKT and UWMC."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think banks would be forced to buy treasuries to increase holdings, not sell."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty much.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,If the bank needs to hold on to a larger percentage of reserves then interest rates will likely go up because there is less money in circulation to be invested. It‚Äôs bearish news but honestly may not mean shit at all

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is all greek to me but it sounds like this might cause inflation. I think that's part of the plan.

It can also be viewed as hawkish which means that if the Fed ended capital relief, it might also be possible that they raise interest rates sooner than later to combat the expected shitstorm of inflation. That's why bond yields have gone up and will likely continue to go up in the near future.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So you are saying that we could prevent inflation indefinitely by constantly taking everything from the poor and giving it to the rich?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"He wants inflation. He will do everything in his power to cause inflation. Look at the debt we have rung up. Debt is more manageable when inflation is high. He will pop inflation so we pay off all these companies debts, the. He will pop rates to bring down inflation.  He can't bring rates up no or no more america.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The Stonk
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well yes and no. It's a good take on the whole situation but the Treasurey and the Fed are 2 separate entities. Fed is independent of the government to a certain extent while the Treasurey department is part of the executive branch. 

It the government wants to spend money it needs to get a loan, the treasurey department has to borrow money....no surplus money to take it from as we have been running a budget deficit for a long long long time.

The Fed is the bank the basically controls money supply that's how they manage interest rates. 

So when the government needs to borrow money they have to sell bonds through the treasurey department. The Fed can turn the printer on and give/lend them money but that would cause some problems with their ability to manage effectively monetary policies. They try not to do that unless it's part of the monetary policy strategy I.e. quantitative easing.

I get that the treasurey has a reserve of 1tn or so in cash but that reserve is going to have to be maintained so even if they use that as part of the American Rescue plan they would have to go back to the market and get that reserve back to make sure they have enough in case of another emergency.

At the end of the day if the government wants to spend money they need to borrow it from someone. That means they need to sell T-bills to the market. That's why we're seen bond yields go up. 

Fewer people buying the bonds making them drop in price and their interest or coupon increases to attract more buyers. Bonds value is inversely related to their coupon rate. That's what everyone is afraid of right now. So making the bonds less attractive is going to cause a small blip in short run of tbill yields as less people buy and their interest increases. 

Sorry for the long reply."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, the amount or value of currency currently in circulation doesn‚Äôt change base on this decision. The biggest difference is that banks are forced to start shifting back to normal business and lending practices, rather than relying on emergency measures for income. What the hell that means in the long run, who the fuck knows, but this decision won‚Äôt change the value of a dollar. Besides, national debt doesn‚Äôt matter very much in the grand scheme of things, debt doesn‚Äôt function for governments and massive institutions the same way it does for some average person, the news just hammers home the topic of national debt and deficits to sway people one way or another on a given issue."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Big secret is that the government created all the problems in the first place by forcing banks to make poor decisions that they otherwise wouldn't (mortgages and loans to people who can't afford it, etc) and then when the banks need a bailout the government pretends it has the money to prevent a financial disaster and prints enough to cover for their losses. Notice that the money supply is up 50%+ yet inflation is slow to catch up, it's cause the majority of the new money printed is in the hands of the banks and not the consumers, so the slower it makes it's way back to you the slower inflation goes up, therefore it's in the government's interest that the banks get bailouts and not individuals, this ensures the big banks always have a monopoly as a side effect because they cannot fail thanks to free money. Through this ""Quantitative Easing"" they slow the climb to your dollar being worth 50% less so people don't start to realize that when they print money they are just taxing you without asking, and it only negatively affects people who deal in money (middle class) and not the rich because they deal in assets which appreciate over time and with inflation. The Government will never go against these ""evil people"" because they put them there in the first place, some intentionally but most from sheer incompetence with monetary policy, even if they could seize their assets or money the way in which they spend it would create more inequity."

I think the question would be why did they make this change now? One reason could be because they expect GME or other meme stocks to crash the market and the government doesn‚Äôt want to foot the bill when that happens. The cap on GME would be whatever the banks have insured which is something absolutely ridiculous like $62 trillion. Get ready for some crazy shit."

Is there any coincidence that that was in effect before the quad witching day? Exactly. :-)  
  
Major structural changes will be coming to our financial institutions as a direct result of GME. Any moves made right now from a major player in the system are most likely going to be a posturing move in preparation for what they think is coming.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes it does. 
Example: If you buy a bond for 1000 $ and get 100$ annual return, you have a 10% yield.

Now you sell it for 900$, but the annual return stays the same.
100/900 = 0,11 -> 11% yield.

Is that correct?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hmmmm, it depends on what we interpret bubble to mean because my thoughts on a bubble are a lot like your mountain analogy: it‚Äôs disconnected from the economy and an otherwise minor event will cause a much greater correction. 

Currently, the market has seen a massive influx of money from uncommon sources. It is unlikely those sources will continue into the future. The result is a correction. 

In the long term, the stock market has been disconnected from the economy ever since 2000, if not longer. The massive wealth inequality and middle class debt has been feeding this disconnect (more wealth in the hands of those who invest in the market, little wealth in the hands of those who drive the economy). The only to keep this going to keep giving out debt. The problem with a debt driven economy is debt inevitably needs to get riskier to keep the good times going. Eventually, enough bad debt accumulates and market meets reality. That should sound familiar as that is what happened in 2008. Nothing has changed to prevent that from reoccurring. If anything, it has gotten worse."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"What insurance company can actually pay the $62T claim?

 GME could still squeeze to insane heights, but the idea that its going to a $62T mkt cap is just silly. At some point the SEC steps in and shuts it all down."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The change is because they want to get off the USD and onto satoshicoins.  Banks dying is part of the plan.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Blatant misinformation...wow.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You seriously think JPow cares about GME? I‚Äôm still holding GME but this reducing QE has nothing to do with market makers and meme stocks lmao.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is total nonsense. This move just reverts the capital requirement for banks and disallows the temporary higher leverage that the Feds permitted big banks in buying Treasury bonds, while also changing how big banks can account for their purchases. The risk is now if big banks reduce their purchasing of bonds, that risks bond yields (that move inverse to prices) climbing higher - which starts making the less riskier bonds more attractive than stocks - this led to the tech crashes/rotation into value stocks past couple of weeks. The yields can also be interpreted as the markets expectations of rising inflation, which is an environment high growth stocks that rely on heavy borrowing would suffer in.

GME has not much to do with why the Feds withdrew this, besides _maybe_ contributing to the stock market being a total clusterfuck 1-2 days. 

I like the stock as much as everyone else, but also want to be informed in the right ways when we can, esp since who you're trading against do this for a living.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The FED decided that the stimulus that was finally put in place is enough that that can pare back on what they were doing. 

if the market crashes they will be right back in there to foot the bill with our money."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not really related, but think about how the government controls the currency. The taxes come from the governments money. They don‚Äôt need our taxes when you get down to the bare bones of it, it‚Äôs their money. But yes in reality they do use that tax money for different things, I won‚Äôt deny that. Consider this - would anyone use the US dollar if we weren‚Äôt taxed in it? Maybe a better question is would anyone have used a governments currency in the first place if they weren‚Äôt taxed in it."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Since we use sovereign currency, the government‚Äôs money doesn‚Äôt really come from taxes. After all, we had to get money in our hands first for it to be taxed at all, and the only way for that money to end up in circulation is for the government to spend it. 

Taxes more remove currency from circulation than they do anything else, as I understand it. So while the federal government may tie the budget in to taxes to a degree, that‚Äôs more from an angle of avoiding inflationary spending. 

States require tax money to function, since they do not possess their own currency that they control and produce, unlike the federal government which does."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wrong....

Banks have to have a certain amount of cash vs assets, dictated by central bank. The Fed has allowed them to exclude some assets from that count which means holding back less cash (more loans can go out).

They've been doing this for the last year, clearly banks are going to be fine, no need to keep this policy"

It's bad for bank stocks, but bullish for the rest of the economy to get banks lending again. It might be short term bearish for tech/etc... because of rising rate fears."

On Monday I wait about 20mins after market open then buy a $SPY call that is $5 out of the money and 30 days to expiry. Sell it after about 5 to 7 business days or as soon as you see 16%-20% gains. These last 2 weeks have been kinda red but otherwise this tends to rake anywhere from $120 to $500 a week depending on how many calls you're willing to buy. To start off I recommend only buying one call and seeing if it works out for you. How much more you're willing to risk afterwards is up to you but be careful! These last 2 weeks wiped out pretty much my whole 2021 gains because I got greedy and went in hard just before SPY took a downturn."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,this guy held rkt lol
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine taking a comment about GME in WSB this seriously
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lets do some simple estimates:

70M shares of GME. Probably at least 200M float due to naked shorts/FTD's. If GS does a 10x split and a special dividend along with converting to an ecommerce then that effectively means around 100-200 factor.

70M becomes becomes 700M but effectively 7B with ecommerce reevaluation. If the stock goes to 1000 that is 7T to 20T in GME alone. AMC and many other stocks are going through the same thing.

Granted, GME probably won't go to 1000 after the split, maybe 100-200 max depending on the news. That is still billions upon billions of dollars in one stock.

The problem is that if the MOASS happens it will effect the entire market like dominoes because HF's will have to sell stock(which increases supply which reduces value) and this will create a feedback cycle of FUD once the market starts slipping. HF's start going under, millionaires and billionaires who were invested in those HF's start to lose everything and have to start selling their yachts and mansions since they can't afford the taxes, and things just get worse and worse.

I'm not saying such things will happen, the magnitude of the event is inversely proportional to the probability. The issue is that it \*could\* happen. it is more likely than ever before. It all depends on the exact circumstances and no one really knows. Not all HF's will go under, some own GME precisely because they are hedging. RC may not do the necessary things to pull it off. The short position might not be more than 20%.

Regardless, there is a good chance that if a few things line up that it will upset the markets. If it gets too bad you know that the government will step in and save the rich, they always do. Retail will be left holding the bags. Maybe this time will finally be different, unlikely though. Remember, the bankers are rich as are the politicians.

&#x200B;

‚ÄúBecause of recent growth in the supply of central bank reserves and the  issuance of Treasury securities, the board may need to address the  current design and calibration of the SLR over time to prevent strains  from developing that could both constrain economic growth and undermine  financial stability,‚Äù the Fed said in a statement. ""

&#x200B;

Remember, if some HF's defaults on a few billion someone has to come up with that money. Now if they default on their position then what does that trigger in the market? A sell off of stock? Billions worth? How does that ripple through the markets? If it triggers any other systemic issues then what?

&#x200B;

I think the key here is to look at the overall picture. To see how the different data points all point to something major starting to happen. You have this, you have the SEC implementing restrictions on HF short positions, you already have Melvin Capital losing billions, you had Robinhood screwing over retail, you have all the FUD against GME by the media, you have clearly organized attacks on GME to drive it down, and what else?

All these point to a direction that something big is starting to build. GME is not going to 1M a share, it is impossible(not enough money in the world) and greed would still prevent it. But GME seems to be at the center of all this. I could be wrong. I think it is conclusive that if shorters have shorted more stock than can be bought there is a fundamental singularly that exists that they will never be able to fix(you can't buy back more shares than exist even if all the buyers would sell).

I think the real issue is that the bankers and HF's will do everything they can to undermine GME even if they break the law to do it(they have no problems with this). Also remember Epstein?

They would get more in deposits by raising interest rates and thereby lending out more money. 

So i think the fed wants banks to incur more debt on lending, by taking out of equities and putting it into borrowing.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The SLR is T1 Capital/Total Assets, the fed temporarily allowed banks to remove treasuries and fed account balances from the denominator, increasing the ratio. The thought was this would encourage banks to lend (PPP, etc) without fear of falling below regulatory capital minimums.

So now the fed is letting that temporary change expire, signaling banks need to retain extra capital but also the extra measure to ensure additional lending isn‚Äôt needed anymore.

But no, that doesn‚Äôt mean more deposits, it means more T1 capital, which will most likely come from earnings, especially with firms releasing reserves which just boosts income. Deposits are an asset/liability which only brings the ratio lower, they‚Äôll need more T1C to bring their ratios up."

When interest rates are higher, there are less people that want to get loans but banks want to lend more so they loosen restrictions making borrowing more available to a larger group, therefore increasing the amount of loans going out. 

When there's a lot of cheap money being thrown around, the only people who can really get access to that are people with good credit and corporations with solid financials (not including emergency loans that went out last year in the beginning of covid which most banks didn't want to participate in but were told to nonetheless). 

When interest rates are high and lending restrictions loosened, more avg joes can borrow, albeit at unattractive rates, but they still need the money and are more likely to accept it out of need, not greed."

You are one serious imbecile. Epstein and the bankers were already tied together. I even posted a damn link that tied them together at least in one way. You have absolutely zero idea how deep Epstein runs through the system. ZERO. Yet you just assume he was just some random dude that raped a few girls on his 500M island and 70M mansion and he got that money by playing the stock market.  And of course he ends up dead by a means that no ordinary person could pull off. Funny how you just ignore all the facts. I can only conclude it is because you are an imbecile. BTW, what is your IQ? Do you want to make any wager that mine is larger? 1000? 10000? How much do you have? Do you know what an escrow is? Do you have a lawyer?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Um, maybe you just have no patience. You clearly do not understand how all this is playing out. Maybe you'll find out Tuesday or Wednesday. 

I realize there is always talk about it's going to happen tomorrow... but no one knows when it will happen or IF it will happen. Again, you clearly don't understand how this stuff works. It is about probabilities. Do you know what a probability is? Have you ever learned Bayesian probability? Can you compute a mean or know what a normal distribution is? You don't have to know this stuff to figure out that if the right set of circumstances happen then GME can skyrocket. Then if you knew a little about probability you could estimate the chances of it happening. It's just an estimate.

But what you completely fail to get that it is nearly certain that GME will be worth around 200$ a share as long as it converts to an eCommerce business. If that is the case then buying shares < 200$ is not really much of a risk, far less risky than buying penny stocks or weed stocks or others. So the risk/reward is pretty damn low if one is willing to wait and see. Yes, GME could drop to 20$ a share again. I don't think DFV will let that happen without a fight.

Anyways, you could be right or you could be wrong. I'm not sure why the hell you are worried about what other people do with their money. It doesn't effect you. Are you afraid of missing out? You don't want others to win? I mean, seriously, what the fuck is your problem? Are you a bot or a shill? If I lose all my money what does it matter to you? You don't give a shit about me so why are you concerned at all about GME? Did you short GME and have something to lose? Seriously, what is the game you are playing?"

Raising interest rates allows the banks to lend more. Remember that most deposits will be fixed term deposits for years - you won't get your 3% if you withdraw before say 12 months.

Banks use money to lend. That's their business. The fed printing heaps of money devalued cash so much that banks flocked to equities. They had no choicr during the lockdown. Businesses were closing. No money in lending. 

Now the fed wants banks to go back to lending."

Well, no shit. But people who talk about it sure don't act like it's probabilities. People talk about it like it's a sure thing and are shocked when you don't see it their way.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"But clearly I am smarter than you. Again, funny with the ad hominem... but I don't see any paper in the escrow.  Look, we can settle on independent IQ tests that measure any level of intelligence you want. Music? Mathematics? Science(Physics, Chemistry, Electrical Engineering, Biology)? Computer Science? Whatever you want we can work it out as long it is actually something that requires intelligence.

At least my mommy never called me an idiot. Sucks to be you. Still waiting on the wager amount. I'll even give you a 10 point handicap. N(100, 15), that is almost one standard deviation you'll get. How intelligent do you think you are? You know I can't be that intelligent. Likelihood of having an IQ of 200 would be something like 1 in 500M. I'm sure you can calculate your likelihood of winning and find the appropriate expected value to wager. I'll be waiting for the amount."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Who described Epstein‚Äôs penis in detail that you knew about this?  Lol.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait, no one saw my dick in high school, what gives"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,A special comment
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Um, maybe it is that you are pretending anything in life is an absolute? Everything is probabilistic. You don't even know what will happen in  4 seconds after reading this with 100% absolute certainty.

Also, if you understand how things work. If it is 1$ that MOASS would happen, then it is 10% that 1/10 of a MOASS would happen(assuming uniform distribution for simplicity). GME doesn't have to MOASS for people to profit.

The valuation model? 
1. Ecommerce businesses are classified with a 10:1 P/E ratio since they do not have the same revenue needs. Less brick and mortar stores means less rent, less bills, less workers. It has been well established that the 10:1 ratio is what happens on average when a business converts to an ecommerce. The earnings go up because there is less overhead. It's very simple. Since you don't seem to want to do your own DD:

https://wemakewebsites.com/blog/how-to-determine-the-value-of-an-e-commerce-business/
https://wemakewebsites.com/blog/how-to-determine-the-value-of-an-e-commerce-business/
https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042015/what-average-pricetoearnings-ratio-internet-sector.asp
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ecommerce.asp

So IF GME moves in to an ecommerce, which it almost surely is, then it will eventually be re-evalauted with a 10x stock price at whatever it's true valuation is now. Given that a year ago it was 20$ we can use that as an estimate. So 10x20 = 200(I know it is hard but keep up). So, given that only, the stock is at 200$ right now, so buying it at 200$ is not a risky bet, At the very least the stock may go down a little or stay the same if things don't work out... but it wouldn't go back down to 20$ with a 10x eCommerce evaluation because that would mean that the stock would be worth 2$ which is a completely under evaluation. Even your favorite analysts are saying the stock is worth 15$-40$ so that would be 150$-400$.

Then anything good that happens is just icing on the cake. If GS changes its image, creates new value, etc then the stock will go up.

You should do your own work.  It seems you are expecting someone to give you all the answers... not going to happen. If what I have said doesn't give you enough of a picture to at least warrant you putting in your own DD then the problem is you, not everyone else."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is actually the way.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here, I think you dropped this üëë"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What happened to your 1.5k shares from your previous update?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They're really going for it!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can't stop won't stop, clearly."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Hurry up. You're taking too long
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just read over your original post. You realize that in order for your income to make up for the loss of IV, *you* have to pay for that exponential growth you're abusing? What do you think the stock will settle at? No matter what you're gonna need at LEAST tens of millions in external revenue because it's not going to continue jumping up and down 1000% for 30 years. 

Your best bet is if it crashes to 1$/share; then at least it only costs 7 million to buy, and you'll have a decent chunk of that from calls (If this somehow goes on for *5 more years* and you truly reinvest everything like you claim, you'll have around 360k before the crash, 35%+0.5% of which sticks around), so around 120k. With your income that is at least semi-feasible.

If it's a vaguely reasonable number instead, let's say $10? You need 70 million, of which (35%+5%)*360k = only 144k will be from stock gain after 5 years. 70 mil-144k is... still 70 mil.

The problem is the strategy of selling calls requires the price to stagnate or decrease forever to make profit, but in that situation the IV doesn't stay high. And even if it DID somehow keep a meme stock volatility gain of 10% forever it would take like 50-60 years to buy GME at 10 bucks a share, and that would make you the best stock picker in the world."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,If you want to own gamestop quickly following the trend and selling in the squeeze is probably a good idea. You'll maximize returns so you can double down when the price drops. After that it's a simple case of your current strategy of buying and holding. Not financial advice ofc.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt know about you but I don‚Äôt feel like we got an answer to this üòÖ
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Withdrawals from a traditional IRA are just treated like regular income during retirement. The tradeoff is that the contributions are tax deductible.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your 401K match will always be traditional, but you should ask if they have a Roth option for your contributions."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"*401(k). 

IRA is Individual Retirement Account. It's a different vehicle than 401(k) or 403(b)."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I just opened a Fidelity account today. It says it will take 'til the 26th to transfer from RH.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Better to have both anyways so you can rollover portions when it makes tax sense to do so.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dammit, I was so hoping the traditional was an intentional thing because you never planned on taking profits. To be fair, I believe you're forced to take out of a traditional at 72, but not a Roth. So if you intend to keep at this past 72, then a Roth is the way to go!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I only have TD Ameritrade, I might get fidelity in the near future"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You buy the shares using the money in your IRA? It's not like a 401k where you're limited to certain funds.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I remember correctly, OP has a thriving business and does not need this money until ... ever"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If your plan is a traditional retirement, with all debts paid off at that point, a traditional IRA can make a lot of sense. You can effectively live under the poverty line and pay virtually no tax, but still have plenty to play with because your $1000/mo mortgage is gone."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks! I‚Äôll definitely do that.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Good catch. Whoops.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I didn't know I'd be in a situation where I'd be making millions in such a short amount of time when I funded my Roth.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok I was going to say that would be really convenient. Rather than having to log into a different account to help my wife.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Serious enough to make a plan and stick to it.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree with this guy how can we lend a hand post your PayPal
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I did a transfer on Wednesday. My shares are there now. However I tried the exact same transfer weeks ago and robinhood rejected it for an incorrect account number. Fidelity verified the account number was the same on both requests
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, I still don't intend to take profits. And moving shares from one to the other means I have to claim it as income to transfer the funds, which would hinder my goal."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Huh, maybe mine is just weird. I can only select funds within their portfolio from what I can see. Oh well"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What's the chance he's a big YouTuber of some sort? Probably making bank off his old videos so he has money to spend. I know Mrbeast in into the stock market I wouldn't be surprised if he posted a couple big buys here in the past.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What's the business
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or, if you don't care about profits, you can use the immediate tax break of a traditional to buy as much GME as possible before you turn 72.

Either OP knows this and this is the most diamond balls commitment we've ever seen on wsb, or OP just doesn't understand what a Roth IRA is. Either way, I'm fucking hooked. Literally can't go tits up"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,RMDs say otherwise
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Would you please elaborate on this, specifically the link between mortgage and traditional IRA. Thank you."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"But doesn't this still work out in our favor if it goes to a million per share? Otherwise I figured the taxes we would pay on a traditional IRA would be closer to 50%... so I thought ok, say I make a couple million here, I can withdraw a mil and only pay a 100k penalty instead of like 400k in taxes"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,OP has no intention of selling; ever. His entire goal is to become the major share holder of GME.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, they mess with the plan a bit, but realistically they're still around what you'd need to pull out anyway and the tax rate you hit is still less than you're probably getting taxed while contributing to one.

This is assuming taxes don't double, of course. Roths are a great way to dodge future tax increases."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The base concept is to make it so that you pay the lowest possible tax rate. Within certain bounds, you can control your income while drawing from a traditional IRA. So, if you keep your costs low, you can keep your income low and sit in a lower tax bracket. For example, if you had $1M in your IRA at retirement today, you might withdraw $30k of it a year (the government actually requires you to withdraw about this much, look up RMD). If your income now is above that by a significant margin, then contributing to an IRA allows you to defer that higher tax rate now (say 22-37% depending how much you make) and withdraw it at the lower rate. 

Since we're assuming it's all of your income, you get the standard deduction taken off ($12k if you're single) leaving $18k. $9875 of that is at 10%, and the other $8125 at 12%. So, your total tax burden for your $30k/year income ends up being $1962.5/year, or about 6.5% overall. You also don't pay into social security or medicare with it, since you paid that in advance anyway. (Traditionals are still required to pay that part of tax.)

Compare that with a roth, where you paid all of the contribution tax up front at the top tax bracket you hit (22% for me, for example) instead of removing the standard deduction and starting from the bottom bracket, and it's quite favorable up to a certain point. If you plan to use a lot *more* money in retirement than you have now, then the equation flips and a roth now makes way more sense.

Mortgages only come into play here as me assuming you are not paying a mortgage when you retire, because it is fully paid off."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh thanks man. Will have to take a look!

Edit: oh damn, this is the way I'll be going. It looks like I'll be taking out as much as can over the next 5 or so years! Thanks again!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow I was not aware of that. Hoping to retire before 60. Thanks!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You pay 100k in penalty *on top* of your normal tax rate if you were to withdraw early on a roth.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,well it doesn't fucking matter because in no universe is it ever going to get anywhere close to a million per share? like seriously? what the fuck lmao
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre not pulling anything out of a traditional ira without paying taxes. The brokerage is required to withhold and submit the tax portion to the IRS. Plus, if you withdraw earlier than age 59 1/2, the brokerage will also withhold the penalty as well. You don‚Äôt get to ‚Äújust go take a million out‚Äù without it following tax laws."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Can be a HF and borrow the shit out of stocks to manipulate the market but god forbid a user day trade
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"And this only applies if the account has less than $25k in equity in it.

I just started exploring trading so I created a ""buffer"" in my account that is in VOO and VTV just to ensure that I don't dip below that threshold and get locked out of trades I want/need to complete."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Who tf was talking to you?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I'm maxing out my Roth. I figure I can still live comfortably paying a lot of taxes now and then live like royalty when I retire and pay no taxes.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait if you withdraw early suddenly you have to pay taxes on it too? :o
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I know you're taxed on a traditional IRA no matter what - it's paying taxes on Roth as well in case of early withdrawal that I failed to realize was a thing
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah if you want a really lavish retirement a roth makes a ton more sense.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,There are some exceptions but expect to pay a 10% penalty and then your tax rate in your tax bracket. The goverment is basically encouraging you to keep a retirement fund and discouraging you to pull it out early.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That's good to hear. There's tons of articles online explaining the difference between traditional and Roth and all they really boil down to is how much taxes do you think you'll be paying
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Alright that's good to know.. thanks!

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not trying to be an ass. Just trying to clear confusion and.   There is a major difference between EV (full electric) and PHEV (plug-in hybrid).  

I works for a dealer, I personally sold 10% of all of the CT6 PHEV‚Äôs that are in the US.  I leased one myself.  Loved it and I swore I‚Äôd never buy ‚Äúan electric car‚Äù.  

Gm has had an EV before, but it was 1996-1999‚Ä¶. Nothing recent.  

GM has surpassed Tesla in self driving and battery tech.  There will be problems with every car for every manufacture but I really feel confident about this new lineup.  I can‚Äôt wait.  

It‚Äôs a love hate with me and Tesla because I f‚Äôn love Elon Musk but I work for the competition lol."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You mean the electric Saturn? That actually came out last century...
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I owned a Volt.  It was a good car.  GM has been (as you know) silently working on EV/self driving for quite a while and didn't make a lot of fuss about it.  I got family and friends that work at GM.  I think they are going to do well.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought we were talking actual cars..
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It was an actual car. Saturn EV 1.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look - are we talking about cars that are production in the context of the original comment?  Or are we going to talk a very limited scope technology proving vehicle that you couldn't even buy?  GM took them all back and destroyed them.  I would not call that a production vehicle.  Guess what - companies have limited prototypes all the time.  Sure, it was a marketing stunt to lease them to people.  

I grew up in SE Michigan.  I know about this car.  My response was that GM has been doing this for a long time.  You're really smart for knowing about the EV1.  Are you happy now?"

2021-03-20 02:54:30,wallstreetbets,"RKT: catalysts for continued housing boom this year A lot of people are arguing that mortgage rates will go up and RKT won't hold its strong earnings. I believe that there are a couple of catalysts that will extend the hot housing market and RKT is perfectly positioned to take advantage.

1. Biden's 15K first time home buyer tax credit. This will be HUGE. This can be used at the time of closing so that down payment is effective lower. In cheaper places, [\~40% more renters would be able to afford a median mortgage](https://www.housingwire.com/articles/renters-and-bidens-15000-homebuyer-tax-credit/). Guess which demographic group is the most likely first time buyer? That's right, tech-savvy millennials who will likely shop for their mortgage online. RKT is perfectly positioned to take advantage of this, and they will also have a suit of complimentary offers such as home insurance, title services, and realtors, all in the Rocket/Quicken ecosystem. 
2. [DACA recipients will be eligible for federally insured mortgages.](https://themortgagereports.com/73772/fha-accepting-daca-home-loans) There are 700,000 DACA recipients. Again these are all young people, [with an average age of 24](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/09/25/key-facts-about-unauthorized-immigrants-enrolled-in-daca/). You can bet that they will likely shop for mortgages online. They are probably less likely to walk into a bank branch to ask for a mortgage.

I couldn't find any more recent statistics, but back in 2016 already [millennials were already twice as likely to use quicken mortgage](https://www.quickenloans.com/press-room/2017/03/07/fueled-rocket-mortgage-detroit-based-quicken-loans-achieves-record-breaking-year/). 

These catalyst, combined with the already conservative guidance, means RKT will crush expectations on their earnings for at least the next few quarters, maybe then they will earn the respect of the market."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Part time real estate agent here. It's fuckin' nuts. right now. Showings are booked solid like 14 hours a day.

2021-03-20 02:48:56,wallstreetbets,"$MRK to feed your $GME addiction Hear me out fellow autists. Covid vaccine out full force so if you missed the Moderna rocket ship here‚Äôs your chance to bet on the next best thing. Covid pill that heals you within 5 days.

A little-known company by the name of Ridgeback biotherapeutics has been working on and in the late stages of developing a COVID-19 Therapeutic Molnupiravir. Preliminary studies show that so far the drug suggests that it helps your body rid of covid in 5 days if taken early enough. 
https://www.merck.com/news/ridgeback-biotherapeutics-and-merck-announce-preliminary-findings-from-a-phase-2a-trial-of-investigational-covid-19-therapeutic-molnupiravir/


Now Ridgeback isn‚Äôt publicly traded, however Merck pharmaceuticals, Under the agreement announced on May 26, 2020, through a subsidiary, has acquired exclusive worldwide rights to develop EIDD-2801 and related molecules in collaboration with Ridgeback. https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200701005928/en/

And Merck is publicly traded under $MRK. That‚Äôs right apes, Pitbull aka Mr. worldwide style. No matter the country your wife‚Äôs bf takes her she will be able to get plan b and a covid pill to set her straight before coming home. 

Looking at Moderna when they announced their covid vaccine their stock more than doubled. $MRK stands for a chance to do the same (if they actually have succeeded in developing a drug that fights covid)

Now $MRK play here may be long (depending on their approval with the FDA) however this is a safe one. More results end of this month.

Let‚Äôs look at numbers which you won‚Äôt understand or care about:

1.	Dividends (extra bananas every 3 months) = range of .61 to .65 per share (1000 shares = $650 bananas every 3 months to feed your $GME addiction)
2.	Market cap of $195.51B (a lot of bananas)
3.	Volume = 52,981,418 (lots of apes)
4.	52 week ‚Äì H=$87 L=$76 and currently $77 (buy high sell low)
5.	Options are affordable still ($2 range for $85 calls in Jan 2022)
6.	Earnings EPS 1.5-1.3 last (next on 4/29)

My predictions going into the fall of this year this stock will rise to $85 without any significant developments, but if they actually accomplish this medicine bank on $100- $125 / share easy.

Obligatory positions ‚Äì 100 shares $MRK . 18x $85 calls Jan 22

TD;LR- $MRK owns rights to ridgeback development of covid 19 medicine capable of healing you in 5 days, also can‚Äôt go bust so you won‚Äôt lose all your hard-earned bananas.

If the studies pan out and it gets approved it'll definitely be a useful addition to the covid arsenal.

2021-03-20 02:45:31,wallstreetbets,"$GME ‚ÄúConservative‚Äù Outlook; Technical Analysis ‚Äì MACD, W%R, DMI Based I have been seeing GME squeeze by ‚Äúx‚Äù date a lot in this sub, and I think its fun to theorize when it will happen. However, the truth is we don‚Äôt know when it will happen, and it‚Äôs almost impossible to try to guess.

What we can do however is predict the next bearish or bullish cycles within GME, and we can position ourselves accordingly to trade well. For example, holders can have an idea of how long they need to hold so you don‚Äôt get spooked into selling too early, and buyers can enter in at educated price points.

GME is currently in the very last days of its bullish MACD sentiment. In the chart below we can see that on 2/25 MACD flipped to positive, triggering the start of a bull run. As of 3/19 the MACD histogram bar is very low and with W%R and +DI trending down it looks like on Monday MACD will flip to negative, confirming a bear run.

[2\/25 - 3\/19](https://preview.redd.it/jzkjlx5hb2o61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=5835a25e613d379340c2f52da7b1004b1de4deec)

Now, the question is how long will bearish sentiment last for? For reference lets look at the last two times the MACD histogram was negative:

&#x200B;

[1\/27-2\/26](https://preview.redd.it/n35a3qlkb2o61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1e93ef2c67df5f7598139d211144db90b76e987)

In this example (2/4-2/24), we can see that bearish sentiment lasted about 14 trading days. We should note however, that this is right after huge volume and sudden spike in price.

Now another example:

&#x200B;

[12\/8-1\/13](https://preview.redd.it/0x6qf54ob2o61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=b10e245f52cb96382e7eeca802024346475218c7)

Looking back from 12/10-1/12 we can see that GME was following a 6 to 8 day bearish to bullish trend. Important to note is that these trends did not spike the price too much and volume was relatively low.

Now looking ahead to 3/22 and onward, I can safely predict that there should be a bearish trend. This doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean prices will dramatically plummet but institutions know that trying to raise prices against negative MACD momentum isn‚Äôt favorable. Also, I can also say that if a bearish trend starts, it should last something like 6-14 days. Our most recent bullish trend had decent volume and there was also a pretty dramatic price change, and so I think the real number will in the middle of those two extremes.

Now I know that is a very large window of time, but it really does depend on what happens during the next two weeks to determine if the MACD histogram will overturn. Events like the earnings report on 3/23, and if RC announces a CEO position could help overturn sentiment.

I'm sorry if this doesn't feed your confirmation bias or if you think im trying to spread FUD. I just wanted to share so we can make educated trades and stay in the game longer so we can get this thing to squeeze!

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You say GME has been in a bull run according to MACD but it‚Äôs been in a downward channel for the past week. Can you help a smooth brained ü¶ç understand?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm happy when the price goes up, but even happier when it goes down.. so I can average down!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,TLDR I‚Äôm not selling
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Max Pain was $150 today, we finished @ $200 solid. MMs lost their shirts this week and were desperate to get the stupid thing down. When $GME was @ $230 around 11 today, I watched a 3/19 300P $4M come across cheddar and hit the stock price like a missile. Looks like desperation. 

We finished with 100 shares left in broker borrow view. Shorting fire power is gone, which can also means some MMs can't sell puts if they don't own the underlying. 

Charts are bullshit for a stock like this. 

Max Pain 3/26 is $175 and MMs make way too much money selling call premiums to apes.

Watch options flow on Monday. If big money calls start lighting this up again causing delta hedge wheels to turn, you can bet your diamond plated ass that we smooch the MACD and float upward."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey, were all smooth brainedü¶ç here no worries. So I can see how my word choice is confusing. When the MACD moves from a neg to pos slope, that signifies a bull run. This run is confirmed when MACD switches from having negative to positive values. You can see this on the first chart and most recently it happened 2/22 (neg to pos slope) and confirmation was 2/25 (neg to pos histogram values). This lasted until 3/11. 

On 3/12 the slope reverses, meaning the green MACD histogram bar was smaller than 3/11's green MACD histogram bar. What this means is that momentum on the stock is failing, as in this case MACD is a measure of average prices over 12 & 26 days. This signals a bear run, and explains the decrease in price from 3/12-3/19. The reason I have ""last days of bullish sentiment"" in my post is because until the MACD actually flips to negative, the signal is not confirmed."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gamma squeeze won‚Äôt happen until price drops and IV cools off, making calls more reasonable prices"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I concur. I think most have felt the bearish pressure for about 7 trading days. We have had a couple of intraday ‚Äúspikes‚Äù - like midday today - but for the most part it‚Äôs been a downward trend for a full 7 trading days now. 


I‚Äôm expecting to hover around between 180-205 for a little bit. Once things thing hits 230+ again with volume....then I expect to touch 400 soon after. I think going from 250 to 400 will be pretty quick. 


I also think settling in around 180-200 could be important to attract new retail investors. We talk about Hedges bleeding....well I think some of us are bleeding too. There are many of us who have already maxed out."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Gamma squeeze at 350% IV with price hovering around $200 while the options chain goes upto 800+? I thought I was delusional

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs fair, appreciate the response fellow ape"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,If gamma squeeze won‚Äôt happen until price cooled off then what happened two weeks ago when price was $146 on Monday 3/10 then we rocketed to $348 on Wednesday? IV was already high for calls since 2/26 spike so your statement makes no sense. Option chain doesn‚Äôt matter if whales start chain reaction by making just otm calls finish in the money  by carpet bombing with big call option buys and/or shares buys. Those whales include other hedge funds.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn this is so good
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"One (of the many) event that helped the 3/10 movement was the 14 trading days of price pushdown from 2/4-2/24. This allowed many investors to enter in at good price points. 

And another is that by 3/10 we already had 10 days of growing bullish momentum. If you look at my first chart you can see how large the green MACD histogram bar for that day.

As for IV, the cooloff occured during 2/4-2/24. Allowing investors to buy large amounts of calls during that time. 

Whales love money so they will be looking at all of this with at an even higher level of detail than us"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because people bought calls while it was in the $40s, for several weeks out, like I did. As the price rose, more of those became ITM. Sure, some were added. But the ones that were for low strike prices that were potentially exercised were the ones that were purchased while price was low. The ones people added as the price went up were way OTM and never even paid out, forget about being exercised"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought in the way up from $75 to $250  and sold near top. Held some calls (currently in the red) for earnings. Still netted some awesome gains. Still hold original shares bought at around $18 a share

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fundamentals don't apply in a short squeeze.  They could announce the company has zero profit and the share price is still going to the moon because APES HODL THE STOCK,  HF'S HAVE TO BUY IT TO COVER THEIR ILLEGAL NAKED SHORTS, AND APES ARENT SELLING UNTIL WE GET THE PRICE WE WANT."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,no one is saying that earnings will be bad and price will go down. ur the fucken idiot here. people are more interested to hear what changes Cohen is bringing to Gamestop.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Bullshit.  Earnings will have zero impact on the outcome.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I think it's like CNBC's way of pretending that this stock isn't just pure market manipulation and fairy dust and bulls vs bears grudge match.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Fundamentals did an Elvis about 2 months ago and left the building.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right.  He‚Äôs spinning a narrative that ‚Äúthe only way GME is worth more money is if they tie in crypt0.‚Äù There‚Äôs zero chance of that so he can keep saying ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt listen to me, better sell it‚Äù.  It speaks louder that he never talks about legitimate steps and gameplans on the table with GME"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets, I got bonered there reading that.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, not THE big tournament. The stores host the locals tournaments. That qualifies people for the state tournament, which qualifies for regional and so on. 

WAAAAAAY back in the day we tried a Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 tournament. It went really well considering it was just us at the store advertising and social media wasn‚Äôt what it was today. It was just a local tournament for Douglasville Ga but we pulled it off in our little store. 

If this is the future for GameStop, and this is just me guessing, they‚Äôre going to need larger stores but less of them in their districts."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh steam is easy to beat. It‚Äôs all about terms. Take less of a cut from the creators. And part of the agreement people don‚Äôt know is when an indie game is put on steam, steam gets a percentage of everything related to that game. Sell T-shirts of your game? Steam gets a cut. Make a comic book from your game? They get a cut of that too. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love steam. It‚Äôs been very good to indie devs but there‚Äôs always that little bit extra a company can use to cut into Steam‚Äôs market hold."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Just buy Valve.  It's only worth like 1.5b

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,nah dude. any of those fucks can get away w murder as far as their audience is concerned. similar personalities in the political side of things (w/o trying to get political) have shown that there's no consequence if you say something that's later proven wrong

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramerica Capital
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Right on my credibility
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,this is even dumber. why wouldn't institutions take profit when the price was over 400 or even now when its over 200? why wait till earnings when it could be bad and stock might go down. did you even think before typing this?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They wouldve taken profits last week then ü§°
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,earnings will have an impact they will most definitely announce positive earnings which will be the catalyst for the squeeze
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,GameCoin - use it across all consoles/platforms. Buy it or earn it through unlocking achievements played in-game. And make it transferable across different games? Would that be too much?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Can I create a coin with the sole purpose of the value going down?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree with this take.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Me too üò≥ is that a bad thing? Ape don‚Äôt understand
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck, I'm rock hard right now. 

There was this little place in my old hometown when I was a freshman in high school, half my life ago, called Nod3. They had the best PCs back in 2004-05 it was heaven for a teen gamer like myself. I used to go there with a couple friends and play vanilla WoW and The Burning Crusade and drink Bawls. It was really fucking fun. I would play games in a Gamestop one day just to revive the sense of nostalgia of playing on expensive ass PC setups that I've never been able to afford.

I just hope they will sell Bawls."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I wanna take you for a ride!....
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would not say easy.Right now valve has the huge advantage that they offer a steam workshop FOR FREE. There are games where their entire lifespan depends on haveing easy access to mods, assets, map, ...  and valve offers just that. Not to mention that contentcreator for games like Dota use this (or in combination patreon) to make a lot of money from it too.

The other factor is trust. The best example for me would be oculus vs vive.Oculus was first an independent company and now requires you to login via facebook and if you do not merge accounts you and I quote "" can continue using your Oculus account for two years."". With valve being its own platform and not on the stockmarket aka not dependent on investors there are a lot less shady moves.

To make this clear, I am not saying valve never pulled anything shady like for example offering a Doom themed bundle at equal price for all countries when due to restricted lists that ment certain countries did have 6 or more games less in the bundle.

I am saying that valve earned trust by being more pro than anticonsumer on top of offering other services I have yet to see properly implemented by other onlinestores and I would not call that easy to beat.

But you have my upvote good sir/madam because I believe that haveing more competition will be good for the market and users too. If Gamestop wants to step up to it, I welcome them to try."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,When was the last time they updated the GUI? Whatever happened to their console? Pairing headsets it's a bitch.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why buy Valve when they can create their own digital store and take advantage of the existing membership database and existing online store?

That 1.5b can buy a LOT of soft serve ice cream you know?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm going to have enough money to buy a dump truck of manure per asshole to be delivered on their driveway every day.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wouldn‚Äôt it be better if he shows up to the mcdonalds and they just assume he wants ice cream. They proceed to tell him the machines broken. He then walks over, taps it once and says ‚Äúnot anymore‚Äù.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Those brothers are good. They are chasing the short term trends. I‚Äôve noticed the josh guy and another guy are buying dips and the brothers are trading momentum. 
A week or two ago one of the brothers was all about qqq calls on Monday, market went down for 2 days, sold the calls....im like ‚Äúyou should go to WSB‚Äù

Edit: other guy is Jim Labenthal"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Their unusual option activity has printed like 70% of the time for me. On small and mid caps it almost immediately bumps the price too. So free momentum plays usually.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer Berkowitz and Co. actually. He is a literal hedge fund manager.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Next earnings will be insane I expect though, it will include everything they made post hype up which I expect is probably  shitloads of cash"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What's the actual short interest?  This chart is based on reported and we know a lot of counterfeit stock is traded in ETFs.  The HFs need more shares to close their positions than actually exist.  This has been true from day one and won't change.  Fundamentals mean nothing now.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're the definition of a noob investor, yolos into GME at sky high prices thinking your $1-10k investment will make you rich"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bruh, it‚Äôs an earnings report. Shit either goes up, or down."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not necessarily. If you‚Äôve held before all of this, and your cost basis is around $5-$10 even when it plummeted to $40 you still got a great ROI. On the 10th it went from $348 to $172 so clearly someone with enough shares to cause the drop decided to take their profits."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Now I‚Äôm hard üòÇ what to do about it?!? Lol
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"What I described is basically just a concept for a store I was going to open about 3 years ago. Now I‚Äôm glad I held off because my open date would have been around Oct 2019. Maxine being open for 6 months then COVID comes along and kills it. 

I know this, if GameStop doesn‚Äôt become something like this in the future and they just want to sell Fucko Pops and various other crap online, you bet your ass I‚Äôll make it happen."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,We have this i agree. No one is listening. My kinda dirt. Did he grab some woman. Make racial insensitive remarks etc
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I just wish they came on CNBC a little earlier with the unusual option activity... maybe 10:30 instead of 11:30. Though I assume that is what their paid service probably is.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the MF way!!!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I ain‚Äôt there yet. The calls and puts I am not familiar enough to pull the trigger on.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Based on what? Price keeps going up.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,on the horizon it is
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its essentially capping your losses if gme dumps big time

Look up covered calls"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good advice, and I'd do it if I had that much on the line... but it's also capping your gains. 
Let say you sell two $200 calls that expire next Friday 3/26. 

Currently they're ~$33 apiece, so you'd gain ~$6,600 (16.5% of your investment is absurd for the record, but we are in absurd times)

If it closes on 3/26 below $200 (or really $233) you will keep the $6,600 ""premium"" and your shares. 
EDIT:ThatCrazyDudee is right, I guess in reality it'll be AUTOMATICALLY exercised if it's 200.01 or above.

If it closes on 3/26 above $233, someone will pay you $200 a share, and you still keep the $6,600 --- but $46,600 is the max you will net even if GME hits $100,000 / share.
Once I stop gambling money away on deep out of the money options, I plan to actually move towards this cuz it f'ing prints money, especially in times like this.

Lastly, it really eats into your profit, but if you wanted to hedge against extreme losses, you could also buy something like 2 x $150 puts for ~$12 apiece ($2,400)

Edit: Each put/call represents 100 shares, so 2 calls x 100 is why we keep multiplying things by 200... probably should've said that part earlier. Oh well"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I will have to look into this. Thanks for the path.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you do this with any stocks you own 100 shares or more? I haven‚Äôt really looked in covered calls that much.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The beauty is that even if it trades flat (even just for a day), iv will crush and youll make money on the premiums"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The example of 200 is way too close to the current price unless you're short term bearish. The process described above is correct, but typically you want sell 20-30 delta options ($300+) 30-45 days from expiration.

Because volatility is so high, selling $400+ calls 7-10 days until expiration is really profitable right now. You can make around 1% per day while only capping your stock gains at 2x if the options get exercised."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I think he means protective puts? I dont understand why you'd sell a covered call at 200 for downside protection...
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, as long as the stock has options."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"No calls. It's essentially capitalizing the high IV incase GME trades sideways. This week has been tremendous for GME option sellers.

Selling otm puts then wheeling is also commendable"

2021-03-20 01:50:48,wallstreetbets,"Imagine insistently opposing a giant group of gamers after trying to destroy their home. ""*You come to ape's jungle and try cut down our tree? Then try burn whole jungle?!""*

Gamers are some of the most strong-willed and tenacious people on the planet. We regularly spend hours in highly toxic and competitive arenas... **AND WE FUCKING LOVE IT!** 

Now, we stand before the real life- **""Level: 100 of 100 Gatekeepers,""** that have been hacking the game for centuries, with almost complete amnesty from the Moderation and Dev teams. 

In these online arenas, we not only face our opposition head-on, but communicate with them on a personal level. Any cheaters are usually caught, banned, and punished. Effectively, making these online lobbies, with virtually no real-life stake, more governed and moderated than **the fucking stock market...** and that speaks volumes! 

The SEC's intervention into this broken, cheated, and rigged game is overwhelmingly pathetic. 

When you consider the real-life stake that is on-the-line in the stock market, with it being people's livelihood & futures at potential risk, where is the balance here? -You're telling me, that a virtual world with no real-life stake, is just, much more fair than the latter? That is so incredibly ass-hat backwards. 

That's why as community, we need to voice our interests, ideas, and opinions of GameStop's future- Re-imagining the possibilities and laying-out a vision for its potential future. 

Personally, I see the largest gaming organization of all time, with a brick and mortar foundation that's paved and primed for endless possibilities. Storefronts that offer everything in consoles, to a flourishing mecca for PC gamers, \[along the likes of micro-center,\] *(which btw has limited locations w/ little infrastructure for expansion.)* Each store having gaming lounges, where local gamers can team-up, practice, and compete. An annual eSports Championship that covers every competitive title, with total coverage and a production value of the Superbowl/Olympics... Lastly, a thriving eCommerce platform with the same vitality as of everything aforementioned. 

It seems the future of GameStop still remains a bit hazy, we all have different ideas of what it could be, and no real conceptualizations for what it will become. If we started sculpting a collective vision of what we see for GameStop, the more conviction every ape will have. Drastically reducing the amount of paper-handed bitches- **Apes together strong!** 

**Power to the Players!**"

For everything you just listed, versus everything I have proposed, while keeping in mind that GameStop has the capacity & infrastructure, to solve literally- almost all the issues you've just listed, then you must not understand the video game industry and it's ever growing potential.

**Gamers:**

**Created a exponentially growing market worth 138B** ...**and that's my only bullet point**

Do you think you're big brain for playing adversary in a scenario with known resistance and massive manipulation? Literally, all you did was pick a side, and this game has only begun.

If you seriously can't see, that this industry is gonna grow to be even more of an absolute market powerhouse, then you're blind as a fucking bat. So, enjoy those temporary profits, because you can only oppose a massive powerhouse for so long."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"There like the normie fucking console gamers and I'm pretty sure most of them are getting bored of getting the same 3 games every year and shit releases that don't work properly, although it does amaze me that people spend $1000s on card packs every year in Fifa, like they really do need mental help.

Look at CoD - they actually had to make a decent game to get players back and even a free to play model. After the last couple years, no way are people going to be pre-ordering games as much - everyone pre-order has been disaster Cyberpunk being the most recent to mind.

Can't buy video cards with no supply and scalpers trying to hoover them up. But we'll be able to get them in store at Gamestop soon

China is a problem as their market is so big companies can't ignore it.

2021-03-20 01:47:38,wallstreetbets,"Long vs Short (GME Calls vs Puts) We just won the week!!! **Let me explain the ""WIN""**

***Guys in the game of Long HF (wrecking ball) vs Short HF (the brick wall) we're like Miley Cyrus... Swinging naked on the ball and along for the ride!***

The Longs are smart, they knew they wanted to play this sideways all week.  They know the Shorts are playing both sides of this game.  Shorts are buying all the Calls 250+, just in case they find themselves out of position even more than they already are.  Additionally, the Shorts doubled down and bought thousands of PUTs.  the magic number was 200.  We just put a clinic on them, the LONGs have us holding that support.  We're not selling and the Longs know that.  So, lets look at next week...  once these AMC peeps realize we've been the endgame all along they'll come back.  They chased 15 bucks and got burned.  With GME earnings report coming out Tuesday and ETFs adjusting next week. Apes will find direction and community support will follow.  We won guys, we won big.

&#x200B;

**TLDR**: If you own the stock, you're winning.  If you need more ""dry powder"" to buy more GME. Go to Costco and refund anything you ever bought there.  They'll give you cash and boom... You can keep this fire burning!

Lastly, Stop getting nervous paper hands.  We're not dropping to 140 bucks any time soon... Ride these waves and enjoy the ride.

Not financial advice, I just like the stock!"

We talk a bit about catalysts. Feb finra data was supposed to be one, as was 3/19. All we have left is earnings. People like me can hold to the ground because our position is tiny like our pp. but if we‚Äôre making wild predictions I think the people who threw thousands in at 220+ are going to get very nervous if earnings does nothing. I‚Äôm sure the HFs will do their best on Wednesday to nudge that feeling along.

Personally I only make life changing money if the 100k people are right. So I‚Äôd rather the squeeze squoze already to free up room for the next play I‚Äôll miss due to trying to time a market that even pros can‚Äôt."

Just don't be expecting the moon anytime soon"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro... same... had the sell order in at $340 and cancelled it the night before. I was going to sell half to be even and ride out the rest... Greed can be a helluva thing...
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"So this is not conventional advice here but... whatever. I think the sensible thing would be to do what you had planned with the 10 shares. 3 weeks ago this thing was at $40 per share and we could go back down before we go up. Nobody really knows. If you get out what you put in at a profit, then ride the rest, nothing wrong with that. Heck, you could have bought those 10 shares back at $185. Either way, you need to be prepared emotionally for anything, a slow or fast move down or up, and even a grueling sideways march. If making you whole would give you peace of mind, go for that. Your 10 shares won‚Äôt be the reason we don‚Äôt squeeze. More important to be well. It‚Äôs important to be all smiles in the rocket ride."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This has got to be the easiest hold in history, potential squeeze, we clearly have some big players on our side, and at 200, still quite a bit of growth will occur once the company vision post-earnings is shared.  Gaming is growing each year, and all this free marketing is doing wonders.

Easiest. Hold. Ever."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Perhaps consider still selling some off and locking in a profit. You don't want to be saying the same things again if it falls another hundred
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That's index expiring. Etfs adjust at the end of every qtr. Next week!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am hoping it hits 40 again, even if that means prolonging the squeeze. I sold a few boring stocks to free up cash to buy ~200 shares next time it hits that range."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,He got me at Miley CyrusüòÇ
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would be surprised if it hit $20 tbh. Anything under $100 would have me scrambling for more cash to buy right now. 

I can easily see a regular bounce between $150 and $300 for weeks though."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"My buy orders are ready, cash is in the account. I need to get over 100 shares to write some calls."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"But doesn't that mean they sold *less* consoles they potential could have? We all know there was a shortage, but was the shortage due to higher than normal demand or lower than normal supply? With the chip shortage being a known thing I lean towards the latter meaning earnings might be great but also priced in. What I'm really looking forward to is the announcements afterwards."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Ill keep positive vibes. You should go drop another 100 bucks on your 8 shares of AMC... lol all to make 4 bucks.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"AMC has a mountain of debt, while GME has a mountain of cash."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro this is the fucking way man. That shit is dope.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Keep this in mind, evwn if we xont get the squeeze, you'll be 3x in a couple years based on pure growth, the fallback position here is ""get rich slow"" instead of ""get rich now"" edit notfinancialadvice"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Appreciate it. It's the whole ""what if"" thing haha greed is a fical master. I am averaged at $64 so I am doing quite well and if it wasn't for the whole GME thing it would be an insane return already so fast."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,hmm everywhere i read made it sound like it adjusted on witching day
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You shouldn't hope that it does that.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,If we hit 40 again I doubt everyone is going to want to get in on GameStop again so if it does all momentum is done so you‚Äôll just be bagholding the shares for years but ok keep wishing we go back to 40
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You're gonna give him 500k for a ps5?!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed but this could help push momentum. Plus new Cohen business plan, new partnerships, margin calls etc."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I would much rather the squeezes be staggered. I want to roll one squeeze directly into the other for compound squeezes.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dayum, i kind of craving some of that orange chicken now."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The last time we hit $40 it was clearly because of manipulation, and we all held and bought the dip. The GME roller coaster isn‚Äôt over, so maybe it won‚Äôt get back to $40 before the squeeze but $80 or $100, in which case I still get to buy more tickets. And in the end, I still want to own shares, because I believe in the stock long term as well. I bought hundreds of shares of AMC and BB for the same reason. Their underlying fundamentals are good enough and they‚Äôre pivoting to maximize sales. If they happen to squeeze in the future, that‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôll cash out near the top and buy back in after the drop."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah with you on that stuff for sure

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a joke in the pokemon tcg community right now because scalpers are buying out entire stores stock and short squeezing the price of cards at the moment.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Your comment made me realize how dumb it was to invest in gme because in reality nobody is on the same board. All you idiots keep buying and selling constantly and fucks with our momentum. No wonder we can‚Äôt get anywhere. Selling all my shares Monday now thanks for the wake up call
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"They ARE affected.  This is exactly why ‚Äúpin risk‚Äù is a thing, and why brokerages such as robinhood don‚Äôt allow people to keep spreads that are near the money open until 4pm on expiration"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, so I read the pin risk article on Investopedia. If I understand correctly, the risk here is if you get assigned say a call contract a minute before closing (15:59) just barely, and then the price shoots up in AH, you as the options writer are fucked come Monday morning when they have to buy the shares to deliver on the option, because the share price is now significantly higher due to the after/pre market climb?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah check out online stores and shops if you‚Äôre bored. Amazon, gamestop online, walmart, target, anywhere near me and a lot of others are wiped clean.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't worry, these questionable folks just spreading BS.  Makes ya wonder why they care so much what YOU'RE doing"
2021-03-20 01:44:36,wallstreetbets,"Why closing at $14 and $200 DOES NOT MATTER- let‚Äôs do this again **why closing at $14 and $200  DOES NOT MATTER** Facts not FUD

I see a lot of confusion about this. (It also wouldn‚Äôt have mattered if they closed above $14 or below $200) 

**First** those large prints you see on the tape at 4 PM? That‚Äôs NORMAL. Every day at 16:00:02 the first NYSE closing print goes up. This tends to be larger on all Fridays, triple, and quad witching days due to opex. https://www.nyse.com/network/article/nyse-closing-auction?utm_source=homepage&utm_medium=banner

This is not mAnIPulATIOn. This is how the market works. The reason you see the price jump/ change right at 4:00 is you‚Äôre watching the tick data until 3:59:59 then at 4:00:02 they put up the first closing auction print. 

On to the options component of our class - 

Obviously explaining gamma, delta, dealer hedging and open interest is really not getting through to you smooth brains. So I‚Äôm going to try a practical approach.

Use the TWO WRINKLES YOU HAVE and think for ONE SECOND. Would the option market work if every time a dealer sold a call option they just sat around and waited until Friday afternoon to figure out if they needed to have shares to deliver for In the money (ITM) options?? Would that make ANY SENSE?! That people went and bought $200 3/19 GME options 2 weeks ago for $20 and the dealer just sat in their chair staring at their screen? And at 4 PM today dealers short calls from $125 to $200 went ‚Äúoh well looks like I‚Äôm short $300M of GME I have to go buy next week.‚Äù

OF COURSE NOT. This is what we mean by delta hedging. They have already bought stock as a hedge. As the price went up they bought more. That‚Äôs the ‚Äúgamma squeeze.‚Äù

As people close out their positions on Friday the dealers are unwinding. Some options will be exercised and... good news for the dealers! They have the stock! Because they hedged it!

There‚Äôs all sorts of slightly technical reasons there‚Äôs small overhangs at 4:00 but it‚Äôs mostly done. 

Second practical point- HOW MANY FUCKING TIMES DOES THIS HAVE TO HAPPEN FOR YOU TO REALIZE ITS NOT HOW IT WORKS? Every Friday we hear ‚Äúif the stock closes above/ below X then Y will happen next week.‚Äù And it doesn‚Äôt. Because QUITE OBVIOUSLY if that was the case you would see HUGE movements AH. Spoiler alert- you guys aren‚Äôt the only ones that can see open interest. Put on your practical hat again. Don‚Äôt you think if the entire street saw 30M options ITM and thought that many shares needed to be bought Monday they would do it... now?

Options markets matter and you should learn more because it can illuminate what‚Äôs happening in stocks (Ie last week someone bought a whole lot of GME calls and set off this rally) but price at expiry matters very little. There‚Äôs slightly more to it (you can look up ‚Äúpin risk‚Äù and ‚ÄúMax pain‚Äù if you‚Äôre interested I‚Äôm trying to get the most basic concepts across here). The reason AMC traded in such a tight range is because it got pinned at the $14 price due to large OI. This is not manipulation and is just due to mechanical hedging by dealers."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC and GME are glorified ETFs now until the Tendieman comes.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,">They have already bought stock as a hedge. As the price went up they bought more. That‚Äôs the ‚Äúgamma squeeze.‚Äù

Not quite. I believe a gamma squeeze is when they buy stocks to hedge and that causes the price to go up so much they then need to buy more to hedge the next lot of contracts, the more that continues the larger the squeeze."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you. That was very educational for me. It makes total since that when the contracts are made, the MM go get the shares to cover then. Could that be the reason we had the run up to the 300s before it got smacked down?

I just now able to post in this group, so I will have more questions from time to time.

As a side note, I posted in the GME sub earlier today, and was immediately attacked and called a shill for asking if we, meaning that group, were living in a separate reality. As all I see is hype over there. I came here to hopefully make money, but some of the stuff I see posted every two seconds makes me question what planet is this?"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good post. I'm not sure why people are thinking this is some kind of 100% sure thing. I'm still holding because I'm betting they didn't close out their shorts and probably opened more. Basically hoping the persistence of the internet attracts some sharks.

It sounds a lot less interesting than some of the stuff I keep seeing, but that's the play distilled down. It's frustrating that we don't have a lot of information. The core premise still hasn't changed.

Some of the weird wannabe e-celebs and bad DD make me nervous. People are trying to pry attention out of the whole thing and it's frustrating to watch."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"u/verb0182 Thanks for this. I've seen you post various iterations of this concept. Maybe it will sink in now.  I find myself reading DD generally, then checking your profile to see if you've commented to give me the balanced view on it. So keep doing what you do

Presumably, the closing price should affect the  hedging requirements of future possible ITM options not fully hedged? and therefore although they won't be buying on monday for the prev Friday ITM they may well have to improve delta against future risk emerging as the price increases."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes!!!!!!!!! Buy at 200 and sell at 14!!! This is the way!!!!!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I wonder if the only reason OP's post hasn't been downvoted to oblivion is that the GME gang thinks this post is positive for GME.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is all well and good as long as everyone is playing by the rules. It wouldn‚Äôt be crazy to think that some players might not fully hedge and end up short the shares to deliver if there were a big move. Probably not with apple...but GME...?....maybe
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I think they planned their attack on power hour because they read everything posted. They know that's when we will be buying. They think we will crumble. They think we will just give up. Personally I believe we just need to stay the corse and go silent. AMC is going to rise up and speak so loud for all of us it won't be ignored... the whole world is going to hear it!  Not advise I just love the stock and the company.

I'm dumping all my money into until it reaches $1100 a share (it's actual fucking value as an e-commerce company) then I'll sit back and enjoy the squeeze. They should have let this shit happen on Jan 28th, I only had 13 shares on margin (fuck RH). Now I have 32 shares bought with cash (Fidelity and webull) and I'm just a poor boy."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Price and dates matter more than you think but not why you think.

This is a psychological battle.  So even though $200 @ 3/19 doesn't matter to the squeeze, there is a psychological basis that provides the long apes the sentiment to hold going into next week. 

Who set it up this way?  Too early to tell.  Could have been the long whale trying to keep the ape spirit high for their play next week.  Could have been the HFs setting something up for next week by creating a positive sentiment and then pulling the rug out as if crashing.

So it is true that the numbers and dates do not matter as pertains to the mechanics of the squeeze, but I think there is significance to the psychology of the parties involved in how those mechanics are executed."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Gamma squeezes are real but they happen BEFORE expiration not after. There‚Äôs expirations everywhere week so there‚Äôs lots of opportunities for it to happen!  Dealers do not take directional bets on stocks... they want to be ‚Äúdelta neutral‚Äù ie buy/ short stock against their options so that they don‚Äôt make or lose money if the stock goes up or down. When the stock moves a little they have to change their hedge ratio to remain neutral.
If a lot of people buy calls, or a huge stock buyers comes into the market, dealers will have to buy more stock to hedge themselves, resulting in a ‚Äúsqueeze.‚Äù

But by Friday at 4:15 the *past week‚Äôs* options don‚Äôt matter. And again, this is actually intuitive. It doesn‚Äôt make sense that dealers would just wait around and then say ‚Äúoh man, guess I lost a couple of hundred dollars on those options, gotta buy some stock on Monday to deliver shares.‚Äù"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I mean the fact that the stock closed around $200 versus $180 or $220 matters. It just doesn‚Äôt really matter that it was $200.27 vs $199.95.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly it‚Äôs a neutral post. Just clarifying that specific price points don‚Äôt mean shit because MMs don‚Äôt cartoonishly wait until the end of the week to delta hedge.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Aight I think I'm starting to get what you're saying, but I have a follow up question. When a bulk of these $200 call options were written, GME wasn't believed to hit/maintain levels that would put them ITM, and delta hedging was within their budget. Has that changed now that the price skyrocketed beyond their expectations?

For example, a 4/16 $300 call has a delta now of 0.44. If I were to short that, I'd wanna buy 44 shares to be delta neutral, right? But if two weeks from now, that delta jumps to 0.88, I'd have to buy another 44 shares to stay delta neutral. At normal GME prices, this would be doable for MM, but it's more of a stretch when the price is exorbitantly higher than their expectations. At what point do they skip delta hedging and instead try to keep the price down so that those options don't go ITM? Instead of hedging based around the delta, they try to keep the delta down itself? 

What if instead of dumping a ton of cash into GME that they may not need (cash they'd get from closing other positions, as seen by negative beta), they hedge by keeping price low? 

That all aside, I'm assuming they do delta hedging differently than the simple math I did? Cuz if so, 3/19 $200c closed with a delta of 0.5195 and OI of 3593. Even if they were delta neutral, they'd only have 51.95 shares/option. Assume every call option contract writer did that, and they'd have to buy ~173k shares to make up their shortfall.

Plz help me grow a wrinkle here"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Much appreciated your original post and this has really clarified a lot for me today. Especially with the price action of AMC. We need more posts like this.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I get the basics of which you speak. I have gained wrinkles. But what about those ""put walls"" at $300 and $350? It is ASSUMED that hedgies bought those to impede any price momentum from a possible squeeze. IF the hedgies really bought those, and there were a lot of them, and they expire, don't they lose a shit-ton of money? Is that not the essence of why this needs to happen slowly?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"3 weeks ago YouTubers went nuts because AMC finished $8.01 on Friday, as if something big was going to happen. As if dealers hadn't bought any of the ITM shares and would buy them all on Monday, thus causing a squeeze."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"What has buoyed the price to stay around $200 for so long? Is it still just a ton of interest for long positions even though GME should really be $20-$40? It seems like the short position has reduced for a while now, but we still see the spikes and eventual resettling at $200 instead of a free fall.

Just trying to soak up info where I can around here."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"So they hedge the whole time. Literally their computers are using models to ‚Äúdynamically hedge‚Äù with almost ever penny move in the stock. 
You buy a $300 4/16 call, dealer buys 44 shares. Monday the stock goes up to $210, they buy another share. Tuesday it goes up to $240 they‚Äôre buying more shares. 
They‚Äôre *losing* money on their short call but they‚Äôre *making money* on their long shares. That‚Äôs delta neutral. 

If this sounds like the dealers always lose money... remember for GME they are ‚Äúcharging‚Äùexorbitant prices. That $300 call has an implied volatility of 278% which is really expensive in option land. The ‚Äúonly way‚Äù they lose money is if realized volatility is higher than 278%. If it‚Äôs lower they‚Äôll make money (Ie even if stock goes to $350 they won‚Äôt necessarily lose money)

They are short *volatility* they aren‚Äôt short or long the stock price. 

As for the $200 call... I wrote an addendum to the post but yes, right before 4 PM the ATM options have a delta of just around 50%. A lot of times when you see that kind of sharp movement right before the close it‚Äôs dealers capitulating and getting 100% hedged because at 4 pM the delta actually goes to 100% for that $200 call. BUT! it goes to 0% for the $200 put. Given that there are calls and puts open though the total overhang that needs to get cleaned up is relatively small."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"So basically, they've had to pour crazy amounts of money into the GME options machine since get-go, and now that  the dust has settled, they'll have to lose those shares since the calls are ITM. But since the puts aren't ITM, they've got shares that haven't been called away. 

I guess my last question boils down to this: did they pour enough money into the GME options machine to hedge their shit adequately? Other than the intuitive logic we/you worked through, do we have some tangible way of knowing whether they did? Negative beta seems to suggest it, right? A more calculated version of ""Oh fuck, GME went up again. Sell off another couple AAPL!"" 

If all this is true (and I'd believe that to be the case) then Monday we should see them maybe sell off some of their shares that they don't need for hedging? Probably a bit of a dip at market open, kinda like 3/15 and 3/1?"

In particular, he‚Äôs had guests who have written some highly upvoted DD that made it to the front page of their respective subs, much like yourself (I upvoted this DD too btw). You seem pretty passionate about it, and much more knowledgeable than the average person here, so we could probably all benefit from it.

I think for a lot of people they just enjoy the sense of community etc. um, that‚Äôs fine? My problem is that there are some people betting real hard earned money, many of whom could walk away with some nice gains but won‚Äôt because they‚Äôve been misled about an infinite squeeze in AMC.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,How low will apple have to go before a margin call?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Man I‚Äôm also stuck trading Apple on a loss of 2k and keep averaging out.  It has strong support at 120$ I might sell some puts if it dips more.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"those APPL calls would be better served you better by going to las vegas and getting coked out and hookerd up. 

now they are just loss porn.

the other way would be real porn and couldve been made into a movie...."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You have 100k invested already. Most brokers give 2x margin.

Wtf do these people think aapl is doing last I heard they didn‚Äôt buy canoo

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Even with those losses you can still retire very comfortably. You'll just have to relocate to Syria instead but the weather is warm and the place is very affordable from what I understand. You just have to deal with the bombs is all.

They're never going to be better than Nvidia, the only reason they can make better CPU's for retail is because Intel has 95% of their focus on corporate ventures. You're saying they'd be valued more than 10x higher than they are right now in the next 3 years. That's not going to happen."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm just being nitpicky here, but fidelity does allow something called ‚Äúlimited margin‚Äù on retirement accounts. Essentially, it makes sure you can buy stocks with unsettled funds without fear of getting a good faith violation. It doesn‚Äôt allow you to borrow against your securities though.

So you‚Äôre still right in that there‚Äôs no way to have your retirement account go negative, but there is still a type of ‚Äúmargin‚Äù you can have"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh u 80% GME 20% FD, too?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've fucked up bad before too.

It'll get better. 

It's an expensive lesson but if you want to keep trading, especially derivatives, keep this in mind:

Avoid weeklies unless you have the risk tolerance and experience to exit fast.

 For monthlies always try to bake in at least two quarters of ER to save your poorly timed dip buying or whatever other dumb reason you had for opening the position. 

Stick to a handful of tickers you know well and avoid chasing every meme shit under the sun. It's okay to day trade or momentum trade whatever is memeing but just be aware that you're basically gambling vs investing and building your capital/portfolio.

Making gains is actually surprisingly easy (esp in a bull market). Keeping the gains and preserving the capital is actually the hard part. The name of the game is to the preserve the capital and shift risky, short term shit to stuff that will be a bit slower and more steady. Once you get to a comfortable point (eg 100-200k portfolio size), you'll find you actually have more shares/leaps and you'll be able to start doing theta gang shit and build income on top of your still aggressively growing portfolio.

Good luck man. Take a break if you have to, face what went wrong and switch up your trades to avoid the same mistakes."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,People here have no idea how to value companies or what drives the price up or down. They see something they own and they go full retard when someone says it will sky rocket 10 fold. AMD isn't and won't ever be a 1T company. Apple is BARELY at 2T and they dominate the entire smart phone market in many countries. Another guy messaged me saying AMD has better servers yet many corporate programs don't work with AMD CPU's. Their is a reason Intel dominates the market and it's because the ease of use.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"All today‚Äôs GME stock HODLer, the mass of retail-investors, 
a question to all of you:

So far, you just have book profits. Nothing realized yet, only nice to have a look üëÄon.

And all of you long stock holders, you will cash in at a whatever time in the future, remember:

ALL of you are FUTURE SELLERS. 

So, do you think all of you will be able to slip tru the same bottleneck when it comes to cash out time?

As nobody wants to buy your stocks then and you all like to sell to realize the giant book profits, but no bids are probably around and the price will suffer as first sellers change their limit orders to market orders,

you could come in the same position the hedge fund(s) was/were the other way around.


Are you concerned about this fact?
Did you ever think about this particular risk at all?

Happy to read and discuss your concrete answers and/or solutions.

STOCK MARKET
Once upon a time in a village, a man appeared and announced that he would buy monkeys for Rs 10 each.

The villagers went out to the forest and started catching monkeys.The man bought thousands at Rs 10 and as supply started to diminish, the villagers stopped their effort. He further announced that he would now buy at Rs 20.

This renewed the efforts of the villagers and they started catching monkeys again.Soon the supply diminished even further and people started going back to their farms.

The offer rate increased to Rs 25 and the supply of monkeys became so little that it was an effort to even see a monkey, let alone catch one.

The man now announced that he would buy monkeys at Rs 50.However, since he had to go to the city on some business, his assistant would now buy on behalf of him.

In the absence of the man, the assistant told the villagers: Look at all these monkeys in the big cage that the man has collected.I will sell them to you at Rs 35 and when the man returns from the city,you can sell it to him for Rs 50. The villagers squeezed up with all their savings and bought all the monkeys.

Then they never saw the man nor his assistant, only many monkeys everywhere!

2021-03-20 01:08:18,wallstreetbets,"SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON BORROW AVAILABILITY IN GME There has been a lot of very inaccurate and false information being posted about the borrow availability in GME shares. The most common one is that IBorrowdesk (IBKR) is reflective of the total availability of borrow in the marketplace. THIS IS FALSE!!!  iBorrowdesk as well as most other offerings of the same sort from Fido, Schwab etc mostly just show the availability of shares on their platform at that moment in time. Ironically this means the more their clients buy GME on margin the more borrow availability there will be. 

THE REAL BORROW MARKET AVAILABILITY. 

In its most basic form, the largest holders of securities are also the largest lenders of securities. Hate to break it to y‚Äôall but there are a ton of institutional holders of this stock. When an institution such as pension fund, mutual fund insurance company buys GME ( or any other stock for that matter) those shares are held at their custodian. A Custody bank such as JPM, Citi, State Street, BONY aggregates these assets and if the pension fund is in their lending program (most are) those shares are lent to broker dealers. The large broker dealers all have Prime Brokerage groups that custody assets for Hedge Funds. One of the main functions of a Prime Broker is to lend stock to Hedge Funds to short. BDs act as the middle man between the Custody bank and the hedge fund. How does a PB know where to borrow GME you ask?  Easy, the Custody banks broadcast ALL of their stocks available for lending to Broker Dealers. The PBs aggregate this borrow availability from all of the Custody banks and broadcast this information to Hedge Funds. Included in this aggregation would be any positions that are available at the PB from their long clients who purchases those securities on margin. So each day every PB in the market aggregates all of the borrow availability they have access to and broadcasts it to HFS to short. Here‚Äôs the rub. THIS INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE TO THE  GENERAL PUBLIC!!!!!  Securities lending or stock loan is a purposely OPAQUE market. This allows the PBs to keep control over who gets borrow and at what cost.  On that topic of Cost, given that the general public does not have the same access to this information, the COST to  borrow a security can often be a more accurate reflection on borrow availability. Case in point: When GME first squeezed in late January there was ZERO borrow available to short. As such the cost to borrow the security went as high as 200%. Think about that. That high cost is untenable and impossible for a HF to stay short for very long. Obviously they covered a load of stock and the borrow cost came in and availability went back up. 

EVERY BD(PB)‚Äôs ABILITY TO BORROW STOCK IS DIFFERENT 

Think of hard to borrow securities like GME as an allocation of shares in IPO process. Not anyone can rock up and get an allocation of an IPO. The same is true of an allocation of stock borrow on a hard to borrow or ‚Äúspecial‚Äù security like GME. The Custody bank will allocate limited shares of a hard to borrow to those borrowers (BD&PBs) that pay them the most revenue throughout the year. It stands to reason that the largest clients of the custody banks are the largest PBS that have enormous borrow demand. Thus BONY will lend GME to a GS or JPM before lending it to IBKR or Fido (both with very small PB groups). You with me so far???  So let‚Äôs look at the loan side of that transaction. BONY lends GME to GS. Now GS will lend that scarce resource of GME borrow to HF clients that pay them the most revenue throughout the year. Thus GS is more likely to lend GME in this scenario to a Citadel(I know I know), Bridgewater or DE Shaw vs a small 50mmAUM hedge fund. 

CONTROL AND AGGREGATION OF BORROW MARKET AVAILABILITY. 

Although the transparency into stock borrow availability is non existent for individual investors it is vastly different and very transparent to stock borrow participants (CUSTODY BANKS, BD/PBs). The largest stock loan participants have created an industry utility they control that aggregates each participants borrow availability. They submit total shares available for borrow by firm aggregate it all and distribute back to its participants ONLY!!!  So a stock loan trader at one of these firms can simply type in a ticker and see pretty much the entirety of the stock borrow availability as well as the cost!!! Because the BD/PBs & Custidy banks control this information they reveal only a subset to non participants such as the actual long holder (Pension plan, Mutual fund) and Hedge Funds. This is a main reason why large HFs have multiple PBs. Because everyone‚Äôs stock borrow capability is different, they want access to as many avenues to borrow stock as possible. 

The only way for an individual to anywhere close to an accurate number of borrow availability would be to call each of the large PBs and ask for the info. Obviously this is not going to happen. I happen to know several stock loan participants very well and can tell you that there are MILLIONS OF SHARES OF GME TO BORROW RIGHT NOW AND FOR THE PAST MONTH!!!!!  

Given that, the best indicator of whether or not there is a lot of borrow is the COST to borrow which is more readily available through your BD. Even if they aren‚Äôt showing you availability they probably still show the cost to borrow. Generally speaking, any cost to borrow below 10% implies there is borrow available. At .5% it is virtually a LIQUID or ‚ÄúGC‚Äù (general collateral) borrow. A further reference point would be RKT which squeezed several weeks ago. There was Very little to no borrow availability as evidenced by its 30% borrow cost at the time. 

Don‚Äôt even get me started on the availability of shares for retail to short. I generally DO NOT recommend retail investors going short. It is a sure fire way to go broke. That said even though your broker may show you ZERO borrow to go short, I GUARANTEE they are giving availability to their HF clients.   

Hope that helps. It does feel fairly rigged at times given the lack of borrow market transparency. I just hate to think individuals are drawing the wrong conclusions because iBorrow or their BD is showing no borrow. In the case of GME this has been the case all day today. Rest assured THERE ARE MILLIONS OF GME SHARES AVAILABLE TO SHORT."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe if we just had the market requirement that this data was published just a clearly as volume this wouldn‚Äôt be an issue.  There‚Äôs no reason it shouldn‚Äôt be right under a ticker summary.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's been a bit irritating watching people use iborrow to determine the exact volume that gets shorted for each ""short attack"" when there are so many other lenders when I see them write DD.

Some questions I'd like to ask:

What are the other main factors that determine how much the fee is?  

For example price of market security, demand and availability right?  Right now the demand is not high because someone is keeping the price stable at this time, and I'm sure they are worried about adding more fuel into the fire if the short is worried about getting caught in a trap.  Or as shorts, they may need to launch it at a rally or during an attempt at a squeeze, so they are keeping the availability of borrowed shares as high as they can to counter so they don't get margin called with what shorts they have remaining.

If you check the borrow fee for GME history, even when it was shorted at >100% in August 2020, the Borrow rate was only 4% when it was <5 dollars for a good month until it needed to borrow more.  This is much less than the current borrow fee x borrow rate.  The borrow rate x borrow price is 5 times greater right now than when it shorted at >100% in august during a lull period.

There are temporary increases during that time that brought it to 20-60% - likely when the short demand was even more high because they wanted to keep the price down during catalysts, but the % fee does not tell us how short a stock is, we as retailers don't get that information.  But I'm sure the longs whales/institutions have a much better idea than us, and they are still in the game trying to do something.  There is a ton of buying power and manipulation going on in GME, and retailers do not have that level of execution to do it.

Understandably, there are millions of shares still left as some have covered, but there is still a considerable short position - with a lot of other things that need to be taken into account - FTD's, hiding FTD's with OTC options, etc.  Someone is under fire still - Just take that drop from 350 down to 200.  No one overwhelms a buy side with millions of shares in minutes to make money.  If they wanted to make money, they would have sold it slowly over time.  Someone who is under fire wanted to either create panic for others to sell or tank the price because of fear of a Margin call, etc."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the post. All day people spamming ‚Äúonly 100 shares left to short‚Äù and I‚Äôm losing my mind thinking there‚Äôs no way in hell we‚Äôre down to a mere 100. I can‚Äôt understand why people get hyped and post bullshit they know nothing about... oh wait, never mind."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What are your thoughts about the theory that ETFs are being used to short GME? I would assume it would not be close to the amount of shorts needed to suppress the stock price.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,How does this explain over half the volume everyday for a month is shorts?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The lending of shares, must be stopped.  If they want to lend it and benefit they should own the shares.  If it's retailers, pension funds, or any funds with clients money in there, shares should be illegal to lend out with out explicit consent.

Think about what is going on here, let's say you put 10000 in your safety deposit box and bank takes it out and lends it out with out your consent.  People will goto jail, but now that type of thing is one of major business in financial industry.  

&#x200B;

2 reasons, why this is happening.   First, majority people don't know about it and think that it doesn't matter to them.  Well it does, it leaves room for manipulation, alters price by increasing supply of shares.  People don't want their shares lent out period, this concept only works when the owner doesn't know.  Second, billions are made to turn a blind eye to unconsentful.  Money is trumping common sense behind doors.  When I explain to normal people that your shares (either via your pension fund, brokers, or mutual fund) are lent out, they are furious.  That is the modern day scam.   Policy makes need to stop this immediately instead of talking non sense during the Zoom meeting."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for this. So excited to know there are MILLIONS OF SHARES BEING OFFERED AT A DISCOUNT COMING OUR WAY!!

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed. BDs push back on that level of transparency hiding behind the excuse that publishing even the raw data would be them divulging their clients info. Really a BS excuse to keep the market opaque.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not sure I follow the ‚Äúunder fire‚Äù comments. The price to borrow is simply what HFS are willing to pay at any point in time. Supply and demand. Too pricey and they‚Äôll cover. Sure, there is still a large SI. Many stocks have this. The comment about hiding FTDs with options don‚Äôt hold up over time especially nit now when the SEC is breathing down the neck of ever BD in this name. Trust me, nothing fishy is going on with the borrow now. 100% above board. I‚Äôm not saying there wasn‚Äôt some sketchy stuff going on 2 months ago but definitely not now. The whole conspiracy angle is just wrong. It makes for good WSB banter to rally the troops but ultimately it‚Äôs dangerous disinformation"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Word
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs why I posted. It was driving me mad. Many people believe that actually meant something. 80% of what is posted to justify holding GME is misguided and dangerous.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I am not a fan of that theory. Makes little sense to short an ETF which only has a portion of its components invested in GME when there are plenty(millions) of shares in GME to borrow cheaply. My whole point is that too many people are looking to short interest and borrow stats as the MAIN reason to squeeze the stock. While this was very relevant and the cause of the squeeze in January it is no longer relevant now. I‚Äôm not saying you shouldn‚Äôt hold the stock if your doing solely based on borrow dynamics that is flawed
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Correct. They are big fans of securities lending. They are also a huge lender of international securities which up until recently were lent to effect dividend arbitrage strategies(massive problem in Europe. Google Cum-Ex scandal if you are interested and have a day to kill).
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What this OP said is legit though. None of it is FUD.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs normal. What‚Äôs your point?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"While I agree that most people don‚Äôt understand who the biggest lenders of stock are, it‚Äôs not that simple. A big reason why fees at etfs and mutual funds are so low is because of securities lending. If you did a side by side comparison of two identical funds one lending their portfolio and the other not lending, there would be a substantial drag on the non lending portfolio. 

When a fund lends its fully disclosed in its prospectus. 99% of people don‚Äôt read it. 

Additionally, and here is the real eye opener, anyone who is long GME in a margin account and utilizing that leverage is lending their shares to hedge funds. It‚Äôs in the margin agreement we all sign. A BD has the right to ‚Äúrehypothecate‚Äù up to 140% of the margin debit. In this scenario the long holder is not compensated for lending their shares."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"One additional point id make regarding lending of shares: a big reason why there is commission free trading is because of securities lending. If you look at the revenue of online BDs such as Robinhood and others, aside from payment for order flow ( which is talked about incessantly) revenue derived from lending out your shares at these BDs is a huge and meaningful number. Why do you think MS bought ETrade. This was a big reason!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,All I‚Äôm saying is that there have been a ton of people saying that there is no more borrow available and inferring that the hedge funds are trapped. It‚Äôs the opposite. There are millions of shares available.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Ya....ü¶ç Will just HODL
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah free markets my ass LOL!  I 100% back the invisible hand but we don‚Äôt have full information for all market participants in so many ways.  I wish a purely technical economist would take a sledgehammer to the capital markets but one can only dream.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Markets today are all data driven. More so than ever. HFs and BDs demand transparency and data from their counterparts and trading partners. Retail and individual investors do not have anywhere close to the same data.  SEC & FINRA know this but are staffed by fired wallstreeters who are cozy with the firms they ‚Äúregulate‚Äù
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The hiding FTD's with OTC options was brought up in the congressional meeting along with a lot of the other shady things that was being done that we retailers can't see.

And by someone under fire, I meant some institution likely has a position that is in danger, and someone is at risk of losing a lot of money.  Otherwise they wouldn't have thrown millions of shares away last Wednesday to tank the price."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good ape, you are done for the day. Come back tomorrow for more tips and üçåüçåüçå"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,why are the interest rates so low? 0.5% no?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Just curious why so much effort to suppress the price if there's no more squeeze potential.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"And is high availability good or bad for GME? Don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôm not going to sue you. You seemed knowledgeable, just want a neutral opinion."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,If it was brought up by the legislators on the panel I wouldn‚Äôt give it too much credence. They know less about this stuff than the average WSB  member. There is an element of truth to FTDs and using option strategies to satisfy the requirement. However it‚Äôs WAY overblown and used as a catch all reason by WSB
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Because there aren‚Äôt that many shares short anymore so demand for borrow isn‚Äôt that high.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Block me dude. You won‚Äôt be subjected to any facts. Enjoy.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,If there is no more squeeze potential that is exactly why short sellers would look to suppress the stock
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"High availability means there is less likelihood of a January type ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù. In January there was no borrow to short shares when it squeezed. Shorts were genuinely trapped. The only thing that saved them was RH and other restricting buys. But that situation was always going to resolve itself. A violent squeeze like that always reverts back. DFV is being deservedly commended for exploiting what was the perfect storm of technical events: Crazy high SI, zero borrow, insanely high cost to borrow, Tons of genuine buying interest from WSB crowd. RH restricting trading was the piece that killed it. But be aware it would have broken at some point. Most of those same contributors to a squeeze are no longer in place. I‚Äôm not saying it couldn‚Äôt squeeze but plenty of hFs won‚Äôt be taken by surprise again. Fool me once..."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Since there's essentially no chance for a short squeeze (let me know if you disagree), any thoughts on a potential gamma squeeze? I'm curious how many more spikes we will see before it settles back to a more ""reasonable"" price"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't trust any 1 mo accounts. Too risky. Especially with the shady bans recently. Stick to the OGs. No idea what this guy's really about.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£. Fuck I knew I‚Äôd get stuck here. Where‚Äôs all the üñçüíéüôåüèªü¶çüöÄüåùüï∫üèªüé∂üíÉüöÇüé¢ I‚Äôm outta here before you guys take all my karma.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Nobody wants to hear this but ... the market doesn‚Äôt lie.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets, A gamma squeeze is certainly a more likely scenario vs a classic short squeeze. That said I‚Äôm not an options expert. Either way both would be very short lived if they happen.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,user name checks out
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Makes sense. What has buoyed the price to stay around $200 for so long? No prob if you're not sure, just trying to soak up info where I can around here."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So instead of letting a stock naturally find it's place and then shorting it. The law allows vultures with no real use in society to drain money from investors and cripple businesses alike. Weird. Unless they suck citadel off then they probably won't be shorted I'm guessing.
2021-03-20 01:04:54,wallstreetbets,I heard a lot about this $UWMC and I like it. $30K YOLO

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,If you read up on it and didn't figure out why it's good then you probably should just invest in some mutual funds until you gain a ton more knowledge or you're gonna get cleaned out. Definitely paper trade first
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It already crashed from $14.38. I am expecting it to go somewhere around $10-$11 this month.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you sell all your shares?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I just found out the stock is not being added to either of the russell indices. Best example of why I prefer to buy leaps. Monday is gonna be rough.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I have 30 12.5C for 4/16. Gonna need some volume to get this heavy boy off the couch and on a god damn run.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"lmao no. I bought at 26, sold at 42, then I bought back in now at 24 because of the great news surrounding them. They are crushing UWM, tons of brokers going to deal only with Rocket now - and thats only because of UWM's retarded ultimatium. The dividend payout is also soon, which means a lot of people are going to reinvest into it. It's a great short term play aswell as long. 

Feel free to hold the bag in UWM, this is obviously just my opinion and not financial advice."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought at $8.78 not exorbitantly high. 52 weeks low is 7.24.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, jobs suck! A $200 average still sounds in-the-money to me. Anything less than a $25B  market cap (~$400 / share) in light of recent events is just stupid for this company. I think it could reach $1,000 / share in the next 1-5 years. Of course, I am just speculating at this point, and you should do your own homework.  

You can't lose, in my opinion, if you just hold and lower your average aggressively. How do you do that? Save up a bunch of cash and sit on it. When, and if the price falls below $100, buy that shit. I am personally looking for $50-$80 for my next buy. You'll be fine if you don't panic and sell for a loss."
2021-03-20 00:57:32,wallstreetbets,"GME & AMC APES (MUST READ) Not a financial advice.
Dear Apes,
What you just witnessed with AMC at the last 2 minutes of the market close, was horrible. We get back at them by selling our shares at extreme prices for both GME and AMC, so the Hf and their traders looses everything, their Manhattan penthouse, their chauffeured Bentley, their Michelin star chefs and regret their whole lives thinking a bunch of apes, turned their whole lives upside down. 
That‚Äôs the price I want for 2008, for apes holding these stocks, their mental fatigue, all the sleepless nights, their kids, family, house, medical, students at schools. This is enough.
I do insist all the day traders and investors to make money through other stocks and dump in these stocks, take help from your fellow friends, apes help each other make money by holding and making each other get their desired prices. Us divided is what they are praying on, imagine us united will make those big boys piss their pants, they are 1% cause we have our money invested in their companies. Their ability to manipulate, cheat and bend the rules to their will, I say that‚Äôs enough. We have seen enough, I am humbled, but really pissed. Today a lot of my fellow apes have options OTM and who is responsible the HF, the powerful institutions and financial market caretakers are doing nothing about it. Who is suffering us, us retail investors and traders. 
Look out for each other, all our lives we have competed with one another making money out of each other, this is the one time we can make the money off the 1% I say we take it. Win or loose is upto god, but not trying will be on us. 
It‚Äôs not the end of your life even a day can change your life, be positive, relax and trust the path you have chosen for yourselves. 
I myself own 180@14 AMC and 80@230 GME shares, keeping some money to buy more, I am trying and hoping for the best.  
Hold and buy if possible don‚Äôt loose hope not now, not when things might go our way for once in life.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Sold directly to another algo... timed perfectly at perfect price.
2021-03-20 00:52:59,wallstreetbets,"NAPA went public. It's the perfect stock Winemaker Duckhorn ($NAPA) went public on 3/18/21 ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-18/napa-valley-winemaker-duckhorn-rises-after-300-million-ipo](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-18/napa-valley-winemaker-duckhorn-rises-after-300-million-ipo)). Very rare for winemakers to go public.

This is the perfect stonk and I have been doing some DD over the last few years before they even thought about going public.

Their product is great üç∑üç∑üç∑. No idea about the financial details but here are the two scenarios I see:

**Scenario 1**

The stonk goes up üöÄüöÄüöÄ. You are happy and can buy expensive wine without feeling guilty üç∑üç∑üç∑. After all the wine paid for itself with the gainz. Stonk goes up more and you can buy more wine. It‚Äôs a self feeding circle.

**Scenario 2**

The stonk goes down üò≥. You are sad for a moment and drown your sorrows in some wine üç∑üç∑üç∑. The more it dropped that day, the more wine you have to drink and buy. That helps the company and the stonk will go up again üöÄüöÄüöÄ.

Disclaimer for Scenario 2: Stonks usually don‚Äôt go down, so this is more a theoretical case. As of this writing NAPA has never closed at a loss üöÄüöÄüöÄ.

**The greeks**

I studied the Greeks as well. They love wine. So no showstopper there either in case you‚Äôre into options. And good wine becomes more valuable when you hold, so no danger from theta here.

**The squeeze scenario**

They squeeze grapes for about 1.4M cases of wine per year \[1\]. That is 16.8M bottles. r/wallstreetbetscurrently has 9.6M Degenerates. If everyone buys two bottles that‚Äôd be 114% of the yearly supply (aka float). That‚Äôs enough to make the price (of the wine) skyrocket as all the fancy restaurants scramble to get their demand filled (usually only about 39% go to retail investors like us \[2\]). That will then make the stock go to the moon üöÄüöÄüöÄ.

Now you can diamond hand üíéüôåüíéüôå the wine and the stock and make double the money.

**TLDR**

Stonk goes red, drink more red until stonk goes green, then drink more red.

PS: This is not financial advice. Drink responsibly. Don‚Äôt drink and drive.

PPS: I own 30 stocks and a bottle of wine. Planning to buy more.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I went in the day after they went public. I live in San Francisco. Believe me when I say loads of bitches also go and drink wine at every winery up there, every weekend. Duckhorn owns a nice one. . They‚Äôre all starting to open up now. Everyone is going to go wine tasting in Napa Valley. This is a no brainer."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Scenario for, everybody thinks they're investing in Napa Auto Parts and the stock goes up"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love wine. Duckhorn is pretty good.

However, I think this is a terrible investment, right now. Wine was lost on a lot of Gen X, and companies still haven't figured out how to market wine to millennials, even though they seem to be on board with wine and may even to prefer it to other alcohol types.

Duckhorn's S1 filing is focused on DTC and standard sales channels. Maybe with this cash, Duckhorn will figure it out, but I think that's 2-3 years out before we see real growth. And 10x sales is too pricey with 10% sales growth, for a business that has to deal with rising temperatures affecting product quality. And that's hoping no natural disasters occur."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought a bunch just because of it's ticker name. Real DD.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Used to work in fine dining in Oregon. Duckhorn has a great reputation and I have seen lots of wealthy people spend hundreds a bottle on the stuff and love it. Sold great by the glass, too. I might have to bite."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That particular NAPA is owned by Genuine Parts Co. (GPC).
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I work with local winemakers in Mendocino County, CA and some of the best nuanced wines are getting pressed at 4.5/4.0 degrees brix to get the seeds out since the good skin tannins extract at lower levels of alcohol, but once a typical red that got harvested around 24-25 has fermented to the aforementioned range the alcohol starts leeching the seeds which are bitter as fuck. Letting it dry out the rest of the way in stainless is the way."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The jig's up when people realize cheap wine and expensive wine taste the same.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is why I love this sub. We hold
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I imagine pressing at 4 bricks you have to saignee half the juice  to get the proper skin to juice ratio, more skins would mean more skin extraction faster, with less time (thus avoiding seed breakdown).  Since you're foregoing extended skin contact. I think you may have just inspired my next Cab! The downside is you're pouring money down the drain... Or you make a shitty ros√©.

The alcohol seed extraction gets  even worse when Napa and Sonoma are harvesting at 27 + brix...then they just de-alc it which strips even more of the flavors you want. Not to mention the 5 micron filters that they're using, Duckhorn included. 

I love that I can find fellow wine industry peeps in WSB. I won't be buying $NAPA, as a winemaker, this is not the direction I want to see the industry going."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a class thing dude
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Okay might want to check the data cause that's not what's happening right now. Sure it could change but habits like wine die hard.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"One of my friends was slowing fermentation down in the barn, which was kept in the low 50s since he was fermenting in macro bins with covers and doing manual punch downs for skin extraction. It helped get more love from the skins into the wine, and for a cab franc, it had a nice texture"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way. Exactly how I made my 2018 Pinot. Slow and cool.

Of course I could be completely wrong but the sentiment on this sub rn that you have to wait to end of day to exercise your 'tract goes against anything and everything I've learned about options. 
  
Maybe EOD is super more important for options sellers? But I can't wrap my fucking brain around people having an ITM contract at 1:45pm-2pm (especially if they have capital) and then being like ""better wait til 4..."""

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Calls are hedged as price fluctuates so you stay delta neutral.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, you're pretty much totally wrong. It's because calls have time value and are almost always worth more than execution until right at the close. A $200 itm call at the peak of today would probably be worth $3000 ($30/share) which is more than what you would get from exercising and immediately selling, especially because you selling will inherently bring the price of the stock down with you as a sure thing."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,ok i‚Äôm sorry dad
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If that happened they would restrict buying, not selling"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Im seeing a lot of sentiment about closing over $200, specifically at EOD, being the ""target"" of today, especially for call holders. It's really throwing me.
  
Like, you can exercise your option or sell it for profit at any time. I mean okay sure you might just being selling it back to Citadel intern's but meh...
  
I basically picked your comment to attach to and complain on because you said ""delta neutral"" and that makes me think you are smart ü¶ß üçå"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bruh we're saying the same thing. I'm spouting off *against* people waiting until the last minute to exercise or sell their options. 
  
In the context of Call Options holders at the 200 level. On march 19th 2021 the absolutely best deal you could get was either selling or exercising when that üêã (I assume) spiked the price to 227. Not only would your option be profitable on IV alone, exercising at 227 is probably at or above the B/E price. 
  
What I *DONT* understand, is the sentiment on this sub about the price of GME needing to close over 200. In terms of options, those contracts should have been sold (or exercised) way before 4pm...unless people holding them from 2pm to 4pm yesterday love slowly hemorrhaging money.
  
I was trying to justify these thought processes by thinking maybe options sellers hold end of day in higher esteem. But it still doesn't make sense. And it REALLY doesn't make sense for 200c holders to have anything that looks like an open contract post 2pm ish yesterday.
  
Edit: For personal context: I sold my call on GME weeks ago because I'm a little bitch boy. Still made profit tho."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Most options don't get exercised.  They get sold for the profit.  If no one is there to buy it and hope for his turn at a profit, a MM buys it to close it out.  Then the MM can release his shares that were hedging a different (or the exact same) option that he sold previously because they're fungible.

Which kind of blows up the theory on options forcing the hand on Monday/Tuesday.  Sure, some guys have enough options they can sell some and exercise the rest.  But if you don't have the cash to buy the shares, the MM doesn't have to deliver any shares.  For any option ITM on dte0, the delta is close to 1 which means the hedge is 100 shares.  They should have already been purchased from the market prior to 4 pm on Friday."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"We're in half agreeance. I agree with you that people shouldn't wait until the last minute to sell their options. I still don't agree that they should exercise them early. Either way, you're speaking with the hindsight knowledge of being able to time the exact peak and dips of a day's movement. 

I don't personally agree with holding an option with only 2 hours left, but I can **understand** the sentiment that this is obviously a volatile stock that can move upwards of $30 within an hour. It moved from $190 to almost $230 just from 11:40 to 12:40, so I can understand the idea that someone might hold on to a call in the hopes of it moving from $210 which was it's 2 pm price to $250 within the span of an hour too. 

Also like you said the act of closing barely over 200 does shit for itm 200 calls. No one will realistically exercise them if it's barely 27 cents itm at close. The point is to render the 200 puts worthless, which has massive volume and is mostly bought by Melvin Capital as a way to obtain real shares without having to go through the market."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right but with PFOF, RH and the MM get to decide if your shares mean anything. Hunt: they don't unless you sell because they make money on the fractional differences. That's the real issue. When you don't pay for something, you're the product either way."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,i expected apes; my family
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You don‚Äôt even have to look at a 1 month to have a trailing stop. Diamond nuts all the way back to under 100!

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well this may be the first time one of my 3 paragraph responses produced a 3 paragraph reply that I was very much okay with reading. I definitely am using hindsight to my advantage and that 20/20 vision is like Ben Steins private stash.
  
I guess I'd like to haughtily believe I'd exercise at 227 but I'd probably hold on and play the spike too in the moment."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre missing the point.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"We're attacking RH. Not you.

And if you choose to be ignorant and selfish, because you fail to listen to those attacks...

You literally can't expect to be immune from criticism.

RH failing to fulfil their margin call for $3bn is probably the only reason we're even having this conversation and instead not talking about our millions.

They're continuing to hold us back by not buying shares in real time."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok now what would you have put a trailing stop at to have grabbed that peak... quick give me a number without looking at the price history
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I love you too. This is always the way.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Dudes been in since $94. Don't think buying shares in realtime is really an issue in this case.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Even a 10% trailing stop would‚Äôve given a sell limit around 310. You know what a trailing stop is right?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the [whey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whey)
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I do know what a trailing stop is. Next question. Edit: actually what do YOU think the price is one week from today?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I can‚Äôt give an exact price because I can‚Äôt predict the future but it‚Äôs more likely that it goes to 100 than 300. The squeeze happened when it went from 150 to 350 in 3 days
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is it more likely to go to a price that it hasn‚Äôt been at in 2 weeks than a price it was at this Monday? You can‚Äôt predict the future but you seem to be going with the less likely outcome because it confirms your biases.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"!RemindMe 7 days

**Sharpe Ratio**

Per Investopedia, the Sharpe ratio ""is used to help ~~investors~~ retards understand the return of ~~an investment~~ a 401k YOLO compared to its risk.Ôªø The ratio is the average return earned in excess of the risk-free rate per unit of volatility or total risk. Conceptually, what this provides is a measurement of the portfolio‚Äôs outperformance per unit of the portfolio‚Äôs volatility.""

Check my math here: [https://imgur.com/a/tV1eRlV](https://imgur.com/a/tV1eRlV)

Please correct me if I did this wrong or I'll fail my class, but this shows that YTD, the portfolio's (100% GME diversification) performance has outperformed the volatility or risk associated with it. No idea where it's going next week but GME having a +5% Sharpe ratio, a professional risk measurement formula, is off the charts for what is considered good.

What you‚Äôre doing isn‚Äôt a useless exercise. What you‚Äôll learn is how common decision making measures break down/don‚Äôt work when assumptions are broken.

I'm note sure what this means, could be a whale trying to push the price above 200$ because of important option strike prices or the execution of thousands of options. Probably the latter.

Edit: GMT+1 time zone if you wondered.

Edit 2: This happened to almost every stock, so it's nothing abnormal. I was just a bit spooked to see that. Should've investigated further..

Edit 3: I hope that this is in some way still a very bullish sign for $GME. Smarter apes will surely tell us everything we need to know."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If Melvins still in, I‚Äôm in!!!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I see you are using Tradingview. How do you seperate the volume indicator like this?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I had a buy that went through in the last 30 sec at 200.58 (At market) just before the dip below 200, then this jump back to 200.27"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"That makes sense. 

What's your view on the AMC spike of the same time for 45 m volume (around a third of the days total volume)? Just an aggregate of a lot of people making market close buy/sells? 

I'm fairly sure that's what it is given the timing and lack of any other explanation, but it's an abnormally high number."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Ya did gud!!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Genuinely serious, I'm all for GME mooning but why is closing above 200 a good thing? What would closing below that do?"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks! Im just now trying to look into stocks and such and it feels like i jumped from the high dive into the deep end.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, but apes also don‚Äôt hold the majority of the float. Still hedges fighting eachother long and short. One hedge said fuck this I‚Äôm out and dumped around 1m shares in a few sweep trades

Has more to do with the fact that AMC equity fair value right now is $1 short term and $0 long term. Even if they had 100% earnings increase YOY for 5 years they still wouldn‚Äôt be able to get close to paying stockholders equity back to even $0 let alone get it positive"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"No I mean I appreciate your explanation of what it is. Not OP's post. I also appreciate your anger and it's direction. I just want you to know I appreciate the explanation, as an aside. Thanks."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah so they‚Äôre reporting tick by tick by tick by tick. There‚Äôs obviously a million of them and you can‚Äôt *actually* watch in real time it‚Äôs moving too fast esp with dark pools. The ‚Äúlast print‚Äù that they catch right before the closing auction print might be different between different sites. It doesn‚Äôt matter though. The NYSE auction print is the official close. That‚Äôs why you might see website X say $200.19 and website Y say $200.04 then they both change to the official close of $200.27.

People need to understand the closing auction actually eliminates fuckery it doesn‚Äôt add to it. If the ‚Äúclosing price‚Äù that determined whether your options would be in the money just happened to be whatever printed at 3:59:59:59 or 4:00:00:00 that would encourage a LOT of shenanigans right? But the auction lines up a bunch of buy and sell orders and crosses them where supply and demand meet thus it can‚Äôt really be manipulated."

I once left the risotto alone for 10 minutes and it burned the hell out of the rice, then my dad made me stand outside in the freezing cold while he beat me senseless with a set of jumper cables.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Discovered the main reason IBKR has the lowest margin interest is because they also have the most aggressive auto-liquidation/risk management.. and it's just algo based so i don't even think a human actually reviews your positions and decides what the best way to get out of margin call would be to take the least amount of loss. I'm happy to pay more considering my broker gives me usually 2 days notice for margin calls... unless it's a hopelessly large amount.

Ppl who are laughing at cathie have no idea, back in 2016 when tesla stock was trading at 200 pre-split she had predicted tsla stock ( base case ) will be 4000 by 2024. Last month in 2021 itself tsla stock was trading at 800 ( post split which is 4000 ).

Her etf has outperformed for last 5 years.

Tsla will start the cybertruck production by this year end. Autonomous taxi, cybertruck revenue, New 25k car within next 2 years, which will bring huge revenues for tsla along with new factories in India which is a huge space for tsla considering the demand for the cars ova there & also never forget abt tsla insurance.

The same cnbc so called intelligent analyst who were laughing at cathie in 2016 were made to look like a fool.

Cathie is right at this one. 

Imagine with the new battery cells, a 25k car for indian market, how much revenue that will bring & also worldwide."

but you can't ignore that amc is burning 365m a quarter, only has 1.0b in cash,  27% of it's revenue is from international markets, and they are betting people are going back to the movies rapidly after vaccination roll outs/ landlords reducing rent / studios won't release straight to streaming services.

I mean this is all laid out in the 10k from December  but folks are so delusional lol

She thinks Tesla‚Äôs HUMAN ride share (not autonomous) will have 2x the earnings of Uber and Lyft combined by 2025. Apparently twice as many people will be taking ride share by 2025 and every single one of them will be using Tesla‚Äôs app instead of the ones they‚Äôre accustomed to.

For reference, Tesla doesn‚Äôt even fucking have a ride sharing program yet.

Cathie is unbelievably stupid.

Her other valuations are hilarious as well. Tesla is apparently, at the ‚Äúbear case‚Äù going to be making $23 billion in insurance revenue by insuring their own cars. For reference, Geico, a global insurer of more than one brand of vehicle, who has been in the insurance game for 80 years, made only $35 billion in 2019

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC was barely a good price at $4 let alone $14. They literally just posted something like a 90% decline in revenue and the stock shot up
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wave.  Movie theaters are dead and/or dying at best.  

Real talk, movies are going directly to streaming in a major way.  I personally much prefer to do this than go to the theater because I can eat/drink whatever I want, the seats are always perfect, and I can watch at my leisure instead of on a schedule.  Even the picture at most movie theaters can no longer compare to quality of an average tv.  Literally no benefit unless you love that experience, which I know some do but most do not, I think."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"bro the company was already declining for years before covid, and was nearly bankrupt all of 2 months ago and still has shit sales, you should absolutely not buy it at $14, plus they have done share offerings so many times and there's nothing stopping them from doing it again (which they logically should) which would tank the price."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can you afford 100 shares?  You can write a deep OTM call three months out, use the credit to buy a put closer to the money one month out, that way you aren't nickel and diming yourself by buying puts with your own cash.  If it goes down, sell the put and buy back the call for cheaper and extract some cash from the drop, and if it runs up just let the shares get yanked at a profit if it's over the strike of the call you wrote"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your kidneys can't process filtrate, basically blood before its converted to urine, that fast. It's relatively fast but not that fast. There is a hormone that's released that gets you to urinate in response to having too much liquid on your blood but I don't think there's ever a scenario where you could take urinate equal parts.

 If you could, You'd prob die from peeing out all the stuff your body needs to keep such as electrolytes, ions, and water. Your kidneys filter that material back into your blood in tubes called nephrons before it ultimately winds up as urine. I don't think at that rate of stream your kidneys would have the ability retain those materials and you'd probably die."

This will end badly for all brokers that continue to do it. Checked [https://www.tdameritrade.com/td-ameritrade-trading-restrictions-stocks.page](https://www.tdameritrade.com/td-ameritrade-trading-restrictions-stocks.page) and ""- There are no limitations on long calls and long puts for these stocks."" What BS, blatent lies on the page

EDIT: that was yesterday and my post got deleted. Finally got through to trade desk via phone - Kevin trader - put it through and worked although options price was 20% higher. He said somebody TDA screwed up and put the restriction in for GME when it was meant for RKT ?????? What a bunch of bull. These guys are all a RICO case waiting for the US Attorney for the Southern District of NY if he had any balls

Update - tried to change price on the order the trade desk put through - rejected -- ""hard to borrow"" even though it's the same trade!

Today, 19th, 3:43pm EDT, closing only again.  Would have doubled my money in 5 min but no only Citadel can do that. Stock had just gone from 214 to 201 in the past hour

If MMs or HFs want to move GME to any number - not just 200 or 199.99 - they can do that with the click of a mouse. It's nothing. Really we're just along for the ride at this point.

The people here (reddit) are not **Institutions**... or **Hedge Fund Managers**... and the remaining 21% which INCLUDES **Insiders** (like Ryan Cohen etc...) so the remaining **Individuals** (the people on Reddit) are a very small percentage of the overall float. It's hilarious there are so many salty redditors downvoting this but it's the truth. Only morons wonder why GME sometimes moves with AMC/KOSS etc or why it sat at $49 until deciding to breakout. It wasn't retail that moved it, but the rest of the players gladly moved GME to bring in retail FOMOers and greedy people. Today they dropped it exactly where they wanted to make a bunch of options over $200 expire worthless... it's all a game and people here are just too gullible to think they are controlling any of it.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"**Exactly the way it should be!**

The government‚Äôs‚Äô job is to protect people‚Äôs rights. **Not** to baby sit dipshits who can‚Äôt bother to- spend a day reading investorpedia to absorb the most basic concepts of investing. 

Nobody including the fucking government gives a single flying fuck if I walk into a casino with every cent I‚Äôve ever made and put it all on green on the roulette table. Oh but GOD FUCKING FORBID I make more than 3 day trades in five days. Because now I‚Äôm a menace to the economy and a danger to myself because I don‚Äôt have a rich daddy who can buy me 25K worth of ‚Äúinvesting experience.‚Äù"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm selling covered calls and buying more
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I sold June 40 cc and used the $4k in premium to buy more shares
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is basically my strategy. I have 6-7 stocks in different industries (tech, housing, coin, oil) and every other week put a few hundred in each. It's not much but it adds up."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"My brokerage charges quite a bit per transaction, so I can only buy in bigger amounts to try to reduce my costs :( otherwise I would follow you and invest a few hundred at a time."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs not an accusation; they openly admit it. It‚Äôs even in their customer agreement. They can do whatever they want, whenever they want, if they perceive it as a risk to their business. Having GME moon poses a huge counter party risk......Worse part is that there isn‚Äôt much that a customer can do about it. Call them yourself if you want, I was amazed by how open they were."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,no they didnt.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol ‚Äúwhy would someone just lie on the Internet?!!?!‚Äù
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Post audio file or ban.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah you're right, nobody in their right mind would get on the internet and just lie."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Keep in mind that leverage works both ways; so don‚Äôt risk more than you can afford to lose; and look for options with high liquidity / tight spreads so you can get out of the trade if needed. Also, most brokerages will auto exercise, so if you don‚Äôt want to own the shares over the weekend; be sure to advise your brokerage ahead of market close. Happy trading"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have a cash account with level 2 approval. Same as you. TDA has always allowed me to trade 0DTE, with the exception of GME recently. I would call TDA and see what the issue is.

&#x200B;

Good luck!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Interactive Brokers halted GME trading same day as RH. Their CEO even went on CNBC to say they halted it because they didn't like the price and admitted if the brokers didn't do something the price would have shot into the thousands. 

I've used them before, but I won't after what they did. Far worse than the bullshit TD is pulling - I have accounts with both."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They did however send a extremely vague notification about ‚Äútrading restrictions‚Äù without actually specifying what those restrictions were. During trading hours. It took me finding out from Reddit what those restrictions were because TDA wasn‚Äôt telling.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can confirm. Have TDA, and bought the dip back in Jan"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe they stopped buying if you already had more than 25 shares or something.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That's right . I unfortunitly bought some.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was long GME in Jan and while they technically didn't restrict trading on GME options, they did shut it down online and require their customers to phone in their orders to the trading desk.  When you phone in, you're on hold for 2-4 hours and your entry price is long gone.  I just wanted to sell some covered calls and I was essentially prevented from doing so while the premiums and IV were at their highest levels."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"So I wonder how much RH is getting paid for this from citadel vs ally. I‚Äôll have to look at RH‚Äôs 606 forms‚Ä¶another rabbit hole‚Ä¶

So, I don‚Äôt understand why is apex getting payment for order flow‚Ä¶ and from where/whom‚Ä¶

Ally seems to say they use Apex as the clearing house but I don‚Äôt know what % of orders actually go through them directly. 

Anyways. Seems like this clearinghouse is also getting paid for orderflow ‚Ä¶ so these orders‚Ä¶what % of these orders come from which companies??


 This all seems suspicious to me. Disclaimer - I don‚Äôt want to spread FUD, only want transparency. We deserve that. ESP. After 2008.  I don‚Äôt know if the ongoing hypothesis I‚Äôm thinking of in my head is necessarily valid.  Someone needs to check my work here though because I could be wrong. 

Long day. Cheers"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I call bullshit though.

Literally.

RETAIL OWNS 5M SHARES? YOU WHAT?

THAT MEANS THE AVERAGE WSBER OWNS 0.5 SHARES. THAT'S JUST WSB.

THERE IS RETAIL OUTSIDE OF WSB TOO.

LOOOOOOL"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Interesting thanks. Wouldn't the rest of institutions not want to also take advantage of the HFs that are exposed so even if retail is not the prime mover they will still benefit from the squeeze?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look at your own chart you‚Äôre sharing lmfao, it‚Äôs more than what you‚Äôve been spamming in comments. ***rEaD iT aNd WeEp sUcKa***"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah all these ""things to protect us"" are just ways to protect donors. 

I started day trading, lost a lot, learned, regained it, and am a decent trader now. I don't need someone babysitting me from DC."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice. America's biggest security is their home so I feel it's safer... Mortgage companies made it through 2008
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you in America?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,LOL; good point....I just meant that there‚Äôs nothing for me to gain by putting the info out there.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the info. I will give them a call because like I said any time I've tried to open 0DTE it is always rejected even on other stocks. Only other explanation I can think of is if they had restrictions on those specific securities as well when I tried submitting an order.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah they had the same liquidity requirements with the CH as everyone else.

This has nothing to do with Citadel."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're absolutely right, it was vague and you had to search for sure, which shouldn't be the case. The point I was trying to make was that they didnt restrict trading to only selling as Robinthahood did."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey don't worry, just make up stuff like I do :)"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It's adorable that you think followers = GME holders... lol and well you're REALLY not going to like the Bloomberg terminal that shows other stats of reality such as Germany accounts for less than .5 of 1% of the ownership of GME. But you will still upvote and post BS about late night Europoors and Deutsche bros refueling the rocket LOL... sheeesh... don't be so clueless THEY'RE not the ones moving GME at 2AM and neither are the WeBull retards... get a clue what is going on so you can profit
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,why didn't you study harder and attend a university? I mean your comments are just embarrassing
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,">	I started day trading, lost a lot, learned, regained it, and am a decent trader now. I don't need someone babysitting me from DC.

This is exactly what I‚Äôm going through right now. I jumped into options with zero experience. Lost money and made money. Took a weekend to break down my trades and see what mistakes I was making on the losing calls. By the third week of doing this I was able to make a 108% return on a FB call. Took the W and kept doing the same process over and over again. I‚Äôve been doing the same thing since the start of Feb and I way more confident in my picks now. 

None of this shit is actually hard, it‚Äôs just involves a metric dick ton of tedious research and grunt work to make profitable trades. Wall Street just like lawyers love to make over complicated terms to confuse and scare people away. Making them believe they need a ‚Äúfinance profesional‚Äù to not lose money. I can‚Äôt wait for gme and amc to shatter that narrative."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I honestly looking to cash out of rkt at $40 a share hence I‚Äôm selling cc on $39.89. Once it hits I‚Äôm probably going to swing trade aka buy the dip or look at something else. Either way I‚Äôm in currently at 2600 shares
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nope, I'm in Asia :P"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're right, but my problem is I watched the fucker live on TV flat out say they didn't have liquidity issues and they chose to do this regardless. He said they still had billions in liquidity available and noted that other brokers (RH) probably DID have liquidity issues, but not IBKR. 

IBKR fucked everyone over because they could. That's it. All eyes were on RH. In his own words, they 'didn't like the price'."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Huh?

Woosh I don‚Äôt get it"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"40% of RH users had a position on GME. After black Thursday, 50% of users left. Gee whiz. That isn't even accounting for people who *still have* positions and opened more *elsewhere*.

WeBull reported somewhere closer to 10% IIRC

Look dude, it isn't my job to exhaust so much effort on convincing one person about whats going on when you can just filter through the BS DDs and the quality ones and realise the same conclusion.

I'm not a vessel for your lazy arrogance.

GME attracts about 200K users in wsb at any given time during the day, peaking to about 500K when it moves.

Do you understand how many people that means have a vested curiosity about what GME is doing? This is wsb, not wall street studies. People aren't looking because their curiosity is intellectually driven. It's financial."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I Think 40 is their low end.... I'm expecting them to be a 60 dollar/ 2 dollar dividen  Company so it's worth holding and reinvesting.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Some dick just porked you reading your comment.  Believe it.  No positions / plans
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Everything you just wasted your time writing is wrong. You've clearly drank the koolaid so enjoy your ride!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Possibly I sold my cc for June 18, I think I will be okay. I don‚Äôt foresee rkt paying dividends in the near future the ceo wants to grow the company to much"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt be a moron
2021-03-19 23:44:11,wallstreetbets,I too am a Space-X rocket:) 
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"All good ma g, just roll them over to next week and pray. I‚Äôm down from 30k to 20k this weeküåö"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If we can lose it we can make it. Round 2, fight."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Way back in the Pleistocene when I was in high school, this guy named Michael Moschen came and did an assembly presentation for us. He was the guy who did [David Bowie's crystal ball juggling](https://youtu.be/0UWNWVIhFdY) in Labyrinth, actually. He showed us a bunch of cool stuff with juggling and miming, but what really sticks in my memory is this: 

He took out a balloon. He said ""I'm going to split this audience into two sections. Not equal sections, but there will be precisely two, with no ambivalence."" He started blowing up the balloon. He inflated it and inflated it and inflated it, til it was almost bursting, and then he stopped and said ""OK, look around. Some people right now are cringing with anticipation, and others are like 'what's the big deal?' There's no third section."" He was right. We all laughed, and then he blew the balloon up some more just to torture the anticipators. I was one of them. 

Eventually the balloon did burst and we were put out of our misery. But I thought at the time that this was just something genetic or something I could not really control - it's just how I WAS. 

But you know what? This fucking roller coaster with GME has proved me wrong. I am so used to this situation now I just don't fucking care any more. Thank you, WSB, for this opportunity for personal growth, lol. I FEEL SO EMPOWERED."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I literally watched that for 5 mins like dam there‚Äôs a lot of camera angles
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is actually pissing me off
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is abstract pain.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jesus christ that gave me anxiety.

I'd rather wait 1 year for a gme squeeze than watch that for 10 min."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Been watching for 5 mins now long is this video?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel like this shows the power than retail investors have. It's slowly squeezing because they're selling shares they shorted over time. That's why is staying at an over valued price. Hedge and get out. I said that at 40 bucks though. I could be a little soothe on the brain.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,OMG WHAT A FUCKlNG SETUP! THIS SHlT IT'S GOING UP ‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è

Deep breaths, fellow apes, now is the time for meaningful meditation, reflection and recuperation, take time to remind yourself why this all started, who you started it for.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like at 6:05‚Äì the part of the movie when they realize that even if they put the butter on the bottom of their bread or put the butter on the top of their bread, it‚Äôs all the same buttered bread. Good lesson."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is true
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Goddammit I've been watching this for a whole minute before I realized I was being tricked!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You just keep thinking its going to come (twsh)
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The squeeze was when it hit 480
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Starting to think that squeeze isn‚Äôt coming, just a big dump of retards with diamonds."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Already did, twice."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm ashamed to admit I waited for a few loops before I realized... It was never going to happen.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It's almost like it's not coming üôÑ
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I just hope some people actually take some gains this time around and don't get left holding bags
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Which squeeze are we on now?  I lost count. Isn't this one like the triple gama ray witch squeeze or something?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude it happened already you smooth brain
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Did y‚Äôall miss the part where it went from $3 to $400?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,All you people did was made people like Roaring Kitty Rich.  I bet you he flips the shit out of it. Telling you to buy and Hold.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,My ape brain can‚Äôt process this exotic flavor
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I watched this way longer than I should of before realizing the gif cut off before impact.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dont understand how we are going to see another ""bigger"" squeeze than what we already saw if the HFs are fully aware of what is happening here. Can someone please explain to this ape?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you people really still think a squeeze is going to happen?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"And just like the GIF, it doesn't happen. Shocking!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you still think there's a possibility of a ""squeeze"" you probably don't understand what a squeeze is."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,nah my man gmes fucked
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It already squoze ya doofuses. That‚Äôs what the 450$ jump was.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I miss the old wall street bets
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I think I saw the end of this video in January
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"In the meantime, here hold this bag"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Doubtful, it sells pretty well."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe a stupid question but isn't is possible they're just selling off small amounts of their shorts daily and keeping the price around 200, so it doesn't shoot up? Couldn't they just do little bits at a time to not drive the price up super far then once they're done it just drops?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"What if... now hear me out, because this is crazy. What if the squeeze already happened and all that's happening now is retail investors are just buying a worthless stock and hedge funds are making money off the volatility to recoup some of their earlier losses? Wouldn't that just be the most obvious and predictably crazy thing ever?  
now downvote away if you must for not confirming the bias but face it, the squeeze happened."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This ape finally gets it.

# It's not going to happen. Get it through your heads."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why would there be a short squeeze now, with around 15% short according to Ortex data? I mean, with current daily volume the full 15% could cover in just a few hours? It's all just hopes and dreams I guess."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Personally, I hope it does what it did last time. I hope it collapses down to $50 again, we can all buy a FUCKLOAD of calls for mega cheap and when it goes to 10k we all make millions. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hoping.

Edit: Why did this get so many downvotes?
I was literally saying we could make even more 
Money than we already are."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,U just got coconut  malled

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"it was. That's what's so annoying. It was GOING to be the MOAS, but then RH and other brokerages cheated the system while the HFs backed out. It sucks, but it happened. Greedy biches in here got some pipe dream about GME going back up to a thousand. Let it go... when a stock goes from $10 to $400... that is a short squeeze. It happened. its over. Now all that's left is for hedge funds to milk the volatility and collect more bag holders from the wallstreet bets forum for a few more weeks until they all realize what's happening about 2 months too late and then bam its back to $20 again."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That was the gamma squeeze. Next is the short squeeze. Do some DD.

2021-03-19 23:10:27,wallstreetbets,"Why RKT is not just a mortgage company with an app First of all, I see a lot of ""I like the stock cuz it's undervalued"". Undervalued compared to what? Traditional and pure-play companies deserves a low forward P/E and P/S because they don't have the potential to scale up, innovate, and revolutionize their industry - they are only there to make constant small profit for shareholders. This is why these companies will eventually have constant dividend and not reinvest back into the company expansion. Makes for good retirement investment where you want constant income. On the other hand, tech companies need to have either a new technology/product or have some way to digitally transform the industry that can quickly scale.

RKT has spent billions of dollars creating their own broker tools that's customizable, as well as investing in data analytics and AI-assisted automation. They have a 2500-strong software team in Detroit. RKT is not just a mortgage company with an app (although I've heard their app is pretty good). Just look at their acquisitions and some of their other businesses:

1. Nexsys Technologies makes a platform for mortgage lenders that automate homeowner insurance verification, and is being integrated with Lemonade
2. Lendesk, a Canadian aquisition that makes end-to-end digital mortgage solutions
3. forsalebyowner is a property listing site, kinda like zillow and redfin
4. Finally, their flagship rocket mortgage/quicken loans is the first digital mortgage experience - they are the ones who brought on the digital revolution of the mortgage industry. They are the real OGs and are continuing to innovate.

If you think Lemonade is a tech company (it is), then RKT is a tech company. Even more, it's a tech company that has succeeded in its own field and is rapidly expanding/acquiring. 

On the other hand, everyone is familiar with the feud between RKT and UWMC, and arguments for which is a better company. While I think UWMC has done well in recent year in terms of rapidly expanding in the broker channel, I don' think they are a tech company and thus shouldn't have a long term high forward valuation. Their flagship platform for brokers, Blink+, is a third party software that they pay per use (see their [S1 filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-016729/)). So here they save the initial investment that makes the finances look better for IPO, but will eat into their margins later."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I work in escrow and deal with hundreds of individual transactions each day. The top amount by far are UWMC. I would say the next amount are a toss up between RKT and Wells. 

I also am a homeowner that refinanced last month. I went with RKT. The rate they offered was fabulous, they fund their own loans, so my loan won't be passed around from lender to lender. The deciding factor was ease of use with their website and app. It is damn near perfection. 

I like them both, it really just depends on what your  goals are."

Look at all the men here following that advice! Join them and actually commit to Diamond Hands! For decades!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Listening to streams for financial advice

I'd start by diversifying your advice as well as your portfolio. Yes, videographers on Youtube can give good advice, but if you want to get serious, read books and listen to others that made it.  My favorite is Mauldin Economics, followed by (you guess it) WSB. Knowledge is power.

WSB itself is a good source for knowledge: these apes uncovered a big short and rode it to the moon! However, the point of YOLO investing is that you are taking great risk for great reward. I already said this before, and I'll say it again: *never risk what you can't afford to lose*.

When you want to buy ""Stonks"", you use disposable income: money that you can afford to lose and are willing to gamble. THis can pay off if you play your cards right. WSB has really enlightened me on the inner workings of things like meme stocks  and so on. In addition to the cutesy slang that helps me remember serious financial advice (Diamond Hands is my new favorite economic term), I like to see people's insight and successes.

Before you learn to invest, you must first learn to budget.

It's unconventional, but I firmly agree with WSB that ""Stonks"" should be taken as an actual investment tool. 
Every stock portfolio should have silly ""Stonks"" alongside serious buy-and-hold stocks. Game Stop, AMC, things shorted by the Hedgies, all of these ""meme stocks"" require timing, intuition, and research. However, you can't have Stonks as your only source of investing.

You must understand, I am ***NOT*** saying not to shoot for the moon. Far from it! Investing requires risk: you can't get sick GAINS without first laying it on the line! Just don't lay it all! Tendies are tendies regardless of how they are reaped. You need to understand restraint and moderation: you already understand Diamond Hands, which puts you above almost all casual investors. Now you need to understand *diversification*.

Should I ever compile a portfolio, I will ABSOLUTELY have some set aside for the Game Stops of the future. I'd set aside a portion of my funds to invest in things exactly like this.

> Boomer advice

I'm sorry, who has the vacation home and the paid off house? You, or the Boomers? Who has a stable nest egg to pass onto their children? You, or the Boomers? You broke one of the worst rules of investing and put all your eggs in one basket.

Now let's say one day, your stock hits the moon. You've got a banquet of chicken tenders and you kick up your feet. You did it!

...now what? You sound like an addict who will take their tendies and dump them all into a new Stonk with no diversification. You would lay down a million dollars to make two.

Will you be responsible and allocate most of that money to savings, leaving a portion for further investments? Or will you step down from your lofty position as a distinguished ape and dump your fortune into a new stock by trying to double it?

I'll give you another tip: **know when to hold them, know when to fold them, know when to walk away, know when to run**.

***Diamond Hands is not just a meme.*** Of all the memes that WSB has, Diamond Hands is more than just slang; it is *legitimate investing advice*. Day trading is poor wealth management and very stressful. As I said in my third point, the best portfolios don't need to be checked often. 

-and did I say become a millionaire? No, I said earn enough money to live on. Being a millionaire is a great goal, but the *real* end of the tunnel is to live *abundantly*, not a set number. Many people don't need a million to be happy.

Again, though, I am ***not*** saying that you should not bet on YOLO and roll the dice. I'm saying that diversification of your assets allows you to have your cake and eat it too. You can have your money in Stonks and buy your moon tickets.

Also, I should note, Boomers aside: you can't make it in decades-long Normie stocks without Diamond Hands. Of all the things WSB does, their commitment to Diamond Hands, *real, serious buying and holding*, puts them legions above even professional traders. Few people have the discipline not to fold in a panic sell. Fewer still can actually say it.

> Bashing bonds

> Implying I said not to *also* have stocks

> Implying I said not to *also* set aside some money for Stonks and memes

I'm sorry, I can't hear you over my completely and totally guaranteed tendies that will be maturing in a few years. A thousand bucks for a thousand three hundred tendies? That may not be a moon shot, but it's gas in my rocket to keep me from crashing on the ride we call life."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Same to you! I hope that your portfolio some day rests on the moon!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I completely agree. WSB and this Game Stop fiasco has taught me to take ""Stonks"" seriously, but like all things, to do it with *moderation*. High risk, high reward. You can't make big bucks without taking bigger risks. Any portfolio I create will ***unquestionably*** have a section for the meme stocks. Most moon shots don't happen, but every now and then, you make it. Stock markets are, after all, a casino at the end of the day.

My point, and the advice that I gave, was recommendations in making long term, sustainable wealth. It's not an either or: chicken tenders are baked regardless of how your successful investments are reaped.

As you so correctly pointed out, responsible stock investing need not exclude silly Stonk investing. Diversification of one's portfolio ***should*** have some moon tickets and Stonks.

Ask yourself: what do you want more? Chicken tenders today that you can *entirely* dump into the next meme stock, or a self-generating oven of tendies  that, without investing new poultry, reinvests into new tendies? That's why I said you need to reinvest the dividend. The stocks generate wealth by you holding them. You already have Diamond Hands for decades, so what better way to cash out at the end of the line then having *more* to cash out?

Four Chan aside, calling your fortune and your accomplishments ""tendies"", much like Diamond Hands, is actually a good description: you either eat ramen today and steaks tomorrow, or ramen today and Alpo tomorrow.

Tendies aren't just things to buy bling and luxury goods. They are *food*, and when you can no longer work for your chicken, you had better hope your retirement has enough chicken tenders to sustain you when you can't work."

2021-03-19 23:00:02,wallstreetbets,"Please stop using IBorrowDesk as your only source of hedge funds borrowing shares Like all of you, I've been looking at [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) to keep an eye on the amount of shares remaining for hedge funds to borrow. However, about a week ago I decided that my brain was just a little too smooth (my wife's boyfriend told me to wrinkle up, whatever that means), and I took a look at the FAQ on the iborrowdesk website.

Link for the lazy [https://iborrowdesk.com/faq](https://iborrowdesk.com/faq)

At the very bottom, the FAQ says the following:

""It's also worth noting that IBorrowDesk only tracks Interactive Brokers data - it could be that other brokerages have many shares available. Professional or institutional investors have access to data sources far more sophisticated than this site - which can only track a single, albeit very large and active, brokerage.""

At first I was confused, and picked my nose with an axe. Then, I had a jimmy nerdtron brainblast, and realized this meant that IBorrowDesk does not showcase all of the available shares to borrow for shorting purposes. Investigating the amount of shares available to borrow from other brokers is key to monitoring what the hedge funds are up to. Relying solely on IBorrowDesk is incomplete data at best, and confirmation bias at worst.

I am not a financial advisor, but I want people to be aware that they're not looking at the full data.

Ape strong together."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I can make my balls wrinkle up.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What pisses me off about all this is the guy at the nyse at the last hearing talked so much about dark pools and it's like no one paid attention around here... 40% of average trading is unreported...
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is no good source for short info.

There just isnt.  

I dont even trust company filings anymore."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, [here is a fourth graders version of stuff](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/01/082201.asp)"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it possible for shorts to be gaming the interest rate as well. They return just the right amount to keep it low making people who look at interest rate as an indicator.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Ortex has free week with just email verification very handy on taking your game to the next level
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,am I so fucking blind or there is just 100 - 10 000 available to short on IKBR?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct. If available shares go from 100k to 50k it could simply mean that an IBKR customer sold 50k shares or perhaps they paid off their margin loan and thus the shares are not available to lend. iBorrow numbers are such a tiny, irrelevant source to use for borrow data."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it's cheap as fuck to short GME right now and availability seems plenty despite less available on IBKR.

Honestly the responsible way to play GME right now is probably to sell april puts. OTM stuff like $60 or $80c.

I was selling $25-$40p but the premiums on them arent really worth it anymore."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are many factors that play into why fees are what they are.  Determinants include: market security, demand and availability

Sure there are some shorts that have covered, but the price of the market security is so much more than it was at 200 dollars that make it less attractive to short.

Also take for example in August 2020 when the borrow rate was 4% when there was no catalyst or action - GME was shorted over 100% of the float at that time.  The borrow rate x security cost is now 5 times more than it is was when it was shorted over 100% of the float.

Recently when the short side tried as hard as it could to suppress the price in late Feb, the borrow rate was 12% with a market price of 100-170 in that short time frame.

We can't just state the borrow rate without taking into account the market price or the current demand (ie trying to actively suppress a push).  The rate itself won't tell what the short interest is.

We also don't know what the players thoughts or actions are.  If they are allowing it to pool so they can use a heavy amount of shorts at once incase the long side tries to push.  And they won't haphazardly use them in fear of getting trapped and losing money by the longs when the market price goes up.

All we know is that there is significant short interest  - we don't get the same type of data as the big boys, but we can see they are still invested and there is some big reward (or something else is brewing) - otherwise they wouldn't be in the game now."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It's very low. 0.5% we need it to be 20%
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"How do you check this at Fidelity? I use them and have never seen a number available, just whether or not I can short."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You would need info from the big dawgs. GS MS JPM C BAC. That‚Äôs where all the borrow is
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,True!!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,But can you smooth them out?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Your giving them way too much credit. The rates are primarily determined by the Prime Brokers and Custodial lending banks. There is no conspiracy theory here.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Definitely need a hedge, I'm all for technical war, short interest theory and momentum plays, but if you don't protect your money, they keep your money. And for all you downvoters out there selling deep otm puts is good strat, especially if you want a discount on share price. Just like Gross selling otm $250 $300 calls was a bear strat, collect fees on your hope."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a retail investor I'm not that clued up on the details of shorting (I would never short a stock as it doesn't fit my risk tolerance) however my main understanding on the interest rate on shorts was that it was highest when the chance of a company going bankrupt was likely.

The fact that the borrow rate is low could be a bullish sign for the stock - the lenders aren't worried about never getting their share back."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,No you don't. You don't even know what you're talking about. 20% would be good to stop them from entering new short positions but it has nothing to do with shorts already in place.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,On the Fidelity Active Trader Pro window. I found it on their quote page down towards the bottom.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Over here: https://imgur.com/z8HPAuf

If you mouseover the little blue box, it gives the interest rate too."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay, youre right about this being just one lender and more info is always good, but when you use weaknesses in apes knowledge to try to say ""everything is normal with this stock, nothing to see here,"" even though we csn clearly fucking see that it isn't, then you aren't trustworthy.

We just need to take your word for it that your friends in finance (who *totally* have *no* position) that there is so much GME available that it's easy to short. We can't just call PB's and ask because it's a closely guarded secret (and they said as much about positions in Wednesday's hearing). But your friends who work at these places can just be like ""hey, there's plenty to short"" and we take them at their word? Even though some basic math shows there really aren't that many shares? Even though Ihor Dusaniwsky form S3 says a squeeze is still likely?

See, I've been called a shill for telling uncomfortable truths. But when you immediately use them to shoot down the stock without addressing other indicators, you raise suspicion."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,My 791 $GME at $49 are doing pretty well for me :B
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are many reasons why a rate is low.  When the rate is high, it does mean there is a heavy demand for it and low availability meaning someone is desperately trying to push the price down.

When the rate is low, it could mean there is no demand for it at that moment.  It could mean that shorters are worried to borrow incase they get trapped, despite there being a heavy short interest or low availability - because these lenders would ideally want their entire stock to be on loan so they can make the most money.

For a security that has a higher market value, typically a borrow rate is lower - unless for example: Jan 25-30 when the price for GME was pushing 200-400 and the rates were super high.  They wanted to 1) short it at the peak to make money 2) suppress the price because they were in deep trouble in terms of getting margin called.

It is a dynamic process and you have to take many factors into account."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,20% would increase the likelihood that there are few shares to borrow and this short. That is bullish sign for longs and any potential squeeze. Hard for a true squeeze to take place when there are millions of shares to borrow
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good response, thanks"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,SI isn't soley tied to the amount of shares available to short. It being low right now likely means theyve deemed it too risky to take new large short positions so there is no demand and the SI on it drops.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn‚Äôt that the same thing?  If nobody is  putting on new shorts SI will be lower and there will be more shares available to borrow
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,No. Because its not tied to quantity available like that. There could be no available shorts to borrow because the liquidity is literally zero and SI could still be low.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Respectfully I disagree. What liquidity are you talking about?   I know 100% certain that there are millions of shares to borrow. But that I do admit isn‚Äôt readily available to see and that is a shame that individual investors can‚Äôt get access to that info. But let‚Äôs look at it logically....if Fido is showing 100k shares available to short and they are a smallish player in the borrow market isn‚Äôt it reasonable to assume that the bigs GS MS C JPM BAC etc have at least 3x the availability as FIdO? That alone gets you well over a million shares available. I‚Äôm not saying this stock can‚Äôt bolt higher but beware a meaningful January like jump from these levels will certainly be met with a torrent of short selling. Whether that‚Äôs enough to overwhelm the buying is the main question
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think we're now saying the same thing. There are tons of shares to borrow, always have been. What I'm getting at is the ""we need it at 20%"". Basically just because its at 20% doesn't mean theres less to borrow, just that its more expensive. Just don't think its good for people to think "" if SI is 20% its over and squeeze is imminent"" because thats not necessarily true and ppl keep locking in on dates and prices and SI which leads to FUD when they don't hit."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,20 refers to the percentage cost to borrow the stock not the price of the stock. A borrow costing 20% fee would imply very little borrow
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry. Typing while shitting. I meant 20%. How did anything I say imply I was talking about share price even with the mistake? A borrow cost of 20% would not imply very little to borrow.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,My bad I thought you had 20$ per a share in your original response. Either way if the cost to borrow goes to 20% that would most definitely imply less borrow availability. It‚Äôs a supply and demand dynamic. Why would someone pay 20% to borrow millions of shares. If there was ally of borrow availability lenders would be undercutting each other to compete for the shorts.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,SI has nothing to do with borrow availability https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortinterest.asp
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,They are very related. When someone goes short a stock a stock borrow needs to occur. That‚Äôs a fact. A short seller sells something they don‚Äôt own. They borrow the shares to make the delivery. If short interest goes up the amount of stock being borrowed goes up. Therefore if the amount being borrowed goes up the amount that is available to borrow decreases
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude what are you even talking about? Whos debating how short selling works? Have fun, this is no longer worth discussing."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Amen to that. It‚Äôs all related.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I have TD (TDA)/TOS. I like it
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The interface and ease of use pales in comparison to something like RH, but at the same time they also won't give Level 3 options to any dipshit with 5$ for the first month of gold that requests it in the app on their phone and like you mentioned they don't fuck around about handling trades. 

I watched today happen on their active trader pro desktop program, it's got a million bells and whistles but it's pretty neat and I had all my limit buys filled under my limit price rather than at price. Once RH buys some shares and sends them my way so they're not marked margin anymore I'll be g2g."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Anybody know what the OP was holding? Also - every time I see these posts it just makes me laugh when I think about people who argue that the rich only got rich by being smarter than the rest. Statistically over large enough populations I'm sure that's true - but then you have these wonderful outliers that show there are some real cashed up retards out there. I salute you.

My 401k is super limited with like 10-15 options but I think I can transfer that money to my IRA penalty free if I want."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actual, literal stock options. Can't go tits up, right? Merger, lockup period and fuckery by new mgmt over the escrow account proved that wrong.  I was young and so stoked after giving my soul to them I was getting paid.  Here's a check for 25k and a ton of stock.  Tax time came and my liability was right around 25k. My liability should have been zero because we all requested that enough of our stock be sold to cover any liabilities the day of conversion.  I asked finance how that happened and they said, we withheld what we were required to by law.  IOW, fuck you.  

Funny thing is the symbol was recycled into a stock talked about on WSB.  It still triggers me."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Step aside peasant
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree. I wouldn't have known that had I started on TOS first. I hit the traditional pages first because apps can be buggy. I jumped into TOS after getting used to TDA. That's when I realized how I can see a lot of info fast and easy on TOS but at the same time there's stuff either only on the website or I just haven't found on the app. So I use both when needed.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dang man, this is a true lesson in humility. 

Dont fucking forget it."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yo, that was a great run. Don't listen to these guys saying, ""You're greedy, you're dumb, should've sold at the top."" These are just jealous apes trying to make you feel bad because they didn't even make a play that gave them the same YOLO chance you got with your decisions. Remember, it was your decisions that led to potential profit. These guys with their ""don't be greedy, get out when you can,"" are the ones sitting back not risking anything and backseat driving other people's positions.

Next time someone says, ""You're so dumb, should've gotten out at 5x."" Just ask them, ""O yea, can you show me your positions where you got out at 5x?""

Sure the exit was suboptimal, but a successful trade takes a great entry, and a great exit. You nailed one of them, and only the other half remains. Just try to analyze where you could've done better, and do it for next time. 

Thanks for sharing, brother!"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,GME calls are like fucking Russian roulette. Welcome to full retard club!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,2k off 10k is 20%. I ain't gonna hate on those double digit gains
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,DIAMOND HANDS RETARD YOU HAVE YOUR DIGNITY OVER 220k CASH! LOL FUCKING RETARD
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,How is it able to drop so hard in after hours? That shows it dropped right at midnight almost.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you me?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow. Thank you for making me feel better.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro you should have sold
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I quick spurt of unattainable happiness. Much like an orgasm or my love life.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The stock market is a graph of rich people‚Äôs emotions. Your account is a graph of poor peoples emotions.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,How did you do that dashboard?   I have TD AMERITRADE.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,12K on GME Shares may get your money back if there's a MOASS
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine if you would have just sold it all
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine how many shares you could have bought with 200k.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Know how this feels, to a lesser extent. Actually maybe more so because I turned a huge win to a loss. Turned a $75k win to a $25k loss on GME calls because I kept doubling down after being up huge. In the last two weeks though, I turned the $30k I had left into $100k (ironically on more GME calls, fully out now though...  and NFT-related stocks). Moral of the story, ride it out. Life changing opportunities exist every day in the market. What helped me has been making 10-15 bets (1-2 of which are calls, rest shares). This makes it much easier to cut losses and not get emotionally attached to a single name. Also, I‚Äôm really good at TA and that went out the window when I was trading GME the first time around, so I‚Äôm back to relying on that. Good luck and keep your head up."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shouldn't this be tagged ""gain""?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn TD cost a bit on trade on, Mr Money Bags over here."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I am you. 150k to 8k to 100k back to 12k. Fml.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Aw look at that baby spike, big brother will enter chat soon"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You did it
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Set limits for fucks sake
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,2k is a gain
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Epic!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Congrats and fuck you, up 20% all time, but yeah lost a lot the past month too"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Having 10k to invest is poor? I don‚Äôt wanna know what that makes meüò¨üò¨üò¨
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You see poor people - I see 20% gain in two months
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just flip the graph brother, works everytime"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice 20% gain.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Options are a hell of a drug
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"How to save it
Amazing lesson"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,How did you get a graph my emotional health since January ?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,i bought at 300s and made like 10k then dropped and lost 70k....
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I did this too.  Except I legit lost all of it cause I'm a paperhanded retard who sells for loss constantly on stocks but will hold options to 0
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,God damn just learn to take profits sometimes. Even if it's just in little bits you don't need to cash out all at once. Fuck emotional attachment to stocks and trading just don't do it. Learn to take profits. This is a single player game.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey man you made 2k
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The stock MARKET is a graph for rich people. Your dumb choices is a graph for YOU.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Now here‚Äôs a guy that had the world in his hands and traded it for bananas
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Charts and stock market in general is just a gage of fears and emotions. People afraid of losing money will sell driving it down. People will get excited about some news and eagerly buy up stock driving prices up too. I look at a stocks price over years, plus read as much DD as I can, read relevant news that may affect how well a company will perform. I buy companies I believe in and that helps me hold when others panic. From my observation every time there is a huge sell off the stocks recover, so I hold. Look at 2008, and March 2020 as examples. Not financial advise, I can only tell you what I do. Knowledge is power, do your own DD. If you find something that you think is useful, double check the information is accurate and go from there."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm currently up 110% in my first three months... not something I should get use to I expect?

You are all fucking idiots. You deserve what you got."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think we've learned an important lesson. We probably won't see 1000% gains, but we will see our portfolio's grow."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Speaks to me
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,LOL this sub is full of absolute morons who have no awareness of financial responsibility.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree he should have sold for for a profit and play with house money. Hindsight is 20/20 and its hard to setback when you‚Äôre ahead.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is why you lock in your profits
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didn't ""allow"" it. I deeply disapproved of it. ;)"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,How is that full retard? Was the right play until they shutdown the market
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,More like college for one kid...
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Easy. It's greed. When you're up 2000% it's all just numbers and you want more and don't  want to stop the momentum.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"How hard is to take 150k and leave 50k to play, I don't understand!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Upon further psychoanalysis, I believe the narrative was more important than the money, until the narrative let me down and I realized that I was just as fooled as believing that I live in an actual democracy."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,He is up 20%.  From 10 to 12.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You can buy cabins on national parks? And they're fucking 400 grand? I know what I'll be saving up for now.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It's mindblowing after a 2100% increase you don't even cash out your original investment. I would have taken 100k out and been laughing all the way to the bank.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the thoughtful response! I have learned and what does not kill my portfolio makes it stonkier.

It's a mindfuck when you're in a 2000% trade, which many don't know what that feels like. I said this earlier, but I did take out 12k to max out my IRA for 2020 and 2021. So, I'm trying to convince myself that I'm winning in some way."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes he's dumb. How about x25?

https://i.redd.it/iqlybk56c2e61.png"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks mate. I also maxed out two years of IRA, which the graph doesn't show. I'm still well above where I started."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Beautifully put.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It's not on think or swim. Go through the td app
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"How about the -95% in 2 days?   
How fucking outstanding is that?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. Expect only greatness and only greatness will envelope you. Keep your eyes on the moon and the rocket will take you there.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Should be easy to maintain. Go all in on each trade to maximize profits and you will be a trillionaire within 5 years.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Cant win every time
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you ever serve in the military? Dark humor and the inability to pull out are kinda pre-requisites...
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Too many newbs here bought in to the ‚Äúdiamond handsüíéüôåüèª ‚Äú and still don‚Äôt realise cashing in at least your stake is just smart from a risk management perspective.

I don‚Äôt give a fuck what the price is now it‚Äôs all house cash... Just waiting for moon!üöÄ"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Made that mistake with GME. Up $110,000. Didn‚Äôt sell. My finger was at the sell button on $400. Came crashing down to $100 and sold at cost breaking even."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't give in to the FOMO. It's like spending your winnings on the slots cause you feel great. 

You can always leave some shares in to collect more if it keeps going."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It would have been full retard to sell for $483 when this thing easily had the potential to go well past that if it wasn't stopped.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Not cashing out when the writing was on the wall. Can always buy back in lower. When it was apparent they were manipulating the stock the holding strategy was a moot point.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is literally all I would ask for. To be able to pay off my student loans and be debt free. 

200k is definitely life changing."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,what is exit strategy
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a casino."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So much blame on you while do the same with GME.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Balls of steel and a 20% ROI in 2 months is better than I‚Äôll ever do
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So is this what we say to people to console them for not selling at the top? Ok
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,How is anyone dumb enough to be poor and lose THAT much overnight. LOL
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Wouldn‚Äôt those have been up a ton last week when we hit $350?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,it is indeed impressive
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Not with that attitude
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm fairly certain majority of newbies here don‚Äôt realize HODL makes sense for shares,  but not always for options. The number of times I see people saying shit like, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre fucked now ‚Äú 1 week prior to expiration is insane. You can always sell your options  prior to expiration ."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can't tell from the graph but I did pull out to max out two years of my IRA... I'm actually up %150 because IRA is 6k per year (so 12k) plus that 12k of play money. I wasn't going to watch it go to zero. I'm not as retarded as I seem, but still definitely might be missing a chromosome."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Awe man that hurts my soul and it's not even my money LOL fuuuuuuck
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Same man. 80k‚Ç¨ gone to the wind.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,it gone back up to $340? oh yeah calls
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not realizing massive gains because of ""potential"" is risky and borderline stupid. This is why people set goals and make exit strategies."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think that's just FOMO peaking its head out. I know several people who really kick themselves for not selling when something was up at a very high return. They all said they wanted to get more and waited, but it's short-lived."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This was my hindsight, but obviously most of us actually are new retail traders. It just made us all diamond hand investors of GameStop. Learned a lifetime of lessons very quick, and have been able to double my position and average down. Can't wait to see where this game goes."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Not to mention you can leverage 200k 10x as most of the freewprld does. 200k has the implied power of $2m .
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"4k to 120k peak here, rode it down because I believed, still believe"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stop it. It is his fault for listening to the ""ape gang"", but they CERTAINLY would have told him to never sell."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"That wasn't the top. Also, timing it is impossible. More than likely he tried to time it (by selling/rebuying or playing options). My options have gotten wrecked, my shares have rocketed. 

If I'd have just put everything into shares and hodl'd I'd be better off. Hindsight us always 20/20"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"To be fair I‚Äôm new too, but have semi-decent gambling experience (poker) and sensible enough to understand bankroll and risk management.

Haven‚Äôt dabbled in options, yet, but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll have plenty of loss porn to share once I do!üòÇ"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I was only responding to the headline so if I mistook the meaning I hope you don't blame me for that because I've seen other post where they literally mean the account rose to $200k and now it's back to $12k and they didn't sell anything at all.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You bet. I‚Äôve been having mood swings, emotional distress, and cold sweats at night. Can‚Äôt eat, can‚Äôt sleep, can‚Äôt stop thinking of ‚Äúshould have sold it at $400‚Äù, ‚Äú why the fuck didn‚Äôt I sell at 400% profit gains‚Äù, ‚Äúdude go kill yourself, could‚Äôve made life changing money‚Äù

Everyday, my emotions are fucked."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol when people.talk about ""potential profits"" like they are something that actually exists"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"In the long run it helped me too. I was average in the 300s with 20 odd shares now I'm in the mid 100s with over 8x the amount of shares

Let's go!

ü¶çüí™üíéüôåüí∞üöÄüåï"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Uhh, paying off my student loans and freeing up $1250 of my income a month for the next 7 years would be life changing regardless."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs almost like when it hits your limit at 200.05 you can say thanks for the offer but I going to pay you 210$
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I won‚Äôt sugarcoat someone‚Äôs inability to see a 5X gain in a week and take profits. Y‚Äôall diamond hand as much as you want, is it honorable? Probably in r/investing. Here, its just plain stupid."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,now you know...could've been more expensive
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ahaaaaahaahahahaha  
what an idiotic decision!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Beautiful
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. There's a level of wealth snobbery here.

Is 200k going to let you retire? No. But even if conservatively invested it's going to basically add a full time minimum wage job to your yearly income for the rest of your life.

If you're already making $75k+ an extra $14k is just icing on the cake. But if you're making a smaller amount that kind of money is literally the difference between poverty and a stable life."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I disagree. We all see very clearly where this is headed. All the blatant manipulation, the instant 50% drop in ""price"" in 5 seconds. The just perfectly timed 60 BILLION dollars raised in bonds which as always only puts state employees like my wifes pension fund that is mandatory (no opt out) at risk.. aka, she's being sold out to fund trying to keep the price down, when it should just be used to fund the payout now not make it worse...., which ultimately will just be added to the exponential payout.

If you think less than 100% (hell at this point theres prob 900% w/synthetic shares out there) of the float is owned, I've also got a great deal for you on a house down in Florida"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know, I blame myself every night before I sleep and every morning I wake up depress. Idiotic is underrated. I'm a fucking stupid dumbass motherfucker cunt bitch cocksucker bitch ass retarded idiot. I need a rope."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait so the French would be speaking German if America didn‚Äôt step in? But we did step in so that‚Äôs why the French speak English? I mean wait, French? What?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Good luck.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I miss playing Max Pain on my playstation
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Those numbers on the screen are just made up by apes to account for shit that we don't need in our lives... too bad it all has real world material impact and that fucks with our squishy brains.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell all my shares at 498k.  Got it.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thx see ya on the moon!! Or if you're not on board the rocket, I'll send ya a postcard"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Could've made my life a whole lot easier. Hindsight is 20/20 but I can't believe I didn't sell it when I double my portfolio in less than a week. Greed is powerful and evil.

2021-03-19 22:07:45,wallstreetbets,"$VST - Texas Winter Wonderland Play First DD and keep having to minimize my screen when the bossman passes, so it will be a quicky like the wife's BF enjoys.

Vistra Corp is a company. A company in Texas where it was unexpectedly cold for a little while. Actually, more specifically, Vistra Energy is an energy producer and provider, serving millions in dozens of states. This is done both via wholesale power sales or its retail segment. Even amongst other energy gorillas in the absolutely massive energy zoo, the firm is no small ape slinger; it is the largest competitive energy provider in the United States with over 39 GW of power generation in its portfolio ‚Äì a number capable of sending Marty back to the future to sleep with your wife 32x. It also rivals that of traditional utilities like Duke Energy or Southern Company.

https://preview.redd.it/fhp9400xu0o61.jpg?width=195&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88c495202d872f2a32627086343335bec39b260e

""So what?""

Beginning this year, EBITDA over the next three years was expected to be in excess of $9,000mm, of which the firm would have converted 60% of that to free cash flow. While some of that was set to fund growth projects (investments in renewables), the bulk of it was going to be returned to shareholders in the form of either dividends or shareholder buybacks. The firm was coming off of a multi-year deleveraging cycle and had achieved the leverage metrics necessary to qualify for investment grade credit, meaning that the heavy lifting on the balance sheet was done and it was time for the equity to benefit. The market, for various reasons, was fundamentally mispricing this opportunity. Vistra Energy traded with free cash flow yields to the equity in excess of 20%, and even traded with double digit annual free cash flow yields on the entire enterprise.

Vistra was doing well. Really well. Then came this once in a lifetime storm. Investors thought, ""no big deal. They can weather this thing."" But then the management peeps disclosed a forecast of $900 ‚Äì 1,300mm in the aftermath of the freeze. In addition, media reported wiffs of bankruptcies across these companies.  BOOM! Sell-off.

But what happened? and is Vistra really in danger? Well, lots of  things happened that my smooth brain doesn't entirely comprehend, but it turns out it was an ERCOT pricing error outside their control. They were really well prepared to deal with this if it weren't for some stupid incompetent bureaucracy.

Vistra did good before the storm. They predicted the weather event and spent money to be ready. In fact, they were more ready than your wife's BF when you're in the taxi on the way to the airport for a business trip. Before the storm, they locked up natural gas supplies. They were prepped to be supplying energy in the face of this severe catastrophe.

https://preview.redd.it/csq9qfb6v0o61.jpg?width=259&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a491d2fcb5ffbb9699dc88a454f868f4c0957a2a

The winter storm comes and the grid gets shut down. Other fake and inefficient energy production like wind and solar go offline.

Through all of this drama, Vistra Energy is supplying a large portion of the power of the grid as one of the few electricity providers that was prepared. Yet, inexplicably, the ERCOT mandated price was slow to respond to conditions. Even with half of Texas power generation offline and load demand near all-time winter highs, market prices were not where they should have been.

For perspective, stated prices fell from $9,000 per MWh initially to as little as $1,500 per MWh by mid-day Monday on February 15. Vistra Energy went into this crisis substantially long and ready to fulfill its role, but prices were marked to market too low when load was shed, meaning they were supplying the bulk of early grid electricity at weaker rates. Further, ERCOT mandated blackouts did not occur in areas where they had energy, a situation that helped other electricity providers that could sell during downtime.

&#x200B;

Ultimately Biff ended up with Marty's mom, Marty doesn't get to the clock tower and Vistra get's screwed.

Stated prices fell from $9,000 per MWh initially to as little as $1,500 per MWh by mid-day Monday on February 15. Vistra Energy went into this crisis substantially long and ready to fulfill its role, but prices were marked to market too low when load was shed, meaning they were supplying the bulk of early grid electricity at weaker rates. Further, ERCOT mandated blackouts did not occur in areas where they had energy, a situation that helped other electricity providers that could sell during downtime.

End of the day, despite making the correct weather call, the firm ended up with a higher cost of goods mix than it anticipated (higher natural gas prices, less use of coal-fired generation) and pricing issues related to the Monday morning ERCOT issue.

**Longstory Short**Vistra is positioned to üöÄüåï. Afterall, we know that Marty & Doc always save the day. Not only is energy a post-covid recovery play, but Vistra is a good company that suffered an unfortunate set of events.üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄLong $VST üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

BUT... 

Yes, Robinhood are encouraging this type of trading, even though most of their clients don‚Äôt have the experience or portfolio to be actual day traders. They set their target audience up for failure. 

That being said, I see a lot of obviously stupid trades posted every day. At some point, traders have to be responsible for their actions. But also, at some point, Robinhood has to responsible for their actions. 

What we‚Äôre witnessing in this market is that only traders are being held responsible for their actions while brokers and financial institutions are not held responsible and can do whatever the hell they want... no matter how disingenuous. 

This must change. 

There is DEEP DEEP market manipulation and not just on one, but on several levels, by brokers like Robinhood and other financial institutions."

RobinHood app: Apparently RH has on staff 'behavioral analysts'. It looks like the apps is designed almost like a video game NOT for easy of use, but to encourage trading!

As a dirty fucking leftist, I would say that competition is good, most banks don't lend out shit to small businesses and upstarts and women and minorities, monopolies are terrible and cartels are worse, and most of the US economy is dictated by government incentives approved or written by 65+ year olds that haven't written Hello World in fucking java and have never physically touched an arduino, embedded computer or a fucking raspberry pi. 

For you normies, the last bit is pretty fucking fundamental to understanding how to write/physically build robots that build physical things. You remember the show ""How It's Made""? We need those fucking machines goddamn everywhere. I live in one of the ""shit hole"" east coast US cities and we have abandoned 4+ story, 40,000+ sq feet empty goddamn warehouses like 1 per 6 blocks and the fucking local government won't seize them from greedy landlords or simply repossess the abandoned property and auction them off to build SOMETHING there. Hilariously there are all of these builders that want to build expensive townhomes everywhere (ironically driving down price), but the local zoning boards are old as shit, literally every person on them is 50+, so nothing gets approved unless there's a $10k+ bribe, aka a foreign bank account that pays out every month for 10 years automatically.

I also think that the order of events that they described in Robinhood renegotiating their payments shows a likely lack of malice.

It's one of the reason for government that is able to be separated from corporatism. And since the US shows most signs of being an oligarchy, the regular person is often left wanting for representation."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Your confusing correlation with causation. Main companies failed in the Great Depression because of poor business decisions. But the skyrocketing unemployment and starving people were caused by the mismanagement of the money supply. And many many more companies failed because of that. Letting companies fail does not have to lead to the money supply issues we saw in the Great Depression.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Smort ape
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know what the term means. I thoroughly reject the premise of the term as fallacious. The assumption is that such a business failing results in societal devastation and a complete removal of its assets from existence.

In reality, the opposite is true. The business liquidates its assets and competitors absorb what clientele the big dog had. ""To big to fail"" is a cop-out developed by businesses seeking bailouts and pushed by lobbyists and politicians in the pockets of those businesses."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,That doesn‚Äôt mean the leadership and stockholders have to remain the same.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's a decision ultimately up to the consumer, truth be told."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because this is how banks would make more money!  Get the bailout money to keep them in business, meanwhile, they will still still collect every single dollar owed by their customers on top of it and foreclose on them as soon as allowed.  Just like covid.

Sure, you can get away withi not being kicked out of your place, but you sure owe that money even if the parent company or person got government help to help them deal with the lack of income from their tenants.  

And then we still have to help the tenants or we have a homelessness issue once the restrictions are lifted and people start getting kicked out due to not having months of savings to repay their rent and mortgages.

Those bailouts did not come with agreements to waive mortgage payments.  Just deferments.   It was basically no risk to them since the government was bailing them out, they got to collect off everyone the same amount and then some due to interest, just down the road.  Free fucking money for the wrong reason.

The argument is always we gotta save big businss, they are suffering>

Okay?  So give the people the same money they are normally getting or even more if you want more spend and that's better than bailing out a bunch of companies who keep that money, and then get the money from everyone else too and makes them better off in the end than everyone else whos stuck paying for it. :("
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The other half of it is power fundamentally changes your empathy and perception of the world, and that's just studies in a lab where somebody us given an unfair advantage in a game then thinks they are superior. Even the best people fall victim. 

Then add in perverse incentives like donations, speaking fees, and the less apparent but far mar insidious corruption of life at the top. When you golf with the CEOs, your kid is friends with their children, or you attend private art galleries, you associate with those at the top. They become your friends and they become *you*. 

Its then easier to view what they do as moral or legal, since, hey, ""I know Bernie Madoff, he's a great guy. I went boating with him a few times.""

You also look at your life and see the hard work that you put in (for a lot of people, even an heir like Romney or Trump probably think they earned it) and atteibute your success to your work ethic or talent. You faced challenges to get where you are, so its hard to empathize with others who migbt have had greater challenges. So, those who are poorer or less successful are, therefore, lazier or less talented. 

When push comes to shove, you will find it hard to side with the little guy. Its just psychology. 

Sure, sociopaths and materialist people might get to the top in greater propensity, but even the most humble and selfless people are changed by power to some degree."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well financial instutions literally can be too big to fail, most other firms I disagree. If Google failed, then we would be fine. If Johnson and Johnson failed we'd be fine. If United Airlines failed, we'd be fine.

Banks are different, since their assets are extremely leveraged money, and if the money dried up then commerce grinds to a halt like the depression and recession.

The former justify bailouts by saying x employees will lose their jobs, and with that their seniority, 401k matches, holidays and all the other bonuses of longevity within a company. 

They also say that the jobs in that city/state or country will be lost. If United fails, then corporate jobs on Chicago will be lost to day Beijing when their planes are bought out by Cathay Airlines. The pilots and attendants will keep their job, but corporate might not or they will move to a different state."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs not how dominoes work. 

Businesses rely on each other in major ways, particularly banks and insurance. If these companies cannot fund day to day operations for their clients, then the economy will be unable to exist in its current state. It would likely take months to get the accounting situation for thousands of corporations back to a point where they could operate business to business transactions. 

Financing to manufacturing to shipping to retail all rely on one another as a linked chain. Without financing none of it works in today‚Äôs world.  Too big to fail is most definitely a thing."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"And you‚Äôre just wrong. 
Yes there are many instances where the term is misused by companies to get a bailout. That doesn‚Äôt mean it never applies. 
Standard oil had 90% market share for over 20 years. They were literally too big to fail. If they had failed the entire US economy would‚Äôve ground to a halt. People wouldn‚Äôt have been able to hear their homes. 
We can argue about individual companies, but the concept still exists. There reaches a point where a company has such large market share that if they fail, there competitors cannot increase their production to meet demand."

Everyone's been miseducated and purposely forced away from self sufficiency so that they can be greedy and force us to give to them.

Financial companies and critical infrastructure shouldnt be allowed to be too big to fail to begin with.

I don't think it would reallt hurt society if Nike or Aramark failed. 

If Duke Energy failed it would result in power outages for months while bankruptcy and asset sales occur, if there is no government intervention to keep the power on."

2021-03-19 21:58:32,wallstreetbets,"GME Elliott Wave Count - 3/19 Midday; Bulls Take Over, Wave iii underway **TL;DR** \- Bullish count (Primary) currently in control, with impulsive upside action; 5 waves complete at 227.00. Minor pullbacks expected as wave (1) of (iii) completes between $286 and $322. Breaking resistance at 231.02 confirms upside. Holding above support keeps further downside as alternate count.

Resistance (wave i): 231.02

Major Support (wave 4): 172.50 

Minor Support (wave ii): 183.58

**Discussion**

After watching GME pullback in corrective fashion in overlapping waves finally completing at 183.58 today, wave 1 of iii took off, and completed five waves quickly (which we would expect in a 3rd wave such as iii), extending beyond the standard .618 extension of i from ii, nearly hitting the .764 extension before turning down at 227. This completes 1 of iii of (1) of (iii). We now wait to see how far 2 retraces 1, and from 2 we can more accurately calculate these minute subwaves. However, with 1 extending beyond a standard fib target, each subsequent wave should also be lifted by the same number of fibs surpassed. In lifting these targets, we have the following regions: 3 \~ 264; iii \~286; (i) between 286 and 382.

**Conclusion:** As long as the minor support holds, we have room to run. Only a break of 183.58 forces us to consider today's upside as a new b wave of an incomplete ii. A break of 172.5 forces us to consider that the large green 4 has not yet completed. Alt yellow count remains, but as long as new supports are developed and held, we shouldn't worry about that for now. ENJOY the UPSIDE!

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"From minor wave 1-2 (highlighted blue), we can predict a head and shoulders formation. Its a classical formation and is very identical to the ""cup handle"" on the volkswagen short squeeze.  


I had my waves counted differently. Alt(b) was my Major A, Alt(a) was my Major B. The reason why i did this because of stock price graph. It doesnt make sense to use the data from last year because you cant extrapolate much data from it. Stemming from this conclusion, from my analysis, we are in a major wave 3 formation which must be higher than $349 (high of Alt(b) from your graph) in order to make the elliot wave valid. My estimation of peak of wave 3 is actually $586 - that'll be the golden number to reach.   
As we can predict, wave 5 will be the end goal but that depends of wave 3 can actually form -assuming this is the gamma squeeze before the squeeze.

The best thing about the waves is that the waves are above 183.58. as long as we are above 183.58 we have the ability to go even higher than 183.58. if it goes below 183.58 then it will be below 183.58 and I don‚Äôt like that but as long as it doesn‚Äôt go even lower we are above that even lower low.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sit down my smooth brain friend. You're about to gain a wrinkle.

You clearly have the cash on hand to buy the stock at the strike. So you can do a cash secure put.

Sell a put at the expiration date of choice. Pick a strike you want that's otm. So below the current share price. Since you waiting for a dip, set that as your strike. You'll be paid a premium for agreeing to buy the underlying at the agreed strike if it's at or below the strike at expiration. Just wait. The cash will be taken from you as collateral so you need to have the cash in your brokage. It'd be used to exercise. Otherwise returned if it never dips. Only gamble here is it needs to dip to get your ultimate goal 

Short term you're a üåàüêª

But it seems your play is long so stonks go up.

RH has a ton of issues, but I really can't see this as being one of them. If anything, when you buy a fractional share they're stuck holding a whole share... but that's about it. (Obviously, two people with 0.5 of a share means RH only needs 1 share total, but you get the idea)."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Collateral requirements mean that they have to have the collateral requirement put up *before* they get the stock, yes, but that's standard in T+2 settlement. This is how clearing works for any firm - though usually the collateral requirements for a firm are closer to like, 2-3% of a stock's valuation or what have you

They had to raise the capital to cover the increased collateral requirements, NOT because they couldn't buy the stock itself - that money was already in flight in user accounts and whatnot and wasn't an issue for already settled stock. 

Note that, of course, once the stock is settled, they no longer need to have that margin put up - so in effect, a 100% collateral requirement means they need to have 2x the price of the share put up. The user's money, and their own collateral money for the clearing process.

So say, they already have 100 cleared shares, and someone buys 100 more - that means that both the user's money (the money for the actual trade that changes hands between the traders) AND the collateral means that RH essentially has to front the full cost of 100 shares temporarily AS WELL as transfer the user's money out - so 2x the share price temporarily leaves RH's accounts (in a 100% margin scenario) - and that collateral is reduced/returned when the trade settles. 

So it wasn't that they had to buy the stock - it was the collateral requirement in the clearing process that skyrocketed. This collateral isn't the actual cash used to buy/sell/transfer the stock - just to guarantee during the clearing period in case something goes wrong / no delivery / broker goes under / etc."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you do full account or partial? Did you put any money in the fidelity account before hand? I just transferred GME  to my fidelity account (that had more GME lol) and was given the estimate of march 24th.  It took 3 days for me. Hope yours transfer sooner than later!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs been definitive proof either, but if that wasn‚Äôt the case, RH should have had no problem raising margin requirements like other firms have done and instead they opted to shut down buying completely. It only makes sense in the context of saving their own ass. Remember, they changed their pay model to one of a percentage of the spread, so if they route to citadel and citadel who is short, they would be incentivized by even greater than normal profit to wait on actual purchase. They would essentially be taking a short position themselves along with citadel. 

It sounds left fieldish to me, but it MAKES TOO MUCH SENSE in my gut and we know how much greed motivates stupid decisions."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,...my parents touched me improperly.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can you explain how that ""forced people to sell"""
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, they didn't have to buy 2x as much.

&#x200B;

When you have a 100% collateral requirement, that means \*while the transfer is settling\* you have to have 100% of the funds to guarantee the trade for the clearing process. Then, also, you have the user's funds going through the process AS WELL. So they are only buying one share, but effectively have the value of two tied up. 

&#x200B;

Clearing requirements (DTCC) raised collateral requirements to 100%, meaning they had to have the cash to guarantee the settlement in escrow - which eventually gets returned to them.

&#x200B;

This isn't about the end-user's account margin. I should have said 100% collateral requirement, not margin, my mistake in phrasing there. This has nothing to do with an end user's accounts. I'll edit above to make it clearer. Fixed it up there - because it has nothing

&#x200B;

And yes, it was about collateral that RH had to raise - but that wasn't the money that was actually buying the stock. The ridiculous volume is why they had to raise capital to cover the collateral, and that money was from short term credit facilities that they then turn around and pay back once collat requirements go back down."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right...

Someone needs to learn what statistics means. Statistically not a way to get rich in no way implied no one ever gets rich.

Just like saying air travel is statistically safe is not a statement that crashes never happen.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not the end-user account margin requirements (though modifying those can help - to reduce trade volume) but the collateral requirements the *brokerage itself* has to front up that would cause this issue - especially buy side, as there's no collateral requirement at all on the sell side (as there's no potential risk). That collateral is totally independent of the end-user's account themselves."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,bro calm down its the internet
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right. And if users are on their own cash, done by raising margin requirements, then RH would literally have cash in hand deposited by their users to cover 100% of GME purchases. Unless I dunno, RH went short waiting for GME to fall from 300-200 and pocket a percentage of a $100 spread of a stock bought by 10% of their users?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, my point remains. No one was forced to sell. 

No one held a gun to anyone's head and made them sell. I recognize there was market manipulation at play, but be honest with your rhetoric."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Zelle, a service most banks are (or are starting to provide) is instant account to account transfers now for direct bank payments instead of going through the ancient ACH system. And even ACH is usually next day anyway.....

Stock settlement is a whole different kettle of fish, involving a whole lot more than just transference of funds - part of the whole reason the clearing process exists is so you don't get ripped off if a broker fails to deliver, etc (hence the collateral rules).

If it was *just* funds transferrance, then it'd be the same as options - T+1 or similar (next day settlement, essentially - which is what they're revamping the stock system to go to anyway - long term project that has already been in progress before the GME situation went nuclear) - T+1 would greatly slash collateral requirements because of the trade float and mitigate a lot of this potential issue from happening again...."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nope. What happens here is that the user's cash is sent out, but during the clearing process, robinhood *also* has to have the collateral to guarantee settlement put up - so in effect, they have to have double the amount if the collateral requirement is 100% in order to do this - normal collateral requirements are in the low single percentage ranges. 

User's cash is sent out for the actual trade, RH's cash is used for collat - only difference here is RH gets the collat back *after* settlement and the user's cash is in whoever sold the share to the user."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"What a retarded take. Someone has never heard of fiduciary responsibility.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"NGL, I'm still not following 100% here.  If they have my cash on hand, what is the reason that RH would then have to put up more money?  Their part of the transaction is 100% secured with user money, it would be the counter party being able to pay out that would be in question at that point, no?  If RH would then have to put up money to secure their users in the event of counter party default, then wouldnt RH be assuming the counter parties risk?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Responsibility goes both ways. If you had been irresponsible enough to underestimate the risk, or to invest more than you could lose, you're not out of the bounds of reason to assume that one might also hold the shares in that situation.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not in finance, but I had to work like 90-100 hours a week for like a month. It was forced. I  didn't want to do it. They made me do it. So yea, its possible, but its not healthy and I never want to do it again."

I imagine if they're of the caliber to even think about applying then they must have plenty of options."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,From experience this sounds about right; Anytime I did more than 50 I just couldn't focus and 30-40 minute jobs turned into 1.5+ hour jobs
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"What the... this is WITH bonus? That's pennies for that amount of work. If they worked 40h that wouldn be like 70k, which is just a regular income."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is completely retarded. 150k in new york? That's like 80k in another city.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I do not doubt you did that *for a month*, so did I (was fun though, huge corporate restructuring turning all systems upside down). 

Still, even being below 30 at the time, I needed two weeks off after that, and during that time, mistakes were made, since one can't watch screens for that time and be awake 100%."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It might be a tad more now than 3 years ago. As a datapoint, I was a top bucket (meaning I received the top bonus) in my analyst class at one of the top ‚Äúelite boutiques‚Äù. Essentially, my shop was known to pay a lot of money. I received $95k salary and $75k bonus. Bumped up $25k total for my second year. Keep in mind this was my first job out of college, so that‚Äôs a TON of money. I got worked hard and constantly thought about quitting as the money just wasn‚Äôt worth all the mental and physical health issues. The expectation for most analysts at these high level I banks is to move to private equity or to a hedge fund. Some people move to startups, corp/biz dev, some actually stay in banking. But the greatest value banking provides is exit opp optionality.

I moved to a small PE shop and actually took a paycut, but many moved to mega funds like KKR, Apollo, Blackstone, which pay a lot more. Progressing further in finance is where you‚Äôll start making absurd amounts of $.

It‚Äôs actually an issue in the finance community for junior level talent. Top tier college grads are just not attracted to banking anymore. The money is obviously great but it‚Äôs not such a huge difference than what you can get in tech. Lots of people are moving to consulting now too."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, it is one of the only jobs (excluding some jobs in tech) that pay that much for a first job out of college. 

Also, it‚Äôs probably a bit more now. Plus, seamless stipend (bc you‚Äôre working late lol). Most importantly, it‚Äôs optionality to get into PE or a HF/ builds a lot of valuable skills even outside finance."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't understand why you are saying its not possible. Why is it not possible? You just show up to work and be there for that many hours a week.

I needed time off also, but I didn't get any time off until 6 months later when I quit. As a matter of a fact, I had to go into work every single day except two days a month for the following 6 months. There were times in the following months where I had to work 20 hours straight to solve an emergency.

My point is that a lot of shit is possible, just extremely unpleasant and tortuous, maybe even counterproductive"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I see. So its really about having GS on your CV. I work in Tech and the money can be made here as well, don't know what you mean with absurd amounts though. And agree as a grad that truly is a ton of money, as an hourly rate it's miserable though. Glad you survived it! Can't imagine working that much. Especially as a German woman these hours are just unheard of, even in banking lol. We have 28 payed vacation days and strict overtime laws. I have worked only 2 weeks overtime since 2 years and I immediately took days off to balance after that. My max worked hours a week have never exceeded 60h. And those were horrible ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|dizzy_face) so i really can't imagine working that much"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"We agree - that's exactly what I meant with my initial comment. Showing up for work, then staying a ridiculous amount of time to dispose of jizz in the restroom, then whine about it, isn't work, it's showing off for the sake of showing off."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you believe in a free market he's right. Sometimes you win sometimes you lose. When you trade in derivatives, you're trusting the person creating the derivative is creating it based on real owned assets, and if you don't feel you can trust that, you shouldn't trade in the derivative. As is, for example, on my life I would *never* buy any kind of option or derivative from Shitadel. (And since they're the source of options on my brokerage - I do not buy options.)

He's correctly analyzed that the issue (if Robinhood was not lying - and if they were, then the excuse they used) is really related to how much liquidity they had to have to ensure those trades could process, and real-time execution of trades would massively reduce if not eliminate that concern.

I'm actually immensely satisfied with this result. 

Another issue of regulation I think needs to be addressed is the way they report ownership of shares using derivatives. The methods and organization of reporting these numbers should be legally standardized - the same way tax organization was standardized with things like the FIFO rule. Free markets require accurate information - if these reporting numbers are standardized, and designed to make it impossible to hide your positions, we wouldn't see shorts hidden in ETF's anymore, for example. In this case, it would be much clearer who is producing derivatives not based on any underlying asset, and in cases of a stock being counted multiple times due to derivatives, the chain could be followed to the actual asset to get a more accurate reflection of ownership - no more fucking around with *how* you report your derivatives and ownership so you're technically not lying but the numbers are still nigh-on completely incomprehensible. 

This way, when the numbers show Shitadel is shorting more Gamestop than exists, their customers can bail in droves because they're clearly committing fraud. Or, they can continue in a fraudulent bubble market in the hopes of making a profit off it before it collapses, in full knowledge of what they're doing. Either way, they'll be making a more accurately informed choice in a free market.

I think this particular part of the issue needs to be brought up more directly with representatives, and the lack of anything addressing it is disappointing, but as far as what *was* addressed I think it was addressed correctly.

I think this issue revealed some serious inefficiencies in the market, which need to be addressed with VERY LIGHT regulation in terms of streamlining the reporting of ownership, and in the form of modernizing the trade infrastructure to facilitate real-time trading. Beyond that, I agree with his assessment. ""I'm disturbed at what I saw but I didn't find anything wrong with it."""
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,He did say there is a ongoing investigation on it. It will be 3 years before anything happens but yeah.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Huh? 
Robinhoods a private company. They can freeze selling certain equities if they want (assuming they weren‚Äôt manipulating the market, which we know they were doing but can‚Äôt prove). As consumers we have the right to not use the services of companies who would freeze trading on certain stocks. What were able to prove robinhood did (freeze trading) is disturbing but not illegal. What we can‚Äôt prove but know they did was illegal but since it can‚Äôt be proven it doesn‚Äôt matter."

I'm sure in the stock market, it has remained more than a day by design (even if the infrastructure or capability currently exists)."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey, I‚Äôve seen this story before!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You'd be horrible as a juror. Motive has to be established. Since RH admittedly froze retail investors from buying stocks we have to look at why. They claimed it was to protect investors meanwhile they admitted that they did not have the liquidity of their own positions. The ongoing attacks against this sub and its members do not align with protecting the retail investor. Can a casino kick you out for being too good a gambler? Sure. But the stock market shouldn't be an actual casino. I know we joke on here but in reality wall street changes the game and it's fundamentals. Supply and demand and prospective future earnings etc are no longer a part of informative speculation and predictions about why a stock should rise doesn't apply anymore.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm Kiwi so I'm just a horrified onlooker. Hopefully at a safe enough distance. Good luck friend.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not sure what any of that has to do with being a juror. 
Motive alone is not enough to convict anyone. I said very clearly I believe robinhood did shady illegal shit, the issue is can it be proven. As of now the answer is no. I agree with everything else you said. So I‚Äôm not sure where the disagreement is."

Not to say that there won't be anymore manipulation if settlement was instant though.

The ""Why"" is what drives our justice system. In fact, ""why"" is the universal question we all ask to seek truth."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is good DD with examples.  I would like to disagree with one point and that's that Pinterest was created as a way to organize ideas not to pivot you to a service or product. That being said, they've improved their interface and understand their user. Want to have a secret board where you plan a vacation? Perfect, your whole network doesn't have to see. Want to find a recipe, search and save.  Good to know how much its grown, gotta add this to my watch list.

Edit: OP any info on why its grown so much internationally and not as fast in the US?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is great DD! Thank you for putting this together. Wish there were more posts like this.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good dd

Overall I agree but here‚Äôs a challenge to PINS

it‚Äôs hard to bet against the leaders because in the tech space because they can innovate their service and have eyeballs on it immediately 

For instance Facebook implementing marketplace disrupting Craigslist 

I don‚Äôt know if pins is popular enough to have a moat yet but I‚Äôm not their demo"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm considering this as well. I used some crayons on a 10d chart and seems the triangle points to either break out or potential to grab down to $71.  

Im thinking of having buy order at $72 and $71.30 and alarm at $74 since that would signal the breakout.  

I'll let it bounce around in my thoughts over the weekend.  

Have any price ranges in your thoughts?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're right about the stickiness. The reason I finally committed to this stock being a major holding was when I asked myself I ever had a reason not to use Pinterest anymore. The answer was no, because of how I'm using it. It's sticky like Google in that way, but im not sure that I could say the same about Facebook. 

One of the biggest shifts I've had on my online usage has been away from Facebook and toward more productive tools. Reddit has been one of the more transformative tools I've used as an engineer and investor. One sentence stayed with me: everyone acts like a D list actor on Facebook.


Like Charlie's love for Costco, it's about the customer and what they're doing."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You can actually integrate Pinterest when using Microsoft Edge so that you can save stuff to Pinterest collections.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree with your assessment. Historically that's what it did, searching and planning seem to naturally go hand in hand and their evolution proves to show that holds true.


Pinterest is strongly feminine, so the majority of US women are Pinterest customers, while male users tend to lag behind. As the network effect evolves, the US numbers should grow before it scaffolds for international male users. So it's plateaued in that area.

At this rate, I expect to see Pinterest approach 700-1B users before demographics start to shift toward general demographics."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Could be that the US is only one country and ""internationally"" consists of the other 194 ;) so if you divide the international growth by 194 the US actually has grown faster than the average.
Although idk if Germany or some other country maybe grew even faster because there's no data in the chart."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you. I used to write DD back in the day on a different account.  It took some time to learn how to write for the WSB audience. It's a tough crowd where plenty of folk get boo'd off the stage.


I think I've been here long enough to kinda see that WSB is sorta growing up in a way. I think Palantir was a really good example at how Reddit culture is able to break down something quite complex for the layman."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,">the Covid effect is the big question mark.

That would be my only worry too. As things open up, I could see people getting out more and spending less time online. At least that's the trend I'm seeing here. On the other hand, I could totally see people starting to use it for travel.

&#x200B;

>In addition, most growth is coming internationally vs from the US

Genuine question, why would this make you bearish? This doesn't seem like a bad thing to me. In today's world, most adds can be targeted based on geography for smaller companies looking to advertise. For international ones this would just be a bonus in my eyes."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I actually never got into FB at all until recently but I use it in a very targeted way (not having a personal account and only joining groups I'm interested in). I got the idea from using reddit and twitter which is how I use those platforms. I'm just not very social (quite introverted) and FB always stressed me out - Instagram even more so. But you're right, Pinterest is one thing I've used for years on a project basis - to get ideas for home renos, outfits, vacation planning, etc. So I get what you say about stickiness. 

You also mentioned this

>Pinterest was not designed to make a user spend hours mindlessly scrolling for content. It was designed to make a sale and keep a customer happy *outside* of Pinterest.

Which I think is very interesting if you think about it. I'm definitely seeing a lot more discussions on mental health and SM's impact on this. In the circles I'm in, I hear more and more people turning away from SM in general just for this reason. I just had a virtual get together at work last week where my manager said just that. Deleted FB, insta, linked in - never been happier. And with everything starting to open up again I just see that trend continuing."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It was mostly western nations like the U.K and Germany. I can say with confidence that Pinterest will also be appreciated in Mexico soon.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good question on the international growth. I guess bearish is maybe the wrong word to use, but I think it may be similar to Netflix who always shares US vs international subscriber growth. I assume that international ad spend may be smaller than in the US, just like international subscriptions bring in less revenue per customer for Netflix."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's certainly a regional effect. In some regions of the world, Facebook is kind of like AOL in terms of utility.

A major reason I feel secure in Pinterest is for that mental health reason. I didn't want to elaborate on it in the post because it's up for debate, but I believe that condition is very real. Facebook was not built to be a healthy tool and I think that's a consequence of local group connections.


There is a huge distinction between community and connection. A facebook group and a reddit subreddit often have very different intentions and the privacy that subreddits offer really only supercharges community driven aspects."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I‚Äôll have you know I graduated top of my class in Harvard Business School, and I‚Äôve been involved in numerous leveraged buyouts, and I have over 300 million invested in my Cayman Islands bank account alone.

Facebook was not built to be a healthy tool and I think that's a consequence of local group connections.

It may be up for debate but I can speak about it anecdotally from my own experience and that of my friends. I'm a late Gen Xer so I remember the time before SM and the internet in general. I joined FB very late because initially it wasn't considered very 'cool' lol. Then I started to feel like an idiot for not having it so I joined. For the brief time I was on it my anxiety skyrocketed through the roof. At that time nobody was talking about mental health and especially not in relation to SM but I put two and two together. I closed my account and problem solved. Like I said, I do use it now but more in a similar manner to how I use reddit and twitter - to follow groups and communities I'm interested in. And hell, I still take SM breaks on the regular now. 

And now it seems a lot of other people are figuring out the same or at least using SM in a much more targeted way as I mentioned in my comment. This is a legit consideration as it's the direction I see society moving. 

>There is a huge distinction between community and connection. A facebook group and a reddit subreddit often have very different intentions and the privacy that subreddits offer really only supercharges community driven aspects.

Yes, well said. Also, as a woman (also one that works in tech) I think it's kickass that it's a company run by women but not necessarily for women. Great DD and will be buying on dips!"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,back in December some guy did a survey which said that WSB owns 5% of GameStop probably not accurate since its from 4 months ago and people could've lied but that was the only time anyone did a survey

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"There‚Äôs nine billion people here. Let‚Äôs say they all invest half of their stimulus check.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,">There‚Äôs nine billion people here.

Lol there's not even 9 billion people on the planet. 

You're making a lot of assumptions. 
A lot of the users on WSB are not American (no stimmys), there is no way to know how many subscribersactually bought GME, and there are a lot are bots and inactives as well."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Obviously should read million. $6.3 billion is correct.

100 million Americans are receiving stimulus checks. That‚Äôs 140 billion dollars. You‚Äôre delusional if you think there‚Äôs no way for retail to affect market prices."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I figured, but it was funny nonetheless!

Again though, you're making assumptions you cannot even begin to validate. 

A lot of Americans need those stimmies for actual bills and food. Not everyone is as fortunate to be able to invest. On top of that even the ones that are willing and able to invest may be scared away from 'meme' stocks because the volatility and MSM. Then on top of that, a lot of people that are still willing to invest in meme stocks are investing in others like AMC and BB.

I'm not saying retail as a whole is not making some impact, 8% is still huge. I'm just saying based off those numbers, we are not the big players, which shouldn't be a surprise. We've been talking about needing whales to turn the market this whole time."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It is actually S5E4 not E12
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only thing I disagree with is skipping Season 4. Sure, it's got some rough patches, and it lacks a lot of the charm of the three preceding seasons, but there are a fair amount of high points, and I honestly feel you could say the exact same about Season 5 (Hell, this scene is probably the highest point of Season 5). Honestly, they're both kind of hit and miss to me, and I feel every other season is better than either one."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fair, but the creator, actors, the writers, and even the literal characters in the show consider season 4 to be non-canon. Something to consider."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Season 5 has roughly 60 high points.... but okay
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't recommend skipping Season 4. In retrospect, it wasn't  bad for what is essentially ""fan fiction"". And even though Dan Harmon more or less retconned it, there's still this appreciation for Harmon's return after, and some threads still connect."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,*im high as hell and you‚Äôre about to get shot*

The world is easier when you just eat crayons"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Not blackface. Drowface. He was a Drow.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Where is this scene from?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The blackface joke was in definitely in bad taste, even if they did lampshade it with Shirley‚Äôs objections. But even so, they shouldn‚Äôt have removed the episode. Especially since it played a pivotal role in the character growth of Jeff, Pierce, and (fat) Neil, not to mention that it was called back to repeatedly in later episodes. 

If they really needed to censor the episode, which I don‚Äôt think they did, they should have just cut out the offending scene and left the rest of the episode alone."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Robert Downey Jr was a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude though. You can't go blackface as a character playing a character, your character going blackface has to be in character before deciding to go blackface. Kirk Lazarus wasn't going blackface, Lincoln Osiris was. If Ben Chang was playing, say, the Dean or Abed cosplaying as a dark elf, it would have been okay.

And now you know why derivative securities of derivatives aren't a publicly-traded thing."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"So the first clip is from a previous season where she just plays an extra, so to explain it in universe they went troy level meta and she gets a nose bleed if she contacts the IT dept because she is the IT dept"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn put your stimmy in there and yolo it again and you‚Äôll be good g
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I've been looking to implement this strategy but am having a difficult time finding the right stocks to do it with.  Is there some kind of options scanner you can use to find stocks that would be a good match for this?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Theta Gang
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you ever buy them back if the share price drops significantly? Knowing the price would go back up again you could sell again and make more money ?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way... To tendytown.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"How do you plan for taxes? This is considered short term capital gains, correct?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Much more profitable to sell weeklies at a closer strike.   

also way more risky, no?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like BB too.  Good stock, lots of upside...doesn't seem to rise and fall with $SPY as much, so if there is a bit of a correction in a few weeks it may not take as much of a hit.  


I think I like the 4/1 $13c @.34 right now.  Thoughts?  


With your 10k you can get 9 calls and collect a $340 premium for 2 weeks, roll that into another and collect $600/month with 10k in capital...6%/month sounds good to me!"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You have to do it with stocks you would be comfortable holding. For me, I like CHWY CRSR U and other ones I got"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I've heard that some people buy them back when they get 80% of their premium and then roll it into the next weeks/months options...it might give you the benefit of getting in at a better premium for the next one
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I do, but im a fidgety person so i roll up/roll down quite a bit"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have you considered the ""poor mans covered call"" (diagonal debit spread?) Not quite the same as a covered call but you can collect premium week after week but with less capital"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't live in the USA and I'm not obliged to pay taxes ;)
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is it more risky ?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right now the PLTR 3/26 $28c is .14.  Do you find a certain day or number of days out is getting you a better premium, or does this just match up with how the market is doing that day?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"How did you do this math?

Right now a $bb apr 16 $12c is .88. 

Selling 1 call gets you $88 premium.

For 2k profit i need to sell 23 options, which is 2,300 shares.  At current price of 10.95 that is 25k.

Am I calculating that correctly?

Also, what if $bb has another run to $30?  Would you hedge with a few OTM LEAPS?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,there's no need to do that if they're not near the strike price. just let 'em expire for free.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So is your monthly leverage fees less then what you are making a month? I might try this strategy
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes all correct. I'm hedging by holding my shares. (Or poor man's cash covered call strategy which I don't know much about nor it interests me). If price runs to 30$ I will be obliged to sell at 12$ on expiration
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is a need if your call is part of a spread. After hours shenanigans (big news, +50% spike) could get you assigned on half your spread and all the sudden you're $50k in the hole. Doesn't really matter though if you're just selling though."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Pin risk is always a concern...especially when looking at stocks with a lot of volatility -- hence the juicy premiums.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. U need to check with your broker
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks!  Do you find that you get the best premium selling calls on a certain day, or have any strat around that?  Do you ever buy them back once you've made a certain percentage and re-buy another month out?  Or just let them expire?

Also, do you aim for 10-15% above the current strike price?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I aim to put my strikes 15% away from my buying price, or away from last price if the current price is above my entry so I got that 15% share growth potential + premium. I try to avoid being assigned since I hold stocks I like. But if I ever do I won't be unhappy since I got that 15% extra from share growth in addition to premium. And I do monthly strikes since I can easily rearrange my portfolio"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"The Royal Navy have ordered a bunch of new frigates, which likely will use Rolls Royce engines.

The UK government have committed 80Bn pounds to the military over the next 10? Years I believe, and the Navy will get a fair portion of that being the new favourite child with all the new ships it's getting.

Rolls Royce also make the takeoff engine for the F-35B, which lots of countries have ordered."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"You know, I was about 1000 shares in on them on February 23rd, and they were one of the few stocks I was investing in that was green at the time. I ended up selling it along with all of my losing trades that day, and Yoloing everything I had accessible (gotta wait for the trades to clear because I don‚Äôt like fucking with margin) into GME that day when the price was still $45. Ended up making up every single loss I‚Äôd had since the first GME run and then some by the end of the night, selling out for a tasty profit and switching mainly to selling CSPs on stocks I liked while waiting for the next one.

I like Rycey. I love that your bullish sentiment on it is honest about the fact that they‚Äôre not a particularly good company, and they are by no stretch of the imagination a long term hold, but they can stand to benefit in the market regardless of those facts. I‚Äôm also glad that you didn‚Äôt just hit us with the ‚Äú$RYCEY was this high before the pandemic and it will be that high again eventually duh‚Äù argument, because it‚Äôs more complicated with the dilution of shares since the pandemic.

I‚Äôm going to allocate about 1%, following your lead, because I think it‚Äôs got a good chance of making some money without being a balls to the walls super success.

Thanks for continuing to share this weekly DD, and thanks for sticking around. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve been weathering the storm as WSB recovers from rapid growth, and that you still take the time and effort to make these posts.

I have a few questions, because you‚Äôre smart, and I would appreciate your perspective:

1) What‚Äôs your opinion on how this might be affected by the increasing bond rates and the current bearish and uncertain sentiment that has been permeating the market these past two weeks? For both this stock, and just long term holds in general. I‚Äôm relatively new to investing, and the only thing I know for sure is that I don‚Äôt know anything. That being the case, the territories seem even more uncharted than they were before, and I‚Äôm just trying to learn how to adjust. Considering closing most of my positions and going cash except for a few long securities that I have, but that also feels a heck of a lot like timing the market. Which, as I understand, is stupid.

2) How are you weathering the storm of rocket emojis and confirmation bias? It‚Äôs been pretty disheartening, and I‚Äôve been reading your DDs for a while and it‚Äôs pretty refreshing to see that you‚Äôve stayed strong with this, but it‚Äôs also a bummer that you‚Äôre not getting nearly the exposure your DDs deserve. Thanks for posting them regardless.

Appreciate your consistency and willingness to share your DDs."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Well... looks like I'm diversifying for some cripple swagger ü§£ü§£

But since you know more than us apes, can you elaborate on the diamond hands comment? You think most people just going to end up bagholding?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just wanted to say, I love your DD posts.  Im pretty new to the trading game and am thoroughly retarded so this shit helps a ton."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I work for RR and have been buying since before COVID. I don't think it's insider trading to say why -  I'm just an engineer and it has nothing to do with Financials or contracts, etc - but I'd rather be safe than sorry.

Personally I'd be shocked if we were trading at $4 EOY, let alone 8. I'm expecting something in the $2 area EOY with real movement happening in 2022. There's a lot of investor concern about the terms of the debt we took on to stay solvent during covid, I can't see the stock making any huge moves until we've recovered enough to restructure it."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,A good friend of mine who is a VIP aircraft maintenance lead engineer says he doesn't see RR losing market share unless someone invents a new engine of sorts. Seems good.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can you post the charts you made for RUKNY anyway, I'm kinda curious"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Curious, why didn't you mention their electric plans?"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,The colab everyone would love to see
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,where tho
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can't speak to that.  It sounds plausible on its face (it is considered a national treasure to the Brits), but across the pond they generally have a philosophy of ""too big to fail means too big to exist"", so I dunno."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think anybody who bought before the price got to 60 (I can't recall the exact day that happened) will be fine no matter how long they hold on.  Similarly those who bought at 50 after GME 1.0 crashed.  Everybody else is playing with fire.  And those apes sitting up around 400+ missed their chance to mitigate their damage the day it briefly popped to 350 and then collapsed.  The entire squeeze thesis is fucking garbage at this point, because all the shorts are sitting so far up the chain now that the apes will never reach them.  A good amount of those dudes are sitting at 425.  It's not like in January when the shorts were down in the $3 range.

&#x200B;

Expanding on that, though:  Anyone who bought AMC over $20 is fucked, anyone who got NOK over 7.  The people go jumped in $BB over 18 have a long road ahead of them but they'll get there, etc.  The concept of diamond hands is as patently stupid as the concept of HODL, because it's strictly better to sell something for big profit and buy back more of it on a drop than it is to just hold through."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,What's in your not-fun account?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I always liked ""choose your own adventure"" books."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"People keep talking about short interest but you're the first I have seen to bring up the, lacking a better term, quality of that short interest. You're right. If $3 shorts doubled-down at $400 their average short position would be a comfortable $200 right now. Hodlers will need way more capital to squeeze that"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I made 565 a week ago in one day of trading. I felt like a god. Remember this is all about earning money and learning how to be better. If I make 2k in a day that‚Äôs more than I make in two weeks as a plumber. Let‚Äôs celebrate the victories and learn from the loses.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm not complaining by any means. 2k made when I had an initial deposit of 2k was very nice.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is great and all but stop buying calls on GME. Not a shill response - but you‚Äôre helping the writers by giving them capital when those expire OTM. How many shares could you have picked up instead? üíéü§≤üèΩ

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that and the fact that ReefShark chipset is now a complete product and Nokia has overcome the challenges it had with chip related components, delivery and such. It's been a long road.

Also 5G deliveries will continue up to 10 years before 6G will come to market. So Nokia do have time to catch up and make some good profit. 

I think it's also interesting that 5G is now rolled mainly in Western countries and China and SE Asia. South America and Africa will be potential and huge 5G markets in the future alongside with the development of infrastructure."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Im not to sure about the roll out of 5G in the developing countries. The main promise of 5G is the ultra low latency that is actually only possible with a distributed network having compute power at the edge. The cost benefit ratio will be hard to bring in these countries. The ones moving forward are those with great industries that can benefit from 5G. It also needs to be considered that the frequency of 5G is not long range what is also a potential downside for the building up of 5G in developing countries. 

It‚Äôs always important to take into account that 5G is just the technology, the roll out will alway require the use cases to justify it.

From my perspective I believe products like azure stack disconnected or was snowball will be solutions where compute at the edge is required is such countries. Connectivity would then not be such an issue. IOT compute power would be given and connectivity could be solved more conventionally."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agree, surely 5G rollout in the developing countries is not going to happen in near future. Not in this decate for sure, most likely not even in next one. However I believe the world is going to change. China is already bulding the infrastructure in Africa and the development is going to take further steps. Well, that will be Huawei as 5G provider but I think that's not relevant here.

Also, it is kinda funny that we are going to have a 4G in the Moon before the country of India has even basic 4G coverage. And yes, 4G is still widely installed especially in the developing countries. When one gets a contract to deliver 4G, at some point it comes relevant to discuss upgrading to 5G. Again, perhaps not in the near future but this is a possible pathaway of progress.

However, as I see the development, it is more likely to have local 5G networks e.g. in harbors. 5G doesn't have to mean country wide coverage but it can be targeted for spesific environment to support spesific operations. What 5G can offer as its best and how the 5G is actually used in the first wave of rollout are two different realities. Anyway, I'm excited to see where all this technology is taking us to and how it is going to shape the future."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Totally agree and it is quite refreshing reading from someone who actually has some understanding of the technology, potential and realistic future vision. Are you already investing and mind sharing or collaborating on working on some decent DD?"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds about rightüëç
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Already investing. As I'm a Finn and Nokia used to be our national pride and treasure back in the days when mobile phones were a huge business for Nokia, I have kinda followed the company for years. Or you could say decades. But I'm also interested in 5G technology and what it can do and also want to understand what I'm investing in.

How about you? Still hesitating or already on board? :)"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Im already investing in some 5G related assets (chips & cloud) and evaluating the next investments (telco & robotics) in this area, currently focusing on telco companies who were considered as acting in saturated markets but having good chances of growth opportunities through 5G. I also believe that O-RAN will bring new players into the market what is holding me back from investing into Nokia or Ericsson at the moment as a good disrupter can result in some good portfolio gains

I‚Äôve also got an eye on WIFI V6 and what may be emerging there, this may be a cheeper alternative to 5G for many industry cases.

Good luck with Nokia, as Europoor I also really hope that they get the nose ahead in the 5G market."

If GME, just for instance, goes from $100 to $200, it has gone up 100%, with each increment of ‚Äú100%‚Äù representing an increase of double the original value.... & the inverse is of course true as well, meaning a drop in price from $300 to $150 is a decrease of 100%, or 1/2x the original... perhaps it‚Äôs a semantics issue, but it is correct.

A percent is obviously a different representation & notation of a decimal, & which can be represented as 0.0 (0%) to 1.0 (100%). So, if ‚Äún‚Äù represents any integer value (for simplicity), n*2 = 200% of n, n*5 =500% of n, & so on...."

If in 10 years your whole technology will be left behind, then the first few years matter more than when you have a century to fight over like the engine manufacters have.

For example electric cars where created basically at the same time as gasoline cars. Yet electric cars sees now comeback, cause engine technology evolves slow enough that it's possible to quickly advance old technology for modern standards. You cannot advance tape for modern digital standards, cause the whole paradigm was left behind.

Hydrogen engines are just being figured out, even if they won't succeed at first, the moment people realize that electric engines are for most part nearly as bad as gasoline, but also worse at everyday tasks, then the hydrogen will see a comeback as a ""green alternative"".

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"These explains are getting harder the drunker I get. Listen, stocks only go 100% if they don‚Äôt exhaust anymore. If it doubles in price, it‚Äôs up 100% compared to that number you are comparing it to. If it‚Äôs half the price from what you‚Äôre comparing to its 50% down. If you‚Äôre 100% down from a number, you‚Äôre down 100% of that number. 100% of 100 is 100. If you‚Äôre down 100% from 100 you‚Äôre down 100, meaning your at zero. Down over 100%, you‚Äôre negative.  You can be up 150% 200% and so on. But must be negative to be more than 100% down."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"That makes sense. Up 100% attack speed on 1s is double the speed. So .5s. .5 is half of 1, but this is speed in seconds. So 100% faster is attacking at double the speed."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm not going to read this, too many words. Up 100% is double. A decrease of 300 to 150 is 50% down. Because 50% of 300 is 150, so if it‚Äôs down 150 that‚Äôs down 50%. If it went from 150 to 300, well 150 is 100% of 150, so if it‚Äôs 150 up it‚Äôs 100% up.

So if 100% of 150 is 150, and a stock is down 150, it‚Äôs down 100% to 0. Which is why you‚Äôll never see a stock down more than 99%.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Math. Literally, math. Like grade 6 math."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mate you truly are retarded. 
Ok so if the price was to be $1 and see 100% increase the price then would be $2 if the price would have seen 1000% increase it would be $10 if from $10 then it sees 100% decrease then it would be back to $9. 
Your percent increase/decrease is proportional to price movement just look at a goddam chart. 

Goddam I know you guys have smooth brain but c‚Äômon look at PLUG chart and zoom out 6months the top at $74.49 was a damn 450% increase (yet was the price $450 god damn no) over the price at the start of those 6 months.

So yes I understand what you are saying but what kills me is that this article is oriented towards people having understanding of markets. People on this sub should have understanding of market which I doubt that 90% of this sub have and it just kills me to see comments like some made.

Ummmm what‚Äôs he sold? Lol"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,‚ÄûMy favourite Holding Period is forever‚Äú DFV
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"1. He did sell something like $11M worth
2. He's under a ton of scrutiny. Dumping everything would be a bad look.

If he thinks its a $400+ stock why is his highest buy at $38? $200 is at least a double. 

Go back and look at his most optimistic videos. He was speculating it might be $50-$70 as a turnaround e-commerce story."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"He did secure somewhere like around ~$11 million in profit I believed. That‚Äôs also how he was able to afford to ‚Äúdouble-down‚Äù after the congressional hearing, spent like $2 million on that move (50,000 x $40)"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Plus state taxes, depending where you live (CA - ugly)."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Didn't he buy again at $50?

And he didn't sell $11m of shares. That was options that were expiring."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Mostly from selling calls
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have been wondering about that. I doubt his original strategy included a few million people looking to him for guidance. Or being  the face of a financial saga that included government hearings, adopted gorillas and even my parents knowing what tendies are. He seems like a genuinely decent guy and that's a lot of pressure. Complicates the exit strategy."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"No. His ""double down"" was at $38. Its lightening a position. There's a reason you do it."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't know what you mean. How is buying more shares lightening his position?

And in any event, he still hasn't sold any shares as you claimed."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Options are exposure (leveraged until they get in the money). He sold exposure. I said he sold $11M worth. I don't care whether its shares/calls/short puts. Its long exposure.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Semantics. He had to either exercise or sell before they expired.

And no, it wasn't long exposure. They were expiring. And don't tell me you meant long as in not short, because you literally list short puts in your example of long exposure. 

And I still don't know what you mean by lightening his position. It implies he sold high and bought low back in again, which is absolutely not the case."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are you new to this? Its not semantics at all. The calls he bought were long exposure.  If he'd sold the calls they're short (bearish) on GME. Expiration has nothing to do with it being short/long.

They were around $12. So trading at a Delta of nearly 1. This might be condescending, but it might help if you thought of a contract with a Delta of 1 as essentially 100 shares. Them expiring ITM like that just means he has to make a choice on whether to take delivery (of 100 shares) or sell the contract. He chose to sell (or possibly take delivery and then sell due to the bid on the contract being unappealing). That reflects a view on the price."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I guess if you had 10 mil GME you specifically wouldn't, right? :)

Every single human in this world would do what DFV did. Even more, most would liquidate ALL their stocks, not just 20% of them. DFV could go for 5x the cash and he did not and instead chose to wait them out, like he urges the rest to. That speaks in itself.

So what you are trying to say still makes no sense. Try harder."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,If you're as smart as him then go ahead.. But seeing this comment chain I doubt it
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not new. This is the first accurate thing you've said. The rest was misleading.

You still haven't clarified what you meant by lightening his position by buying new shares. That makes zero sense. 

I don't disagree with your point about his view on price."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Woosh
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been saying exactly what I put in the last message the whole time. I just didn't think I needed to be so verbose.

Re: lightening. He didn't sell those options at $38. No one knows his exit for them, but barring terrible timing it was well north of that. So he lightened up at some point during the mooning and he bought more when it fell to $38. 

Him buying back in kind of stung because I'm a buyer <$30 and was waiting. I have no doubt his news was a catalyst for the price. Not to be I guess. The fact he's got something like $10m on the sidelines (maybe more, the position snapshots leave some guesswork) tells you he's lightened (or he's got some other monstrously profitable investment no one knows about)"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok I get what you're saying.

That being said, I see it a bit differently. Just because he didn't exercise his options, doesn't mean he wasn't happy with price x. So his options were nearing expiry and he had to make a decision. Pony up MORE cash, or simply lock in profits. He did the latter. Fair enough.

He then bought more at $38 or whatever. Also fair enough, and also him putting in more capital. He hasn't sold a single share at any price. That also says something about his sentiment.

Edit: I guess what I'm saying is, I can kinda see that him choosing not to exercise his calls is lightening his position. But him later choosing to buy more shares certainly isn't."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't disagree that GME is attractive sub-$40. I thought with the negative sentiment I could get it well below that. Turned out I was wrong.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"On exercising, short of portfolio balancing concerns, if I thought the price was attractive I would take delivery. Him selling at whatever price he did says a lot to me. 

He said in his congressional testimony that he thought ""the price had gotten a little ahead of itself"". You have to decide whether he meant $500, $400, $300, etc. was ahead of itself."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's a good chance it'll get there again. 

Aside from fundamentals, I have a feeling this might be shorted all the way down again and seesaw between sub 50 and 250. Who knows."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. I would just say there's a difference between choosing not to add in more cash (ie exercise) and choosing to sell. The expiry date forced that decision, but it's not quite the same thing as choosing to sell shares at a certain price."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Real talk is Citadel has likely committed fraud against the entire country, specifically against the entire financial sector. They have been accused of naked shorting and counterfeiting shares before, likely are with GME and countless other stocks at this time.

What people may begin to realize is that dilutes the value of those equities they are shorting- but it goes beyond that. Many of us hold funds that own these equities. Those funds are thereby valued lower. 

Here's the kicker- the excess capital dumped into these shorted and counterfeited shares is capital *that would have flowed into other stocks.* So not only are the stocks they are shorting devalued- stocks they don't even touch have a lower value.

They're essentially taxing the entire market. 

They've been stealing from literally everyone who owns stocks."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look, cut the fucking bullshit. No one knows when and no one knows how much this pi√±ata is going to shower down upon on us.

The fact of the matter is these dumbos think that GameStop is the video game retailer equivalent to blockbuster. They saw how powerful Blockbuster was and saw its demise. They see the condition of GameStop and predict thier demise. 

GameStop didn't die. Going forward with Ryan Cohen it will not die. Now they have to unwind a **THICK** short position. 

They have the advantage of seeing what we're thinking and what we're doing thanks to social media. We lack that luxury because they don't advertise.

Look at the charts, look at the data, look at the sentiment. GameStop is here to stay. 

They have unfavorable positions they need to close out, its helps a bunch if ""ur scared."""

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You mention AMC price in the past but SHARE DILLUTION!!!
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yo dude you might want to exit. AMC is already going under. All of your DD has nothing to do with their actual financials.

Year ended 2020 stockholder equity is -$2.85B, down from $1.2B year ended 2019. If that number stays under $0 stockholders will always get absolutely nothing per share if the company is bought out or goes bankrupt. Their book value is $-5.95B, they've had ""earnings"" of $114m once in the last 3 years and even then the retained earnings still reduced stockholder equity by $300 million. Even if they had the best year they've ever seen for the next 5 years they still won't have paid off the debt and stockholder equity will still be negative.

At this point they should be paying you to hold their absolute bottom tier equity. The unsecured notes they are issuing have a 29% Yield. That's like buying bonds from venezuela.

I really encourage you to take a look at the whole picture, not just anecdotal nonsense. Since august 2020 they issued 350 million shares. AMC was at $35/share with less than 100m share float. At their absolute peak, their market cap was substantially lower than it is now. I wouldn't be surprised at all if this stock hit $2 next week. That is a generous valuation. You could throw a dart at a board and have a 99.9% chance of picking a better stock."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"No shit, you‚Äôre not a financial advisor. Unless you just moonlight as an usher at AMC."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If someone wanted to acquire AMC, why didn't they do it when AMC was $2? I don't think anyone wants AMC, even the Chinese gave up majority rights."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah that's a policy at most places that serve food.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"My counterpoint to that is that movie theaters have to pay to lease out the movies they show, and the terms vary contract to contract, but most of that box office revenue goes towards the the production companies while the movie theaters just get a smaller piece. Sometimes, the contracts are a fixed percentage of box office revenue throughout a film's entire run. Sometimes, the theater gets an incrementally larger cut of the box office revenue with each passing weekend, it just depends

For example, a lot of theaters chose not to show 'Raya and the Last Dragon' because the contract terms were unfavorable to them. Maybe it was too expensive to lease out, or maybe the theaters were trying to negotiate a lower price because Disney was simultaneously releasing it on Disney+ with a premium due to the pandemic.

The production companies stand to make more money on a theatrical release than going direct-to-video, and most of the production companies didn't choose to release their movies that way to cut out the middleman (and if they have to use Amazon or Netflix there's still a middleman), they did it out of necessity without their primary means of product distribution. Even Disney has been withholding Black Widow for a theatrical release for a year now, even though they could have released it on Disney+ at a premium, and they might even postpone the release again according to recent news. Sony also just pushed back Venom: Let There Be Carnage from a summer release to later this fall.

Another major problem with new movies going to VOD is piracy. It's easier than ever to get an HD digital copy of the latest films with studios releasing them this way. That's why getting the theaters reopened was so big, because now all those blockbuster films are coming soon to a theater near you.

I also thought of the cruise line play, it's another good recovery stock. Different industry, but it's the same concept of riding the stock on it's way back up to pre-covid levels."

You did a much better job than I did but overall the message was the same. Short attacks to make calls expire OTM. The asshole in the news talking about how he made 10 million shorting gamestop was the hedges showing their hand. He said he was selling $250 and $300 calls. Once GME broke 300 the ladder attack dropped it down to.. 178 I believe? Now we're sitting on a $200 floor for days now. Funny that one of these fucks revealed it was the $250 and $300 calls and now the price is staying around $200. How many weeklys do you think they sold that ended up ITM?

So there's diminishing marginal return as you push the price closer and closer to the max paint put. On top of this, it may more expensive to push the price from 200 to 175 than it is to push it from 350 to 250 because there's just so much buying pressure once the price drops below 200. So the price usually settles around where the marginal benefit of more pain equals the marginal impact cost of pushing the price around."

For such a small-float stock like GME, there's no way to buy that many shares without shooting up the share an insane amount - just several thousand shares bought is usually enough to jump the price up a couple dollars (just look at the data on Yahoo or something for the past few days - see how little volume is needed to shift the share price up). So if they started to cover, we'd have noticed immediately.   
You might ask: What if they've been quietly buying a few shares every day? To which my answer is: look at the pathetic trading volume for the past many days - even if **50%** of that volume was them buying (*which is highly unlikely obvs),* that's still not enough shares to cover."

""The open market"" is my simplification of all the exchanges tied together under Reg NMS. I didn't want to try to tackle explaining what you just did in an already long post. Please help me out, I don't quite understand yet why that's so misleading? There is a lot of liquidity hanging around to take.

""Take the other side of your trade"" is actually the SEC's wording not mine. Please check out the graphic. My worry with internalizers is that they create information asymmetry between themselves and the rest of the market. Shitadel can still pay me at/better than NBBO banking on the idea that they'll be able to make more money off everyone else not ever knowing how much retail volume they're getting. A simple example would be: pay a little bit of premium to internalize a bunch of buy orders, long vega while IV is low because everyone else thinks retail isn't buying, and then buy the net position of all those orders you internalized from a bank MM (paying significant impact cost, yes) but making more money off the appreciation of your options derived off the ""open market"" prices. Can you point out any flaws in this?

Also, what other fallacies jumped to mind in my original post?"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hi, and let me first apologize for my seemingly harsh wording in my comments. WSB seems to favor sarcasm and blatant saying and I suppose I fell into that habit as well. 

In short, the simple and direct mistake you may have made is assuming that trades taking place in a dark pool or against a PFOF MM don‚Äôt register on the market. [They are](http://www.mit.edu/~zhuh/Zhu_darkpool_RFS.pdf). The term ‚Äúdark‚Äù in dark pools only refers to pre-trade information about an order, [but post execution these order are treated like any lit order and are reported and posted on the consolidated tape. ](https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/104306/effect-of-dark-pool-traded-volume-on-current-tape)

But the more interesting part of your posts was in my view the idea that there might be some ‚Äúopen market‚Äù where some of us are excluded from and deprived of because an evil MM hijacks our orders on their way there. Let‚Äôs review: 
So, what is ‚Äúan open market‚Äù? It‚Äôs important to understand that the National Best Bid and Offer, as displayed on the SIP (Security Information Processor), is a crucial price reference, yet it‚Äôs nothing but an aggregated survey of top-book orders on various lit trading venues, rather than tradable liquidity. For the most part, traders would subscribe (retail traders often through their brokers) to [CTA ](https://www.exegy.com/2019/12/consolidated-tape-nyse-feeds/) to get a snapshot of a virtual consolidated book. 
However, this is mainly used originally to help institutions to mark-to-market their portfolio, and isn‚Äôt useful for trade execution. 
Let‚Äôs look at an example: 
If I only subscribe to lvl1 data feed with my broker (or use a shitbroker like RH), I might see stock XYZ available at 
1200x20.21 : 20.23x2000
Say I want to buy 1900 shares of XYZ, and looking at the SIP I conclude it shouldn‚Äôt be a problem (2000 on the offer, I‚Äôll just lift them) so I hit the buy button for a market order. 
What is lost on many retail traders is the fact that it‚Äôs very unlikely that there are actually 2000 shares available on the offer by a single market maker who is quoting in a single exchange - the 20.23 x 2000 may consist of 
BATS 210
EDGEX 550
NSDQ 340
NYSE 300
PHI 250
ARCA 450 
* I listed different exchanges and ECNs on purpose, but let‚Äôs keep in mind that the exchanges don‚Äôt trade, different MM (all of them HFTs, including Citadel) provide this liquidity in the exchanges)

So there is no meadow, no single open market; My broker is responsible of routing my buy order to the right venues, and the way they‚Äôll do it depended on my order modifiers (market/limit, routable/non-routable). For simplicity we will assume my broker sends an ISO (Inter-market
Sweep Order) so my order will eventually be broken down to pieces and routed to 6 different exchanges, but NOT NECESSARILY by my broker, because BATS gets it first but cannot fill me on more than 210 (Reg NMS) so they must re route it to the next exchange instead of filling me at 20.24 (my order won‚Äôt go deeper into the book before all 20.23 offers on all lit exchanges have been cleared. 

Now, my broker may also have access to dark pools such as Merrill Lynch or Goldman Sachs‚Äô pools, or send it directly to a specific MM who‚Äôll pay for the privilege of trying to fill me at price improvement. This has no effect on me, and when the trade fills, IT IS reported to FINRA and posted on the consolidated tape. 

So the phrase ‚Äúopen market‚Äù is a little bit anachronistic and misleading, there is no ‚Äúone big market‚Äù for our orders to get filled."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the clarification.

Regarding the consolidated tape, odd-lot trades in Shitadel's dark pool do not need to be disseminated by SIPs, which entails that only Shitadel knows about any internalized order for less than 100 shares. With GME trading over $200, that includes any order under $20k, that's where the ability to hide retail volume part comes in."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you are referring to odd lots not being displayed on order book? 
Well that is true for any exchange anywhere; If RH sent your limit buy order for 11 GME shares  to NYSE directly, no one in the world would see it either. Exchanges do not display odd lot orders on the book (to avoid ‚Äúwhite noise‚Äù) but will fill (and report) such orders when able to match them with orders from the other side of the book. 
Could this be what you‚Äôre referring to? 

The tape (times and sales) will display odd lots matches, usually marked ‚Äúbasket trade‚Äù on some systems (due to they way the broker executed them)."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit GM3 has earnings after hours on Tuesday, prepare accordingly."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"*enters chat*

See‚Äôs Fanny is losing at basketball again just like she lost at uno.. when will she learn"
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"All right, so here's a little thing I like to call, ""everything you learned in school is a lie"".

Since we're all talking about basketball it might be fun to do a little experiment. Thought experiment will do, but it's better if you use a real prop. You'll need a ball and a sharpie or (if you don't feel like ~~improving~~ ruining a perfectly good ball) some rubber bands large enough to fit around the ball. 

In school you learned that the interior angles of a triangle must add up to 180 degrees. For example, a 30/60/90 triangle has angles inside the shape that add up to 180, and these brazen fuckwits have the gall to tell you that's how *all* triangles are. We're going to show just how wrong they are. 

You're going to take your ball and draw a circle around the middle. Then you're going to take and draw a second circle the is directly perpendicular (at a right angle) to the first. Now you should have two circles that make an X when viewed from the side. Now you're going to take and draw a third circle just like the second, but also perpendicular to the second one so that no matter which side you look at it makes an X.

Now look at what you've done. You've broken reality, you magnificent bastard. Take a look at one of the triangles you just made. In one corner you've got a right angle, 90 degrees. Now trace over to one of the other corners. Also a right angle. Same with the third. That adds up to 270 degrees. ""But u/Flying_Madman, in school I learned that the interior angles of triangles added up to 180 degre..."" THEY LIED TO YOU! I bet you also believe that squares have corners. 

More lies. Look down on your ball from above and what do you see? That's right, four equilateral triangles. And as you were taught in school, four equilateral triangles = a square. Now find me the corners. Go ahead, I'll wait. Except no I won't, I haven't got that kind of time, because there *are* no corners.  Wherever you think there's a corner it's actually just a straight line. Why? Because there's a right angle on either side, and two right angles add up to 180 degrees -which means it's a straight line, no corners to be had. You might have *thought* you were drawing a circle when you made that first line but you weren't. You were drawing a *God damn square*.

What is this weirdness where triangles have 270 degrees of interior angles and circles are actually squares and everything you learned in school is a lie? Fucking curved manifolds, that's what. It's all because the surface of the ball is curved in three dimensions that makes reality as it applies to 2d planes break down. You think that shit doesn't apply to three dimensional space? Have a look at your watch list/positions and tell me there's not a fundamental problem with reality at the moment. Or maybe your entire conception of life, the universe, and everything is fatally flawed. Maybe that's why GME closed at 200 and KTOS closed below 26. Maybe that's why you lose money and it isn't about being terrible at this game at all!"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I, uh, I don't think there's actually been extensive DD done on either one... SOXL is a 3x ETF on semiconductors, and there's a semiconductor shortage at the moment, so the mfgs should be doing really well. KTOS makes drones, so if we go to war or we just start blowing people up again they ought to moon. That's... that's about it. 3x leverage in a hot industry and a company that makes things for blowing people up. What more do you need to know?"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's definitely been doing really well, but I'd be cautious long term. Well, I'm not in it at all so it hardly matters what I'd do, lol. 

AMC is pretty much doomed. Even before Covid they were losing market share both to Netflix/YouTube/Hulu/etc
.. and to more ""premium"" type theaters. They've been shut down for basically a whole year now doing nothing but bleeding even more cash. Opening back up will help them *a lot*, but if they don't do something big, they won't last more than two years. They've been raising cash by issuing new shares, but that's only a temporary solution, and it's bad for the share price. 

Thing is, it's kind of got caught in the meme/short squeeze thing. I never would have guessed that it would run up again after the main peak, and if you'd asked me two weeks ago I'd have said dump immediately and don't look back. Today? IDK, if you're up 30% you're doing better than me!

There are a few options. Depending on how many shares you have, one option is to sell call options using them as collateral. (Calls are a promise from the seller to sell shares at a specific price on or before a given date. If you're the seller you get paid for doing that). The benefit there is that lets you turn the *time* that you're holding for into *money*, which we like. The risk is that if the strike price is too low you can miss out on profits if the price of shares goes higher.

Another option is to cash out a part (take profit) - you can always buy back in if you want to, and once you cash out you can't lose that money if it crashes. That's a pretty common thing we do here. I'm trading entirety on house money now since I've withdrawn more than I put in.

And, of course, you could hold a while longer. It really isn't showing any signs of slowing the meteoric growth, so why not? The big risk is that you're going to miss it if it crashes and lose all your money before you can sell. There's no sign it's going to crash yet, but it probably will, and when it does it's going to be quick and savage. Personally, it's just not worth the risk to me, and you're talking to someone who just lost 65% in a month playing options. 

You know, a nice middle ground might be selling calls and using the money to buy puts (puts are the opposite of calls, they let you sell at a given price, so if it drops you can still sell your shares for a profit). You can get as complex as you want once you start trading options, but that one's pretty simple. For playing options, you need sets of 100 shares, so there's a bit of a barrier to entry there. 

Me? I say cash out some and let the rest ride. If you've got enough shares, maybe do the call/put thing. It'll give you a bit of a hedge against a big crash and probably not east into your gains too much."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs gone over $76 a few times just depends on how long you want to hold on to it. I sold this morning when it hit just under $72. It keeps going between 68 to 77. I think it will work it‚Äôs self up to 80-85 by the end of the year
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I am like a hold for at least 6 months.  I would be disappointed to be tied up for a year with it if that would mean I could have found a better horse for the money but you might be right.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,But low sell high. Sold his morning when it stayed around $72 so made a little in less then 24 hours. Only thing is I went back in to GME after it dipped a little late and lost most of my gains by the end of the day.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I had bad timing.  It happens now and then.  I have my victory stories but I don‚Äôt have a crystal ball."

I lost a very lucrative performance for which I didn't break a sweat I made in 2020 on GME. But I don't care and holding even when I could've gotten out with handsome profits. Just because I like the stock. Not a financial advisor here.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way. Holding until I make profits.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is awesome I have those exact two alerts for the same reason. Only looked at charts on the open and the close it‚Äôs reduced my stress levels a lot

Again Fibs are a probability and don't work by themselves. You also have to depend on other things like  price action, past S&R, RSI & MACD  indicators, volume etc

If fibs haven't worked for you then may be you're not using them right or have an expectation that they're the ONE Magic formula that will make you a successful trader. Sorry to burst that bubble but there isn't any such thing in trading."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's the basics. There's a lot more to it. Knowing how to determine whether the price on calls is worth the risk, how to not get IV crushed, theta banged, knowing how not to lose on your winning plays (i.e. let it expire ITM by not having enough cash to exercise, and not selling on time), knowing the underlying market mechanisms how clearing houses hedge against sold options, how added value of exercising ITM options can sometimes go with a premium because big players can exercise them without causing market moves, ability to sometimes sell your options to your own broker and instead of exercising it or letting it expire they can do some vodoo magic to cover other positions, etc, etc. I'm not even sure everything I listed is correct, there's a lot of stuff under the hood."

 Or, if they choose not to raise capital, this means that they don't need no stinking capital = Positive Catalyst. 

 If GME was so much as mention esports in their earnings call, = Positive Catalyst. 

And finally and maybe most important of all, if a butterfly lands on a flower in Japan, for GME this equals \*positive catalyst\*

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Is everyone here seen dumb. If they need 100m to help transition to e commerce they should absolutely take it.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought you said that the re-opening demand is only priced into the futures but the spot price of crude has sharply risen as well so the demand is already here.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,So I was saying that the speculation of the future demand against the supply appears to have been priced in. The price doubled while trying to find equilibrium and that increase in my opinion is to a large degree ‚Äúpricing in‚Äù an increase in demand against current supply projections.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I think the the 25+ million barrel build in inventory pretty clearly shows current demand is less than current supply unless I‚Äôm not considering something

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well I can recommend reading material for reading charts (""Japanese candlestick charting techniques"" is a book all about candles. ""Volume price analysis"" by Anna Couling will help you understand a lot more about price action (both can be found online PDF free), and you can practice with paper trading to apply the principles, and there are lots of things out there for learning chart patterns like wedges and ascending/descending triangles. Read about exponential moving averages(most common are 9, 13, 50 ema) and VWAP. You have to combine all the skills. 

Options are just a step further to see how well you can predict action, but riskier because of timing element. If you understand how to place options and how the price target and expiration date effects your money.. then you just have to use your knowledge to make a reasonable bet. Options are a fight against not only the charts, but time. So it's really experimental. I began my options testing last year, I haven't read anything or studied specific strats, I just use my knowledge of charts and keep my risk low.

My best bet starting off would be to never do low timeframe options until you get better at timing, that will decrease your losses significantly. instead of a 2 week option.. do 4. 

It's not really about winrate, it's about profit taking and risk management. You can be right 50% of the time as long as you make more than you lose. and that relies on your ability to buy near an optimal value close to your sell point if things go wrong, to minimize your loss"

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop it with the doom and gloom bullshit on the Russell index. This company literally is printing money in the hottest housing market in decades (maybe ever when it‚Äôs all said and done). Chill out and let a good performing company make you some cheddar. Fucking relax.

Hoping to see a price bump early next week when it's included in that russel index thingy."

The Smith-Mundt Modernization Act was a part of the H.R. 4310 National Defense Act.

It was signed into law. Please leave your propaganda in /r/politics

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you wanted people to know what you‚Äôre talking about, maybe you should give a link backing up your claims to begin with, or at least refer to the relevant law with correct terminology.

As far as I can tell, that law doesn‚Äôt do what you think it does. Do you have any examples of the propaganda that resulted from this law? If not, then maybe you don‚Äôt know as much as you think you do."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You commies are *so far left* that you think fucking 0bama was on the right. Like Jesus fucking christ. What are they brainwashing you kids in school??
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,You're so myopic that you think communism is the only thing to the left. Incredible. Clearly they didn't teach you a damn thing in school. Communism is a disgusting sister philosophy to capitalism - the both of them are flawed offspring of enlightenment economics that focus on the individual as little more than a unit of capital.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Negative, lol - although through some twist of the universe, I've dated several....

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,This GME craze has made it painfully obvious just how many news headlines are just stolen/copied from other major news networks.  One culprit made up some BS and every news outlet around the world just ran with it.  It MUST be true if CNBC said so right?
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"How‚Äôd that ‚ÄúFriday squeeze‚Äù you were all trying to hype go, you fucking idiot? Did you catch those mean ‚Äúhedgies‚Äù off guard with your quadruple-nunchuck-sneak attack-mondo Friday gamma squeeze? You are a joke.

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,I think you‚Äôre actually retarded.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"I want to thank you for this. Admittedly I am an inexperienced trader, but I have been doing my best to learn since I fomoed in January. 

What I have learned so far is how much ambiguity exists in the market, along with speculation based on lack of complete data. Inherently, I distrust HF, so in hindsight, I let myself accept conclusions/DD that I did not validate personally. 

I hope earnings go well on Tuesday and hopefully it gives GME a little bit of a catalyst. I plan to close my more expensive positions, and let the positions I have already paid off in gains ride.  

I lurked WSB back in the day, and it wasn‚Äôt anything close to what it is now sadly. It‚Äôs hard to bring up counter arguments without getting attacked. For what it‚Äôs worth, I appreciate your effort to point out some of the inconsistencies with the thesis of others."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, I appreciate your discernment and positive feedback. Hoping for the best for you."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"well now that everyone is panicking and gonna sell Monday...I don't see it doing anything I thought it would now....still a long game, but it's no longer the ""squeeze"" I thought it'd be....how disappointing, but hey, that's casino for ya."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"So at this moment now because of the Russel Index and the sell off we're gonna see on monday....it's gonna be a while before it hits what it should be worth....this game just became a long hold game....but then again that's the market place for you...squeezes and pnd are few and far between....still, the stock is definitely undervalued right now and when it drops on monday, if it gets really low, I would recommend holding it for long term if you have the cash to do so. As for the amount, I still think eventually it could hit $20 eventually, but then again I could be wrong, I know nothing about any of this stuff."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"So I just check my bank (Schwab) and they have tons of shares of GME so I should be okay

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,AMD's GPU's are pretty competitive with Nvidia when it comes to performance/price. Moreso on Linux since the free drivers fix some of the driver issues in the official drivers.
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"In the budget conscious tiers, DLSS improves performance so much on nvidia cards that AMD can't compete. Also, there isn't a significant enough people gaming on Linux to even include that. Also, Intel is releasing its GPUs soon, which I would assume are going to share the same space of budget oriented cards so AMDs market area is going to get crowded even more."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"> The cow gets its food for free as well. The farmer makes money from the cow. That does not make the cow the customer. 

The point is that the cow is getting something for free, so it is the product. I don't know how you can fail to understand such a basic analogy. 

The data Robinhood gets isn't where it gets its money, it's the payment for order flow, it's explicitly said right in the article. This is another thing you have failed to understand."

03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,For sure don't be afraid to sell them too close to the current price. Worst case scenario you lose shares and switch to selling csp. Look up the wheel method to learn some more about it. Pretty safe way to make consistent gains

\-BABA is not under investigation. Tencent, Softbank and 4 others were. WSJ mentioned fines of 950 million US$ possibly. Tencent was fined 75k in the end.

\-BABA needs to sell it's mediabranch, which is a positive for the stockprice."
03/20/2021,wallstreetbets,"What did they actually do? Require the ANT group to adhere to banking regulations, because they offer financial services. This was bad for the evalutions of the BABA stock,
