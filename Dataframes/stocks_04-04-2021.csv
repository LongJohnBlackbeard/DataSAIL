04/04/2021,stocks,i just paid the fee. fractional shares get liquidated during the transfer
04/04/2021,stocks,I’ve heard from other individuals on Reddit that Fidelity waived the $75 fee.  I think it depends on how much you’re investing.
04/04/2021,stocks,"I did this a couple months ago. I just sold in RH, withdrew the money to my bank and deposited it in fidelity. If you're not worried about the ups and downs during the week or so it'll take to do that process then just do that. 

A note about fidelity, when you deposit there you don't get instant access to the funds like on RH. So you can't buy right away. The money has to clear from your bank."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Transfer to connected bank, and then bank to fidelity"
04/04/2021,stocks,Link the fidelity account to Robinhood and withdraw straight into it.
04/04/2021,stocks,If you're just holding a bunch of fractional shares it's not worth the transfer fee. I'd sell and withdraw the money from robinhood straight into fidelity. You can rebuy your positions or open new ones. Unless you think you're gonna lose out on more than 75$ in gains in 3-5 days it takes to transfer it isn't worth it.
04/04/2021,stocks,I would get out of RH immediately lol
04/04/2021,stocks,Didn’t know about the transfer fee
04/04/2021,stocks,If your account is over 2500.00 Fidelity will (currently) reimburse the transfer fee. Under 2500.00 call customer service and request it.
04/04/2021,stocks,you can if you enable margin. robinhood instant deposits are margin accounts. the bank transfers happen pretty quickly with fidelity if done during trading hours
04/04/2021,stocks,This is what I did. Zero fee.
04/04/2021,stocks,I’ve recently invested in SCHD.  I got in a few weeks before the Ex Date and received over 4$ of dividends which I’ve reinvested. Not bad of a return on a 600$investment. Has a low .06% expense ratio.

04/04/2021,stocks,I’m curious to see responses as well...good question 😎 thx
04/04/2021,stocks,IMO ARKx is going to go crazy. I think there will be an explosion in space tech and breakthroughs within the timeframe you are speaking of
04/04/2021,stocks,ARKK is the best one I found so far.. it have been averaging 10% a month yearly. It has a lot of tesla shares. Cathie Wood is the woman behind it. Dona little search on her.
04/04/2021,stocks,VFINX dca and forget about it. It’s been a great safe play.

04/04/2021,stocks,"GE manufacturers various ECG carts and their MUSE system integrates with all EMRs.  GE tends to come out with new equipment every 3-5 years and require software upgrades pretty frequently, so upgrades through capital expenditures are relatively frequent at healthcare facilities.  But COVID is a clotting issue, so I think you would want to focus on PV diagnostic systems, not ECGs.  Pt’s are getting venous Doppler exams and echoes as standard practice for COVID.  Again, GE.

However, Let me suggest a different option.  Focus on  obesity effect on the heart and not COVID.  67% of the population is overweight or obese. Obesity increases the risk and incidence of a-fib, MI, and CHF.     All of these dz states increase the need for implantable devices (e.g., pacemakers, ICDs, implantable loop recorders, etc.).  The leading manufacturer for these is Medtronic.  It’s trading slightly above its 10-year regression average, so it might dip a little with rising interest rates in the near future, but I think you’ll be rewarded much better going in this direction.  Just my opinion as a cardiovascular program administrator."
04/04/2021,stocks,$GE
04/04/2021,stocks,Awesome info. Much appreciated. I’ve had a pretty well performing stake in GE since November but may re-up at the next dip. I’ll look into Medtronic too
04/04/2021,stocks,Is there a reason for buying the ARKK positions directly rather than the ETF?
04/04/2021,stocks,"Same age but slightly different composition of portfolio. 50% split between palantir, nio and paysafe. The rest in various spacs . 
Personally your risks have been mitigated by opting for VOO, INRG and VHYL.  
If I may ask, how much are you currently playing with ?"
04/04/2021,stocks,"Don’t stop swinging. Swing trading works. It fails when you bail on the strategy. It would be like a dividend investor bailing after a week from not making enough dividends. 
   Watch Moneyball and trust the system. If you were 64 then fine go and buy ETFS, SPY, QQQ, etc...
Swing the bat. Hit home runs. Once that is done, then is the time to “play it safe.”
    This isn’t financial advice, but I sure wish my money were up to bat at your age, instead of sitting on the bench (401k). 
     That being said, long term investment I like going heavy on the Aristocrats. Reinvesting dividends.
Maybe go middle of the road and buy solid ETFS and sell covered calls, which you reinvest the premiums on buying more shares.
      This isn’t financial advice. If I were smart it’s what I would do, but I am a gambler by every definition of the word. 
      Don’t worry about making mistakes at 24. You should worry about thinking you don’t make mistakes.

04/04/2021,stocks,"> I'm 24 and well employed so I have a fairly high risk tolerance and long time frame, but naturally I don't want to be making any obvious mistakes borne of inexperience.


Ok. 


> 25% VUSA (VOO)


Seems kinda small. 


> 25% VHYL (not sure of the US equivalent)



DWX or VYMI maybe? IMO, I subscribe to the dividend irrelevance theory. So obviously I think investing into an ETF for nothing but dividends is a bad idea. 


> 30% ARKK (buying the positions directly rather than the ETF)


30% pointed towards pure speculation isn’t exactly the smartest thing to do. Seems more like FOMO and chasing returns than actual investing. 


> 10% INRG (ICLN)


Buy high, panic sell sell low. The Reddit way. 


> 10% Individually chosen and mostly highly speculative stocks, none making up more than 2% of my total portfolio. Most likely chosen from the best of the SPACs I've been trading the last 6 months. 


what do you think your “ARKK” holdings are. You’re pushing 40%+ into pure speculation and gambling. 


> Am I taking too much risk? Not enough risk? Is there any overlap I may have missed? What are your thoughts?


Bad. IMO it seems like you’re chasing returns which never works out. “Adding risk” would be like adding 10% towards small cap etfs or 10% towards speculative stocks...not 40%+. Ngl, I have a problem with how Reddit defines “risk tolerance,” too many times it means yoloing money on speculation, that isn’t risk, it’s gambling....and it’s a great way to lose money fast. 


Plus right now it’s easy to sit back and say “I have a high risk tolerance,” wait till you have a bear market, you’ll be panic selling. 



IMHO; if you just had 80% in VOO, 10% in QQQ and 10% in a small cap index fund, you’d beat 99% of people on this sub if they’re honest about their returns AND you’d have less volatility than them over the long run. At the end of the day it’s your money, if I were you’d I’d look into proper portfolio allocation and limit speculation and individual stocks. 


This comment is not financial advice."
04/04/2021,stocks,"If you feel like you’re a “smart” beginner that wants to be a bit more active rather than passive. 
Follow a list of 30-50 stocks that you; like, don’t give a fuck about, energy, etc. Just get a diverse group. 
Set a week-2week trading goal. I.e if you are playing with 2k maybe your goal is $200 gain. I typically do a 4 stock spread, diff industries, buy low/staggered. Don’t be afraid to sell for $60 profit in a day. (25% of your goal). If your shit dips, just hold it. Why not? You came to take profits. 
Then you’re trading $1500 biweekly until your $500 comes back. But you are only ever weekly trading up to $2k.
If you avg $200.00 biweekly you’re looking at $5,200.00 worth of growth over a yr off that $2k. (write these trades down. It helps keep track through your port and limits you.) It is very possible in this market. (PENN can be played as it swings from 100-130)

04/04/2021,stocks,"A good question is how old are you and how risk tolerant are you.

04/04/2021,stocks,You could hold it in cash and invest when there are dips but dollar cost averaging will probably net you the same return in the long run
04/04/2021,stocks,Yes. The market will always make new all time highs and continue going higher over time. It is impossible to correctly predict tops and bottoms so dollar cost averaging to get the average price is the way.

04/04/2021,stocks,"Could do that. 

Vxus contains the same companies that are in vwo, just in smaller proportions. 

I recommend investing both in and outside the us for long term investments."
04/04/2021,stocks,Right but you might still want some money for emergencies available instantly. It’s been suggested to me to invest 70% keep 30% extra money aside but it’s always up to you I’m not a financial advisor just trying to help 😃

04/04/2021,stocks,Fair enough. I hope OP already has an emergency fund before even considering investing.
04/04/2021,stocks,"Having an emergency fund should be common sense. If op already has one then investing the 2k into VTI would the ideal choice since historically it provided a 20% annualized return. It’s relatively safe and if VTI goes down significantly, there’s bigger problems in the US."

04/04/2021,stocks,"Reason is CHPT ha more chargers, and more products lined up. They have home/residential chargers and chargers for apartments. They also have level 3 chargers available but not as many deployed. I am more bullish on CHPT than on EVgo tbh long term because I think more people are going to charge at home and CHPT will be able to satisfy that"
04/04/2021,stocks,"I have a sizeable position in CHPT around 22.

CHPT is better for the following reasons, of course, imo:

1.) Old board member of CHPT is a part of Biden's administration

2.) CHPT does have level 3 stations. They also sell NEMA 14-50s.

3.) TSLA is a closed network. I never see other cars at TSLA stations.

4.) Some cars cannot level 3 charge.

5.) The grid cannot support all chargers being level 3. It is likely that government contracts will be for mostly level 2 chargers and some level 3 chargers. Most gov businesses close after 4:30, so charging overnight is not going to be an issue.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Forgot to add, CHPT is actually currently valued higher. These are the reasons why it is probably valid and also explains the recent run. It literally is just back to post-merger prices and SPACs usually drop post-merger. Analysts have marked fair value in high 30's to 49, I believe."
04/04/2021,stocks," Apart from the fact that Chargepoint might have a large share of charging stations around the US, I'm questioning their and EVgos business model. Selling electricity isn't going to bring in huge margins on the long run, since the future of charging your EV is at home.

That's why I set my eyes on Volta, which is going public via a SPAC. People can charge their car without costs for 30 min. How do they make money? They simply put advertisement screens on their charging stations. So no matter how little the station is being used, Volta is still making money: [https://voltacharging.com/advertisers/](https://voltacharging.com/advertisers/)"
04/04/2021,stocks,Still new to stocks. Why does it matter more?
04/04/2021,stocks,"From what I've seen, they have a lot of level II charging stations while other companies have more of the fast charging stations. Tesla and EVGO seem to have more fast charging stations from what I've read"
04/04/2021,stocks,"Nr 3 is a major thing, at least internationally. Tesla really messed up by having a different standard then the rest of the market since its made them unattractive for new charging stations. Unless Tesla build their own, or pays a subsidiary to do it, they'll remain few. Meanwhile ""open"" alternatives like these are getting more widespread and is a crucial part on modern city planning (can't be proprietary)"
04/04/2021,stocks,"I mean, couldn’t an experienced player such as ChargePoint easily pivot and add something like this to their stations? Doesn’t really seem like a novel idea."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Just comparing price per share without knowing how many shares are outstanding is comparing apples to oranges.

04/04/2021,stocks,"Market cap is the market value of outstanding shares. Share price is the market cap divided by the number of shares.

Take PINS and PLTR as an example, which have similar market caps (eg the size of the pizza is the same).

PINS is trading around 78/share while PLTR is trading around 23/share. This means that PLTR has more shares (eg more, smaller slices of the pizza)"

What do you mean internationally? Tesla 3s in Europe use CCS, not a proprietary connector like they do in the US."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Yeah, and their network is way bigger. Just like how people cite CHPT doesn't focus in level 3 charging. They can easily pivot once the infrastructure allows since they do have fast chargers. 

People are really overstating ad revenue and how scalable it is for the EV space. I've posted this before, but these kind of responses make me really question if someone owns an EV. In my Tesla when I charge outside my home, I am either shopping inside, at work, or sitting inside my car. If I'm forced to watch it through the app, I'll just do something else and not even pay attention.

I already have trouble finding chargers that are empty sometimes, and lol, I couldn't imagine how many people will use the 30m of charging and then leave their car there seems like a nightmare."

1. Register to vote where you are a resident. 
2. Receive voter ID card in the mail to your residence. 
3. Go to a polling location. 
4. Show your picture ID and your voter ID card and have your name checked off the official voter role. 
5. Enter a private area free of campaigning, pressure or coercion. (That includes the coercion of being given free water bottles) 
6. Vote your conscience privately. 
7. If you have committed a felony against our society: no vote for you. 

This is a free and fair election. This suppression nonsense is embarrassing to listen to. If the level of discussion gets any less intelligent, we may as well wear animal skins, and live like primitive forest dwellers."

04/04/2021,stocks,"That's pretty much where I'm at. Maybe they're trying not to alienate investors with strong opinions. It would be the logical business move. If I'm sitting here doubting my decision to hold or sell, it's working to some extent. I don't look for ""woke"" companies specifically, but it does help me sleep at night."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Absolutely. I refuse to buy Facebook because they're overtly evil. Southwest, not so much. But they're also not using their clout in any meaningful way. I'm considering giving them 3-7 days to put together something meaningful, but that time line isn't based on anything I actually know.

04/04/2021,stocks,Nothing wrong with investing in companies you like for whatever reason but keep in mind just about none are clean. I mean you’d have to throw out just about every company that deals with China for example. Or pollution or whatever your bag of tea is. In the end you get left with just a bunch of penny stocks
04/04/2021,stocks,I'm just saying you shouldn't expect a response form southwest or really many companies. And at the end of the day if they do give a response it's not really going to change much. The companies putting out responses are most likely headquartered in Georgia like coke.

04/04/2021,stocks,"The opposite actually. I was hoping for contrary thoughts to balance what's already in my head. I'm just trying to make the best decision. Yes, money is the name of the game, but I'm also a human being that cares about other stuff."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Not at all, that's nonsense and you're making a ridiculous strawman. I'd you don't know better then don't comment, instead of spreading ignorance.



Ethical investing can be as deep or as shallow as you like. Merely saying you won't invest in Chinese stocks is by definition ethical investing. So is cutting out drugs, porn, weapons and slave/child labor. While yes, it limits your options, it doesn't make it impossible or unprofitable. The Church of Sweden follows this mantra and is world leading in ethical investing in no less then 700 (!) carefully audited companies. They've invested billions and are, quite frankly, having great returns. OP should follow their model"

China is the one going ham on development but once those countries get developed big stable corporations from the US can move in to compete unless China has been pushing their stuff during the development operations mainly because in places like Africa where they give them electronics and cable infrastructure being able to advertise and get them to buy the Chinese stuff which the government already did hence the massive development projects.

Been bullish on Microsoft for a few years now and given current performance and news coverage , there is no reason to think otherwise still... Covid or no Covid, I think Amazon is only getting started , AWS currently makes up majority of the actual profit margins earned, even minute earnings increases from other operations will blow the EPS through the roof, make the current PE seem cheap, so I’m bullish. Facebook and google are solid too, I just like to stay away from stocks that are more likely to get hit by “political grenades” (I know Amazon can be in the press sometimes, but not to the extent as FB and GOOG). Apple is very solid too, I just chose Microsoft and Amazon. Only one I’d be slightly iffy on is Netflix , they have a lot of growing competitors and could face headwinds.

I think overall though for the perspective of FAANGM, people look at current market caps and PE ratios etc.. and think these have the overvalued.

And Amazon? Not only do they have *a lot* of upside geographically, chiefly in India, but Amazon Prime is only growing, AWS too, they're expanding their offerings via grocery, etc.

>Meanwhile Alphabet can be hurt by regulation

Again, look at Facebook. Alphabet has a ton of growth prospect that cannot be inhibited by regulators short of breaking them up.



As for the question, I would say:

1. Alphabet
2. Apple
3. Amazon
4. Microsoft
5. Facebook
6. Netflix"
04/04/2021,stocks,"Own or have owned all of them except Amazon (no particular reason for not owning it). Microsoft and Apple are the “safest”. It seems even with the MSFT hack their reputation hasn’t taken a hit (yet, if ever). Apple prints money. Alphabet and FB have good cyclical exposure for this next leg of economic reopening (ad dollars tend to track with the economic cycle). Not to mention from a valuation perspective they’re the most “affordable” due to regulation overhang and reputation risk. 

Netflix is still a leader in streaming and I’d buy them again if they fell a bit from where they are. Was a long-time shareholder but needed to rebalance my portfolio. Also competition is fierce and spend on content will continue to go up a lot. Disney+ is a big, big competitor."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Netflix is like Spotify - they might just get replaced at some point if enough money is thrown at productions by big players.

Disney on the other hand is more diversified and has so many freakin brands that they will overtake Netflix quite soon. Also, will you ever cancel D+ if you have children? No you will not, cause they go rampage if you don't let them watch Disney movies - and you will have to deal with entertaining them even more. 

Everybody can make generic series and movies that are not playing in a Star Wars universe etc."
04/04/2021,stocks,"I had to ditch google. I just don't see vision there. Its and advertising and marketing company. Yes, they will without a doubt continue to make money. But everything they touch that isnt advertising is shit.  Their core business model is solid bit where is the growth? 

Apple, Microsoft, Amazon understand what big tech has to be in the future. You need fingers in lots of pies, and the ability to do it right."
04/04/2021,stocks,very much looking forward to their plans in terms of Gaming - growth market!
04/04/2021,stocks,Way overvalued but I know what you mean
04/04/2021,stocks,This. FB the dark horse with the cleanest balance sheet. Love how everyone hates them. Hope the stock dips Monday and I’m loading up.
04/04/2021,stocks,I don't know a single person in their 20s who has facebook account. Millenials who were the first Facebook users are now tiring of it and using it less and less.  It's only a matter of time before it collapses. Sure there's instagram and it's other services but there's also other social networks out there and still those yet to be created. Its a rough market.
04/04/2021,stocks,"See it as an opportunity: if google and amazon split at some point, it's going even more to the moon (look at Apple in terms of stock splits and what happens)

also, amazon has a new CEO that might be more willing to have a split than bezos"
04/04/2021,stocks,[removed]
04/04/2021,stocks,Not even sure what your saying here lol
04/04/2021,stocks,That is one of the reasons for Netflix is on the bottom of my list 😅
04/04/2021,stocks,I’d like to know your definition of overvalued
04/04/2021,stocks,"Apple currently has a PE ratio of 33 which is the second lowest of the FAANG stocks, with Facebook having the lowest. So how is Apple overvalued?"
04/04/2021,stocks,Lets do it! Getting an undervalued growth machine for even cheaper! Oh yes.
04/04/2021,stocks,You can’t really say its a ‘rough market’ until it is. If next year facebook meets expected revenue - 107B - that will be a 25% rev increase. An increase in growth over the previous year but quite less than it 5 yr avg. This is all that matters. Can they keep the growth up or even keep it somewhat up? If a year passes and they post like 2% growth...well then you can say its getting rough.
04/04/2021,stocks,It's artistic license.
04/04/2021,stocks,"It's overvalued if u value it intrinsically based on it's earnings up until rn and u assume it grows at a reasonable rate. 

Based on relative valuation ur right it's not that far off from FAANG stocks."
04/04/2021,stocks,How does comparing it to 4 other overvalued stocks make it not over-valued? Lol
04/04/2021,stocks,">Apple is a good company with strong profitability but at an EV/EBITDA of 23, a PB of 31 and a Price to Sales of 7.24, i'm waiting for a serious dip in the markets before buying ANY tech.  
>  
>Based on a DCF Earnings and DCF FCF analysis buying in at around 100 USD should be fine.

Because there is more to life than PE.   
The Price to Sales looks crap, the Price To book looks crap, the Price to Tangible Book looks crap, the EV/EBITDA looks crap, even if you take into account a DCF Earnings and DCF FCF analysis it's still 20% overpriced considering future earnings."
04/04/2021,stocks,have you considered the headwinds they will encounter now that they won't be able to collect data from Mac and Chrome users?
04/04/2021,stocks,"Lets put it this way. If they have the same growth, we get to about a 4.5-8x projection over 5 yrs at the same valuation. So you can cut the valuation in half - still a great buy. Or cut the financial growth in half - still a great buy. So yes you have to make assumptions about what the future will be, in this case how the battle with apple will affect them, but even factoring that in things look good."

04/04/2021,stocks,App Harvest maybe APPH
04/04/2021,stocks,"I was looking into this a little while ago. The most established companies in vertical or indoor farming I found that were publicly traded were SMG and APPH.  

Other than that there are some penny stocks. I’m not sure what the sub rules are in naming pennies, but most of what I found that were public are pennies. GMEV is an umbrella that owns Foundation Farm Corp, a vertical farming concern that is in the startup/expansion phase in Canada.  PVSP is building a large indoor farming set up for marijuana. And INQD does design and equipment for indoor farming and vertical farming.

So those are some companies you could research in that space"
04/04/2021,stocks,Does APPH sound like what you are looking for?
04/04/2021,stocks,"I like Bowery Farming, which is backed by Google and has Whole Foods and Walmart as some of its customers. They’re going public soon via SPAC."
04/04/2021,stocks,Safer play is to just buy Nutrien
04/04/2021,stocks,Hydrofarm is also a good option fairly new ipo
04/04/2021,stocks,"I am very bullish on APPH. Look into that company. Could be a disruptor in farming and in terms of long term value, the stock is undervalued IMO."
04/04/2021,stocks,GMEV
04/04/2021,stocks,"Not sure how promising it is, since it just barely came into my radar, but AGFY is an interesting play. They make the supplies for indoor farming."
04/04/2021,stocks,Did you considered investing directly into Farmland through REITs? FPI is one of my favorites. It is in one of the biggest Farmland owner in the US and after a significant drop in the past weeks I would consider it to be a good investment at a discount right now.
04/04/2021,stocks,Following
04/04/2021,stocks,thoughts about lab grown meet?
04/04/2021,stocks,I like AQB
04/04/2021,stocks,Growgen 😉
04/04/2021,stocks,Agrify is another $AGFY
04/04/2021,stocks,"Vital farms, Bee Vector Technologies"
04/04/2021,stocks,"AppHarvest and Spring Valley (Aerofarms).  On the REIt side, IIPR."
04/04/2021,stocks,There is also another SPAC - Better World Acquisition whose principals are partners in Ngen Partners that have an interest in Bright Farms - no deal yet but rumored - [http://ngenpartners.wpengine.com/portfolio-bright-farms/](http://ngenpartners.wpengine.com/portfolio-bright-farms/)
04/04/2021,stocks,Look into GRWG
04/04/2021,stocks,GrowGeneration GRWG
04/04/2021,stocks,Don't invest in vertical farming. The sun is free
04/04/2021,stocks,Thank you my man 🙏🏻 exactly what I was looking for
04/04/2021,stocks,Yes! Thank you
04/04/2021,stocks,"Looks cool, I couldn’t find investor presentation or the SPAC ticker, do you know where those are?"
04/04/2021,stocks,"just had a look, hydrofarm looks solid both as an mj and farming play, high insider ownership too. only thing concerning me is negative free cash flow"
04/04/2021,stocks,"Look at other established Agro businesses for guidance on valuation. There are much bigger companies with market caps that are a fraction of APPH.  

Be careful."
04/04/2021,stocks,"But they cant grow fruit lol. They might serve some niche retailers but your big box stores are not going to shaft their growers or get worse contracts to use vertical growing. The only upside of vertical growing from a business standpoint is reduced supply chain costs and this only lasts as long as trucks aren't autonomous. 

I understand all the good environmental benefits and labor reduction of it but walmart and kroger do not care about that. 

I think it's a cool concept, will Appharvest or one specific company become a major supplier of produce? Probably not.."
04/04/2021,stocks,If OP believes in vertical farming he probably doesn't want to buy an owner of farmland thought.
04/04/2021,stocks,"Thank you! Yes Reits are definitely on my radar, and will consider this one long term."
04/04/2021,stocks,Take a look at MITC.
04/04/2021,stocks,Cool but no (good) public companies right?
04/04/2021,stocks,"I own IIPR and have been disappointed recently, but have high hopes for the future"
04/04/2021,stocks,"Yes, but AG land, supply chain & distribution, and water are not."
04/04/2021,stocks,Fair point. I think APPH is on the right track and their interview on MM was incredibly convincing in terms of their mission.
04/04/2021,stocks,Remember it is a REIT there will be steady growth but no huge pops as they need to return 90% taxable income to shareholders.  Just reinvest dividends and hold for a long time
04/04/2021,stocks,"Not to mention more efficient use of fertilizer, no need for pesticides, and rehabilitation of America’s wild spaces and biosphere. 

But it may still be a ways away from mass adoption, so still a risk."
04/04/2021,stocks,Water in vertical farming is just as expensive. I sell fluidic systems which is why I know about the struggles of VF. The land ends up being just as expensive in an effort to keep it in high population areas
04/04/2021,stocks,"Take a look at GRF.V for a cautionary tale in vertical agro. They are established and actually have revenue (unlike APPH) and have a market cap thats 15x smaller than APPH.  

Hope it works out but definitely hedge in some way."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Yes to all of this! Economics are definitely changing towards sustainability and efficiency. Also wild spaces and biodiversity are being valued higher almost everyday, so when someone slash and burns for farming or grazing they are destroying a strategic reserve and theoretically infinite future value for a fixed short term value."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Understood. Do you think much money is made up by it being closer? 

I get that the initial investment could be high, but I am wondering how many years theyd need to turn a profit vs regular AG fields..."
04/04/2021,stocks,Hedge suggestions?
04/04/2021,stocks,I think one of America's greatest strengths is our logistics. Currently I think they are propped up by green investments. IF they become high value it will be at the hands of voters not typical value economics. That's my guess anyways.
04/04/2021,stocks,"In 20 years why do you need to be closer when the electric trucks drive themselves where you dont have to pay unionized labor?

Another question is production, a grocery store can get a case of romaine lettuce for about $10-$15. Can these farms grow the 1,500 heads of romaine sold daily to keep their warehouses in stock?"
04/04/2021,stocks,"Watch this and it’ll go through it all with you. Anyone selling you an expensive trading course is a scam artist.

Trading courses are scams. Do not fall for them."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Yeah, pretty much all of them are bs. They will probably make more money running the courses about trading than actually trading themselves."
04/04/2021,stocks,There's nothing in those courses you can't learn in a few hours on Investopedia.
04/04/2021,stocks,There is no hidden knowledge to teach.
04/04/2021,stocks,"Most are garbage.  Although I wouldn't say the ones that have good strategies don't also teach.  Some do and some don't.  Some people simply have a calling to teach others and make the world a better place.  Others want to make a quick dollar.  Discerning between the two is tough. 

The  good ones out there generally have quieter voices and not good marketing.  

Everyone has vastly different strategies.  It's about finding what works for you.  Sometimes that is only found by making a lot of mistakes unfortunately."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Buy low, sell high. Probably more effective than the course contents. You’re welcome."
04/04/2021,stocks,Working on your trading psychology is the most valuable area of knowledge. Forget anything you have to pay for that costs more than a book.
04/04/2021,stocks,"It depends on what they teach. If they show you how to do your due diligence, how to read a company's financials, if they teach what trading terminology is, like what's a short, how it works, who does that, and so on, then it's informative. They're not teaching your ""tricks"", they're teaching you the work that you need to do. Yes, you can read it online or buy a book, but many people don't learn by reading, they learn by listening to a flesh and bones human and asking questions interactively. If this is your case then it may be worth the cost for you.

On the other hand, if they claim to show you ""tricks to profit in any market"" or similar claims that are too good to be true, it's likely to be a scam. If some trading genius knew a secret signal that tells them a stock is about to go up in any kind of reliable way, they wouldn't tell anyone. If it were known information then everyone would respond to the same signal, causing the price to rise before our genius can buy and profit from the upcoming rise. In other words, if they tell you, it's not a secret or it doesn't work. Look for a different course."
04/04/2021,stocks,Also Discord groups that sell you signals are also scams. I bought a month of subscription for a discord group called Asset Entities and was a total waste of money.
04/04/2021,stocks,"Think of it this way mate...where did these 'traders' get their knowledge from to even think about starting courses? Books. It's just regurgitated info, you're better off learning yourself. You are also living through the golden age of the internet. Youtube/Google is your best friend. EVERYTHING is available for free. Literally start on Babypips.com then go on youtube looking for different strategies."
04/04/2021,stocks,Some people like classes and like shit laid out for them and are willing to pay for it. Just because it's the same info that can easily be found else where doesn't mean it's a scam.
04/04/2021,stocks,"Just think about the premises. They're charging money to teach you how to trade stocks profitably. The fact that they're charging money should tell you all you need to know. If they have reliably profitable strategies, why would they need extra income from online courses? Wouldn't their time be better spent using those strategies to make more money? If they're doing it because they became wealthy and they want others to have the same opportunity, why are they charging?"
04/04/2021,stocks,"IMO, the only people who make money from trading are the ones selling courses or teaching. 


There’s a bunch of studies that show trading is absolutely the worst way to build wealth long term and the vast majority of traders lose money each year. The percentage of traders that lose money isn’t proven, because it can vary so much. However, the general accepted percentage of traders that can reliably make money by trading is < 1%. Its such a small percentage that its statistically insignificant. 


There’s also a whole bunch of studies that show there is no learning when it comes to trading. Aka...the majority of traders do not get better over time with more experience. In fact traders will often preform worse over time because they get a false sense of confidence from a few good trades which leads to them taking more risk, and then they lose money faster."
04/04/2021,stocks,"There is nothing in these courses that is applicable to stocks. The market is not predictable. No strategy is a sure thing, and everyone has their own comfort level for risk. Investing is gambling plain and simple. But if I can scam your friend telling him a bunch of bs to pad my wallet you bet your ass I will!"
04/04/2021,stocks,Stock trading is mostly bullshit
04/04/2021,stocks,"There's only 1 question you need to ask a person who sells a trading course: Do they make their money from trading or do they make it from selling a course on trading?

They will tell you how much they make, but 99% of the time they won't tell you how much of that income comes from trading and how much of their income comes from selling success. 

This applies to every scam out there."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Outside of a few select books from reputable authors, I shy away from any learning material that isn't through my broker, or suggested by my broker. I enjoyed and learned a lot from a few of Ameritrade's courses on topics I was having trouble wrapping my mind around. I would start (and in all likelyhood end) there."
04/04/2021,stocks,You can just read analyst reports for free instead.
04/04/2021,stocks,If you had a winning trading strategy why would you spend time putting together a course you can sell? It's a waste of time that could be better spent researching or finding good technical trades.
04/04/2021,stocks,"For brokers nobody knows if the stock market gona go up, down, sideways, or in fucking circles."
04/04/2021,stocks,"coaching courses for any subject are for those who feel like they need handholding, and people who like free information repackaged

&#x200B;

but **sometimes it's hard to find free information on certain topics.**

For instance, I'm still trying to make sense of Level 2 data, and the secrets people say it holds beyond what it basically represents.... like how they can detect momentum shifts and support and resistance levels from level 2 data.

show me a video where you can see Level 2 data speeding up and slowing down, and how you make buy sell decisions on Level 2 data alone."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Here's my take from it- a course teaches you a group of strategies on how to do something specific.  A book gives you very specific and detailed knowledge in a specific subject.  The internet and search engine gives you a lot of information and junk you have to comb through and piece together yourself. There are shitty books (books that just hype you up), bad courses (knowledge is too basic and easily figured out yourself) and well you know all the shit you can find publicly.  How much is your time worth to you? I spent close to 1000 on books and resources for real estate and I got far better returns than that knowledge within 6 months.  In comparison it took me more than 10 years to earn the amount of money that I want from trading.  Teaching is hard man,  it is literally an additional set of skills a good trader  needs to have on top of being good at trading.  Could I teach someone to trade like me? Maybe,  but if I were to teach someone it wouldnt be for $2000, I'd charge more."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Online courses are a dime a dozen, and if they are successful traders, they wouldn't be doing paid online videos.

At a college or school?  That's a more legitimate learning environment."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Ehhh. I too am struggling with this notion. Most education is not free, if the trader really knows what they are talking about the amount of money you spent on the class will be returned many times over, traders are entrepreneurs and there’s nothing wrong with having multiple revenue streams, there are successful traders that limit their risk so they might have a ton of capital but mostly none is liquid.

I mean the list goes on and on, I’m a content creator but I don’t charge for classes, although my community has asked for that, so after doing some research I found this post to be the general consensus. 

I don’t see it any differently than a programmer who works their normal job but sells programming courses on the side through Udemy.

I think the real problem is there are sooooo many “traders” out there it’s hard to figure out who’s worth paying for, so it’s safer to just assume they are all scams."
04/04/2021,stocks,Yes
04/04/2021,stocks,I’d say yes. Even free stuff like youtube channels I’d say most are bull just trying to grow a channel. Theres a reason you can’t find a very old youtube account that makes stock predictions like ‘stock A will 10x!’ - they’re all about a year old.
04/04/2021,stocks,100% of the time
04/04/2021,stocks,What makes these three youtubers different from the others?
04/04/2021,stocks,"Ehh, although true, book smarts need in real life action to illuminate the nuances"
04/04/2021,stocks,"‘Buy high, sell low’ is also an effective way to learn."
04/04/2021,stocks,More like buy low don't sell
04/04/2021,stocks,"Would you extend the same belief to teaching and coaching in other career fields? Is trading/investing different than every other field where a teacher/professor could earn more in the field than in teaching/academia? 

Playing the markets can be tough. It takes a lot of understanding as well as being psychologically draining. I can absolutely understand why someone who could be great at something would choose teaching, especially now that monthly subscriptions are so prevalent.

Do I trust any of the trading coaches? Maybe a couple (though one has a service or class and is also an active trader). Mostly not. But I don't buy into the ""they could make more doing x"" belief because professionals teaching (and many preferring it) has been prevalent for so long. As have charlatans, and in increasingly greater numbers, so be careful out there."
04/04/2021,stocks,I answered these arguments in my post.
04/04/2021,stocks,"Could you give any links to these studies? As I'm contemplating getting into trading, this is very relevant to me."
04/04/2021,stocks,"lol because one is a fake guru trying to sell you a course without an ability for you to peer review their content or get a refund. These three have everything available for free with open comment sections so you can confirm whether the information is legitimate.

The most important thing to learn is how to screen good information from bad. If you can’t learn that then you should absolutely not spend any money on a trading course. You’re definitely going to get scammed."
04/04/2021,stocks,"start investing your time into learning and you will suddenly start understanding some youtubers provide quality insight and many do not. Plenty of people like Graham Stephan and Andrei Jikh for example, but in reality they provide very very watered down basic info that is produced well.

+1 for Patrick Boyle"
04/04/2021,stocks,Because these YouTubers are educational and not for profit.  Their knowledge and intention is to objectively inform and leaves the onus on you.
04/04/2021,stocks,I see no difference
04/04/2021,stocks,I have already mastered this step and am ready to move to the next lesson.
04/04/2021,stocks,Nothing like some hands on experience to lose half ur money
04/04/2021,stocks,"I think my opinions are necessarily influenced by the way these types of courses are marketed. If they're offering to teach you how stocks work, a bit of macro and micro economics, some of the basic math, how to read and understand technicals and company financials, and maybe a few common ways to pick stocks to invest in, that's fine. That info is readily available on the internet for free, but if you want to pay a few hundred dollars for online videos that walk you through that more efficiently than your own research would, so be it. I think that should be taught in high schools, but it isn't.

But there are two problems. (1) the sorts of people who most want and need that information aren't as likely to have disposable cash or to have the sort of job that would make it actually worth the money (by opportunity cost) to save research time and take the course. (2) the courses are frequently marketed to make it seem like you'll learn unique secrets that will make you suddenly able to make a lot of money.

Courses like this aren't like teaching or coaching, because they only have the veneer of education. It reminds me a lot of creative writing courses for aspiring novelists. There are so many of them, and they're all the same. They give you tips that sound insightful and clever when you hear them, but when you try to apply them yourself you realize you don't actually understand it any better. And they market themselves in a way that makes you feel like you can skip some of the hard work of practice by paying these people money. It's all BS. Good creative writing courses aren't online videos. They're workshops or bootcamps where you trade drafts with other writers, get hard critiques from pros, and get focused instruction/direction on what skills to practice and how to practice them. It requires an actual conversation with the person teaching you, and you're paying for the process and work of teaching/learning. These courses are charging you just for information, and that information isn't all that valuable by itself."
04/04/2021,stocks,"I don't agree that you did. Your post sounds like you're looking for a reason to trust the courses. This trend happens in every single cottage industry. There are always people offering courses to teach the secrets to financial success. It's never secrets. It's always regular knowledge that's attainable elsewhere. Just because someone could make the time to teach doesn't mean it make sense that they would. People think learning to trade stocks is the key to becoming a millionaire. That's a big flashy dream that's easy to exploit. The higher the price tag, the more skeptical I am that the person has anything of value to teach.

With stocks, the only thing you can't learn through your own online research is high level math. But you don't learn that from a guy's online course. You learn that in a college investment banking program."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Best thing would be go to a database and look all of it up there. If you’re in school, your school’s database would give you access to hundreds of scholarly articles about trading. 


One google search would yield a lot of articles talking about how bad of a decision trading is. 


Best thing you can do when investing/trading is to DYOR."
04/04/2021,stocks,"“Not for profit”, well gee do I got a bridge to sell you!"
04/04/2021,stocks,Damn that the most silly statement I've seen today.
04/04/2021,stocks,"I liked this lesson so much, I keep repeating it!"
04/04/2021,stocks,"I agree with pretty much if not everything you said, but I have to add that none of it addressed your original point, which was based on the fact that they could make more in the field as opposed to teaching.

Are over 99% of them and the 20 year old self-proclaimed entrepreneurs slinging classes through youtube ads charlatans? Of course. Do I think they're inherently untrustworthy because teachers in such fields could make more working in the actual field? Not necessarily. It's worth considering and a track-record is certainly helpful, but I think it's more complicated than simply looking at income potential."
04/04/2021,stocks,"I'm not looking for a reason to trust the courses. I'm arguing for them to expand my knowledge in the area. I have no incentive to think stock trading courses are usually legitemate, as I usually prefer to teach myself.

However, when I heard such a strong claim from a non-expert saying that these courses are bullshit 95 % time, I wanted to see if this was true. Asking here was the natural place, but I didn't just want a simple yes/no answer. I wanted to know the reasoning behind the answer, and a way to get that reasoning is to offer (counter)arguments for/against a stance, which creates the possibility for responders to respond to specific points of confusion or misinformation, or in other words, give the reasoning behind their answer."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Well in cases of self-promotion to sustain one's own platform is ""for-profit"" as far as you trust the objectivity of their content."
04/04/2021,stocks,"i was speaking to the youtubers cited, not all of youtube."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Right. I have enough unspoken assumptions in my previous posts that I should have taken the time to add express caveats. I don't think it's inherently suspicious when someone purports to teach instead of making more money in the field they're teaching. What I'm saying is not comparable/analogous to full-time teachers at all. Those are people who chose to teach instead of practice the profession. Power to them.

This is unique to these types of online courses. This is a single person who is on the internet with pre-recorded videos that you can pay to watch. This person says they have figured out trading and they make a living doing it. I know that day trading takes a f\*\*\*ton of time and work to do it well, because you need to collect and digest a large amount of information every day or you lose any edge you might have had. The fact that they're offering these courses at all is suspicious to me because they had to spend the time putting them together. If their trading methods are working, and they're making a good living at it, why bother with the course? Did they do it because someone convinced them it was easy extra money so not? Are they not actually making a good living at trading so they want the extra income?

My first exposure to these courses was in creative writing. Tons of small-time writers sell online courses purporting to teach you how to write a good novel. It's almost all crap, because the craft of writing can't be effectively learned that way. Most people doing it were either never able to sell their own books or are past their prime and need a new income stream. The only successful working pro authors who are spending the time to teach are either: (1) doing it for free in podcasts, YouTube videos, etc.; or (2) doing it as a paid guest author at writing bootcamps/workshops (which are actually an effective way to learn how to write better)."
04/04/2021,stocks,"The simple answer is that they rarely teach you anything you can't easily learn yourself on Investopedia (as another commenter here said).

Success in the stock market is almost entirely based on asymmetry of information. If someone has a secret way to consistently make profitable trades day after day, year after year, they'd be effing insane to share that online for a few hundred or even a few thousand. They should be using it to build capital and prove the theory, then market it to VCs, start a hedge fund, and become actual billionaires. The reality is that you can't learn how to be a good trader by taking any courses. You learn how to do it by putting in the work. It is almost entirely a skill-based profession."

If you have open options RH won't accept the transfer and any partial shares will be liquidated and sent in cash. I would also recommend initiating the transfer from your new broker as RH will jerk you around and the process will take much longer.

Depending on your position and how you feel about it, it is much faster to just sell off your shares and buy back with the new broker. But I understand this method is only feasible in certain situations."

2021-04-04 19:36:33,stocks,Questions on long investment strategies So my question is...I have about 2k invested and split between 4 stocks that 3 are tech and I like the stock and I’m long term. Arkk I unfortunately bought in around the ath and iv been dca when I can as I do with all my stocks with 100$ here and 50$ there but there are other stocks that I would like to start investing in also. So I’m wondering if it is best to keep dca with the socks I have or should I invest that dca money into other stocks to hedge. I’m looking long and do not day trade. I understand that it’s ultimately my decision and DD that should give me the answer I need but wondering what’s the best strategy
04/04/2021,stocks,"In my opinion if you are long, the more diversified you are, the better, so I would buy the other stocks if you are confident in the company's long term possibilities."
04/04/2021,stocks,"If you are long, why care about DCA that much? Especially with ARK, an actively managed ETF, I would just keep buying more regardless of the price if I believed in the person managing the fund. If you dont want to put more money into it,  just leave it and move on to other stocks."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Personally, I'd advise you to buy ETF's & mutual funds in various sectors until you get a little larger portfolio. I know you're looking long term, but with just 3 individual stocks you're exposed to a lot of specific risk. Even if the company doesn't go bankrupt, significant shakeup can leave them treading water or even drifting downwards for years.  Go look at a 25 year chart of Microsoft, for an example. They had all kinds of trouble with DOJ and only recently regained their highs.  Actively managed funds may not be as sexy or exciting, but will (may) avoid moving sideways for 10+ years as well."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Tech stocks.. perhaps an ETF that is just that...

I have SMH, and it's doing fairly well tracking the general trend. 

I also have An additional concentration in my favorites.  But you could possibly combine your 3 techs to one ETF.  Then spread out wider

Best strategy... Is revealed in time, when you can't climb aboard."
04/04/2021,stocks,Thanks for the input that’s kinda what iv been leaning towards
04/04/2021,stocks,Yeah that’s kinda why I’m asking because I was feeling like dca on stocks I’m long on seems counterproductive in a sense but I also like to dip. I’m gunna start diversifying better
04/04/2021,stocks,Yes and I’m not to worried about the sexy or trendy thing to do. I already have a pension and annuity from my employment so my retirement is looking good. I’m more intrigued on how to make some of my expendable money actually make some money for me long term. As I’ve learned the past 6 months my money in the bank is doing nothing. I have made some realized gains on some small positions and re invested in the stocks I wanted. In a sense I try to pick a few stocks I can cash in on in a yr then reinvest that money into something more lucrative. Probably not a ground breaking thought. The stock market use to be a little intimidating to me as I have never thought about getting into it. I was all about saving my money which I still do save but I really enjoy learning about investing. I also have some coins so I’m trying it all out and soaking in as much good info as I can. I appreciate everyone’s comments and info.

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/business/bill-hwang-archegos.html?referringSource=articleShare

“Until recently, Bill Hwang sat atop one of the biggest — and perhaps least known — fortunes on Wall Street. Then his luck ran out.

Mr. Hwang, a 57-year-old veteran investor, managed $10 billion through his private investment firm, Archegos Capital Management. He borrowed billions of dollars from Wall Street banks to build enormous positions in a few American and Chinese stocks. By mid-March, Mr. Hwang was the financial force behind $20 billion in shares of ViacomCBS, effectively making him the media company’s single largest institutional shareholder. But few knew about his total exposure, since the shares were mostly held through complex financial instruments, called derivatives, created by the banks.

That changed in late March, after shares of ViacomCBS fell precipitously and the lenders demanded their money. When Archegos couldn’t pay, they seized its assets and sold them off, leading to one of the biggest implosions of an investment firm since the 2008 financial crisis.”

Also, from another article, interesting that “Unlike holdings of shares, which require investors to report ownership above 5 percent in a single stock, over-the-counter equity swaps offer exposure to stocks without the SEC reporting requirements of shareholdings.”"
04/04/2021,stocks,"Always remember folks, retail traders are dangerous. /s"
04/04/2021,stocks,And what gets me is people like us investing in Viacom not having any idea what’s going on behind the scenes (I don’t hold any of their stock). But you know when you are told to do due diligence and all that - sometimes it doesn’t help much.
04/04/2021,stocks,Why gamble when you are already a billionaire?
04/04/2021,stocks,Managed 10bil... owned 20bil in Viacom alone... recent news says he lost 110bil. When will we know what he actually lost?
04/04/2021,stocks,""".. a modest 3 million dollar home"".

04/04/2021,stocks,"Is there any evidence beyond a few tweets, that shows a $110b loss?"
04/04/2021,stocks,So... buying opportunity for ViacomCBS?
04/04/2021,stocks,"The Economist has also a piece on Archegos:

[https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/03/31/archegos-a-family-office-brings-nomura-and-credit-suisse-big-losses](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/03/31/archegos-a-family-office-brings-nomura-and-credit-suisse-big-losses?utm_campaign=the-economist-this-week&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=salesforce-marketing-cloud&utm_term=2021-04-01&utm_content=ed-picks-article-link-4&etear=nl_weekly_4)

""The first sign of trouble came that Friday when Goldman Sachs and Morgan  Stanley, two Wall Street behemoths, began selling large blocks of  shares for an unnamed client who had missed a margin call—a demand for  more collateral to cover losses on trades that had gone awry. The stocks  that were forcibly sold might best be categorised as “second-tier  tech”. They included [Baidu, a Chinese search engine](https://www.economist.com/business/2021/03/20/baidu-turns-to-personal-transport-for-growth), and [ViacomCBS](https://www.economist.com/business/2019/08/15/viacom-and-cbs-agree-to-reunite),  an American media conglomerate, with a streaming service that gives it  the flavour of a faddish tech stock. Their prices crashed under the  weight of the selling. The price of ViacomCBS shares, for instance, fell by more than a quarter""

""In short, Wall Street can’t easily make money out of people who do not  take rash bets. But people who make rash bets can lose you money, too.  It is probably not a coincidence that Credit Suisse and Nomura are based  in countries (Switzerland and Japan, respectively) where long-term  interest rates have been stuck near or below zero. With few  opportunities to make money from lending at home, they turned to Wall  Street for excitement. Unfortunately for their shareholders, they found  it."""

If the swaps somehow included an agreement to follow his instructions, then he should have been reported as the beneficial owner."

04/04/2021,stocks,"That’s not what the article says. It says “The house...is valued at about $3 million — humble by Wall Street standards” which is a totally reasonable thing for the author to write, given that it IS humble by Wall Street standards."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Ummmm, not sure what article you read but nowhere in the NYT article does it say his $3M home is modest. 


""Mr. Hwang was known for swinging big. He made large, concentrated bets on shares in South Korea, Japan, China and elsewhere, using ample amounts of borrowed money — or leverage — that could both supercharge his returns or, in turn, wipe out his positions.

He was more modest in his personal life. The house that he and his wife, Becky, bought in Tenafly N.J., an upscale suburb, is valued at about $3 million — humble by Wall Street standards.""

04/04/2021,stocks,"Sounds like it wasn't a refusal. The Chinese stocks were probably also leveraged and when those dropped his cash probably went with them.

And because he refused what looks like 10% of the offering, those shares got allocated to people who weren't expecting them. They smelled a rat and dumped them, which is how the stock collapsed at first.

By the time Huang's bankers were selling his shares (and the shares they owned underlying the swaps he had talked them into having) it was just tossing gasoline on the fire."

1. Despite some of them having less than ideal intentions, those hedge fund guys are still intelligent human beings.

At some point tax cuts or not, regulations or not... but you still support the less crazy people. 

2.  You don’t need to buy the GOP that much. Anti-regulation is in their blood. Dems are a different story. They can be swayed with significant amount of money.

The thing that keeps it from being a threat to the economy is that it was one fund with limited people investing in it and a few companies' shares they bought.

The 2008 meltdown exposed most of Wall Street. A few banks got in deeper than they could survive, and took out thousands of individual and corporate investors. And it forced a change in the entire mortgage business.

2021-04-04 18:37:00,stocks,"Best way to set up automatic investing in Fidelity brokerage? Fidelity doesn't allow automatic investing in ETFs, only mutual funds, in their taxable brokerage accounts. I want to set up automatic investing every 2 weeks into VXUS, but don't want to have to manually make the trade every 2 weeks. 

In light of that, is it better to just do it manually every 2 weeks, or use a fund like Fidelity ZEROSM International Index Fund (**FZILX**) instead so that it's automatic? I'm worried that it won't be as tax efficient because it's a mutual fund—I know it's better to invest in ETFs in brokerage accounts for this reason. 

Thoughts?"

I have three mutual funds set up just for the purpose of automatic reoccurring investments. I found the practice of trying to manually mimic weekly/monthly automatic investments to be tough even if I try to set the same day each week because I would still try to find the cheapest price that day and waste more time than needed. Set it and forget it aspect of automatic investment is worth it for me.

I also actively buy others ETFs and stocks but really love having these as my weekly addition so even if I lose out a little bit in taxes I figure long term it’s helping me grow my portfolio steadily."

But with that said they own the market and are going no where. If they stay asleep at the wheel it'll be easy for someone to come in if they wanted a piece of the pie, however autodesk like all giants see threats then buy them up"
04/04/2021,stocks,"Autodesk is a shitty software company that owns so much market share that they can keep buying smaller - much more viable software companies and solutions. 
They don’t actually make their own stuff most of the time, it’s bought from other successful software companies. I’m a mechanical designer, autodesk rarely comes out with enhanced features, just completely new products which make it seem like a deal when you get so many products for a cheap subscription. I use 3D modeling software from multiple companies including autodesk and I will always go for Solidworks, you can buy a license and have it forever. 

I think that In The future my industry will lean away from subscription based software as soon as a finance manager realizes that you’re only using 30% of the functionality on your $250/mo license, and a $4000 one time license would have been cheaper. The only caveat to this is where an engineering firm is so large that they have a hotline to talk to any autodesk software engineer."
04/04/2021,stocks,"I am a 3d artist and Autodesk 3ds max is the glitchiest software of all the software I have to use for work.
On top of that, seeing how more and more of my colleagues switch from 3ds max to Blender, I myself would not invest in Autodesk."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Ive used their 3D cad for engineering. And my opinion is there are many competitors with better products. but it depends on the industry. I would not invest specifically in the stock over an index that may include it, as who knows how the industry and market share will change."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Well movie industry uses maya, and gaming companies uses 3dsmax. So I guess it’s good?"
04/04/2021,stocks,"I had my eye on autodesk, especially as a graphics student. They are pretty big in the industry but as many have pointed out, they aren’t making significant changes lately, and they have quite the job ahead of them to compete with Blender. The industry is slowly shifting over to Blender, and will soon be the standard. You just can’t compete with free. I decided against investing on autodesk for this reason. 

If you want to invest in graphics, maybe look at Adobe. I’m not super confident as I’m worried that their subscription model will drive people towards their competition, but as of right now there’s nothing that really does everything that Adobe does."
04/04/2021,stocks,"8th semester mechanical engineering student here. I use both AutoCAD (2d drawings) and Inventor (3D drawings, analysis) daily.

AutoCAD is terrible, and i only use it because it can make nice technical drawings for reports. Everything in the software is so awkward and non intuitive. I could honestly not imagine a company, serious about it's spendings, use money on this. Yet it's the industry standard.

Inventor is amazing for 3D drawings/ solid models. Very intuitive, can easily read parameters from Excel sheets, and in general very effective at parametric design just works. The FEM (analysis) part is quite over simplified, and the competitor ANSYS does a MUCH better job. 

If I were a company, I would probably not pay to have my engineers use Autodesk software, and thus, would not invest in their stock."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Well run company,  also good play if you're at all interested in 3d printing."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Been with Autodesk since AutoCAD12 (the DOS version).  I believe their market share will drop because they do not have the development team or business knowledge to create what they need. There are better options out there for both modeling and document management (which is the bulk of the workload,unfortunately).

BIM360 cannot even add emails into the project files, forcing users to manually print to pdf and then upload into the system. I get hundreds of project emails each day. This is no small issue. This company has no idea what is happening in the construction world, and I have no confidence they will make the effort to learn.

Having said that, there is no better option for small 2d projects, so most people I know keep the subscription for that purpose.

When they buy up competitors, they add a layer of suck on top of a good product. 2 years ago, they lost a sale of 5 to 7 workstations (hardware and modeling software), because they simply could not answer our questions during the sales process. I have colleagues who purchased their steel modeling system (which Autodesk bought from Graitech), found it unusable, and abandoned it.

We are in the process of transitioning to other vendors.

Edit: I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to find out they are creating their own marketing buzz to hedge against an appearance of weakness."
04/04/2021,stocks,"AutoCAD is a good for 2D plans. Revit is good for 3D. I am pretty much forced to used these two as other software would have to be approved by IT. I would say AutoCAD is not that hard to figure out the basic stuff. Revit I haven’t learned yet because government computers didn’t install the software correctly to follow any tutorials. 

Market wise I’d say if a competitor came in with software that didn’t crash, so much they would lose."
04/04/2021,stocks,Can confirm. Hate them and every produce they make.
04/04/2021,stocks,Fusion 360 software is great and used fairly often in the manufacturing industry and is getting better. I really don't know much about any other software they have.

But, they pretty much are the kings of the castle with few competitors, though the competitors (solidworks (fee) and even Autocad LT users might like Sketchup (free)) are gaining ground in the market.  They don't have the Moat that they used to.

As a long term hold?  they are a maybe for me but only based on financials and fundamentals.  I don't feel any hype.

04/04/2021,stocks,"Everyone hates them, yet customer retention is excellent?? Sounds like the moat of all moats. Also if they're subscription based services have continued success this should only widen they're moat. I believe they will be profitable for years to come."
04/04/2021,stocks,"As an old-time user of autodesk software, I can confirm, they have been stagnating for years without improving anything at all. Give it a few years and the majority of 3d artists and companies will go for blender"

04/04/2021,stocks,"Asleep at the wheel is the most apt description I've heard for Autodesk.

I use Fusion 360 for work doing drawings for a welding shop. I absolutely hate it. I use it because it's cheap and it can still (barely) get the job done. There's so many things about Fusion that just don't make sense. They say that it's a cad program but the support for .dwg files is still terrible and is lacking the ability to edit 2D stuff easily. The .dwg file format is an Autodesk creation so you'd think that they should have that figured out. It's stuff like that throughout the whole program. Want to make some 2D drawings? Yeah sure. Want to print them? Na you have to export that as a PDF and print it in some other program. They've fixed that a while ago but with the most basic print dialogue box I've ever seen.

My other options are buy a license for solidworks for around $4000, look at tekla which is like $10k+
I don't think solidworks is all that much better and I should be an engineer if I'm running Tekla.

I'll probably just end up installing a bunch of plugins into Blender and hacking together a workflow to deliver PDFs and DXFs."
04/04/2021,stocks,"The finance guys have already asked about changing providers and the engineers rebelled when told they have to learn to use a new tool. Rinse and repeat for every software out there.

Edit: I know it’s easy to change software packages. I am just saying that someone has asked if we could save some money by moving to x product and the answer was no."
04/04/2021,stocks,"It’s not that Blender is “better” it’s that 3DS Max hasn’t changed in a meaningful way in years, and Autodesk keeps charging subscription fees for it.

Blender in the other hand is free, highly supported by the community, and has developed to the point of the years that it’s very comparable to 3DS Max.

The best part? With Blender you actually own your art, instead of paying Autodesk an extortion fee to access you IP.

Good riddance. I can’t wait for Autodesk to disappear."

04/04/2021,stocks,Yes this is my major takeaway from the thread.
04/04/2021,stocks,"Autodesk software is deep, intricate, very capable and hard to master.

Once it's learned, it's appreciated, and nobody likes reinventing the wheel."
04/04/2021,stocks,"I completely agree, i doubt you’ll be able to get willing change from engineers that have only had autocad for 30 years. 

There’s no way you’ll get entire engineering teams to change their entire workflow just to accommodate a more concise software package.

BUT, I’m 23 and have been in this field for ~8 years professionally; I’m seeing most people my age are proficient in at least a handful of modeling softwares and those picky engineers will be retired by the time I am a project engineer.

I mostly do retrofit mining engineering, so re-engineering existing conveyor systems. So I have to know 3D scanning software, pointcloud manipulation in Recap/autocad, then parametric modeling in Solidworks, Revit, and Inventor. We could move every bit of our workflow to Solidworks if I didn’t have to process pointclouds using an autodesk product."
04/04/2021,stocks,Amen.
04/04/2021,stocks,"I started learning 3d max when I was 16 on version 3.5. I could open up the most recent version and I'm 100% sure it'd be almost exactly the same as last time I saw it 10+ years ago when I was working in videogames. It really hasn't changed at all. They'll add a few things sometimes but that's it.

Blender is definately better than 3ds max as well."
04/04/2021,stocks,"I use autocad, it’s the industry standard for construction documentation. you just have to use it. They are innovating but the usability and presentation is behind the competitors, I.e. you can do the same thing but it takes longer.

Whatever software you use you still always send the auto desk .dwg filetype. Meaning you want to use their software to ease any compatibility."

Looking forward to someone unseating them or at least putting pressure on them. Between Autodesk and Adobe it’s ridiculous to see how  little incentive these companies have to invest in their products when they grow so big."
04/04/2021,stocks,"It takes longer until you customize... They can't *really* customize *for* you.. that would be a standard.

2021-04-04 17:58:52,stocks,"Is CVS a good stock to buy right now? I just purchased CVS and want to hold, is that a good idea right now? The price had been way higher within the past few years and they are one of the largest companies in the USA as well. What do you think?"
04/04/2021,stocks,"Why do ppl buy stocks then ask if its a good pick up, what are you even doing on the market lol."
04/04/2021,stocks,"You could have asked before buying, but whatever I guess, but now ask questions later."
04/04/2021,stocks,"I’m bullish on CVS. I think it’s currently undervalued and has great growth trajectory. They’ve been paying off the debt from the Aetna acquisition and having a payer as part of their vertical integration is very valuable.

They’ve also been shifting to a minute clinic model to become a simple healthcare provider for basic needs and services. I think this is a solid strategy.

I think we will see CVS hit $100/share in the next 2 years and only continue to grow. Strong leadership, solid plans and well executed previous investments"
04/04/2021,stocks,Iv been holding it since early 2018. I have a fairly large position. It’s ok I hold it as a more stable play in my ira. It has definitely underperformed my expectations. I think with corona shots being a short term catalyst and transforming into more of a walk in clinic as a longer catalyst it should be ok. If it got into the 80s I would start scaling out of my position. The valuation is very reasonable but future growth will be meh. Low risk low reward play but that’s not necessary a bad thing.
04/04/2021,stocks,"Right now no, because the markets are closed /smartass"
04/04/2021,stocks,Closing stores everywhere.  Discontinued tobacco sales drove away a huge market share.  The worst aspect is the forced rewards program to get the sale price in stores.  They have a good market share but the company keeps making decisions that piss off their customer base.  I personally won’t shop at cvs because of the rewards program crap.
04/04/2021,stocks,I owned CVS for years thinking I was ahead of the curve with all the changes in healthcare. It’s been garbage. Maybe it changes but I doubt it. I don’t think they even pay dividends do they?
04/04/2021,stocks,"I've had cvs in my holdings before, never again, made out just above even."
04/04/2021,stocks,One of the largest health care companies in the world at a relatively low P/E. I like the stock.
04/04/2021,stocks,Solid hold.... Jut set it and forget it.
04/04/2021,stocks,"Pro tip: don’t buy a stock and then ask random s if it’s a good idea. Do your own due diligence and research before buying anything. If you believe in the company and your research backs up your wanting to buy it, then do it."
04/04/2021,stocks,Yikes.. clear a spot on the shelf for that one cus it's going to be sitting for a while.
04/04/2021,stocks,Being one of the largest companies doesn’t justify investing in the stock. You got to look at the growth potential of a stock if you’re holding long term? Can they double in value over the next 5 years? You spent $75 for a share in CVS. There are plenty of other stocks which can double or triple in their value over the next few years for that price or hella cheaper.
04/04/2021,stocks,"I am bullish on CVS because I think pharmacies are the one business (besides maybe fresh produce) that is relatively immune to the Amazon effect. While it doesn’t make a life-changing difference if I order a phone tripod and receive a cheap knockoff from China instead of the one pictured, there’s a reason people don’t buy makeup from Amazon for fear of receiving knockoff products, and it’s even more so for medications. I would never, in a million years, risk getting a knockoff prescription by buying it on Amazon, and in general I think I will always prefer physically going to the store to pick it up rather than relying on the mail. Because of that, I think CVS isn’t going anywhere anytime soon."
04/04/2021,stocks,so they can sell low?
04/04/2021,stocks,They're doing their best :(
04/04/2021,stocks,"I bought it back in 2018 in the mid $70s. I think it went green once after I bought it, I didn't really care cause it pays a nice dividend and I ended up with a good chunk of extra shares. I finally cut ties with it a couple weeks ago when it went green. Overall, I did alright because of the dividend but I'm happy to be done with it now."
04/04/2021,stocks,Paper prices are also really high and that’s probably 80% of their expenses
04/04/2021,stocks,"And poor business placement, they literally built across the street to walgreens, like why? They could have made sales on saving people time and money but instead wanted to screw with walgreens instead"
04/04/2021,stocks,"I’m seeing %2.69 yield, which makes CVS appear to be a fine dividend play if you think the value will remain stable or increase.

I can’t recommend the stock, limited knowledge. But on the surface for a relatively stable option with decent dividends it seems fine as a portion of a portfolio."
04/04/2021,stocks,It’s a very risky strategy to think you can consistently pick stocks which will double or triple in value. To do so year over year is all he more difficult. I think CVS can deliver year over year growth fairly reliably for decades to come without too much risk of loss in the long run
04/04/2021,stocks,I would have to disagree. Them doing their best would be them doing their own DD then making the decision not blinded buying then asking. Its like buy a uaed car then asking if its had a accident.... People have to study and learn unless you just like throwing money at misc stocks....
04/04/2021,stocks,Yes. I am doing my best. Why do some on here assume I don't do any due dilligence?
04/04/2021,stocks,I was being sarcastic

The information appears to be several years old, but it is another example of the vast amount of information collected by Facebook and other social media sites, and the limits to how secure that information is.

This is an old news, Facebook said ""We found and fixed this issue in August 2019."" Suddenly many people think fb stock price will go down on Monday due to this news. It won't affect facebook stock price because this is an old fixed issue. Now facebook stock is having momentum as the stock is trading near 52 week high. Economy is reopening and ads growth will comeback strong. There is no other way more effective of placing ads other than facebook. It is also the cheapest among faang. Investors should keep holding facebook stock and ride the momentum.

And I keep my brokerage app on and streaming all day, every day while I'm at work, so I can look without having to pick up my phone and play on it. Nevermind the cesspool of ignorance it actively seeks to spread.

They’re going to need a lot money to cover their shorts. Besides, FB is over valued anyway. Liquidate FB 😂. Also looking forward to shorting them too and then buying when they hit anywhere south of 20 bucks.

😂 EDIT: look at these shills downvoting a comment in a post. 

For what? Think they can stop the inevitable? 

Did you downvote the actual post? Eat a dick Ken.

EDIT 2: tons of information released this weekend. This weekend! 
Wow so much coincidental right before tomorrow market open. You do you shills. 

Downvoting an additional comment to an already damning post does not change anything. Actually we don’t give a flying Phuc how you get your money to cover your shorts."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Because the institutions need to liquidate their positions to raise capital. An article like this serves as a smokescreen to provide an explanation for the price drop, and justify the trading volume it will likely experience due to the sell off. In the absence of any material news from Facebook, a large sell off otherwise may look more suspicious and cause panic.

Brush up on game theory and the reasons will be pretty self explanatory."
04/04/2021,stocks,"While this may factor into it, I maintain this is primarily symptomatic of institutional liquidity problems. The likelihood that Apple will capitalize on the opportunity to take advantage of this negative sentiment manufacturing article is likely, but I doubt is the primary reason for the piece."

04/04/2021,stocks,"A wash is when you sell at a loss and buy back in within 30 days. It makes it so you can’t write the loss off on your taxes.

I am up on FB so would be selling at a gain. It will be taxable, but selling at a gain always is unless you are trading in a retirement account. I’m not dealing with huge amounts of money so I’m not too worried about the tax hit."

04/04/2021,stocks,"That still doesn't make sense. If we look at Archegos, the large players unloaded their position BEFORE news broke, allowing them to sell at the highest price possible. This is in line with game theory. The general attitude is, sell first, deal with SEC later. The smokescreen is almost irrelevant since minimizing losses is the #1 priority.

With this Facebook news, the FUD comes BEFORE the liquidation, which doesn't make sense because that would mean you have a harder time liquidating a large position.

That is unless this is just one of MANY liquidations for citadel (i presume), then a smokescreen might be a plausible strategy since you want to avoid mass panic across all sectors because doing so would mean you are actually going tits up . - very tinfoil hat theory though"
04/04/2021,stocks,Why would they need to make an excuse to sell off? It seems more likely that they put the story out so that they could *cause* a sell-off and buy back in at a lower price.

04/04/2021,stocks,"This is what people who are always espousing ""buy the dip"" often miss.  If you think a company is going to be a good longterm investment, and Facebook is, then just buy in already.  It was in the $270s like, 2 weeks ago?  Now the $270s would be like a 7 or 8% dip.  The same person who is saying they will buy $FB on a 5 or 10% dip from $298 or whatever was probably saying the same thing when it was $275 a month ago.

Eventually $300 will be a dip from $330, etc.  Today's highs will eventually be tomorrow's ""dips"" and ""deals"" and ""bargains."""
04/04/2021,stocks,Everything I post on Facebook I consider public. It's clear others don't share that mindset or don't care.
04/04/2021,stocks,"Agreed. Facebook has had a number of privacy concerns. The stock always drops and is a good buy point as users don’t change their habits much. If you played every concern FB has, and every time Chipotle has food poisoning issues you’d probably be very rich."

This information is clearly visible via whale wisdom:

https://whalewisdom.com/filer/citadel-advisors-llc#tabholdings_tab_link

I think you might be oversimplifying a little, the article is definitely to create FUD, but it also serves as justification for the price drop, leaving any long retail investors with a position in FB holding the bag here (and prevent retail panic selling if there was no material news to substantiate the drop), which if you’ve been paying attention lately, is pretty much Wall Street’s MO."
04/04/2021,stocks,"If there are in fact large institutional liquidity problems, they have other far more urgent debts to settle and positions to close before they’ll be able to afford to buy back in on anything at the new low, especially with the real threat of margin calls looming. Look at any big tech chart and all the major indices since January. Note the inverse correlation in price movement that coincides exactly with the days that saw large spikes in the GME share price. This reeks of large institutions over leveraged and liquidating their winning long positions to keep their head above water as weights are continually tied around their feet."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Because they′re pretending that they covered their shorts on GME while ″secretly″ liquidating some of their other holdings to cover the losses they are incurring. They′re trying their best to make retail investors lose interest in GME.

I mean is the average person making money of a company like Facebook unethical? Institutional investment funds a company. The average person like me or you owning 2 FB stocks makes no difference, but the money made could make a big difference to us.

04/04/2021,stocks,Someone would invest in Facebook for reasons other than 'it makes lots of money effectively micro-targeting ads based on the info they have on everyone' ?
04/04/2021,stocks,"I’m in the minority here, but I like zuckerberg as an executive (although a lot of FB shareholders would agree with me, the general public likely won’t). If you haven’t seen the power of the network that Zuck has built thru FB, IG, WhatsApp, etc... I don’t know what else will convince you. Zuck had a vision from day 1 and I have not seen him stray from it. How Zuck built the FB network is THE model for how to scale a tech company. It’s the same reason I’m so bullish on Tesla: get as many people to join the network as possible, as fast as possible with no concern for profit; once the network is mature, flip the switch, print money. 

Fb’s finances are top notch and they have as strong a moat as you’ll find. If you aren’t advertising on FB’s platforms, you’re just throwing your ad dollars down the drain. It’s also really fairly valued at its current price and I still foresee tons of growth given a huge portion of the world still doesn’t have internet. I’m also really bullish on VR but I don’t factor that into my valuation since it still needs to mature (where VR is at rn is probably the equivalent of where computers were at in the early 90s; I see the potential but it needs lots of work). 

Humans will always crave connection to one another and FB is the ultimate platform for this desire. I admit it’s not a company with perfect morals and, outside of Costco (which is overvalued rn tbh), I don’t think any other company can be considered “perfect”. Fb doesn’t meet my criteria for evil company (vs oil/tobacco/intel) so I have no problem investing in them. Damn near every internet company is selling your data, FB and google just happen to be the best at it.

With that said, this is the beauty of investing: you can vote with your money. You don’t have to invest in fb if it doesn’t agree with your morals and I have no problem if you think fb is evil. Hell you can even invest in Fb’s competitors or short FB (good luck lol)"

Do I like the company? No. Do I like what they do? No. Do I like how they treat their users? No.  

Do I think I can make money from it? Yes.  

Furthermore, I don't believe that whether or not I buy will effect the company at all, so neither myself, or the world in general, sees any benefit from me *not* buying those shares. Doing whatever I can to make money increases the chance that I'll have enough money to try to enact changes, so the end goal justifies buying those shares."

You need to make your own beliefs as to what is actually unethical vs ethical. Those people that cry foul over privacy I put in the tin foil hat category most of the time...or worse the criminal side. I'm sure there are valid reasons some people need things private but why is that info being exposed to FB?

He threw out the morals thing to cover his ass so that is why I challenged his position. 

FBs peak hate was probably last year and it was just as high many years before. So OP changing his mind two months ago doesn't make sense really, I think he was about the $ all along. 

I think it's fair to call out people's hypocrisy if they are going to pretend to be on a high horse when Reddit is likely just as bad given their CCP alliances."
04/04/2021,stocks,"I used Archegos as an example of when large positions need to be liquidated.

So your thought process here is that retail/long institutions won't sell FB because of these articles about data breaches. After some digging, I think you might be right. I looked up some of the major data breaches of publicly-traded companies in the last 10 years and news of breaches don't affect the stock price trajectory at all. 

So it is a plausible theory that this is a smokescreen for an actual drop. Interesting."
04/04/2021,stocks,Thanks. I never pay attention to that. I guess it's good that you guys do that much in-depth research.

[See Wikipedia to understand FUD more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty,_and_doubt)

If you can cite references for FB selling user data that would be great.

On the topic for privacy there were issues in the past, but like this whole reddit post is about a breach in the past that's years old. Now you can hate the company for mistakes, but I look at other large companies that made mistakes in the past and all have moved on. I recognize that social media was in an infancy both for users learning what to share and when, as well as for the company providing clear controls for people to scope their own privacy.

So your view point isn't so much useful unless you are shorting the stock, as it's not accurate, nor new information. What it really shows is personal bias, which I wont use to inform my stock purchases."

04/04/2021,stocks,This should have been your response when someone says to you that Facebook as a whole has benefited society. Facebook is the number one resource when you want to radicalize a segment of society. Facebook has a huge part in getting Trump voted. Facebook is a big influence in a virtue signaling world we live in. What innovation has Facebook done? The like button? How to do laser pinpoint advertising to individuals?
04/04/2021,stocks,Just pointing out that there are other companies which have higher moral standards where you can still make 20% or greater returns. If you want to support fb that is fine
04/04/2021,stocks,"Hmm. I guess that holds true if you already have confidence in the stock. 

As a skeptic, though, I fundamentally don't understand what's left for them to self-invest in... Feels like acquisitions have been their main growth driver beyond the core advertising model (which I'll concede has been well managed into maturity) and I don't believe world governments are going to allow FB to buy the next IG or WhatsApp

So what's left beyond buy-backs and dividends?"
04/04/2021,stocks,"There's plenty of unethical companies out there, many more damaging than Facebook. I don't think r/stocks is the best place to bring your moral superiority."

Facebook doesn't give two shits if some retail investors own it or not. Yeah, sure, maybe if you miraculously convinced every retail investor to dump their FB shares, it would drop 20%. Zuck would be 20% less rich on paper, and the company would continue on like nothing happened.

Ethics only matter if they actually make a difference."
04/04/2021,stocks,They’re not even remotely close to monetizing their total addressable market. I’m thinking like most of Asia and especially Africa. It may not seem like a big deal now but they will industrialize at some point and they will socialize and use ads just like everyone else.
2021-04-04 16:56:47,stocks,"Value Investing Stocks I really like the idea of value investing, what are some things to be aware of when value investing and what are some indications that a stock is undervalued? I’ve heard that the PEG is a good indicator, what else is there?"
04/04/2021,stocks,"Competitive P/E ratio within their industry relative to peers; lower float than most in industry; growth potential over mid-term, growing enterprise value over time, and stable management. 

If those things are there AND they seem to be lagging without cause when you look at things on the share level - you could see some upward correction. Look at MAs over a decent period of time - 200 / 100 / 50 - and see what trends can be observed.

I like to see these things, but others may point to different signs."

04/04/2021,stocks,"If you haven't already, I'd recommend reading *The Intelligent Investor*. Some of the material is a bit outdated but it nonetheless has a lot of history and perspective for value investing. A lot of (scary) analogs between today's market and the past can be drawn, which should be insightful for new investors. It's not mathematically heavy but does analyze companies performances in light of P/E, D/E, EPS growth, projected growth, etc. My favorite exersize in there is using their simple formula to find expected annual growth rate based on a growth company's price and earnings. Applying it to Tesla today, its valuations imply an expected growth in earnings of ~495%/year (compounded yearly) over the next decade, which would turn $1 of earnings into about $50 million by 2032."

There are bubbles in crypto and Tesla, and they combined to form what history will call The Great Shit Coin Tesla Coil.

Get out of debt and be ready with cash. Buy rarely, read mostly. Do micro experiments to see how well you predict the future. Don't fuck up being a bull market genius like I did by averaging up on margin instead of selling.

If I can do well by taking the ideas of successful people with math abilities, then anyone can. As long as they don't average up on margin. Save cash, and wait for a disaster. There is always some part of the stock market that is cratering."

04/04/2021,stocks,"I would highly suggest investing a large chunk into a large blend etf such as VOO or VTI. I like VTI personally as you hit the mid caps, but you can’t go wrong either way. 

It’s not a sexy option. You aren’t going to see 100% YOY returns. But assuming you do not have any money currently invested, as your post makes it seem, it will be a really solid foundation for your portfolio. Your money will grow, and you will be able to diversify into individual holdings down the road at your own discretion, once you gain more analytical knowledge."
04/04/2021,stocks,Don't dump it all into one stock! Maybe even hold off and fight the FOMO educate yourself on the market first. It's gonna still be here...
04/04/2021,stocks,"Investing, as in not selling in a few days or months if there's a dip? My first piece of advice is to do your own research on specific stocks. You don't want to invest in a stock just because a stranger on Reddit told you to do so. They may be clueless or have an ulterior motive.

With that being said, I think that it's best to invest in solid companies. I always recommend AAPL."
04/04/2021,stocks,Chpt set it and forget it.
04/04/2021,stocks,Open a Roth IRA & put it into a S&P ETF then forget about it. It's unlikely you'll outperform the market on your own.
04/04/2021,stocks,"My piece of advice would be, even if you go all in just on one stock or etf, don't buy all at once.

Maybe start with 500-1000 and wait a bit for a pullback, dip, whatever.

Then you can add more, 500 everytime you feel it's down enough, because it WILL dip.
Sometimes double dip, just look at Feb & March."
04/04/2021,stocks,Stick it in an etf that tracks the overall stock market and get the fuck off any reddit investing subs and forget about it. Absolute worst thing you can do is stick around here and try to hop on new hot trends to hit it big. It's how I'm down 8% in a fucking bull market. Learn from my lesson.
04/04/2021,stocks,"I’m newer to investing too. I also had about $5k to play with. Initially my plan was to put half into a solid ETF and then the other half into maybe a couple individual stocks I liked. 

I altered that thinking a bit and ended up doing about half into AAPL and MSFT and then the other half into what I felt like were maybe a little riskier (not a bunch of OTC or anything). 

I’ve always wanted to invest in Apple and Microsoft and figured those two were about as solid of an investment as one could make currently that don’t seem to have huge pull backs. So they are more my safe hedge against any dumber investment I may make with the second half of my $5k."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Don't go all into one stock. Yes concentrated positions are more likely to go up faster than the average but you are also more likely hit a significant drop. Even the best companies have periods of low performance. 

Over the long run highly concentrated positions are low probability plays. Don't set yourself up for long-term failure chasing short-term profits."
04/04/2021,stocks,"If you don’t know much about the market, stick with broad based index funds like VOO for the blandest long term return. If you really want individual stocks, try to pick a handful of blue chip well known companies that you believe in. AAPL TSLA MSFT are all big tech companies that are unlikely to go to 0, but that doesn’t mean you’ll get a better return the broad based index"
04/04/2021,stocks,"Maybe set aside 1K or 2K for one stock you’re really confident in it growing, that’s cheap, but you’re also willing to accept consequences of it dropping. But it’s okay if you’re willing to hold. I would pump the rest of it into some ETFs or index funds. I personally like ETFs though. Just make sure you like their portfolio and record"

A lot of people will suggest to you what’s in their bag. It doesn’t mean that it’ll make you money and you shouldn’t YOLO your funds, whether it’s worth nothing to you or or not, because you could easily turn that 5k into 10k if you do good research.

But in since you’re asking, without naming tickers, I’m bullish on psychedelic stocks, real estate, banking, cannabis, clean energy, steel, and ETF’s just to name a few sectors.

I have investments in many things but those are some of my main ones because I see a lot of growth long-term. Short-term growth is great but it depends on your risk tolerance."
04/04/2021,stocks,"If I were you, I wouldn’t worry too much about which stock to pick and then anxiously check up on it every day or every hour. The chances are that you will beat the market return, without actively trading, are slim. Now that you know that the chances of beating the market are slim, the next best thing is be invested into the whole market. Best way to do it Standard&Poor 500 ETFs (VOO, SPY, IVV are the biggest and most known).   

Another thing to consider is timing. Even pros get that wrong more often than not. Best way to “time the market” is by dedicating a set date each month and amount you want to invest in. You have to be robotic about the entire practice. Some months market takes huge dip and you might have a temptation to dump more money into the market. On the bull run, you might want to wait it out until market dips so you can put your money in again. Ignore all of those thoughts and follow your rules and guidelines you set up for yourself. Market hates emotional traders/investors, and they are usually the ones who tend to loose most of their money.  

Few years down the line you will even experience a huge meltdown. All you will read and hear is the end or market and probably the end of America. You open your portfolio and see that you are down 10/20/40, maybe even 50%. Your whole family will try to persuade you to take your money out before you loose everything. Here’s the beauty of investing into S&P500. You will never loose everything and eventually the market will bounce back to where it was before. It might take two month, or 4 years, but eventually it will bounce back. All you have to do is keep depositing your money on set date. Never listen to anyone’s advice, it’s your money and you are in full control, just trust the market and it will do its job."

04/04/2021,stocks,Well don't do what I did putting 9k into GME :) Put your money into ETFs and some risky investments. Learn about options as well
04/04/2021,stocks,"I would go all in on 2 or 3 stocks or even 1 stock. Diversification is great for hedging the risk and keeping your wealth but not for building wealth. Every investment contains risk, higher risk bring higher gain. I find options ridiculously risky but many people find options as their go for investment strategy. If $5k is life saving and thats all you have in your saving account, then I would put in like QQQ or some solid ETF. However, if the 5K is disposable income that you can risk losing, then I would suggest you to research yourself and pick your stocks based on your research. I find high conviction investment work great for me. Everyone is different but I like tech and science so I like invest in tech and bio industry where I see huge potential growth in companies. I usually focus on companies' technology than their balance sheet. I've made 100% to 150% gains for past 2 years. I know 2 years is not that consistent and some people think I got lucky and I will lose my money soon. My opinion is different but I don't claim my method to be right than anyone else in this sub. Its all depends on what you want and what you willing to risk. I think what's most important is doing your own research. In my opinion, you can't hold your stock with high conviction without your own research. Hope you make great financial gains🙏"
04/04/2021,stocks,"Look for where the world is changing in a big way and invest in companies that

a) are gearing up for the change

and

b) have a lot of competition who don't (i.e. a conservative industry that hasn't changed much for decades)

...because markets are largely saturated and thus companies that wish to profit need to either generate a new, global market - which is rare but possible, e.g. in the AI space - or take shares of the market away from others.

(And yes, I was exactly in your position 2 years ago...when I put a couple k in the only stock I hold: TSLA which has since 13x. So if I wanted to invest in a similar fashion today I'd look to companies that address climate change in a big way and are in the process of massively scaling up:  energy storage, water desalination, vertical farming, 'fake' meat, ... )"

04/04/2021,stocks,"Despite everyone saying that you should wait until you know everything about it and until it's a fully educated decision...I say the opposite. Invest a small amount right now and put some skin in the game (~200) that is diversified...you will learn more about those stocks once it's your own money going up and down than you ever would when you're waiting to put something in. Once you've had a little bit invested for long enough to learn what it is doing and how it works, you can invest more with more confidence. I think the best thing to do is to just start. That's what I did and least and it worked for me. Lastly, here are a few common tips that nearly never lead a person wrong:

1) Do NOT invest all of your money you want to put into a stock at once! If you decide to put $500 in Apple, use what's called dollar cost averaging to instead put $30 a week or so until you reach $500 in Apple. There's a bunch of reasons why this lowers your risk or losing money
2) Time in the market beats timing the market, 80% of day traders lose money, while buying and holding in solid companies almost never loses you money
3) Putting a largish amount in what's called at ETF will stabilize your portfolio and make the drops less of a drop, but will also make some if your highs lower than they could have been. If you're not a stock expert (like me), then it lowers risk
4) Good luck and have fun!"
04/04/2021,stocks,"Regardless of amount, here's what I would advise anyone trying to get started.  

* Don't buy the hype

There is always going to be that 'too good to miss' stock and as such, the FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) is going to be strong - which is why you're looking for getting in now.  The market is at record highs now, and there is strong momentum to pull it back down, but also good rationality for it going forward.  

Next, do this:

* Understand your time horizon

If you're 60, you're going to be less inclined to buy a PLTR or GME, maybe because you don't understand it, but also because you're more focused on the short-term gains.  When you're 20-25, you have decades of compound interest to compute into the equation

Now that is out of the way, here are my guidelines for new investors

* 50% in an ETF.  This gives you broad based exposure to the market, dividends and reduced risk.  You won't go to $0
* 5-10% in FU money.  We as humans love to gamble, and this sets you up for some big wins, but also keeps you interested in the game.  Short term plays here
* 25-50% in those long term investments.  Companies you may like such as TSLA, or AAPL or even MSFT.  You're doing your research and trying to understand cash flow, long term earnings and how these folks will play in the sectors.  

So go and buy something like VTI with 50%.  You've probably already had your eye on some company like GME so do that 5% YOLO if you're so inclined.  The rest of your time and money should go to those long-term investments.  

* DCA (Dollar Cost Average) your way in.  It's fine on the way up, and on the way down.  You pick a time period (6-months) and slowly start buying every 3rd Friday or something that you like.  

That said, next will be understanding short vs long term gains, and the tax consequences - but if you're making less than say $55K a year, I think the US IRS is forgiving in terms of any capital gains.  So you'll want to avoid losses and recognize it's not a loss until you sell (which is why the ""time horizon"" is critical)"

Do research, see what others are saying, see what they’re investing and how much of their own portfolios are, and use that as much of an indicator as possible. 10% of $500 is $50. An extra $50? Great. 10% of $5000 is $500. Listen to billionaires like mark cuban and warren buffet. You only need one or two good stocks."

04/04/2021,stocks,What’s the goal with the money? Makes a big difference in where you should put it
04/04/2021,stocks,"Well, what I did, and I’ve seen good returns so far - about 60% into an index fund (SPY for me) and the. Played with the other 40% - couple different promising stocks that I found on here, 1 is down big time, other 2 are up - overall I’m up about 30% year on year. Point being if you put a decent chunk of money into something that just makes money and dividends - index fund - it makes playing in the market with the remainder a lot easier psychologically - otherwise you run the risk of developing paper hands and losing it all."
04/04/2021,stocks,"If you can, check out covered calls.  Those options can allow for steady slow growth on a weekly/monthly basis.  Just be sure in doing the research(which stock, the delta, strike price, etc etc) and you could see good gains."
04/04/2021,stocks,Just buy into 'blue chip' companies to start out. Don't yolo unless you have a bunch of spare cash
04/04/2021,stocks,"Never invest it all at once. Every month deposit like 10% in ($500 a month at most); with each deposit pick up a few shares or some fractional share in 1-3 companies that you use/fancy for. 

The reason not to invest everything at once is that you could see an opportunity/pullback where your money becomes more valuable, hence having cash is worthwhile or not being fully invested is worthwhile.

Don't spend each deposit as fast as possible, that way your account grows while your cash grows in that account. This is probably the safest start you can give yourself."
04/04/2021,stocks,"It all depends on your risk tolerance and your investment goals. 
If you a long-term investor and you cannot afford even paper losses then go 100% safe.
If you are a risk taker then diversify between a couple of small High risk or penny stocks.
If you’re looking for long-term income research dividend paying stocks.
You have to first go ask yourself why you are investing this money and when do you need it back? How many years do you have to see returns? 
Once you have the answers to these questions then look for companies that fit into your personal criteria.
Most importantly good luck and may your next trade be a winning trade."

APHA - Weed is gonna be huge and the industry is consolidating in Canada which I believe will give them an edge when US legalizes.

PLTR - I like this for super long hold. Their constantly building their product and don't give a heck what the stock price is doing which ADHD hodlers hate but I think will payoff massively down the road. Big Data IMO will be huge.

AAPL and ETF's are always cool but personally I like to try and find sectors I think will do really well in the future and pick one or two major players I think will be on top based on how they're running their company now.

I would just do some research and go with a sector, industry, or company that you either believe in strongly or have personal experience with, preferably both.

If you're looking for big short-term gains with a good amount of risk, but prefer to avoid options, try XXII, BCEI,  or GSL for a bit safer of a bet. NVAX maybe but I've always tried to stay away from pharma stocks that don't have anything on the market"

04/04/2021,stocks,"Screw that, $5k $800 weekly calls on GME - YOLO! /s

&#x200B;

Seriously, don't do that, it's terrible advice unless you want to lose $5k in a week with a very tiny chance of making like $50k.  Could be fun to paper trade it though."
04/04/2021,stocks,I’ll give them a look now!
04/04/2021,stocks,My goal is to make money and use my stocks as emergency/savings. I have a guaranteed income. So retirement isn’t at the front of my mind because I’ll be getting my pay then too...does this help with how you’d recommend stocks
04/04/2021,stocks,Apple at 33 p/e while not growing is not a good buy imo.
04/04/2021,stocks,"Well I’m not looking to invest money to lose it, so that’s a silly question. Of course I want to make money. As far as looking for advice, yes. Yes that’s exactly what I’m looking for. I never said in the post, but I did in a response, that I was going to take someone’s advice that I don’t know and go spend $5000. Thank you for your concern on how and where I spend my money, but again, I will not be reading just a single comment and then go and spend $5000 because a random redditor told me to!!"
04/04/2021,stocks,What’s the proper question?
04/04/2021,stocks,What is indicating that a market crash is on the horizon? Anticipated inflation or something else? I’ve been hearing this concern more frequently week-by-week🤔

04/04/2021,stocks,I want to ditto VOO. I'm a proponent for having most of my portfolio be VOO or other ETFs and a small portion being independent stocks.
04/04/2021,stocks,"As he said there's a few good Vanguard ETF products you could get in with for that amount of money, VTI, VUG, etc. You could also look to get Berkshire BRK.B, that has done well for me. If you just want to buy one thing, then buy a fund that will do the diversification for you. Buying a single stock you might as well just take that cash to Vegas as you'd probably have similar chances."
04/04/2021,stocks,"You can still max out your 2020 Roth IRA for the next few weeks if you haven't already. And I agree with Phillyfan, it's hard to go wrong with a majority of your portfolio in an index fund like VTI or VOO (I use VTI). Also might think about a growth etf like VOOG, SCHG, or QQQ, so instead of dumping 1k into just apple, you also get microsoft, amazon, google, tesla, etc. with dividends."

second understanding what business your buying is very important as well in my point of view. 
Third . Don’t swing at the first pitch, rather wait for the right one
Fourth. Don’t invest based on emotion, invest based on facts
And lastly when you do decide to invest, be emotionally prepared to see your portfolio in the red and don’t panic. Once you become Educated You will make an educated decision on when to sell. Hope this helps. Good luck on this journey and have patience it’s key."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Buy in 500$ chunks every week.

Try buying VTI or  VT as a single fund strategy with 80% of the money.

04/04/2021,stocks,Have you tried paper trading?
04/04/2021,stocks,"It is a good time to buy now, especially tech companies since they experienced a big sell off for past few weeks. Do some research on companies that you think might will go back to their usual or even exceed their price per share before the pull back. Also as many said etfs are also a good investment with less risk in my opinion."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Investopedia is the best. I'm surprised you said it's advanced. It offers basic explanations and examples of the fundamental financial concepts along with examples. 

Investopedia solely taught me options/option strategies (along with WSB).

What exactly was complicated for you?"
04/04/2021,stocks,I haven’t watched all the videos but there’s a YouTube channel called plain bagel that breaks down a lot of the basics in easily digestible ways
04/04/2021,stocks,"I feel like the old pattern of trading such as company being overvalued or undervalued does not really apply anymore to current trading. People have more access to trading platforms with 0 commission on trades, back in the old days this was not a thing. A lot of people do swing trading or day trading, instead of holding a stock forever so who cares if the company is over or undervalued, everyone just wants to make money.  Tech will just keep going up imo as the world revolves around it."
04/04/2021,stocks,That's good. I just imagine that's what most ppl on reddit do. I hope that I'm wrong lol.
04/04/2021,stocks,"Well it's usually not them just saying ""go buy X."" It's their own analysis which can almost always make sense if you don't have a way to conduct counter research."
04/04/2021,stocks,It's possible. I can see retail stores adding them for people to charge while they shop or bs.

For some reason I kinda feel that way too and I’m a little more weighted toward the Apple side. I figure no matter what I do it will be wrong. Lol. I debated the other day selling a little apple and putting it into MSFT but at the end of the day the amount I’m playing with it’s probably not a big deal. I won’t be retiring on this “play” money."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Don’t listen to this guy. 5k isn’t too much if you’re young and you won’t lose everything unless the company goes belly up. Pick 1-2 companies you’ve done some good DD on and that you truly believe in. If you hit, you’ll hit big and have a solid start into investing as a side business."
04/04/2021,stocks,"The key to making money isn't about being right and choosing the right stock at the right time. You will be right sometimes. The key is controlling how much you lose when you're wrong and what situation being wrong puts you in. 

I'm not completely against concentrated positions, prudent concentration can give you really nice gains. If you're comfortable with the elevated risk look for companies that have lower downsides and high upsides. Risk the falling knife, big companies that have good fundamentals but short-term problems."
04/04/2021,stocks,"You're gonna lose money with that attitude. I hate to be that guy but if it was that easy, everyone would do it, including Wall Street that have way more than $5,000 to invest. GME has screwed people's minds with the idea that you can get quick gains"
04/04/2021,stocks,"If you're looking for big returns very quickly, look at ""options."""
04/04/2021,stocks,Concentration/Diversity is just a tool used to limit or expand risk. It's not inherently better or worse if you understand the implications.
04/04/2021,stocks,"It’s definitely circumstance dependent, but if I’m analyzing 5k, and 5k only for the foreseeable future, probably not gonna dump it in 1 stock. But he doesn’t mind so I mean shooters shoot I guess."

04/04/2021,stocks,"Yeah even if you benchmark with Microsoft signing a deal with army for $21.6 billion for hololens. Apple has room in virtually unlimited market growth, for wearables, ar, vr, basically anywhere it decides to go. They aren’t going anywhere. 

Also does a bear shit in the woods? 
Just because the innovation isn’t in your face everyday doesn’t mean they arnt investing billions into infrastructural growth and development. They are routinely a leader in innovation, that’s in their mission statement haha"
04/04/2021,stocks,"What makes you think that Apple has stopped innovating? They are working on an electric car project as we speak... they have a cult following and will have guaranteed sales on any new product they release in the future. I think Apple is a great safe investment with a ton of growth potential at a very affordable entry point right now.

Complete disclosure I do not own any Apple shares atm as I’m too busy YOLOing on a few other positions atm lol"
04/04/2021,stocks,"Lmao, the m1 is a game changer and on that alone apple's share price should be much higher than it is. They will DOMINATE the laptop market, and probably the desktop market too once they release the next silicon generation. Apple is worth what it is today when they hold, what, 5% of the computer market? Wait until that is 50%, how much will it be worth by then? Because that's basically the situation - with apple silicon, anyone that isn't a gamer or uses very specific software should get a Mac, it's a no brainer.  Better performance/$. For personal use (web browsing, document creation, media consumption, video and photo editing, etc.) it's the best choice, and there ain't even any close competition.

Can't innovate my ass."
04/04/2021,stocks,That's not true at all. The M1 chip is revolutionary. Gonna be an interesting few years to see how it and future chips change the landscape.
04/04/2021,stocks,"Apple didn’t stop innovating. They are a massive company so their growth will be slower than others but they’re arguably the leading tech company globally and it’s hard to justify not being exposed to them. This also makes them very safe in a fast moving industry of tech (including software, hardware, etc)"
04/04/2021,stocks,"I prefer Microsoft however to be blind is to be ignorant. Apple has created a sleek sexy product that gives the image of prestige. They went from cpu to phone to music tv and services and now watches and products. That’s innovation. I doubt they will stop with tech on the rise the demand for Apple is to high.

04/04/2021,stocks,"That's not really true.
There was, and is, plenty of arm based laptops (using chromeos etc. for last 4-5 years). So they did nothing ""new/revolutionary"". Apple today is really NOT innovating company. They do more-less evolution, instead of revolution these days.

But that's not problem for me.. Stability and ""grow expectations"" are good for business/investors/me. But in my eyes I can't think about them like about company which is ""pushing market forward"" like they were in past.

Reason why I pinpointed this - today they have very small space for grow, but if they miss new trend, they can pretty fast loose big amounts of market(=cash). But it probably did not happen, so safe from long-term investment, bad from short (if I would make some ""interesting"" percentage of profit) 😉"

aMWL will now need to compete with Amazon in the same space which is not great, and SPCE postponed their test flight which was going to be my exit strategy for that one. So now I’m just going to wait. Also I think amwl employees can sell their stocks soonish so that’s going to hurt as well. Still think it can get to 30-35 or so by year end, especially if covid measures end and people still use telehealth"
04/04/2021,stocks,DIA is a good option too to hit more sectors like healthcare.
04/04/2021,stocks,"I agree that tech companies have doubled their market caps and are at all time high but, the demand also increased. IMO pandemic increased the demand for technology since people had to switch from their normal office routine to remote work. Schools all over USA and around the world were closed. Computers and other devices had to be purchased  and distributed to people which did not have access or finances to obtain one. Pull back/sell off was somehow a correction to the current stock market however the tech companies will bounce back as the world really depends on it and it will most likely keep advancing."
04/04/2021,stocks,"While 'hitting it big' is possible; you're much more likely to lose everything trying.

Devastated my account twice. Start with research, build a stable core of stocks to trade around."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Perspective. Some wants to hit it big others understand compound. 

Let’s say you make 10% a week for one yr that’s 520%

It’s easier to take small gains often than to hit the jackpot

The point is to make your money work for you, what that looks like is the struggle and why books are important. 

Securities real estate business where and how to make money work. 

I like the idea some gave you read a couple annual reports buy the companies you like. I would save 20% of your money as cash in case a down trend happens you can buy in on sale. Nothing worse that having a -10% week and not being able to buy in"
04/04/2021,stocks,"No, I don't want to hit it big and neither did Warren Buffet, you want to build up a portfolio with high dividend yield and re-invest the dividends in those stocks. Do your research and never buy overpriced securities, only buy when the intrinsic value is higher than the stock price, you will be surprised how many companies with good profit margins sell under their intrinsic value and how many good companies are significantly overvalued.  
My intent is not to ""hit it big"", this isn't Las Vegas, I want to retire at 50 with 50k annual dividends to my name so I can take it easy."
04/04/2021,stocks,6 months over the past 10-20 years is a very small window to be looking at. To state that they have stopped innovating at this point I believe is very short sighted. They have some amazing minds who are extremely forward thinking. I believe Apple in the long term is a solid investment. If your looking for a short term YOLO investment they may not be the best but I foresee solid growth over the next 5-10 years.
04/04/2021,stocks,"""There was, and is, plenty of arm based laptops (using chromeos etc. for last 4-5 years).""

Lol, the insanity. There were smartphones before the iphone, and MP3 players before the iPod, tablets before the iPad. Where are they now? Exactly. Why? Because apple did it WAY better. That's what Apple is so great at doing - picking something that is next to worthless because the experience is bad, so nobody wants it (who the fuck is using arm computers lol, I've never seen one in the wild), and make it actually good so people start using it. That's revolutionary enough for me. The Ford T wasn't the first car. But it had, by far, the most success and made the most money. And was revolutionary because it brought the car into people's lives. The Tesla wasn't the first electric car. But was the first electric car to really compel people to get an electric car.

That's what counts, not ""being the first to get it"", but ""being the first to get it right"". Apple is unbelievably good at that.

Current arm computers other than the m1 SUCK. They are terrible. Everyone can confirm that. They're a joke. It's not fucking comparable. The m1 is the first truly great, competitive in performance (beating most x86 computers in performance/price), arm based computer. Windows on arm is still an absolute joke to this day. It's just bad. And chrome os... I thought we were talking about computers, not dumb terminals."
04/04/2021,stocks,"The only difference is when you purchase. I prefer ETF because I can get in at a dip in the day below the average price a mutual fund would trade at once trading is all finished. 

The difference between the two is that an index can be an ETF, or not, and an ETF can be an index, or not. What you are really looking for as far as the difference is that they aren't two sides of a coin, but rather two different coins. Index/Managed/Stocks can all be ETF or mutual funds. SPY is an ETF index fund."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Theta trading? Alright I’m going to be honest, could be because I don’t know enough, but I never heard of that. Okay OP, I’ll give you a rundown of how this works (even though I’m quite positive you may already know) ready? Go on google, type in something along the lines of “what is the best app for trading?” Insert 2021 for relevancy. Then look at the interfaces real time in action. How you say? YouTube! Wünderfal! Then choose your app. After you download and get all set up on your new trading app, ready to grab the world by its balls, or get your balls stomped on/ coochie stomped (market don’t discriminate) YOU WILL SEE.... Apply for options trading! Sign up. Be honest, you have little experience. If you’re making chicken nuggets at Wendy’s, doesn’t matter, you’ll get approved. Also before I go on, never use margin unless you are cool with going into debt like a true American hero. Margin is the devil, real idiots take out loans from a bank ;) This is the most important part of the process. Once you get all set up, your app will tell you exactly how Calls, Puts, covered, long, short, up, down, left, right. They’ll literally show you everything you need to know. This isn’t just for OP either, this is for anybody 18- old asf wanting to really make some money. The stock market can pay you boat loads of cash. More than you know. So educate yourself and go and conquer your simulation. Happy hunting for a stock that is “not totally overvalued”"

04/04/2021,stocks,"I was new to investing and felt like I was diversifying with the different tech companies because they are all different lanes. But I took such a beating before realizing that similar market conditions effect all of them.

VOO started Mid February for me. It’s not crazy gains but boy is it just nice to see green most days now. When I saw that VOO was 36%(ish?) tech and holding most of what I had anyway but It was actually going up I realized I could either liquidate my losers and actually start making money with VOO or I could continuously dump money into other markets and hope to hit diversity and eventually win that way, which is throwing more money at an already weak decision.

Clearly I am not likely to beat the market and I would have ended up copying the different sector holdings of VOO anyway. Might as well lean into the already built in diversification and just check my app a couple times per day instead of staring at a red line all day.

 I like to set my main trackers to show my total % gained or lost, so I feel like in a year or two I’ll be looking at double digit positive % and that will give me daily dopamine. My short term fix will be watching dividends come in. Lol"
04/04/2021,stocks,"Lol I was being sarcastic. That is a watch every day portfolio besides DIS. A little less than 1% of my portfolio is SPCE, so I cannot talk lmao."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Added it to my list! Thank you.

I was kind of considering for myself downsizing everything into:

VOO as balanced (80%), QQQ as aggressive on tech (10%) and I needed one that was lower on tech than VOO (10%).

I hadn’t really hit one that I wanted to do. I was considering just VTI as it’s slightly lower but I will look at DIA.

Edit: it was VIG not VTI that I saw that had the noticeably smaller tech holding. And the higher dividend yield could maybe balance out my perceived risk in QQQ"
04/04/2021,stocks,This seems like a very one dimensional way of thinking. If he threw his money at almost any tech stock in March/April he’d be sitting at solid gains. Slower compound profits are all fine and dandy because when when you’re 60 you get to retire without financial hardship but it’s not what everyone wants.

""or not"". what happens then? What does it become if it's not an ETF?

FYI you also said that the S and P is an ETF but before said it's an index, so which is it?

Also how come the s and p 500 has a ticker symbol of .INX ? Is this supposed to be a clue that it's an index? Is this how you're supposed to tell it's an index rather than an ETF? I said spy is an etf based off what it said when you google search it ( SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust)"

I explained all that. I think you are getting confused. 

>""or not"". what happens then? What does it become if it's not an ETF?

If an index fund is not an ETF, it is a Mutual Fund. If an ETF is not an index fund it is a actively/passively managed fund of some other sort. It's not that it is an index fund RATHER than an ETF, they are two different things.

>FYI you also said that the S and P is an ETF but before said it's an index, so which is it?

S&P is an index. There are lots of funds that follow it. Those are index funds. They could be ETF, or they could be mutual funds.

>Also how come the s and p 500 has a ticker symbol of .INX ? Is this supposed to be a clue that it's an index? Is this how you're supposed to tell it's an index rather than an ETF? I said spy is an etf based off what it said when you google search it ( SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust)

The ticker part gets confusing, because there are a lot of different exchanges they might be on. The S&P 500 has a ticker of .inx and is tracked on CME, but it isn't really something you buy and sell. It's just the total stock prices of the stocks it tracks. There are ETFs and Mutual Funds that you can buy that are pretty close to exactly what stocks the S&P 500 tracks. Those are index funds.

So in summary there are a lot of different things you can buy. You can buy index funds, actively managed funds, passively managed funds, stocks, bonds, commodities, etc. When you buy index and managed funds, they might be available as ETFs or Mutual Funds, or sometimes both. For instance VTI and VTSAX are two funds that Vanguard offers that tracks the total US stock market. Index Funds. VTI is an ETF, and VTSAX is a Mutual Fund."

So an index fund is just an overgeneralized term that may be referring to an etf or mutual fund correct?"
04/04/2021,stocks,"spy is an index fund. That's why it is trading at 400 instead of 4000. A single share of spy will get you .1 shares of each stock in the S&P 500... approximately. It's not an overgeneralization, it is a specific classification of fund you can get... there are just a LOT of different indexes and funds for them. And depending on which one it might be an ETF or mutual fund. Usually 1-4 letters indicates ETF, but not always. People tend to recommend them because the big indexes cover a lot of the market and provide some built in diversification for you. Most active fund managers don't tend to beat the big indexes."

2021-04-04 16:27:41,stocks,"Jobs offering stock purchase programs Just got a job at FedEx ground and in orientation one of the benefits we receive is the option to sign up for company stock purchasing. I am just wondering how this could be any different than taking my paycheck and buying the stocks myself. No one at the facility where I work knows what it is or the logistics of it. Does anyone here have jobs that offer something similar? And is the option even a good benefit or are they just stretching thin? I am curious as to how other people utilize this benefit if they so have it.

04/04/2021,stocks,"I'm onboarding with a company that allows us to set aside money from each paycheck, and then at the end of the quarter, they use the money we set aside to buy us stock in the company at a 5% discount. 

It's basically loaning the company money at a 20% APY return. I won't hold long, I'll just sell the shares and put the proceeds into my brokerage account and use that as my method of contributing to my investments."
04/04/2021,stocks,Each company has different terms I’m sure fed ex being so big has details online you can read. My company plan is it takes out of paycheck each week only buys the actual stock once a yr. at what price does it buy it you may ask? Well my plan takes lowest average price stock maintained for 3 days in a row and we get it 15% cheaper then that price. Also after you buy it you have to hold it one year before you can sell. So for me it’s a no brained I get 15% off lowest price all year (which would be impossible for me to try and time market on my own).  Each company I’m sure is different just read your policy
04/04/2021,stocks,"ESPP is wwaaayyy better than buying it yourself.

Typically, you buy it at a 15% discount.

04/04/2021,stocks,"Depending on the company they may match your contributions up to a percentage as well. Thats how it's always been for me.

04/04/2021,stocks,"As others have mentioned, you may get a discount on purchase prices. My company does 15% below the lowest point in each investment window.

04/04/2021,stocks,"Look for restrictions. I've worked at a place that sold stock to me at a discount, but restricted the shares from being sold for a year. In a volatile market that restriction wipes out the value of the discount."

Starbucks too."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Similar situation at my work. 

ESPP is a 15% discount, purchased automatically each quarter. The discount is taken from the lower of two prices, either the first or last day of that quarter. 

Basically you opt into the program prior to quarter, up to 10% of your earnings and the dollars are set aside from each check and then stock is purchased roughly 30 days after a quarter ends. 

I’m required to hold stock for 1 year, which isn’t a big deal given that shifts the stock to long term capital gains. 

Also, I think there is a federal law that caps the max amount of fair market value at $25k per year under an ESPP program. 

Bottom line, imho, if you work for a stable company with a normal stock trend, buying at a discount is a great way to earn a little extra cash."
04/04/2021,stocks,"According to the FAQ from Computershare, seems the only possibly benefit is that you get the monthly average price that is purchased from the broker.  They purchase multiple times per month, so you reduce the risk of buying at the top.

04/04/2021,stocks,"If you are an employee of a company there are restrictions on buying stock outside of an employee purchase program, because you are now an insider.

Remember all that fine print when you opened your trading account?  insider trading is in there.

04/04/2021,stocks,"When I was doing it with Amazon it was kind of bullshit. It came out of your paycheck after-tax and then the purchase wasn't made until almost 5 days after the check went into your account (so slower than just getting the money and depositing it to most brokerages). The upside is that if you use the DSPP (direct stock purchase program) you don't have to keep track of the ""lock-up periods"" that seem like half the year where you're not allowed to trade because of insider trading regulations. 

For the people with more important jobs than me there are other options, but that's how the basic one that's available to everyone works."
04/04/2021,stocks,"I work at a big tech company with an employee stock purache program which grants 15% off the stock available to purchase twice a year with up to 10% of your salary.

04/04/2021,stocks,"It depends on what the terms are.  If you get to purchase shares at a discount.  For example, the company I work for you get to buy at a 15% discount once a quarter.  After the initial buy, if you hold the stock for 1 year, you receive a one time 1 additional share for each 6 you own. That works out to about a 30% discount.  I would suggest asking tour local HR about your specifics of your plan."

I haven’t signed any sort of paper for it and as far as I am aware no one at my facility is apart of this program.

04/04/2021,stocks,Did you work for Apple? This is exactly how it was when I worked there
04/04/2021,stocks,I would assume too since the it business models are almost identical. 10% is a hell of a discount! I would love 5% but if I am lucky enough for 10% you bet I am signing up for this. Everyone who has commented so far has had nothing bad to say about it. That’s enough for me to feel much more confident in this decision. It makes me feel more secure because once again no one at my facility knows anything about it so it’s a little scary being the first to dip my toes in. Who knows maybe in a couple weeks I will be preaching to my coworkers who can afford it to sign up too.
04/04/2021,stocks,This is very helpful thank you. Hopefully I can learn something more about it from a higher up when I set it up.
04/04/2021,stocks,Is your place FedEx if you don’t mind disclosing? Or elsewhere?
04/04/2021,stocks,This is very helpful thank you. I will see what kind of discounts (if any) are available to me. Today is Easter so their office isn’t open but tomorrow I am going to bring it up at work and see what I can find out. If the discounts are great I want to start hoarding enough for options plays. If I earn a stock a week it would take me a little over two years to earn enough shares to sell calls and collect premiums. Time changes everything so my plan is subject to change as well. Maybe once COVID starts to recede and people stop purchasing everything online the stock will fall and disaster will occur. But I don’t really care I’m just here for the ride.
04/04/2021,stocks,Good call. FedEx is a strong stock so I would try to think of the stock offering as an additional retirement plan. Put in what you can afford to miss from your monthly budget and watch it grow over time
04/04/2021,stocks,I always wondered but never knew that. I assumed it would be average price over the 3 months or something. Good to know!
04/04/2021,stocks,"At my job I defer 10% of my paycheck for 3 months and then they purchase the shares 30 days later in the amount I deferred at a 15% discount.

04/04/2021,stocks,"My experience is that we could sign in on options that would expire after 6 months.

04/04/2021,stocks,"I work at a company that isn’t publicly traded yet but the way my company does it is they set a “strike price” from when I started, then it takes 5 years for all 500 options to vest. Mine is like a few dollars per option. If we are bought out or go public, the stock goes up and I got in at an incredibly cheap price. 

When I worked at SBUX it was similar in that you had to work X amount of time before you earned any shares. It makes me kind of wish I had worked there for longer because I think they’ve doubled in stock price since I worked there."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Pre tax = Gross income purchase

Post tax = Net income purchase

I think their point is if the purchase of the stock is in your 401k it would be tax advantaged.

Additionally most companies sell you the stock at a discount to market. For example, say the stock was at a price of $100 per share today and your company said they will sell it to you at 5% less than the market, then you would pay $95 per share for it.

The issue with buying company stock is that you are increasing your concentration of risk. You are placing both your savings and your income into the hands of the same company. If Fed Ex falls on hard times, then you are doubly hit with a falling stock price and a potential job loss. Because of this you'll want to keep your exposure relatively low.

Hope this makes sense. Good luck and thank you for helping deliver our packages."
04/04/2021,stocks,Most these places limit it to 10% of your salary.
04/04/2021,stocks,Lol yeah nobody at my place has any clue how mine works either unless there in it. There are some downsides to look out for as well. In my case they keep stock at UBS which for me is about the worst user experience try to navigate there dashboard to find your amount. Also UBS still so old school they charge me $20 to sell it when I do. Which is annoying. But the $20 charge still well worth it for me. I normally just wait the year cash out about half and move that to schwab to buy other stuff
04/04/2021,stocks,I think that’s standard in tech
04/04/2021,stocks,"I get 10%, but employees have it purchased on their behalf by a broker, then the employee can do whatever we want with it. The stock is $850 + and employees can put a max of 15% of each pay period towards purchasing a share. When you have enough the broker buys a share. It’s not worth it for me to forgo 15% of my income to make $85 pretax dollars. Then there is also the time delay of the whole process and it also anchors you to the company."
04/04/2021,stocks,Elsewhere :)
04/04/2021,stocks,My guess is that the only thing you will be able to do in this account is accumulate stock.  You should be able to transfer the shares to a brokerage account at some point though.
04/04/2021,stocks,"When you purchase the stock though your system, is it subtracted from your paycheck weekly?

04/04/2021,stocks,Only downside of selling immediately is that you have to pay short term capital gains.
04/04/2021,stocks,"I like the way you portray this option with both the cons and the pros. People have said that the worst case scenario is that they fall and I lose my job and my shares tank, which is a little scary but at the same time it is the risk that all of us are exposed to even putting your money in the market in the first place. I also see what you mean about leaving the money in FedEX’s hands. The whole point of working for them to to take it out of their hands and put it in mine. I’m probably foolish but I am willing to put that on the line of the benefits are good enough. U/Holdihold told me how their plan looks at the 3 day low and purchases at that price - 15% of the price of the stock, which sounds very enticing. U/letsgorace also mentioned how their package allocates one additional stock for each 6 you hold per year. This is the package I am really looking for but I don’t know yet because I haven’t called or googled yet, just absorbing anecdotes right now."

04/04/2021,stocks,The only thing I know so far is that it buys the shares at the month average so I don’t buy high. Hopefully there are more potential benefits I could learn from a higher up in the facility
04/04/2021,stocks,"I’m paid bimonthly but yes that is how it works. Each check will have a deduction for the amount I’m contributing to the ESOP. Then each quarter (so for me it’s end of March, end of June, end sept and end of dec) I will see a purchase of the stocks and it shows both market price at time of purchase and my purchase price which is 5% cheaper.

I would start small and see how the missing money feels and then increase as you feel appropriate. A smart tip I got is you don’t miss money you never see so deductions like this are a great way to hide money from yourself to grow for the future"

2021-04-04 16:12:26,stocks,"How to get rid of the ""i need to balance my loss"" mentality Hi,

due to volatility in the current market I sold all my stocks except my World/EM ETFs and now having a little loss of around 500$ overall a few weeks ago.

Now seeing the tendencies of the last week I regret selling, realizing the loss and and I am annoyed, although the sale per se gives me peace in these fluctuating times.

How can I best cope with my loss? It is purely mental that I always think I want to compensate by finding other opportunities."
04/04/2021,stocks,"If it's fluctuating, don't sell the dip.  If you're looking for immediate opportunities, take your time- the stock you jump into doesn't know or care about your last trade, let your next trade stand on its own."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Sounds like you were invested in companies you had little knowledge, therefore little faith in. If you cant list off 5 real reasons why you're invested in said company confidently, whether it's to your mom a teacher or even a succesful investor, than dont invest in it. Now is not the time for the inexperienced to be throwing money at companies that just sound cool or are being talked about on reddit. Learning to read and understand earnings reports, valuations, and doing research on how the markets work as a whole would work wonders for many people"
04/04/2021,stocks,"Put the money back into stocks. There are lots of stocks selling at a price lower than a few weeks ago, so instead of seeing what you have as a loss (which you have just realised by cashing out) you can look at it as a reallocation. Stocks always go up over time. Panicking in the short term because of volatility is only human, but it is more sensible to look at the bigger picture."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Realize that losing hurts more than winning feels good.

You weren't wrong to reduce your anxiety in the volatility. If things had collapsed it would have saved you.

Learn to hedge, so you can switch some long assets to short next time and reduce that loss or even profit from a breakdown."

Not everyone is meant to be an investor. Get out of the market if you’re not emotionally equipped."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Whatever stock you buy, make sure you trust the company, and accept the fact the market fluctuates up down sideways. I was down 5% Tuesday, but took it as is and held on everything. Then Wed and Thurs comes the loss turned green. 

Good thing for you it is just $500. At least you learned while early in the game. I too sold some at a loss (NIO, -$400), but did not regret it as it kept dropping after i sold it. But Have I held it till this past Thursday, I would have close to break even and possibly gained more for next week but it is what it is."
04/04/2021,stocks,"I personally dont sell if i dont make a profit.

Profits or bankruptcy."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Trying to grasp the size of your loss here. $500 might be considered not much, but to some it might be a big slice of their current savings..
This drives home the importance of gaving conviction in your investments - I go in with the mentality of 'I'm expecting short term losses, but I will continue to buy in and later on see long term gains'. Knowing I'm not playing to sell out in the next year helps me let a bit of red on my stock portfolio slide."
04/04/2021,stocks,"The emotional aspect to investing can be hard to control at times for some people. Here is what I do. Before I buy anything I write down why I am buying it. If I plan to sell if It goes down 5-7% then I write that down as well (these are for my short-mid term trades). All others I don't sell. Then when the market has volatility I just look at what I wrote down (my plan for that asset).     


As others have suggested always keep in mind (if the stock is solid) that over time, usually it will go back up. You can see evidence of that by zooming out on a stock very far and look at each of the big dips and see where it is now and how long it took to recover.    

For many getting control of that fear or greed can be hard. So for those people, I suggest ETF investing. The returns are good but not what it could be with the right stock picks (if your pick correctly), this is not an easy task and most people get it wrong over time."
04/04/2021,stocks,Education- get some audio books and listen to as many as possible.  Red means buy green means sell
04/04/2021,stocks,Good effing question!! My buddy is nearly professional in skill level and still tells me about times he is in a trade just to try and pare earlier losses on the same stock lol. He still hasn't figured it out and it's been yeeeeears
04/04/2021,stocks,"As a trader, what helped me the most was not hanging on losses. It's important that you go back and try to figure out what you did wrong in the trade, and what you did right. Don't let your losses dictate your next trade.  


Also, remember the environment we're in now. The times when you can just buy any random stock and watch it explode higher in a short period is over, IMO. Stay safe, be nimble, and only put your money behind your best trade ideas. If you're not comfortable with managing emotions yet, it may help to paper trade at first and actually visualize the emotions."
04/04/2021,stocks,Liquor or weed.
04/04/2021,stocks,"Not an expert but you didn't mention your timeframe.

It depends for how long you were planning to keep the stocks. It helps if you know you're in it for 3-5-10 years.
In that case, based on your conviction, as others have mentioned, you'll want to add to your position in stead of selling when it's down.

It sucks to see red, but remember your timeframe and conviction.

You don't ""lose money"" until you sell it."
04/04/2021,stocks,I don't know.. I only know that in these times with an imminent market crash I'm also pretty scared..

Good morning everyone,

here are my new ideas for the next week. As usual, you will find additional info + my Charts in a PDF under the Google-Drive Link:

[PDF with additional TA, Charts and Financials](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MvQCqt8d6bSQepoztL74tTR3NZIXthHG/view?usp=sharing)

This week, I focussed on 2 Tech-Stocks that were not hit that hard by the recent selloff, one promising BioTech-Stock, one from the Energy-Sector that might benefit from the upcoming restructure of the $ICLN and the last one is Plant/Seed Consumer-Play with recent Insider-Grants and Buys.

Here are quick summaries:

**Corsair Gaming**

Was not that affected by the massive Tech-Selloff.

Re-Claimed all 3 EMA’s in the past week – I believe that it will be picked up again by Funds/HF-Algos once it will trade above $35

Very strong fundamentals, solid financial numbers.

Although it is a tech-growth stock, Corsair is kinda an old company with a very strong position in the E-Sports/Gaming Sector.

Could be played as a Mid-Swing but also as a Long-Hold.

I would add a starter now/at $35 and slowly scale in.

**Corvus Pharmaceuticals**

Was beaten down by public offering & earnings. Fundamentals are not that great, but Analysts are very bullish on hit, and the 2.5x median price target is something to look for.

\- Several catalysts Phase 2/3 in 2021

\- Major ownership on “Angel Pharma”  Chinese Market

\- [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/corvus-pharmaceuticals-provides-business-reports-123000328.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/corvus-pharmaceuticals-provides-business-reports-123000328.html)

**Limelight Networks**

“Limelight Networks is one of the best-positioned CDN providers that focuses on providing services to on-demand live video, web content, and software and digital media providers. It has the likes of Amazon, Comcast, Sony, Walt Disney as its customers. As one of the best CDN service providers, with strong infrastructure and steady growth, the company may have some value. Execution remains the main issue, and that too in a competitive environment, to justify significant upside”

They are not profitable yet, although they have a very good customer base. I would play this as a recovery/earnings-play, then sell-off with a good profit. Wait for the fall after earnings and the buy-in again for a longer hold.

**NextEra Energy**

[https://www.ft.com/content/d43ec8c5-0990-4781-b71f-82cb73a09610](https://www.ft.com/content/d43ec8c5-0990-4781-b71f-82cb73a09610)

ICLN will be 3x and change its holding mid-April.

While there will be a lot of selling pressure on $PLUG and other holdings, $NEE might be included and therefore benefit from that.

“In that scenario, ETFs tracking the index would need to buy all of the freshly added stocks, as well as increasing their holdings in some existing constituents.

This would mean the iShares ETFs would need to pump more than $400m into each of Vestas Wind Systems, Orsted, and NextEra Energy, as well as large sums into Chinese groups such as China Longyuan Power, Xinjiang Goldwind, and GCL-Poly Energy.”

**Calyxt**

Agriculture/Seed-Play; Very High Insider & Institutional Ownership

Wait for the price above the EMA’s, then scale in

04/04/2021,stocks,Yup HIMX was on my last List.. still with good potential!
04/04/2021,stocks,"Hi there,

it stayed inside its channel all the time, and the ultimate drop was due to the ""good"" earnings. I cannot post my Chart here, will try to send it to you via PN - but despite other TechStocks it never fell below the former low"
2021-04-04 13:48:10,stocks,"Wash Sale... day trading nightmare? From what I understand... if I’m day trading the same company - Tesla, for instance - a bunch of times in a 30 day window, I’m triggering a wash sale, and my cost basis keeps changing every time I make another purchase. However, if I totally close my position in Tesla on Nov 20, and don’t touch it until Jan 2, then my losses are deductible, right? 

The worst thing I can do is trigger a wash sale, and *not* repurchase, thereby not allowing me to increase the cost basis by the same amount of the loss and formally close out the position and realize my gains/loss. (Buying Feb 1, selling Feb 15 at a loss and then just not buying again) 

Is this right?"
04/04/2021,stocks,"There's nothing special about wash sales and day trading. Once you sell your new position, the disallowed losses are realized.

The actual caution with wash sales is with tax loss harvesting. If you want to harvest losses by the end of the year, say Dec 31st, and then re-buy within 30 days, you now carry those losses over to the new year. Any gains you had in the previous year are now taxable. If it's a lot of gains and you have no money for taxes, then you're screwed."
04/04/2021,stocks,"This may sound harsh,  but it's in good intent.  If you aren't experienced enough to understand a basic rule like the wash rule, you really have no business playing the market by day trading.  Day trading is the easiest way to financial ruin. You should spend more time learning the fundamentals and buy and hold. Sure it's not as fun, but you can build wealth and also not put as much time into watching your stocks."

>If it's a lot of gains and you have no money for taxes, then you're screwed.

Is it right to think that this only applies if you have spent all your gains hence have no money to pay taxes? Otherwise, surely you aren't liable to pay more taxes than you have realised gains?"
04/04/2021,stocks,Same case had $45 million in trade volume too.
04/04/2021,stocks,Yep. Basically only if you got a shit ton of gains then lost it all right after that December cut off. You'd have to pay it bc the loss would be on the next tax year and the previous would still have the gain

I'm with you on PLTR. Not as confident in them as my other holdings but they're a company that excites me and I'm willing to hold them as a high risk play.


Do you have any e-commerce holdings? Amazon and Etsy are two of my favourites. I think e-commerce only accounts for 9% of retail expenditure atm so there's still so much room for growth in the sector, crazy as it seems and I expect the pandemic to act as a catalyst for more people who previously avoided online shopping to now be in the funnel."

Biotech will grow a lot in the next years, I hope. Their diagnostic division is world leading (revenue). Not too much growth potential in stock price (short term there's a high earnings grow forecast), but getting money when the market is down is a plus.

Swiss Re: Largest reinsurance company. Dividend in 2020: Same as 2019. Currently around 6% of the stock price. Stock price very volatile, dividend payout relatively consistent. There's bad years (2004 tsunami, 2020 pandemic, for instance), but they always come back. Just imagine buying them for 12 bucks in 2009 and getting a dividend of 6 bucks now.

LafargeHolcim: Largest cement producer. Aquired US company Firestone Building Products (they built the roof of Apple's headquarters, leader of roofing systems and sustainability) just on the first of April and the plan is to sell their products globally (not only in the Americas). Demand for ""greener products"" is on the rise (better margin), this also includes recycling of building materials. Dividend currently around 3.5%, stagnant the last years. Earning forecast looks great (11% per year). Relatively high debt, but the debt has been shrinking continuously the last years. And as long as buildings are built, building materials will be needed. Short term: ""Build Back Better"" plan in the US."
04/04/2021,stocks,I like NIO over Tesla. It just seems way more practical to swap batteries and have dedicated charging stations charge them than expect everyone to wait around 30 minutes plus to charge their own car (NIO can swap a battery in 3 minutes in comparison!). Even charging while parking seems a non/starter as good parking is always hard to find and it’ll be that much harder when parking is also how you refuel.

The only bear is their management Melo is known for over promising and under delivering .  In the short term, hype might pump the stocks but that is not sustainable until they become profitable.  So that’s the only that make me cautious.  But that checkered past will have a good payout if they manage to execute it well.

Many such brands may very well have the financial strength to tackle the issue. Further, many of these companies (TM, HMC, Hyundai, even Daimler to an extent) are selling at favorable valuations, and pay dividends. Prior to VW's EV press play, they were moderately valued, too. But their stock skyrocketed because of all the hype in EV, and that opportunity is now gone. What if Toyota is next? Or Mercedes? Just something to consider."

I'm not sure what the play is yet. But companies like bp & shell will have to adapt, and are working on it. GE (maybe not a dirty company) is putting lots of resources into green tech."

Is there more downside to PLTR? My view is the stock is worth buying between 20-25 if you plan to hold it for years. If it goes below $20 still fine you can average down."
04/04/2021,stocks,"If I had to pick one it'd probably be Beam for their base editing. There is risk attached as so much is based on trials and approval, and Beam are one of the newer companies among those commonly discussed (2017).  There'll be lots of winners in this new space, because, unfortunately, there are lots of diseases. Who the best is, who the Microsoft/Amazon of this sector will be, is the golden question.

04/04/2021,stocks,"I prefer to own companies that are cheaper, have a healthier dividend, and do one or two things very well.  QCOM seems to be a conglomerate of communications. Not slamming QCOM just not right for me.

I own UNIT for all of their unused fiber, dividend, and growth potential and LMRK because they own the land beneath cell towers.  Used to own AMT but sold because they were to slow in growing, price was high ( sucking up too many of my assets for too little gain) and their dividend was below 4% (one of my stock thresholds).

Now I do own an expensive stock - IIPR which currently sells for ~$180.  But my cost basis is under $25. Bought at $58, $64 & $71 and sold 1/3 for $161."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Had AMD and sold it.  Only semiconductor I ever wanted to own.  Sold when founder left. He was the principal reason to own stock.   He was a visionary.

Why only DQ?  DQ makes silicon which every other semiconductor needs to manufacture chips.  I don't want to own the end product (semiconductors), just the raw material all the mfg's need.  

Same reason I own utes instead of electric cars.  Want to supply EV owners with power, not own the EV stock (car buyers are fickle).  Buying an EV is a once in a 5 - 10 year cycle and can be disrupted by events like recessions, etc..  Electricity is 24/7/365, and the utes give me love offerings (dividends).  Just like grocery distributors.

My usual requirements for buying a stock are priced between $15 - $50/share, paying a dividend of 4% or more, not on the bleeding edge (having anything directly to do with retail consumers), having long contracts with other manufacturers (5 years or longer) and a wonderful ability to grow their stock price & dividend.  Exceptions can be made but 90% of what I own fit this bill when they were bought originally."
04/04/2021,stocks,Intel is a shit investment so no lol
04/04/2021,stocks,"MSOS etf focuses on the US market, I believe the only major etf to do so. I dont think it will go 10x up in price, but when the weed market is finally not dealing with restrictive, expensive legislation and established, I can't imagine it not going up 2-3x, maybe more.

My favorite individual company is CRLBF. They're one of the very few to be profitable in the current difficult market and are in multiple states. HQ is in my state and I know for a fact their product is great. Meets all my criteria for a stock to own. If I had to guess what one of the major players will be in 5 years, I'm confident it will be them.

Some big cons to be aware of with weed stocks though:

If legislation doesn't pass soon, stock prices can plummet. It costs a lot of money to deal with the restrictive laws and taxes, so companies struggle to keep profitable. Not only that, but wsb making weed a meme in February really fucked with stock prices. Some are still very overvalued and, like tech, could be due for even more of a correction 

The above makes them naturally volatile. I was down 25% one week, up 15% the next 

With the nature of the product itself being easy to grow and the market as it is now being difficult to survive as a company in, the next Starbucks of weed may not even exist as a company yet.

Finally, Canadaian companies and US companies have different long term value. Canadian companies are most likely not going to strongly benefit from US legalization. They need licenses to sell here and most aren't getting them. But, they're also going to be the biggest growers for the world market. A couple big players are making progress in Europe. The US market meanwhile has quite a few penny stocks that can explode though with legalization. So kind of a, slightly less risk, smaller reward with established Canadian companies, higher risk higher reward with smaller US companies. My opinion. But the weed market either way is going to grow, that's a fact. How to capitalize on it is a difficult thing, though."

I'd also add, these are in my moonshots portfolio; I have small parts of my portfolio in each. The majority of my holdings are in local (non-US) dividend stocks.

It's a well run company, that cares about its community and is re-investing into their future. It has somewhat of a USP, that kind of home-made craft marketplace isn't really matched by any other companies on that level. Yes there are smaller websites that offer similar, but Etsy is huge these days. eBay and Amazon aren't the same at all, and don't compete directly imo.

They also did very well during the pandemic, gaining a lot of new customers, which will likely be retained moving forward.

Lots of growth potential in the future for Etsy."

(Which would be an important symbol for the electric revolution and a major bump for the share price just like the S&P did for him)

But other than that, no reason to split anymore. Every broker allows fractional shares, so it's not like accessibility for average investors matters anymore.

They make electricity from pig poo.  Basically they convert the methane outgassed from pig poo, that is stored in huge concrete vats, into electricity.  They have been a viable company for 20+ years but just recently became a stock company.  I had learned of them about 4 years ago when looking for other Alternative energy companies.

04/04/2021,stocks,"Share price matters to me as a pre-qualifier for whether I do DD on a stock.   It is not an absolute nullifier.  I had bought IIPR, in a previous post, at $58, $64, & $71 which should prove my point.  Have also bought stocks before that pay no dividend.  Have two now AQMS & MNTK.  Since they have no dividend, they need to perform to compensate for no dividend.

A lot of the companies I am interested in are younger with smaller volume and are non-tech orientated which means they usually have smaller share prices but do pay a dividend.  Since they are younger, if they have a vision for their company and can execute on it, they have the potential to grow both their price and dividend.  The wonderful thing is my strategy puts my portfolio percentage appreciation, at the close of each business day, between the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 so I am content.  Not winning the trifecta every day nor slumming along with the slowest pony is a good place to be.

04/04/2021,stocks,"Right now esports are a terrible investment. They don't make money (at all), and are completely reliant on being propped up by either the developer pumping in money (LoL, Dota, Fortnite) or speculative venture capital (CSGO)

esports do have massive potential and as someone that plays a bunch I would love to put my money in it. But the models at the moment don't work. esports are loss-making marketing budgets for the developers of the games.

ESL are the only company that somewhat tread-water and do OK, but they make the majority of their money from selling tickets for big stadium events with financial support from the devs (again). i.e The devs pay them to host the event and pay the prize-pool.

I just had a look at the holdings for that ETF and these aren't esports companies. They are gaming publishers and gaming developers or companies broadly related to gaming like AMD, Nvidia. I don't understand why they have an ETF with Tencent, Nintendo, Square Enix, AMD and Zynga advertised as an esports ETF. (CDProjekt???, this is just misleading).

This ETF isn't bad, they are all great companies its just completely unrelated to what i'd call an esports company like ESL or Blast. The video gaming side of the ETF is great, just hold it long-term."

The long term ones I don’t have exact exit dates but given that they’ve already done well for me, I would have no issue exiting at any time to move the funds to other investments. My short term plays I’m expecting to exit Oct/Nov this year.

My strategy for eSports has been to target companies that support the industry through content creation, event organization and management, etc rather that trying to monetize the events themselves (though I have a few small plays in those types of companies). One of the companies does own a few eSports teams but that’s not their bread and butter. These intermediary companies are doing well as their revenue comes through advertising, streaming viewership and event organization fees (they do everything from small community events and up) and generate revenue outside of major events.

Think of like investing in the companies that support the NFL and NHL rather than investing in any of the franchises themselves."

People are dumb, panicky animals’

Some analysts - worth listening to and learning from

The rest - their morning meeting was ‘PUMP THIS STOCK because ..... any number of reasons that, when push comes to shove, involve a conflict"
04/04/2021,stocks,I guess information is always good but i would stick to my own analysis
04/04/2021,stocks,"Several analysts have put PT of one well known stock to be $130 one day before it crashed ~20%. I had a feeling that PTs are farts in the wind, but now I know they work against you."
04/04/2021,stocks,Check how they did in the past
04/04/2021,stocks,"I would say take them with a pinch of salt. That said, I like aggregated analyst targets, especially where even the most bearish price is above the current share price. I use it more to verify my own numbers though, I'm not using analyst numbers to drive my investment decisions, more just sanity check, especially my larger positions.  

&#x200B;

As an example, I am bullish on GAW - it's a top 5 holdings - a FTSE250 company (owner of Warhammer) because the business is incredible. Recently, it had a wobble based on a high multiple (it's up 1800%/2400% divi reinvested over 5 years) and worries that the run-up was about nerds playing in their basement due to lockdown which would subside once lockdown eased. 

&#x200B;

I personally don't buy this narrative, I think the numbers are great, I think it's picked up long term business due to Covid and I am cheered by a number of positive developments, from international sales to licensing revenue to rumours of a screening series. 

&#x200B;

So after sanity checking my own reasoning, reviewing the numbers, and then checking analyst guidance, I decided to buy some more shares in the 9300-9600 range."
04/04/2021,stocks,"I appreciate the opinions expressed here because I know that these opinions are not motivated on your personal gains, unlike what we can read that analysts have posted.

I think I can summarize the answers by saying: analyst price targets might help one to gain confidence in decisions that they came up with on their own but should not be used to set ones expectations in the first place.  Or in short, don't take out a mortgage to put money into a stock just because some analyst said it was a good buy."
04/04/2021,stocks,"There's a lot of people calling analyst price targets BS. I agree, but the thing is, a lot of people do trust them. So it'll likely still go up."

2021-04-04 07:44:18,stocks,"Stock Ownership Greetings,

When a corporate insider or person who holds significant shares of a company sells the shares in question, is that done through retail brokerages or large investment banks?

&#x200B;

I remember reading that Mark Zuckerberg sold his shares in Facebook to Facebook."
04/04/2021,stocks,"I’m not too terribly sure who they are sold through specifically, but when insiders do buy or sell as well as exercise options of their company’s shares, they have to file those transactions with the SEC. You can either go onto the sec website to see what insiders are doing with their shares (although searching is kind of a pain) or you can go onto Finviz under the insiders tab and see recent transactions that were filed as recent as the end of the trading day. If your investing for medium or long term, even swing trading and/or options, these are good things to look at as ceo’s, majority, or +10% holders usually know when it’s a good time to buy or sell shares of their own company.
PS, not a financial advisor and do your DD."
04/04/2021,stocks,"They use brokerage firms like E*trade, Charles Schwab, etc."
04/04/2021,stocks,"They’re different situations, though can cross over. 

A)An insider - generally an employee or an associate thereof - is someone who has access to inside information - that is, market sensitive knowledge about a corporate and its prospects (or what those prospects might be) that is not yet public (ie known by anyone who is not an insider). Like a member of the board, senior management, traders, compliance, etc.  

Due to the level of understanding such people have about matters actually or potentially how a corporate’s share price might react to whatever knowledge they have, freedom to trade in securities issued by that corporate such people have is restricted heavily, by law and regulation, to prevent them gaining an unfair advantage over the rest of the market, by knowing better when to buy, or sell. Firm, right requirements that must be met before such people are permitted to trade instruments in the corporate are imposed in most, maybe all, jurisdictions, and failure to abide by them carries prison time or big-steez financial retribution for anyone found to have used their knowledge to secure a gain or avoid a loss. 

An insider doesn’t need a lot of money to do wrong. None in fact. Telling someone else something you know so they can trade on it - also illegal. Think fund managers telling wife or kids or friend - the person who knows doesn’t actually trade - they just pass on things they shouldn’t.  

Now....

B)Having a large long position in a corporate you don’t work for, with, or is different. Owning a sizeable stake in a corporate gives influence, in most cases. But unless one of your employees is on the corporate’s board or books, your access to inside information is (or should be) unaffected, if the corporate and share holder understand their market abuse obligations. Those being don’t trade on inside information - it’s unfair, distorts the market, and is therefore illegal- carrying both civil (money) and criminal (prison) penalties. 

To your question:

Both A and B forms of ‘enhanced’ dealing are often possible through retail brokers.  But:

A are individuals. Generally, retail brokers take care of individuals. 

B is usually going to be a massive investment house with a tonne of money they invest for other people. They ought to have a panel of brokers their traders may use. 

Many brokers offer both individual and institutional clients accounts. But they’re vastly different demographics. 

The wealthier a person or family is, the more likely one of the institutional lot will have a product/service that suits them. 

Mark zuckerberg - fuck me. No idea. Other than he’s not going to give Hargreaves Landsdown or TD Waterhouse £7.50 a trade or whatever it is they bag. He’ll have a special arrangement. Quite possibly with one of the big investment banks. Quite possibly with a few of them. And he probably pays someone to deal with all of it, in a way that ensures the maximum possible is attributable to activities of his charitable foundation, minimising by doing so any tax bill IRS or any other global tax authorities might seek to wave in his face. 

Warping back to earth..... a normal person with a lot of money but not a stupid Mark Z amount....

- More than 10-25m depending, a big investment bank might be bothered to take them on 
- Otherwise, they might need to divvy it up between a couple of retail-facing brokers; most have a maximum investment of something like 5m, because more than that, you’re getting closer to the possibility of anything coming in being ill-gotten gains, which no one wants to deal with, but the investment banks have the depth of compliance / legal lot to
- 1. Check the source of funds more deeply; then 
- 2. Tell the regulator to fuck off if questions get raised 

That’s basically it."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Very large trades are negotiated between traders. They couldn't be made on the open market without causing massive price disruption. When the deal is agreed the traders report it and it shows up on the ticker.

When you hear of share buyback programs, that's primarily why they exist. Not to buy dribs and drabs from retail investors, but to let insiders and other whales cash-out without damaging the market value of the company. Ironically the share reduction actually tends to increase the stock price, even though cash assets are lost to it. So rank-and-file go along with the plan and even demand it."
04/04/2021,stocks,"I believe they can also contact a bank/HF/other institutional investor directly for block trades, though the exact methods they use to do so are unclear"

2021-04-04 07:35:35,stocks,"DD I wrote for my friends and I discord, thought I’d share.        Energy Transfer LP, ticker symbol ET, is an Energy Sector Master Limited Partnership, or MLP comprised of 13 companies currently, ET itself and 12 acquisitions it’s made over the years . A MLP is simply a publicly traded partnership. What this means is that instead of buying a share of the company and being just a voting shareholder, you pay to become a corporate partner and instead of dividends you are paid out in distributions which are basically the same thing with one difference, MLP are closer to REIT’s and BDC’s than individual stocks, and like those two assets that’s have to pass 90% of profits not used in upkeep of the business to shareholders, MLP’s have to pass on 100% of profits not reinvested into the business. Final note on MLP’s is that their distributions are taxed like REIT’s and BDC’s so if you have a tax advantaged account I would put ET there rather than a normal brokerage but it’s absolutely fine to have in a normal brokerage if that’s all you have. 

        ET currently operates in the business of transporting oil, gas, natural gas, and liquid natural gas (LNG) from its source to energy companies that turn it into electricity or refine it or whatever. ET itself is only concerned about the transport or energy, almost like it’s in the name or something. As a result ET has been able to expand its business so much that it is responsible for the transport of 1/4 of all US produced natural gas and LNG, as well as 35% of all US produced crude oil. If you live in the southern US, your power ran though their pipes at some point. In addition to their energy transportation lines, which account for roughly 88% of revenue, ET owns a controlling stake in both Sunoco (34% of common stock shares owned by ET; which it uses to sell their gasoline directly to consumers through their gas stations throughout the US) and USA compression Partners LP (ET owns 48% of common stock shares). Their ownership/partnership of USA Compression Partners  (USAC), which services/repairs oil and natural gas lines as well as updates them with modern tech and pipes (and is regarded as one of the top in the nation) , is why I’m especially bullish on ET as it allows them to exploit a loophole when it comes to making new pipelines that I will explain further into this discussion. Due to ET owning 48% of USAC, that means for every $1 that ET spends on USAC to fix their equipment, ET gets back $0.48. It’s for this reason that USAC accounts for approximately 6% of yearly revenue and since being acquired, has been a break even or positive investment for ET every single year. Sunoco also contributes approximately 6% of ET’s yearly revenue and that is expected to increase as gas prices go up under a Dem controlled senate, house, and WH. 

      ET is also in the process of making two new acquisitions this year, and specifically, this quarter. First up is the completion and opening of their largest green/renewable energy project yet. A massive solar farm in west Texas that is expected to generate 28 MW at peak output (keep in mind 1 MW is enough to power 400-900 homes for a year). This farm was made with a partnership with Recurrent energy.  The second expected acquisition is Enable Midstream Partners, a large competitor in the gulf coast area. 

     Now for the more negative side of ET because I have to address the massive winter storm we just had and how it’s expected to effect ET. In short, if nothing changed at all this year after it was hit, ET would be looking at losing about 1/3 of yearly revenue according to their latest Earnings Report. However, according to their own management team in that same ER, if the solar farm in west Texas proceeds on schedule, opening in Q2 of this year, and if their scheduled acquisition of Enable Midstream Partners LLP, which happens to be Louisiana’s largest pipeline company and a large competitor in the gulf coast area, goes through as expected also in Q2 (the buy out is expected to be finalized between May 19th and July 1st) then the total fallout of the winter storm, including damages, lawsuits, and cost of modernization/upgrades is dramatically reduced to being only 1/4 of yearly *PROFITS* instead of pure revenue. This essentially makes it almost a non-existent problem when you look at it from the perspective of at least a year. And the best part is that since they said that in their ER, the stock price has already moved accordingly so now it’s basically on discount because people drove it down based on the short term news and not realizing that by the start of Q3, the damages will most likely already be paid off, allowing this stock to really take off. 

     Finally, before I get into some of the basically financial fundamentals of ET and tell y’all where I think it’s going, I want to go over what I think are some of the more common concerns one might have about ET. These aren’t mine personally as you’ll soon see but they are some of the most common concerns of people on message boards and some analyses as well.  

     The first problem I commonly see is that, due to Dems being in control, prices of oil and other natural gases will rise increasing the cost to produce them. While this is true, ET itself does not dig up or produce any gas or oil on its own, it is purely a midstream (or transportation and storage) energy company. This means that rather than buying the builder of the bridge, you are buying the company that tax’s people to use it.  As a result, rising prices in my opinion are actually a good thing for ET, since they don’t charge a flat rate to transport materials, rather a % of the cost of the materials. So as the cost of oil goes up, so to does ET’s transport prices. 

      The second common concern I see relates to the first one in that it’s also a result of Dems being in control. Typically under Dem administrations and congresses, new pipeline construction is pretty much put on a standstill cause they want to focus more on renewables and beefing up our green energy grid (something ET is also doing as previously discussed, they are close to 25% of all energy used being renewable). This means ET can’t build new pipelines and their growth plans are ruined right? Well not so fast because I still have to explain to you the biggest reason I’m buying ET, and that is their partnership/ownership of USAC. This simple company lets them exploit a loophole that none of the other pipeline companies are large enough to do. Instead of simply building new lines, they are able to buyout competitors that are older/need repairs at a discount, hire USAC to come in and replace all the pipes with brand new ones with the best technology, and since they are now owned by ET, those pipes have to be allowed to connect to ET’s main supply line, so it doesn’t have to worry about Dems blocking new pipelines since legally, it’s an old pipeline being refurbished and outfitted to connect to the main supply. I’m not sure how the connector isn’t counted as a new pipeline but I’ll just chalk that up to lobbying.  And since they own 48% of USAC, they get back 48% of their payment, reducing costs. So while their competitors are unable to go to new mines as they are discovered, ET is able to just buy the local infrastructure that’s moving the product from the source, fully upgrade it, and simply attach it to its network. It’s because of this strategy that they have a network of lines that goes from New York, to Montana, down to Texas, Arizona, and Florida. They also just purchased a line in the northwest so expect that to be connected through the Montana pipeline in the near future. 

      The final concern I see is their debt is huge. And while it is large, you have to remember it’s technically 13 (soon to be 14) companies all rolled into one. So it’s debt will seem a bit large for a single pipeline company, until you realize it’s 13 companies. Additionally as you’ll read in the financial fundamentals, they have a fairly average Debt/Equity ratio of only 2.83 and it’s competitors of similar size have D/E ratios in the range of 5-35.  The final point I’ll make on ET’s debt is that the vast majority is long term debt which it acquired from its buying of companies. They have also made it a point that after the Enable Midstream acquisition, they intend to begin paying off their debt in droves so that they can look towards another round of aggressive acquisitions like it recently underwent which added the debt in the first place. All in all, I’m not concerned about the debt in general as I believe they are more than capable of handling it.

   Now finally the financial and fundamental break down of ET; its current price is $7.85 has a dividend yield of 7.99% which translates to roughly $0.61 per share paid out over 4 quarters with payments in Feb, May, Aug, and Nov. it’s currently paying out 84% of its yearly profits as dividends and it has a safe rating for its dividend payments. Analysis have a 1 year target price range for ET between $7.50 and $16 with an average price target of $10.84 suggesting room for solid price appreciation. It’s D/E ratio is 2.82 and while this is above the 2.0 ratio that companies strive for, it’s still extremely manageable. 

   Over all I am going to be adding ET to my Roth IRA. It has a strong dividend that is relatively safe, is still expanding its business and is able to do so better than its competitors and it is updating with modern times to better incorporate renewable and green energy into its services. I am going to be buying ET until it tops $8.75 personally and going to just let it DRIP. I personally see it hitting a high of $12-$14 in the current Biden admin and potentially $16 should he or another Dem win in 2024. 
  
    I’m not a financial advisor, just a dude using Google who likes listening to earnings reports and can recognize when a stock is beaten down a bit too much because of current news but is likely to recover and even exceed where it was at previously.

Many of us (Coinbase account holders) know that coinbase model is a simple old brokerage model, 1,5% commission on the buy side and 1,5% commission on the sell side ( 1,5% charge on any trade that takes place) not to shabby I may add. They do facilitate trades for most of the institutions that involved with crypto ( Tesla bought 1,5bil worth of Bitcoin thru coinbase) .
I’ll be watching Coinbase for the first few days of trading , but it may cost me 10-15% of the upside momentum , but then again you never know.

I know I am going to get hate for this, but PLTR approaches clients in a very different way than other data companies. Palantir created Foundry and Gotham to be a ""low code,"" ""no code"" type of software that everyone at an organization can use. Normally, many data analytics platforms require a data scientists / expert to create models etc, where as PLTR took the approach that someone in the factory floor of airbus that has had no technical training in coding, etc, can easily create model and run ""what if"" scenarios. PLTR approached this with their so called ""forward deployed engineers."" These actual software engineers go to the front lines of the customers to understand the problems they are facing and to get feedback so that the product can be better developed so that people from all over an organization can understand the software and make it sense of their data.

I have used Power BI, Alteryx, Tableau, and have seen Foundry in action and learned about the function of foundry, and Foundry has looked the best / easiest to use IMO. Note that I am not technically trained tho. Just work at a large multinational company."

2021-04-04 06:27:16,stocks,"Why are there different gains for s&p 500 ETF’s ? hi, sorry if this is a stupid question, i’ve been trying to wrap my head around this and it doesn’t make any sense to me. so different ETF’s follow the s&p 500 and i don’t understand why there are different returns. i will use an aproximate example where you would invest 10000$. this is for the European market ETF :

1. VUSA - 10000 / 55 (price per share in Jan 2020) = 181.8 shares.
Today VUSA is at 65$, so that means a 10 increase. 
181.8*10 = 1811 profit for 2020

2. CSPX - 10000 / 322 (price per share in Jan 2020) = 31 shares.
Today CSPX is 405 so that means a 83 increase.
31*83 = 2573 profit for 2020

Unless i’m terrible at math, can someone explain why using the same money to invest, tracking the same fund, CSPX had more returns ?"
04/04/2021,stocks,"Vusa distributes dividend while cspx accumulates.
The money that comes out from vusa into your pocket is sitting idle while cspx accumulates and compounds."
04/04/2021,stocks,The answer lies must be based on vusa paying dividends out from the component companies while the other does not instead reinvests them. The website from each company will outline how distributions are handled.
04/04/2021,stocks,"Different weighting in positions most likely. Just ""tracking the S&P 500"" doesn't mean indexes have the same positioning. Check the entirety of the holdings. There's probably your answer."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Where did you get the $65 for vusa from? It is at 65€ at the moment. Thats $76.

A part of the performance difference comes from the dividends. Vusa payed $1.2 per share in dividends since jan 2020. Another part comes from dollar weakness, if you are looking at euro prices. The dollar decreased 7% in value against the euro since 2020."
04/04/2021,stocks,"One part of the difference are the dividends. Vusa payed 1.02€ = $1.2 per share since jan 2020.

Also, you are looking at euro prices for VUSA and dollar prices for CSPX. Vusa is at 65€ atm. Thats $76.

The dollar decreased 7% in value against the euro since jan 2020. This lowers the euro value of the etf."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Repost from earlier - apology for the laziness. 

Tracking error is a discrepancy between an index or other ‘trackable’ feature of the market that an ETF claims to ‘track’ (its underlying) differs from what the ETF itself holds to facilitate accurate correlation between its own holdings and its underlying.

This is all done by algorithmic system-based management tech nowadays.

My view is that the likelihood of a major difference between the make-up ETFs tracking the same underlying (let’s use the S&P 500, since you mentioned it) have on the spot price of a share in any of them is actually pretty limited. Some will be quicker than others to rebalance (and let’s remember how fast the weighted constituency of a vastly popular, influential and traded index as the S&P, will tweak a bit, move some, or shift a lot) - trying to catch a worm with your toes suddenly seems like a walk in the park, on occasion

ETFs, thought, are their own thing. When you buy or sell ‘an ETF’, you’re transaction is in shares in a collective pooled issuer, established exclusively to - in the case of those that track something - hold assets capable of facilitating that tracking.  And while accuracy of tracking is important .....

What’s more important is - as is always so in price discovery - how much buying versus how much selling is going on, in the market, at that time.

Shares in ETFs are shares. And their price reacts to pure Adam Smith supply and demand forces.

So if more people are buying Vangaurd 500 than are buying iShares 500 than HSBC 500, then Vanguard’s price will likely increase compared to the other two, because the market sees a V500 as worth more, due to the buying and selling taking place.

What’s inside the V500, as compared with the iShares 500, and the HSBC 500, may be as near identical as fathomable, given how the ETF balancing process operates.

But, where more of one kind than another is getting bought or sold, for whatever reason, their price will likely react based on that activity.

Hence, tracking error .... wouldn’t bother worrying about it, unless it’s so bad someone with clout has written something negative about it. Which, given the far more terrifying, confusing, weird behaviours we’re seeing in the market at the moment, I’d not lose sleep over"
04/04/2021,stocks,"I don’t think it could be just that. 2573-1811 = 762. On an investment of 10,000 dollars, a 762 dollar difference is a difference of 7.62%. The dividend isn’t that high."
04/04/2021,stocks,Also different number of stocks
04/04/2021,stocks,"Ok my bad, so my first calculation was in euros. that means still a return of  2.129  compared to  2573  for CSPX."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Sorry, I didn't mean to post the above comment. Tried to cancel it and submit the other comment. But reddit posted it anyway.

So, I'll break it down. If you take the VUSA closing price at the XETRA exchange and adjust it to dollar prices, it was at $61.25 on Jan 2nd 2020 and at $75.92 last thursday. You could have bought 163.3 shares of VUSA back then and netted a $2395 profit.

On top of that comes the dividends. In the 5 quarters since then VUSA issued 1.02€= $1.20 in dividends, that CSPX didn't. So you woud have netted an additional $195.96.

Your total return would have been $2591

Edit: The $18 difference of performance is probably just because of rounding errors and one simplification on my part. I converted the 5 quarterly dividends to USD with todays exchange rate. If I were to apply the Exchange rate on the day the dividends were issued, VUSA and CSPX probably would have netted the same return. I'm just too lazy to do that ;)"
04/04/2021,stocks,"ah ok i see, thanks for the detailed explanation. i was under the impression that CSPX used dividends to automatically reinvest into the fund, i didn't thought it's such a difference."
04/04/2021,stocks,It does. The reinvested dividends are just included in the share price.
04/04/2021,stocks,"aaaahh ok something clicked for me now. so because VUSA has distributing dividents, perhaps not everyone will reinvest them but with CSPX since it gets automatically reinvestes it adds to the share price. thanks for clearing this up"
2021-04-04 06:07:18,stocks,"Genuinely curious, why do REITs get shitted on? I'm a complete noob when it comes to stocks. I try to keep it simple and put 95% into Vanguard, with 5% in other things like CCL, STWD, and VNQ (vanguard's REIT).

To me REITs make so much sense once you set up dividend reinvestment and the the reinvestment purchases another full share. 

But I must be wrong somewhere because a lot of people poo poo them. 

What is it that I'm missing? I feel so dumb on this topic.

Thanks"
04/04/2021,stocks,"Look hard enough and you can find people shitting on any investment style or class of financial instruments.

REIT's have a place in any balanced and well diversified portfolio, especially dividend/income oriented ones.

Also plenty of REIT's go tits up from time to time if they don't manage risk well."

I personally love REITS as a part of a diverse portfolio and investment strategy. 

and a 7-10% dividend yield just feels great - if you are looking for extra income that is.  

as with any high yield investment, you have to actively manage those. and some are simply not willing to do this. its easier to dump your money into some ""surefire"" growth stuff, than looking at least every quarter if financials are ok and dividends are stable. 

and as was said by others as well: you probably lose money in the long run as REIT stock prices tend to stay flat or even decline. keep that in mind."

04/04/2021,stocks,"Most commonly lately is the fear that the pandemic will permanently change real estate uses.  Malls will go out of business due to home delivery.  Office towers will have problems filling their space due to more people working from home.

While that could cause some near term troubles, I think real estate in major centre's and suburbs will always hold value and can be repurposed.  Mixed use developments and redevelopments are on the rise.  Empty office tower, turn some floors into apartments, condos or hotel rooms.   Major retailer goes bust and anchor mall space becomes available, stick a condo tower on top and a grocer underneath and you'll resecure the value of the real estate as the mall becomes a hyperlocal option for the hundreds of new residents.

Short term, real estate may struggle, but long term, good real estate holds immense value as populations continue to grow."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Mortgage REITs aren't typical REITs, since they don't own property, so this is an aside.

MREITs buy mortgage-backed securities sold by issuers that buy mortgages from banks. Because these are mortgage-backed, the margin requirement is only 10%. So for $1 in investor money they can buy $10 in MBS.

An mREIT can make money two ways: from the interest paid on mortgages, times 10, or from the appreciation in the price of the MBS it holds. Investors see double-digit dividends, typically.

But, there's another big buyer of MBS: the Fed. The Fed buys MBS to inject cash into the economy. It sells MBS to tighten the money supply.  (mREITs almost never sell.)

Right now, the Fed's balance sheet is extraordinarily large because it doubled last year to put more money in public hands during the start of the pandemic shutdowns; and it had already been fairly large to prop up the economy for various other reasons.

As post-vaccination reopening gets closer to completion, everyone expects the Fed to start unwinding its holdings.

The excess supply of MBS hitting the market will drive the price down.  mREITs are, as I said, leveraged to 10X, so they feel a dime of price drop as a lost dollar of assets. A 10% decline in MBS prices zeroes-out shareholder equity.

Would you buy a stock with a 12% dividend? Most people would. But what if you knew that in 3-9 months you were going to get a 20-40% haircut, with a significant probability of ruination?"
04/04/2021,stocks,One issue I have with reits is that they are typically taxed at regular income. The few reits I have are in tax deferred accounts.

04/04/2021,stocks,Also worth being an portfolio as they generally hedge against inflation better than other stocks and shares
04/04/2021,stocks,"In my country taxation for REITS is hell, so I’m out. I would rather buy an apartment some day and rent it out but at current prices I’m not in a hurry. I’m also not dependent on low interest rates for leverage which is an argument for others."
04/04/2021,stocks,"So, I can't speak for everyone who shits on REITs. I'd imagine most people aren't educated on them at all and just have feelings about them, much like most of the comments here. ""They've had x returns in the past"" where if x is positive, they have good feelings about them, and if x is negative, they have bad feelings about them. That kind of thing. Some people also don't understand dividends, and their tax implications, and their impact on the prices of their securities. This also leads to feelings based approaches.

The actual reason why any intelligent person would oppose including REITs in their portfolio is because they don't provide any diversification benefit that can't be achieved with other assets (stocks and bonds) with less risk. This is demonstrated in Peter Mladina's paper *Real Estate Betas and the Implications for Asset Allocation* which uses a modified version of the Fama French 5 factor model to examine the risk and return of REITs. In summary, it found that the factor exposure of REITs matched that of a portfolio containing roughly 60% small cap value stocks and 40% high yield bonds.

So despite what other comments have told you, REITs are not a good part of a well diversified portfolio. Any return benefit they provide can be explained through stock and bond factors, while the risk of real estate is primarily driven by the idiosyncratic risk of the real estate sector. This is not a priced risk (a risk which you'd expect a positive return from taking).

---

tldr: I can't speak for why everyone doesn't like REITs. But, smart people do not like REITs because REITs do not provide better risk adjusted returns to any portfolio that could instead be constructed with stocks and bonds (specifically small cap value stocks and high yield bonds)."
04/04/2021,stocks,"You’re not necessarily investing in real assets, it feels more like an oil company paying dividends instead of owning a share in properties. The tax agencies prohibit flipping properties for capital gains because they’ll tax you at 100% of the capital gain, which is why REITs only focus on rental income. I think it’s a bullshit business model and ripe for failure when people can’t afford rising rental costs similar to rate adjustments during the housing crash in 2008.

Edit: I’ve considered construction companies that build homes because the tax agencies tax those gains as business income rather than capital gains. If you want access to real assets, try these real estate development companies."
04/04/2021,stocks,"The best reason to avoid them that no one is mentioning is, academic work has shown you can already capture the returns of REITs with small cap value and high yield bonds, but without the idiosyncratic risk of the real estate market.

Also, if you own a diversified stock portfolio you already have significant exposure to REITs.

If the rate curve shifted up too much, government defects would balloon.

It's been 20 years since they booked a surplus and payed down any debt, back then the debt was ""only"" $6T, it's now projected to finish the year over $28T.

04/04/2021,stocks,"It’s the government bond rates though, not the Fed rate. If government bond rates rise, that pushes out the rates on the risk curve. 

The pandemic recession isn’t the same as the GFC; it’s not a liquidity/credit crunch. In fact, thanks to the banking rules put in place post GFC, there hasn’t been a debt crunch or a rush to sell distressed assets. 

But banks will perceive more risk in property loans — no one is sure how the office sector will play out — and that means commercial loan rates will rise"

The companies reported Saturday that among 72 evaluable patients, none of the 47 who took molnupiravir tested positive for infectious virus five days after treatment. Meanwhile, six of the 25 patients in the placebo group had positive viral cultures.

This last series by AMD really has pushed them into a 1-2 punch of top end CPU and GPU combos that can compete on both ends. They are still a bit behind at the ultra top end with server technology and production processes so Nvidia is on lock but with how the market is for GPUs and crypto they will sell regardless. I could see AMD push the boundaries versus Nvidia with server based gaming and other areas with their amazing momentum. I bought at 78 but anything below 100 is an amazing price."

I was extremely fucking bullish then, and have only remained as such now. 

They execute their roadmaps flawlessly, maintain product portfolio diversity and scalability, company and team structure is rock solid and lead by experts in underlying fields, they possess numerous probable untapped markets through their full-stock acquisition of Xilinx and tech, maintain monster momentum in revenue and market share gains through industry-shaking partnership deals, have successful leapfrogging RnD teams for unmatched product performance gains annually, partner with fabrication leader TSMC for astounding chip yields and performance for most of its portfolio, etc......

Yes, we believe it will go into 3-digits but the stock market is in a weird state right now. We sold the most of shares at $89 so we can invest in more lower price stock with potential growth.

04/04/2021,stocks,"Not sure about this year. Their tech is great, so long term, yes. Once they can figure out how to not be sold out of everything constantly. But that won't happen during the semiconductor shortage."
04/04/2021,stocks,Whatt I would like to know is when this chip shortage is going to start affecting the prices of semiconductor and chip stocks?. Has anyone been able to get their hands on a gpu? CPU shortages are also rampant.  Sooner or later the constrained supply chain is going to affect the price negatively. I am long-term bullish on AMD but right now the supply chain on anything going through Taiwan is way too risky for me.
04/04/2021,stocks,"There are a few negative things about AMD that are worth mentioning when thinking about stocks.

* They don't pay dividends. With that, the P/E ratio isn't that small.
* They have supply issues. No matter how good their stuff is, they can't reap the benefits because of limited supply
* The desktop PC market isn't that big, and laptop manufacturers barely have any offerings with AMD. Businesses still buy mostly Intel stuff
* Apple's M1 is awesome, further developments might pose a serious challenge for all x86.
* Once the pandemic is over, the used electronics market could overfill with cheap alternatives to new and expensive hardware, which could endanger future sales.

I'd just like to urge caution. I think it will rise, but it will do so slowly, with a lot of red days, and I'm not certain that it will reach 100$ this year.

AMD at this price is for long positions. If it falls again to 75$ then it's probably worth getting some.

One other thing is that they should report revenues soon. I expect it to go up significantly compared to last quarter, so I'm hoping that the stock price will go up as well."

AMD will inevitably miss a trick due to this as when INTC does deliver then their Marketing dept will power the stock forward at the expense of AMD. Put simply, if AMD can't beat INTC when INTC is down in the gutter then what chance do AMD have in the long run?"
04/04/2021,stocks,I’ve liked AMD for a while but with INTC making such a big investment into chips I really don’t know how well it will do long term. INTC has been behind on chips for years however.

04/04/2021,stocks,"They will be selling whatever they can make for years to come, and there is nothing the competition has on their roadmaps that could pose a threat to them for at least the next couple of years when they are pretty much guaranteed to continue growing. It's probably my personal favorite stock next to TSMC."
04/04/2021,stocks,"It’s insane to me that Intel’s market cap is still about 2.5x AMDs. 

AMD CPUs are currently slightly better than intel’s (better fab process, slightly worse IPC). The IPC (instructions per cycle) gap is being bridged, and AMD’s “chiplet” architecture should in theory lead to better yields and higher margins on the leading edge manufacturing node.

They also should become highly competitive with nvidia in the GPU space next generation with a DLSS equivalent (AMD already has superior rasterization performance).

In my opinion, the reasons intel sits at a much higher market cap, aside from immediate financials are:

1. Friction in the cloud market for CPUs in moving from Intel to AMD
2. Risk that intel regains a fab advantage, possibly through government investment

My investment hypothesis is that based on future earnings, Intel and AMD’s market caps should at worst coverage, and at best AMD will surpass Intel. If I was portfolio margined, I would have an equal cash position long AMD and short INTC. Because I’m regularly margined, I am long AMD calls and short INTC call spreads for equal notional value about 6 months out, AMD have been rolling that position for about 2 years."

Without looking at share prices or history of share prices what would you pay for no dividend info and 5 dollars worth of Buisness? Not financial advice just a way of looking at it"
04/04/2021,stocks,They doubled over the last year. Intel is superior in cooling which is to me the biggest plus. AMD can run hotter but is cheaper. Companies and people will more often buy a quality cheaper product (of course not always). So AMD is the best bet IMO
04/04/2021,stocks,You misspelled A M C lmfao 🤣
04/04/2021,stocks,"I’d switch over to INTC now

Intel announcement that they’re building plants and getting into the foundry business is a BFD

Building chips in the US is going to be a security requirement for some sectors, INTC is finally onto a winning strategy"
04/04/2021,stocks,Bullish on AMD long term. It’s a buy above $82 and below that it’s someone else’s problem. I’d initiate a position here but with a tight stop simply bc the QQQs are looking like they could turn back to the downside by mid April for another pullback towards 290. Nothing big but still cause for concern in the short term. Buy AMD smart and I’m sure you’ll be happy a few months from now
04/04/2021,stocks,I’m lucky to have gotten in at the bottom these past few weeks
04/04/2021,stocks,BIG numbers!
04/04/2021,stocks,I think they are still a buy.  I bought some last year during the covid crash and again when they recently dipped below $80.  My guess would be it hits around $100 end of this year unless some catastrophic event occurs.  They have been crushing earnings lately and I have a feeling they will do the same in a few weeks.
04/04/2021,stocks,"Depends on if this is a short or long term play. Short term? Sure - you might get a bounce. Long term, I would bet on whoever has the best fabs, or the most government support."
04/04/2021,stocks,"An important consideration is ARM and the massive buy in with them by AWS and cloud scale computing in general. Still a buy though, their price is about right right atm"
04/04/2021,stocks,Ive held both intel and amd in the past and amd is the only one that got me returns
04/04/2021,stocks,"I remember being 19 and getting into computers in 2015. Everyone was telling me AMD was going to be huge, once they released competitive CPUs and GPUs, they were just the temporary underdog. Stock back then was just $3 a share. I ended up building my first PC in 2016 with no AMD components, but when the mining gold rush of 2017 happened I built another system using the R5 1600, and by then their stock had already quadrupled. As the years went by I bought a couple more graphics cards for mining, and their stock slowly they crept up to $20, $50, then a whopping $90 this year.

I'm not gonna lie, I didn't have much interest in stocks until the whole GME thing happened, but once I opened my own trading account in February I bought into a bunch of different stocks, including 3 shares of AMD. Think I might have gotten it near the peak at $94, but you know what? I have trust in them. This past year must have been EXCELLENT in terms of sales, since they finally compete on both the CPU and GPU market, plus the new consoles use AMD components as well, and ALL of these products sell out in literal seconds. I expect AMD will continue to rule the desktop CPU space, but there's a ton of room to gain on the laptop and server space as well. I'm also optimistic they will continue to gain market share on the GPU side, as they now have proven able to compete with Nvidia's best, so long as ray-tracing is not enabled, but I also think this gap will lessen as they iterate on their hardware.

My only concern is that Nvidia's experience with deep learning gives them a huge edge and AMD will revert to the GPU underdog, not just in gaming but also workspace, streaming etc. In general though I expect both of these companies to be very solid investments right now."
04/04/2021,stocks,Yes! Buy! Save my April calls!!
04/04/2021,stocks,"You can look more into palantir, Facebook, coinbase as short term."
04/04/2021,stocks,may 80c checking in
04/04/2021,stocks,"I'm very long on AMD. I have always been an Intel guy and for a long time they were clearly the better chip, same with Nvidia on the GPU side. AMD was always kind of a step or 10 behind. Now I can confidently say that my next PC build will without a doubt have an AMD CPU and GPU. It is actually incredible what this company has been able to achieve.

On top of just being innovative in the industry and competing with the two biggest names in their industry they have some great leadership. Lisa Su is a visionary and I don't think the company would be where it's at today without her.

There are some issues in the GPU supply chain atm but the story is the same for Nvidia and not a unique issue for AMD, so although this poses some challenges in the short term I don't see it becoming a huge issue long term. Additionally, unless I've missed something, Apple still uses AMD for their graphics, but like with Intel on the CPU side, they could lose this source of revenue soon. It just depends on how successful Apple is at cutting out the 3rd party processors and replacing them.

The only issue I see as unique for AMD is that they still lag behind on some of the lower end chips. As high as the tech world is on AMDs new GPU and the higher end Ryzen CPUs, most PC builders don't have a 5-10k budget. For now, Intel still gets you better performance for your dollar on the CPU side but the margin is closing. Nvidia still also has a clear edge on the lower-mid range GPUS.

All said though, AMD is here to stay and is going to be making noise in their industry for a long time. I don't expect to ever sell my shares honestly."
04/04/2021,stocks,AMD is 10000% a buy
04/04/2021,stocks,Never trade earnings
04/04/2021,stocks,"Look at their server market share, then actually look at their server lineup, projections and compare it with their only competitor. AMD is a sleeping giant. Even when Amazon, and whomever else build their own chip, it won't be as good as the EPYC lineup, which is great for most purposes.

Disclaimer: I have hold AMD stock for years, and currently hold calls & stocks."
04/04/2021,stocks,Buy SMD
04/04/2021,stocks,"Compared to what really?  On it's own, AMD is doing well.  But when you are weighing numbers, do you want to compare competitors or the market in general?  

Wouldn't a better question be AMD, INTC or NVDA?  At least at that point you're considering options that are in the same league."
04/04/2021,stocks,It was strong buy from end of 2020 to beginning  of 2021. It was so cheap. Its still cheap when you compare to their value. They make better shit than Intel and they're the 2nd following right behind Nvidia imo.
04/04/2021,stocks,AMD and [TSM](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/taiwan-chip-maker-tsmc-invest-100b-grow-capacity-76806792) (they make AMD's chips) are both big buys and have a mutual effect on each other.
04/04/2021,stocks,I think they’re going to have supply chain and delivery issues for years
04/04/2021,stocks,"I'm buying this stock for one reason only they are going to merge , buy out XLNX  this is a game changer last I checked it was 140.00 a share the price they offered ."
04/04/2021,stocks,"i’d say a buy but it is up about 300 percent over 2 years so i wouldn’t expect big moves. i bought for 90 a year ago and sold for the same after a drop amd long wait to come back up.

it might get to 100-110 in the next 3-9 months but i won’t put l ml obey into it again."
04/04/2021,stocks,"So I own AMD and they make their chips, who else to make chips for? Or what else do they do? I guess it’s time for some DD"
04/04/2021,stocks,"I did some DD on them months ago. It was a buy then, it's def a buy now"
04/04/2021,stocks,Agreed
04/04/2021,stocks,I am not sure how they will solve chip shortage issue. Until that is solved. I am skeptical about AMD.
04/04/2021,stocks,"AMD is a very good buy impo. 

as is intel.   
If I had money lying around and looking for ways to get into this,   
I would go   
AMD  
INTEL  
NVIDIA  
TSM

never only one of those. 

also I read several posts in this thread about AMD attacking the sever market and while it cannot argued that the market share of AMD can only grow there, its also worth keeping note on the largest hyperscalers and major cloud providers desperatly looking for ways to become more independent from major chip designers. 

MSFT, GOOGL and AMZN all are on the way to build / design their own server CPU´s as well. 

AAPL is already transitioning to ARM chips. 

So yeah.Just my 2 cents on this"
04/04/2021,stocks,It is going to trade around 80 until the merger. Then we'll see...
04/04/2021,stocks,"What should I vote my shares for this merger, I see this good long term but idk I still have to read this fucking 60 page book they sent. This is probably a buy to 120$ next year but doubt it'll be much moving till the 8th when they have that web cast"
04/04/2021,stocks,"Funny how no one here would buy amd when I posted about it here some years back when it was in the 10-20$ range. Sure it will properly go up a bit more, but the big gains is gone. I have moved all my money from amd stock to xers stock. Buy now at 4.5$ and sell in a few years for 20-30$ do some dd on the stock and you will see why. Here is a little to get you started https://www.fortunealerts.com/post/xerispharma

It's my new tndm."
04/04/2021,stocks,Yields are going to keep pushing this down imo.
04/04/2021,stocks,"Long term, yes, most definitely. 

Short term, I am not sure. They might even go down after earnings depending on the report. I think there is some volatility until the chip storage can get resolved, which I believe it will eventually. Of course, the inherent risk may prevent others from jumping in as well, so that's my food for thought."
04/04/2021,stocks,Remember AMD was like 10-20$ and everyone was going nuts over it. It was a buy back then. 80$.... hmmm
04/04/2021,stocks,Id say its a buy but somehow im still waiting for it to drop below $70

04/04/2021,stocks,Expect it to do what UPST did. I think having growth companies in portfolios are what traders are seeking long term.
04/04/2021,stocks,Well they're making much better GPUs now and in the last few years have pulled infront of intel in the cpu marketplace so Im still buying and holding.
04/04/2021,stocks,Call call call
04/04/2021,stocks,AMD vs Nvda?
04/04/2021,stocks,I’m just upset I sold it at 35 a few years ago
04/04/2021,stocks,TSM or NVDA are a better play.
04/04/2021,stocks,"There are bunch of chip companies, why just focus on AMD, NVDA, INTC, TSM.

ADI, AMAT, ASML, ATEYY, AVGO, KLAC, LRCX, LSCC, MPWR, MU, NXPI, POWI, QCOM, QRVO, SIMO, SWKS, TER.

There's also some small ones: Pixelworks, Himax.

There's also the design part: CDNS, SNPS."
04/04/2021,stocks,I just like the stock.
04/04/2021,stocks,"Are looking for a trade or an investment? I don’t see this as an investment because they do not pay dividends. Maybe they will in the future but honestly dividends are seen as a liability by companies. Right now the price is good for a trade and if you think it’s going to go into the triple digits then AMD is a great long term trade. But hey what do I know, I’m not a financial advisor"
04/04/2021,stocks,"I have had some decent luck with amd options. I don’t have enough capital to get as many shares as I would like to, so I have been toying with e idea of opening a long position. I think they are a great company, their stock price always stresses me out. But I think long term it would be a good investment."
04/04/2021,stocks,Stock dips I buy. I’m not planning on selling for 5-10 years. I think they are going to really dominate both consumer and enterprise in about 3-5 years.
04/04/2021,stocks,"It is on a super strong uptrend right now but i think it is going to have a nice little dip before it climbs more, given how overbought we ended on Thursday. I've been watching it for the past 2 weeks. I like it alot. Just be careful not to buy at the top."

04/04/2021,stocks,I think I'm crying. It's that appealing.
04/04/2021,stocks,I 100% AMD is a buy...though short-term it might move sideways.
04/04/2021,stocks,"If you want to see if AMD is a good buy, check out what Intel is doing.  
If the answer is ""catching up"", ""struggling"", ""recycling 14nm"", then AMD is a buy."
04/04/2021,stocks,"It looks like it would do well but few things to remember. 
Scalper prices dont really reflect on stock (a lot of people are saying I bought a gpu at x price and now its 2.5x)
AMD was also marked as volatile or sus when GME went berserk. It got trade blocked in few brockers.

And last but least, dont expect AMD to do well cause its competitor Nvdia is doing amazing. Nvidia does more than GPU in terms of AI integration. So AMD is in a weird spot imo."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Asml not a better idea? Because they make almost all the machines the chips are produced on, for basically every manufacturer. Haven’t done any DD so maybe it’s already in the price of asml."
04/04/2021,stocks,I've been in AMD since it was $9. I just bought more at $75 if that tells you anything.
04/04/2021,stocks,"Will amd go up or down next 6 months idk, depends on chip shortage and economy. Will amd go up or down in next 2 years, depends on the economy if economy is still bull run amd will go up with it if its bear amd will go down with the entire market consolidation. Will amd go up or down in 8 years, im pretty damn sure it will go up. All that to is to say i believe in AMD and over time theyre brand recognition goes up with gamers (who can be stubborn af)"

04/04/2021,stocks,"Usually once Cramer strongly recommends a stock it drops about 15% immediately. That’s happened with AMD so probably yes. Disclaimer: I decided not to buy AMD at $2 due to credit risk, and then they did a follow on offering, delevered and ripped to $90. Oops"
04/04/2021,stocks,Nvidia > AMD.
04/04/2021,stocks,Its a sell.
04/04/2021,stocks,"I think AMD is overvalued. Or put another way, a lot of growth is already priced in.  INTC is a better value IMO. Intel keeps pumping out record revenue, and demand is so high across the board AMDs rise really isn’t hurting Intel.   

Intel is a PE of 13 and PS of 3.5 compared to AMD at 38 and 9.7. If the market comes back to reality I’d feel much more comfortable with the Intel bag."
04/04/2021,stocks,Of course it is a BUY.... are you daft man?
04/04/2021,stocks,I'm buying leaps asap
04/04/2021,stocks,"AMD and NVDA are the market leaders of their industry, semi-conductors. Buy market leaders. Intel is the ‘flavor of the month,’ but they suck, and AMD and NVDA will eat their lunch again for the rest of the year just like they have for years. 

Same goes for the entire market. Don’t get shook and try to buy CAT, URI, INTC, or any of the fucking banks that crypto will make obsolete in 5 years.

So I’ll settle for a good beer called AMD for now.…Not advice, just my opinion . As we know Tech is on its way quickly, abruptly, and One never knows, you may want to catch it before it surpasses Nvidia? You never know… Good luck my friend🦧"
04/04/2021,stocks,It’s kind of like would you rather have one Mercedes or 4-5 Cadillacs? Would you have one Nvidia share or five shares of EMD? Or would you rather have THREEE shares of AMD and THREE shares of ASX. Being that AMD end yeah sex are comparable in price. Well it’s only $7.97 a share if I’m looking correctly. Therefore you could have Around 75 shares of a ASX or three shares of AMD and 30ish of ASX..🤔

04/04/2021,stocks,"The Short interest is not enough for a huge run up.  However it is a very solid bet long term.  The chip shortage is real and will also benefit from the Push for electric vehicles.

WKHS has a large short interest and with Biden's electric vehicle push, plus a decent chance that the Postal Contract may sing back to their favor, makes it a very good bet.  INO is another over shorted stock, with large potential.   both are fairly solid bets, for a longer term hold."
04/04/2021,stocks,">For the chip/retail side of AMD its a madhouse I mean you can't even get graphics cards or high end AMD cpus right now, sell out quickly, you need bot alerts. This has a variety of reasons, the chip shortage/materials is the main thing

This is due to more than just them being great, like you said.
GPU wise, they have quotas to meet for the PS5 and Xbox whatever. This is where their main GPU stock is going. The GPU market is already seeing an insane shortage due to unforseen demand and market forces. 

CPU stock is to consumers (mostly). They have been slowly recovering and supplying the market better as of recent. 
There is still a debate between AMD v. Intel in much of the computer worlds and doe hards in both. Many older intel users got burned by AMD's driver and mobo issues a long time ago. 

It's their GPU's tht are currently the most desirable. Whenever stock opens back up AMD's earnings will sky rocket.

Edit: I am not arguing against AMD. They are truly the better one in the computer worlds right now. I'm just pointing out items that as investors you don't necessarily see. I just built my PC in 2020 and went AMD because they were better and cheaper. I like them alot and am bullish."
04/04/2021,stocks,"chip shortage predicted to end mid 2022 - early 2023 can’t see them bringing out many major products before that time it wouldn’t make sense for them, there’s a lot of new tech going into chip making atm they’ll come out with something pretty innovative in about 3-4 years and so now is the time to buy"
04/04/2021,stocks,"The shortage isn't because it's an AMD, it's because of the demand for graphic cards and high end CPUs regardless of manufacturers.

04/04/2021,stocks,IMO the biggest issue with AMD is the fact they have so much growth already priced in. Even if they do take over significant market share and have a superior product they could end up trading sideways for a while. For the past year I’ve watched the stock rise consistently and nothing has really changed. Sure there is solid growth but they have to maintain that growth for a significant amount of time to support their P/B and P/E ratio which is high even compared to most peers. Obviously no one knows for sure what will happen but personally AMD seems like it might be overvalued even in this market. Just my personal opinion and I know it’s not really a popular one.
04/04/2021,stocks,"Last I checked AMD has 7.1% of the server market.  (From two months ago.)

So there is Intel has 92% atm.  AMD has a lot of room to grow in the coming years.

AMD's forward p/e ratio right now is 39.84 (source: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD/key-statistics/) so as people have mentioned, AMD is priced in.  40 isn't reckless (\*cough\* TSLA) but AMD is going to have to sell a lot of server CPUs in the coming years to make up for that 40.  I do believe they can and they will, but it is a slow growth sort of change, taking years for companies to rotate out old servers."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Intel, their primary competitor, has been lagging behind too for the past few years. Their upcoming GPU's *could* make them more appealing, but their CPU's for the past few years have always been a PoS put together to stay relevant."
04/04/2021,stocks,AMD next gen is multi chiplet gpu. Which is pretty much same design for Ryzen. Every year they surprise me with how much they improve and innovate. I have been buying selling AMD since zen 2. Around $80 is a good deal IMO.
04/04/2021,stocks,"Another thing to consider is that Nvidia at this point pretty much owns the market for gpu machine learning applications.

If AMD gets their shit together regarding tensorflow/pytorch support it would be massive."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Custom ARM server chips are starting to be flat out better than anything AMD or Intel offers, due to an architecture advantage that x86 cannot overcome. The major players all have or are building their own (Google, Amazon, Microsoft). I personally would be very careful with long term projections on the server CPU side, especially if Nvidia manages to buy ARM. Nobody knows what's going to happen but the trend is strongly pointed towards ARM chips taking over."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Yes it is true AMD is superior is chip maker and has a great upside. They also have great GPU’s which are a potential for a AMD gpu/cpu pairing. The thing is, price wise, Intel tends to cost less. Their new 11th is relatively cheap and, while yes AMD has better performance, many prefer 11th gen as it gets the job done. AMD has growth priced in. The main issues are laptops, if they can get a larger percentage of that, and start making their own chips I can see them easily taking over Intel."

Even if AMD was producing game changing processors across the board, it doesn’t matter if they can’t produce enough to gain market share.

04/04/2021,stocks,"Yes, it’ll go up because Intel isn’t producing CPUs, they’re producing little pieces of shit. 

Intel hasnt made a real CPU in about 4 years, and they wont have the ability to compete with anything other than shit for at least another 2 years.  

So AMD may have a few concerns, but their competition is in the middle of imploding with absolutely no viable technology im the pipe to compete against AMD.

AMDs only current CPU level competition is
coming from Apple, which runs on a different OS which has few users, where people are unable to migrate due to software compatibility issues. 

So in summary, Intel is a burning pile of poop and will be selling poop for the foreseeable future.  If you believe anything else, then you sont know and you’re falling for marketing gimmicks. 

AMD supply side isnt that constrained with respect to production from TSMC due to the lead time required. AMD booked their expansion fan space at TSMC 2-3 years in advance, so any supply issues they have are for sales & production that they didn’t guide for (above expected prodduction).  sonthis shouldnt be a concern unless the  Pandemic runs for another year.

Its likely that AMD will be sitting at $130 by this summer. Id they were hyped like nVidia is (for no reason) then AMD would be closer to $160 right now.  Which means that nVidia is over-valued by the same percent."

Debatable. You're framing it incorrectly. It's not that it will take a while to replace old servers, it's that the efficiency of the new chips has to be worthwhile of an upgrade. If the data centres can double efficiency at same power levels, or same efficiency and half power levels, for example, than the energy savings could make such a move worthwhile. I don't know what the magic number is, but don't forget the biggest cost is energy in a data centre. We already know AMDs EPYC lineup is more efficiency than comparable Intel chips, but I haven't looked dee enough to see if that difference is worthwhile upgrade yet, or how far we are from achieving that."

Quite the opposite. It is mostly a question of timelines I think, and if Intel has to ""give in"" and outsource until they're fully online.

I know, it was tongue in cheek (and a slight jab at AMD's dependence on TSM's fab slots currently).

Same thing with CPU’s. Intel makes their own chips, they dont have the stock issues AMD has (though they currently have stock issues of their own).

AMD processors are currently better than Intel’s, but I’ve seen a lot of people build with Intel because they can’t get a AMD.

For the larger companies like MSFT and AMZN they are just going to stop building the older hardware and move to a new design. The new hardware is more dense and more of it is added which boosts the newer hardware numbers, but the older hardware is still in use for the full cycle. It makes no sense to upgrade servers if you have more than 1000 of them (especially the CPU).

Now for the smaller businesses, I completely agree that the smart ones will upgrade early (maybe not right away but I'd personally cut the lifecycle down to upgrade to a new CPU). I don't have the latest data on if the big cloud guys have more servers than the rest of the market, but I'm sure they will be the largest adopters of the newest hardware when they build new machines.

Edit: don't know how I missed mentioning this, but the big wigs all use Intel motherboards for the vast majority of their servers prior to EPYC being released. It's not cost efficient to replace a CPU, motherboard, and any other part (and it breaks scaling efforts too). So AMD really is selling CPUs to new designs anyway."
04/04/2021,stocks,"They were clearly undervalued at that price point, even when you factor in that they're going to lose market share to AMD and others."
04/04/2021,stocks,At current prices Intel is of more value than AMD. I am AMD long but just saying.
04/04/2021,stocks,"INTC is a dividend stock priced at 13 P/E while other semis like AMD, TSM, MU are between 30-40 P/E and NVDA is 80 P/E. It doesn't matter much that Intel isn't blowing anyone away in the product marketplace right now. Market sentiment expects that to change in the 2020s so buyers are getting in on divvies at a very low PE for its sector."
04/04/2021,stocks,Really depends on how Alder/Meteor lake pan out at the 7nm level.
04/04/2021,stocks,Aren't they releasing their own GPU?
04/04/2021,stocks,Intel announced IDM 2.0 within the past few weeks which could be a game changer after about 2-3 years of investment.
04/04/2021,stocks,"But is this because they're the *only* GPU's we can buy, or because they're a good product? I would attribute a good portion of sales to the shortage, not because they offer legitimately good products. There's no one else to buy a legitimately good, affordable GPU right now. Their sales may be up now but i would take that with a basketball sized grain of salt because of the shortage. There's no one else to buy a moderately good CPU or GPU from at the moment.

To add to this, Intel has been overexaggertating the performance of their products recently. 

But then again, i dont know anything. FUD, diamond hands, obligatory to the moon"
04/04/2021,stocks,Everyone knows only gpus and cpus smh.
04/04/2021,stocks,Buy Xilinx then to get AMD at a discount?
04/04/2021,stocks,[deleted]
04/04/2021,stocks,"Yes, but the way he wrote it seemed to imply that both were taking place 4/7. The meeting 4/7 is for acquisition vote for Xilinx."
04/04/2021,stocks,That's my plan! Lol
04/04/2021,stocks,This is a really strange assumption to make about a person. Tons and tons of people use work/savings/loans/scholarships to put themselves through school.

04/04/2021,stocks,"If you look at p/e you might think the opposite tho...I'm holding Intel but will probably end up buying amd at some point too, im just cautious with their valuation atm"
04/04/2021,stocks,I'm scratching my head as to why AMD wouldn't also benefit from an American-centric market sentiment when they're headquartered in the same exact city as Intel lol
04/04/2021,stocks,Can you elaborate on why you think so based on the market cap of the companies?
04/04/2021,stocks,"Funny thing is that a few billion USD is barely enough to sway the decision. Even without subsidies, I think the last few years have exposed the risks of producing in one country and exporting to another when tariffs can be levied on short notice.

I would expect that there is just enough capacity in the US for critical infrastructure and security sensitive customers while the bulk continues to be made in the cheapest countries, which will generally not be the US."
04/04/2021,stocks,Why are you selling covered calls at the (relative) bottom?
04/04/2021,stocks,"Not really. The 3060 Ti is the same MSRP as the 3060. The difference between something like a 3080 FE vs. an AIB GPU is marginal, and the FE still gives you the best bang for your buck.

If you're not talking about MSRP and are considering buying from scalpers, then $110 won't even get you closer to shit that came out in 2016.

The only case I can say $110 will help is if you take what you'd spend on a 3060 Ti and get a 3070, but I'd rather get a 5600x than get Rocket Lake wish I had waited for 12th gen."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Sadly no, that's the price target after the most recent update (10/28/2020). Prior to that it was in the single digits ($9)."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Well, yeah, he did update it 2 months ago. **To $17.**

04/04/2021,stocks,Which do you use?
04/04/2021,stocks,"A few of the analysts out there do make good money to make impartial evaluations, by Citigroup, in this particular case. And some are still utterly clueless. Like their dad got them the job and that's the only explanation I could come up with."
04/04/2021,stocks,I doubt they need it. Intel does though
04/04/2021,stocks,Excellent points
04/04/2021,stocks,"I've yet to see any real news (as opposed to rumors) about WHAT Intel plans to outsource to TSM and I'm willing to bet it's just going to be GPUs for Aurora this year, since Aurora has been repeatedly delayed and they don't need any more.

Intel is a paper tiger until at least 2023. Ice Lake will NOT make them competitive in server or desktop CPUs."
04/04/2021,stocks,Hasn't the new intel ceo already announced temporary outsourcing to tsmc?
04/04/2021,stocks,"If you knew Intel, then you'd know that my position isn't emotional, its reflective of their conduct as a company.   


There is no advice on Reddit, only opinions. If you think you're giving advice, then you're the danger.  Intel isn't doing anything new or competitive. Every move and announcement they make shows that they have a collapsing house of cards. If you can't see that, then you're missing a bit of info. 

&#x200B;

Also, if you think that what I wrote will prompt someone to spend $$ as opposed to looking into it, then they're the ones that are yolo'ing."
04/04/2021,stocks,"I'm not a fan of buying companies that are doing everything wrong with the hopes they might turn it around. If they fix their missteps, typically there is a chance to get back in before the improvements manifest in earnings, 2 quarters or more."
04/04/2021,stocks,"I agree with that statement. The problem is that it will not continue exactly as it is right now. INTC's financials are great for today but their gross margins have already begun to collapse in their core markets in a bid to slow erosion in their market share, *especially* server, which is their cash cow.

It may be in 2-3 years they can introduce some differentiated products, and perhaps today's price is fair. But the trajectory is terrible right now and they were saved only by their robust manufacturing capacity during the silicon boom of the last year when TSMC is all booked up. When capacity catches up to demand sometime in the next year, it could get *very* ugly for Intel as they have to compete on price across the board after losing the technical edge."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Intel is not falling behind on earnings either .  They gain 2 billion more than AMD last year despite AMD 50% annual revenue growth and Intel is 21.5 times more profitable.  AMD is growing way faster but that is not enough to justify their market cap  if you gonna use Intel as comparison, Intel is way undervalued.

Having said that, Intel made a mistake when they hired Swan who does not have a technical pedigree to make a critical decision so their chip flopped.  Now they actually have a self made guy who work for Intel over 3 decades and have a successful tenure as VMWare CEO to be that shot caller.  Intel PE is 13 which way less than AMD of 39.  I don’t expect AMD revenue to grow 50% but will definitely continue to grow.  Intel just invested over 20 billion and I can bet they got the government blessing to take that risk."
04/04/2021,stocks,"TSMC has only reported that this problem hasn't affected them yet. They saw it coming and planned for it. 

Water can't be all that critical if TSMC's new 12 Billion fab is going to be in Arizona. So trucking water in seems to be quite sustainable."
04/04/2021,stocks,Is this dude trolling? $AMD will still be around in 10-15 years. It will for sure be above 100. Meanwhile these $AMC shares could be actual $0. Lol long term $AMD is a buy.
04/04/2021,stocks,"I do know that there are specialty manufacturers that make passively cooled industrial controllers and the like with both AMD and Intel chips, but they are expensive. 

If we're talking PPW though AMD is far ahead currently. Their only even arguable area of weakness is somewhat higher idle draw due to Infinity Fabric, but that's not an issue in power limited environments either (their desktop and mobile APUs are both monolithic)."

04/04/2021,stocks,I'm not making a stock case I'm just explaining the PC market bc I build gaming PCs.
04/04/2021,stocks,What do make of AMD’s acquisition of Xilinx FPGAs?
04/04/2021,stocks,Would TSMC investing that 100b over 3 years to increase production help?
04/04/2021,stocks,"Nvidia doesn’t make their own GPU’s either, Samsung does."
04/04/2021,stocks,They don't need to corner the market. They are currently worth a lot less than either of Nvidia or Intel. If they reached the market cap of either they would be worth over $200
04/04/2021,stocks,So invest in tsmc basically
04/04/2021,stocks,">Oh, and Apple's new chip is blowing both Intel and AMD out of the water.

This is an important point. **Apple's new CPU is ARM based.** That's a whole new family of chips that computer makers can produce basically **without Intel or AMD**. 

While other companies seem to be nowhere as advanced in the development of their own ARM processors (until Apple introduced the M1, most thought the ARM architecture is only suitably for mobile devices), they **will** come eventually. 

Therefore we may see a **whole new world of CPU manufacturers.** Soon Samsung, Huawei, Amazon, Fujitsu, TSMC, Texas Instruments, or others may introduce their own desktop CPU designs. 

This **could be the end of the X86 dominance** in the market – and that, of course, spells trouble for the established X86 CPU makers."
04/04/2021,stocks,So what’s the ling term bull play? Amd?
04/04/2021,stocks,"At a price premium.  Intel has chips that match AMD. They just cost more.  AMD also allows OC across all lines whereas intel only does it for certain models that you’ll pay  more $ for.

20 and 10 years ago,  the advice was to get AMD if you wanted to sacrifice some performance and save a few bucks.  Now the advice is generally buy AMD unless you want to spend $400 or more on the chip."
04/04/2021,stocks,Glad you’re happy with it! Seems like you won the silicon lottery if you haven’t had issues with it.
04/04/2021,stocks,"That's not true at all. Wtf are you talking about.

Regardless. I hope you enjoy your AMD build where your USB stops working.

Oh yeah. They haven't quite fixed that issue yet after how many months?"
04/04/2021,stocks,"Yeh but there are shortages of PS5, HAHA. Thanks for supporting my point. The irony.

No sure if you were aware, but there was a global pandemic that effect supply chains.

Sigh."
04/04/2021,stocks,Isn't it just an indicator they have good margins?
04/04/2021,stocks,.... you cant compare p/s across industries as easily as p/e. (Even p/e fails in many).
04/04/2021,stocks,How many Intel stocks did you buy?
04/04/2021,stocks,"I disagree honestly, just as PC enthusiast. You can buy both AMD and Nvidia cards right now, and you’ll have a great card either way. But Nvidia just makes better performers on the high end. There’s also different features for content producers that steer people one way or the other, so it’s not all black and white. 

The only thing exclusive to anyone, at the moment, is ray tracing from Nvidia. But we can probably expect AMD to tackle this in their new cards. 

And Intel does actually have decent offerings, despite what a lot of people say about them being so far behind. We’ve seen 10400s go on sale for awesome prices for the performance. In fact, I believe all the 10 series CPUs are a pretty good value right now. So they’re kind of where AMD is with GPUs, just in the CPU space. 

I think the current silicon industry would be amazing for consumers if not for the crazy demand and awful shortage. Competition is through the roof, thanks to AMD. But it’s stiff, nonetheless. 

As it stands, Nvidia make the best GPUs, AMD make the best CPUs, and you’d be wise to not completely fall asleep on Intel. Might take a minute, but they’re not used to being second best. Who knows what will change, but history is worth looking at."
04/04/2021,stocks,"As a PC gamer and custom PC builder for gamers, most of the new market gaming PC's are built on AMD processors.  The new CPU and GPU power share tech is next level and is going to make it difficult for Intel to keep up until they start to offer their own GPU, until then Nvidia will still own the GPU market. AMD is a strong CPU and GPU producer and may knock Intel off their thrown sooner rather than later.  Full disclosure I hold stakes in all 3 of these companies."
04/04/2021,stocks,?
04/04/2021,stocks,"I dont know enough about Xilinx to provide my opinion. I never said I did. I'm just highlighting the terrible dd in this thread and hoping someone with a clue would actually chime in, but unfortunately you don't seem to have one either.

I'm just wondering why Xilinx is not just barely mentioned but not mentioned AT ALL in the top posts, when Xilinx isn't just some small company. It's a huge acquisition by AMD. You not flinching over the buy is completely irrelevant... Kinda sounds like you're just holding AMD and gambling with no dd. Which is fine, but weird to flex on when talking in depth about the value of AMD."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Agreed, I was clarifying"

04/04/2021,stocks,"Intel has its own fabs while AMD uses TSMC. From a national security perspective, this puts Intel in a much better position."
04/04/2021,stocks,Meh - I’m good on my cost basis and not married to the stock so I’ll be fine.
04/04/2021,stocks,">Not really. The 3060 Ti is the same MSRP as the 3060. The difference between something like a 3080 FE vs. an AIB GPU is marginal, and the FE still gives you the best bang for your buck.

TIL $70 difference is the same price.

3060 MSRP - $329

3060ti MSRP - $399

>If you're not talking about MSRP and are considering buying from scalpers, then $110 won't even get you closer to shit that came out in 2016.

No, I'm talking about difference. You already have a budget for a GPU. An extra $110 can make a difference in what GPU you can afford, especially in the used market where you have access to a wide range of cards.

>The only case I can say $110 will help is if you take what you'd spend on a 3060 Ti and get a 3070, but I'd rather get a 5600x than get Rocket Lake wish I had waited for 12th gen.

However, im not sure how he can say “no recent history of triple digits” when it literally hit 99, and was trading in the 90s throughout January.

AMD is gonna hit triples multiple times this year and that is no stretch.  Personally, I think it clears 100 after earnings, AND prob does when XLNX merger is official (since that helps em with the server market share)."
04/04/2021,stocks,"What do banks have to offer at this point? No one under 30 has ever stepped foot inside a brick and mortar bank. They use venom, PayPal and crypto for transactions, credit cards and savings.

You know how Chase bank make their money now? They use the $1500 minimum balance required in your checking account and they investing it in collar leap options spreads to make 1%, which is billions of dollars in income. They don’t add value to anything They are done. They sat on their asses while crypto and PayPal ate their lunch the last ten years, and they deserve to fail. This latest price surge in financial stocks based on a 1% rise in 10yr treasuries is lolz will not last long 🤷🏻‍♂️"
04/04/2021,stocks,"How can you be a PC builder, then attempt to “[explain] the PC market” without even mentioning what mining has done to it. This is all about mining, same thing happened when Bitcoin mooned in 2017-2018 and kissed 20.5K, and similar to stock indexes, Bitcoin is like an index for all mainly traded crypto, and as it mooned, so did other coins that are still extremely profitable through GPU mining, ethereum being the main culprit.


The more GPUs a miner has, the quicker his profits will return after buying said GPUs, and the more GPUs he/she will be able to buy. I know because I used my college dorms electricity for mining ethereum through freshman and sophomore year to pay for books, food, gas, and  in a blue moon, entertainment. 

Regardless, this has everything to do with the crypto market. As long as the price of any crypto is high enough to maintain profitability through mining, and the algorithms for those coins can still be solved using OTC GPU’s (not purpose built ASIC’s), then you will always see this problem. The demand will never disappear, until the coin does first. It happened in 2018, $20,000 USD per BTC, down to $2,000 USD. (And as I mentioned earlier, this is as close to an index you can get for the crypto market).

It crashed in end of 2018, (in the course of a week, LMFAO) it will crash again. Once it crashes, mining will decrease dramatically, as anyone that is still paying for electricity will very quickly realize that selling their equipment will net them far more profit than to keep running those units.

Edit:
Fuck my karma, this is the truth. The truth isn’t always popular, that’s why popular news isn’t always the truth. 

Also edit:
Before some dipshit has the audacity to say “NVIDIA makes better cards!”

No fucking shit. Go wipe your ass. 

A better card doesn’t mean it’s better all around. Look up ethereum graphics cards hashrates, if you’re feeling cheeky. Compare their hashrates to the price of the GPU, giving you an estimate of how many hashes per second per dollar spent on the card. 

Ratio:

MH/s : $ spent on card

The higher the ratio, the better. For non math people, MH/s divided by $ spent on card gives you MH/s per dollar spent. Using that number, you can adequately compare all sorts of new/old, nvidia/amd, air cooled/water cooled graphics cards, and then you come to my realization- AMD’s price for their offered mining performance, is simply so much greater than that of nvidia."
04/04/2021,stocks,"It will keep AMD competitive against an ever changing competitive market and physical limitations of CPUs alone. By merging with Xilinx, they’ll also increase their addressable TAM. It’s a win-win."
04/04/2021,stocks,It’ll help in 3-5 yeas when those factories start to go on line. How much it helps depends on the demand growth between now and then.
04/04/2021,stocks,"I know. It reinforces the point. NVIDIA has a better GPU but no stock, which leaves an opening for AMD. AMD can’t take advantage of NVIDIA’s stock issues because AMD has stock issues of their own."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Kind of. I think TSMC will have the Intel problem. They already hold a large share of the silicone market and can only produce so many chips, and can only expand so fast. I think they’re solid in that they probably the best in the world at what they do and will continue to be so for quite awhile going forward.

The ceiling for TSMC and Intel is what they can produce in a certain timeframe. They’re both investing billions in new fabs, but those take years to come on line.

I see the processor market being squeezed for the foreseeable future."
04/04/2021,stocks,"It's important to note that Apple isn't actually using an ARM chip architecture. They built their own architecture, which is kind of somewhere between ARM reference architectures and Intel chips.

They use the ARM instruction sets though, which is why their release of Big Sur was such a big deal, because it added application SDKs to help bridge the gap in CPU instruction sets from their old Intel hardware and the new ARM CPUs.


I'm pointing this out because it's an important distinction. Anyone can license the ARM chipset architectures. Apple has made their own, and continues to build their competitive advantage."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Caveat: ARM doesn't run x86 software and while apple can force the high end segment to recode/recompile/redo and rebuy all of their software, the 95% of the market on windows expects backwards compatibility and extremely broad support 

Samsung et al might make a killer arm processor, but if windows and video games and office software aren't supporting it, it's dead in the water"
04/04/2021,stocks,"Microsoft's Surface Chip is an ARM, it is just that Apple has far more experience and is far advanced in its ARM development due to years of development for the IPhone and the Ipad."
04/04/2021,stocks,ARM is not new at all..  unless you consider 30+ years old as being new
04/04/2021,stocks,"I think ARM cpu have a bright future. Beside Apple, Amazon has developed its own ARM cpu server, called Graviton(googling internet would find more). ARM has a mobile ecosystem now, it is just a matter of time for ARM cpu to be a mainstream computing hardware. A while back, people think CPU would be commodity, it would be that software running on it matters. Feel that commodity thing is close to reality now."
04/04/2021,stocks,All of them are going to succeed. The demand is just that large.
04/04/2021,stocks,"Idk, AMD has been the generic brand CPU for me since they had heat issues back in the 90s. Benchmarks for Gen 10 still beat the newer AMD chips and now that Rocket Lake is out, I’m sure that’s better. I’m not going to say that you get what you pay for in all aspects of the pc component world, but with CPUs, I’ve always stuck with Intel. It’s like preferring an iPhone over an Android cell phone or an nvidia GPU over an AMD. As for the OC capabilities, you don’t have to OC the intels and really, the CPU speeds we have nowadays, OC’ing is just an e-peen action as nothing requires it anymore. BTC & ETH miners have grown 12k+ just this year on a single platform of a couple handfuls, which has GPUs non-existent. Suggesting AMD will be able to get ahead of this shortage is just being plain ignorant."
04/04/2021,stocks,Intel definitely requires a new motherboard every CPU generation what the hell are you talking about dude?
04/04/2021,stocks,"Relax. It’s not true? It definitely was a few years ago. Intel typically required a new socket for their new cpus, yearly. AMD used the same socket for like 10 years iirc.

What usb issue?"
04/04/2021,stocks,"There are shortages of clean water in places like Africa.  Doesn't mean that it was because of a global pandemic affecting supply chains.  

A shortage of a PS5 can be caused the same way a shortage of axles in Fremont CA for Tesla.  Yes, global supply chain.  But also because of software issues, factory (staffing) issues due to local health ordinances, and more.  

Is Japan open?  How about China?  Those are two major manufacturing nexus which are (for the most part) entirely open.  And yet, we have a supply chain issue?  If so, then where is the blockage - specifically.

But the point on a video card shortage has a lot to do with demand.  And that demand isn't by internet cafes nor gamers, it's being driven by the GPU arithmetic which benefits bit coin miners.  

Again, you're setting up a strawman (""shortages of PS5s"") which is totally ignorant to the conversation.  

Sigh."

04/04/2021,stocks,">Bitcoin is like an index for all mainly traded crypto

Do you even know what a stock index is dude? 

Bitcoin is in no way like an index. 

Just because all coins go up in a bull crypto market, and bitcoin having the largest market cap by far, doesn't make bitcoin anything at all comparable to an index. 

I think it's also silly to compare the current state of bitcoin, with companies like Square and Tesla holding large amounts, to the situation years ago. Paypal and others are also starting to embrace crypto in a way we haven't seen any of the other times cryptos have mooned.

While it's certainly possible for cryptos to crash again, I think we're going to see much higher support prices. Even Elon tweeting that bitcoin seemed too high didn't send it below $40,000."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Not just mining. Everything uses chips these days. The rise of smart cars and autonomous driving capabilities is also increasing demand for chips, each vehicle has a couple dozen discrete processors in them. Beyond just GPUs, demand is skyrocketing.

04/04/2021,stocks,Mining is a relatively minor contributor to the shortage. It's only talking something like 10% of the stock. The cast majority of the shortage is being caused by remote work increasing demand across the board.
04/04/2021,stocks,"You are correct on a lot of points but a major crash is becoming less and less likely. Major difference is the giant institutional buying that has driven the price up. 

Sure bitcoin is on a path to greater adoption but not many regular people have it yet. All this movement has been driven by institutional and billionaires hands moving dollars to bitcoin as a store of value. 

We just doubled the money supply in dollars, so wealthy hands are looking for places to hedge inflation. Stock market is already pumped up with to insane levels with buy backs and quantitative easing for over a decade. 

Gold and jewelry are on 10 year lows and continue to trend down. So bitcoin is the next major inflation hedge. Keep in mind that despite volatility, over 60 percent of the market cap wallets havent done shit for quite some time, they are just hodling.

04/04/2021,stocks,"You are 100% right. Anyone can license the architecture and develop their own custom processors. 
However, with Apple being successful in this, more companies may be tempted to do so. Companies like Samsung, Huawei or Fujitsu may try to get rid of the old X86 dominance (and in Huawei's case, get rid of the dependence on American technology).

All Mac OS software is running on and optimised for Intel processors. 

So Apple created a compatibility layer, Rosetta 2. They did something similar when the switched from the Power PC platform to Intel. While this kind of emulation is never perfect, it works.

04/04/2021,stocks,It's also part of the reason that TSMC is higher risk than AAPL. They aren't going to be able to create an M1 competitor like some people on reddit claim they could. The large majority of the R&D costs in chip development come from the architecture. Apple can drop TSMC and buy their own fabs more easily than TSMC can make their own CPU architecture.
04/04/2021,stocks,"You're right... but there's an important distinction. Apple is NOT using ARMs architectures. They've ONLY licensed the instruction sets for the M series chips. They spent the cash to do their own R&D and come up with something of their own. It takes some of the benefits from ARM-like designs, and some from Intel-like designs.

There's reasons that Apple has done this while others haven't. First, they have the most to gain from this. They have two enormous lines of consumer hardware which will benefit from this investment. Second, Apple has more cash in their coffers than fucking everyone else, so the expense doesn't impact them materially. 

Samsung already has their own mobile chipset, and they don't have a significant product line in laptop/desktop world. They have no interest in making an M1 competitor. Huawei is in the same position. Fujitsu? Lol.

The M-series is an enormous win for Apple and no one is going to contest it for a long time unless Intel decides they want to do anything other than coast on their market share anytime soon.

Apple has so much cash that if TSMC doesn't handle the M-series fabrication in a satisfactory way, then Apple will just buy their own fabs and control their entire supply chain instead."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Apple switched from ARM to Intel when Motorolla didn't want to continue developing the Power PC (ARM) chip for laptops because there wasn't enough demand to justify it at the time. Right away the Intel laptops had heat issues, so Apple started making the computers out of aluminum, so that the whole of the computer was a heat sink. Intel turned Apple down on developing a chip for the iPhone, because they though there wasn't enough demand to make to worthwhile to them. (The first iPhone was seen as bad phone epoxed onto a iPod at first). Apple was forced to go it alone on the iPhone and bought an ARM reseach company. All along Intel was deaf to Apple's complaints about the heat and performance issues of the Intel chips."
04/04/2021,stocks,"It’s actually pretty normal for Intel to get bad rep after a new arch drop, I always wait 3-6 months after a launch before buying.

You came in with a non-sequitor (""what about PS5s"") and ignored the salient point for GPU and CPU shortage:  increased demand.  I explained one component of demand being bit coin miners.  You then wanted to argue about supply chain issues.

* This isn't about PS5s.   
* This isn't about supply chain issues (unless you want to explain the bottleneck exactly where it is)

04/04/2021,stocks,"Not gonna argue that the long term risk you've identified doesn't exist. I'm just trying impress the fact that the risk is likely much smaller than you may think, for the reasons I gave above. 

The fact that Apple doesn't target other OEMs with their chips means that Intel isn't really threatened. The cost is higher than you may think (Apple's been working towards this for ~10 years), which will deter most everyone else (in the medium term at least), and unless they're starting soon, they're going to be far behind when they finally do decide to start.

But you're right, there's always long term risk. But Apple is building a significant moat with their M series chips."

2021-04-04 03:39:14,stocks,"Telecom Argentina: Taking advantage of a downmarket Like Ana Steele’s arms, the country of Argentina has been in a bind.  The country owes $323 billion, defaulting a year ago (for the third time in the previous twenty years).  This is the ninth time that the country has defaulted.  The debt on Argentina, along with high inflation, can be similar to the United States in 1973 and 1980.  In both years, the U.S. faced high debt ($458 billion in 1973 and $908 billion in 1980).  In both years, inflation went up (look at the gas prices in both years).  This caused stock prices for U.S. stocks to plummet. However, men such as Warren Buffett took advantage of these price discrepancies and invested and made money.  Buffett invested in the Washington Post and shares of GEICO.



Telecom Argentina (TEO) has gone down by 36.82 percent in the past year, TEO has $220.38 million in cash. The market values TEO at $693 million as of April 2nd.  The company has $4.5 billion in book value, mainly due to the $3 billion in Goodwill and $4.03 billion in Property, plant and equipment.  Let us assume that the company removes the Goodwill.  The company still has $1.5 billion in equity, meaning that the company is selling at just half its’ book value. 
Despite the COVID-19 mess, the company has lost less money than last year ($80.85 million in 2020 vs. $89.99 million in 2019).  Yes, the EBIT is smaller ($419 million in 2020 vs. $558 million in 2019); but, if we multiply the EBIT by ten, the company would worth $4.19 billion, whereas the current market value is $693.38 million.  The intrinsic value of this company (in my view) will be at least five times its’ current worth.  The margin-of-safety might not be realized today; but, it will eventually (most likely)."

2021-04-04 02:20:47,stocks,"Which Strategy Is Better? Never Selling Vs. Profit Taking Hello, this is gonna be my first post on here. I've been a lurker for 2 years and only created this account recently. Anyways, I want to hear some people's opinions on here about two different strategies I've been mind juggling for a while now.

The strategy of never selling is simple and what I pretty much stuck with since I started investing until recently. I think it's best to never sell if you plan on investing some money here and there into some long term funds or ETFs. But recently (late last year before this massive rotation) I sold profits on a few stocks that I did really well on and reinvested into a bunch of other things. I was doing really well on all of my picks, and with these past 2 months all of my precious gains disappeared. Of course, hindsight is a bitch, and I wish I had taken profits on most of those and then bought the dip because I still have a strong conviction. Which leaves me thinking about a new strategy, specifically for my volatile growth stonks.

The strategy of profit taking would have me taking some profits here and there if I make a certain % amount, and then keeping that cash as buying power for dips, bears and rotations. I think this works really well with volatile growth stocks because volatile growth stocks have shown to be able to run up anywhere from 15-50% in a single day or even more depending on the stock. I don't have many stonks like those, but I do have stocks that rally and pullback. If a certain sector or security I'm invested in grows a significant amount in a couple weeks or a couple months, it will almost definitely pullback soon after. This mindset would also help me not feel as bad about selling during a bear market."

Some of their investments that went down ""pre covid"".  HA, NM, OBELF, AAL, JCP and unfortunately many more all held for almost a decade or more.  Not nearly enough positives as they focused on value plays (oil, mortgage, retail)  If you want to do a buy and hold strategy and not do much work, grab any good indexed ETF (IE: VTI, SPY, VOO etc) and forget your password.

I use 25 steps in my technical analysis, which is a lot for most, but it works for me. I can run through one stock in ten minutes using these 25 steps. Then it's either a buy, or a pass. I work 2-3 hours a day on swing trading. I make a living at it now. Good luck."
04/04/2021,stocks,"I think I'm in a similar mindset. Basically I'm in the market to invest long term. But it's boring to just buy ETF regularly, I want to do some trading as well.

Here's what I try to do 

- Consistently put money into an all-world ETF
- Never sell ETF
- Leave some money for trading (let's be honest - gambling)
- Leave some more money in fiat so I don't have to sell anything in the first moment of seeing a perceived dip and wanting to BUY NOW
- If I lose trading money I sit out and wait for the next time I save some spare money. I've spent my entertainment bucks.
- If I win on a gamble, take it out and store the winnings in the ETF. Of course you can keep some for gambling or even keep it in the same stock if you want to keep gambling on that. But at least try to take out some winnings. Ideally above the initial gamble, if the winnings are large enough."

Certain growth stocks have dropped 10-50% the past month but S&P is at ATH.

04/04/2021,stocks,"I think a big part is knowing your risk tolerance. If you're not okay with seeing 30-40% gains evaporate, maybe what you are investing in exceeds your risk tolerance and is causing you to be emotional about it. To answer your question, time is also very relevant. If you're not okay with longing it, then you need to take profits when you can and look for dips to snatch up more shares or reallocate when necessary. If you really don't need the money now and it's a high conviction play, let it run man. The long strategy, as long as you are in a good stock, will typically outperform by a lot in the long run. Hold and DCA."
04/04/2021,stocks,Sometimes profit taking then rebuying on the inevitable dip works while other times you sell but the stock keeps going up. But it's all about what you believe in. The whole market has generally gone up but never in a straight-line so you gotta think of that circumstances for your stock interests.
04/04/2021,stocks,"You have to do both.  On high growth stocks, you absolutely have to take profits because as much as it shoots up, it can just as easily shoot down.  As they mature in their business is when I decide to keep long term or sell out.  There are plenty of holdings I haven't sold since I bought like AAPL and MSFT.  I bought that sucker in 2008.  Not planning on selling anytime soon unless they fundamentally change their business models for the worse."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Depends on the stock. There are stocks to hold for life, there are stocks to make a quick buck.

For instance, you bought GME at $2. Suddenly in a couple months it's at $400. Sell. It was a play, you won, done. See a company you think will shoot up soon? Buy some, if it does sell. It doesn't pay to hold forever in plays like that. These are, of course, riskier plays, and never put a large percentage of your portfolio in these trades.

Bluechip, established companies, on the other hand (the apples and what have you), should make the core of your portfolio, and you should buy and hold, dollar cost average, and never sell."
04/04/2021,stocks,"I personally think about it this way: 

cons:   
taking profit means paying taxes.   
potentially losing more returns on longer waiting times.   
having to pay transaction fees.   


pros:   
\- you actually make money. it might be (lets hope not) that once you want to cash in further down the line, the market takes a significant hit and you actually lose money.   
\- you can put those returns (and original investment) into other securities that suit new / current market situations (and life situation) better (e.g an etf with 7% / Year is great, but one with 13% on avg is even better)  
\- it frees up cash - again to be able to react to market situations.   


overall I think it all depends on the question if original investments and reason to invest still fit your goals and investment strategies. also, if your initial goals of returns ,. growth etc are met or not.   


I do not think it makes sense to lock up anything into any form of investment if it keeps underperforming, only to avoid tax hits or because ""holding is the most secure way to make money""."

04/04/2021,stocks,"I think that it depends on how long you plan to stay at it. If you're a trader, not in it for the long haul, taking your profit is a good idea. You seem like an investor, so holding and waiting for your investment to grow would be ideal. If you have the luxury of waiting and not just selling your stock when a dip occurs, I think that you're in a good position. I would ignore most of what you hear on reddit (especially these days) about dips bc I think that most are NOT investors. They're just in it for a very quick profit. So, their strategy is going to be completely different from yours. On the other hand, if you see being panicking and selling their stock, that'll be a good buying opportunity for you (if you feel that it's a good investment)."

Take profits immediate on meme stocks that shot up for no reason.  Whenever a stock shoots up for no reason; they almost always come back down.  You'll need to identify these pumps and sell them when you can.  I made the mistake of holding BB when it shot up and didn't sell.

04/04/2021,stocks,"It's important to note that this only works for general equity markets in the very long term. Commodities? Forget about it, you need to be aware of the inherent cyclicality and get our before the cycle turns."
04/04/2021,stocks,"The strategy of never selling means you'll hand the stocks down to your kids... or worse, to the government :P 

Long term: I think if you're selling, because you made a profit and invest it in another company, you should really consider if the other company will make you more money than the one you sold. If you have invested in ""the best company"", they have a superior product without any serious competition, 20% growth forecast, expanding globally and so on, and you already made 20% - why would you sell it and invest in another company that is not the best stock? 

Selling profits has also a lot to do with you. The general rule is to invest only money that you don't need. If you're planning a family, buying a house, and so on, you probably sell your stuff now, when you can make a profit. Or if you're 50 and you figure out that you can stop working at 55 if you sell now, it's really something to consider."
04/04/2021,stocks,"From personal experience. I've taken profits several times and reallocated that money into other stocks. Sometimes I time it pretty well and others awfully. Its pretty much a zerosum game in retrospect.

However I will say, given how I have reallocated I believe I've exchanged most of my shorter term trades to longterm investments even though I could've yielded a higher amount out of those previous short term positions.

I do believe and kind of know also that profit taking is a good thing. Because if your capital is better used in another stock, why leave it sitting somewhere else? Even if people in investing usually say ""dont try to time the market"" I'd still encourage people to sell when a company is trading at a silly high valuation not backed by fundamentals. And buy back in when its cheap, or find something else that is in fact cheap and let the weighing machine work for your profit over time"

The giant firms that actually affect the stock price don’t care at all about the companies you invest in. In fact they actively manipulate the price that they are selling for. You mean basically nothing to the price of the stock, and your hold means nothing except for you could lose a lot of money.

Another thing to remember is people only say hold because the stock is going down. You can always take profits on a stock that’s way up, wait for it to crash again because they always do, and buy back in."

04/04/2021,stocks,"So I know people here my have other methodologies, but I try to follow the value investing approach of Graham and Dodd.

A lot of my portfolio is made up of positions I anticipate holding for a long time (BRK.B, STOR, AFL, ORCL to name a few) because there is an indication to me that the analysis I would perform each quarter would raise my price target (although I still should do the work to make sure).

Then there are the used cigarette butts I pick up for one last good puff. BGFV is one of these for me (OI, KT, VIAC are a few others). It’s probably got 10-15% upside in the next few months based on my research, and some probably have a bit of a longer period of upward momentum. But the plan is to sell once they hit a specific price (usually that margin is a minimum of 20% upside of the purchase). 

Any disciplined approach needs to have a goal for the specific position, aside from MPT (which is just garbage anyway) so long term holds need to be understood within the context of evaluating the investments future periodically. This is essentially the same thing someone who trades on price trends will tell you, it’s just that they work on must shorter time frames.

There are certainly alternative strategies, but I suspect people like Cathie Wood who buy on future promises will be as forgotten as the investors of the past who ignored things like profitability and debt."
04/04/2021,stocks,"I don’t look at it like taking profits, it’s more like shifting your funds.

04/04/2021,stocks,"It is never bad to take profits. While conditions sometimes don’t allow, ideally I like to hold at least a year on my conviction investments (I don’t day trade).

04/04/2021,stocks,"If you’re going for individual stocks there’s a big chance you will need to do profit taking and rebalancing at some point. At least you gotta be aware of the earnings report, press release, 10k, 8k of the stock you have plus the competitor’s reports as well. Also be aware of any new opportunities coming up, like some suddenly super undervalued stocks due to particular short term event/ some new growth opportunity arise. You don’t have to rebalance too often, but at least be  of the news everyday to spot some even better chances."
04/04/2021,stocks,"With non dividend paying stocks I will sell if the stock has appreciated significantly or reached a plateau. 3-5 yrs. There isn't an incentive to hold on for years after that once the high has been reached.

A lot of the older steady stocks like oil refiners producers have good dividends and may be a play because their dividends are high enough for you to keep the stock even when their prices fall for a few years.  But everything has a shelf life and companies move quicker nowadays towards success or failure.

All in all, different buckets of stocks for different purpose and timeline."

Profit taking is for swing traders."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Market timing is hard and it looks like such a missed opportunity in hindsight.

I like to only buy for permanent holding. To me, buying at a good price is easier than selling at the right price. So I don't buy opportunistic stocks, don't buy with a goal of making 20% or 50% or some such goal. I buy good companies I have conviction in, companies I have (and continue to have) an idea of their market dominance, pricing power and moat, toll gate like business structure or too important to fail kind of attributes. They should have performed historically 15% plus and currently are not on a tear.

I try to hold them forever. Of course I sold some when I no longer have that conviction of them or something fundamentally changed about them or if I needed the money. I have been very happy with this and these have performed many fold better (over many years...) than my index fund/etf holdings."

04/04/2021,stocks,"Personally I find profit taking encourages me to chop and change my portfolio too much and I end up wishing I hadn’t touched it. If I believe in the companies then il just leave it as it’s realistic to expect dips.

All stocks pull back after a rally and you can always jump back in. If you take profits, say after a rally to $10, and you jump in again after seeing a reversal at say $8, you make that profit from $8 to $10 again. So ride the momentum and get in and out taking profits, of course assuming you're doing your DD."

04/04/2021,stocks,"This is often referred to as “mental accounting” it’s a flaw in thinking. There is no “your money” or “house money”, it’s just all your money. If you believe that the company is good and has more growth opportunities, then you don’t reallocate capital from the investment, you let it all run.

What this person means is that they picked high quality companies and it soared. The reality is that had they left in “their money” along with “house money” then they would have 10X more than their current stack.

Mental accounting is a simple mistake to avoid but it’s incredibly common error to commit even by seemingly sophisticated investors.

EDIT: just so people don't get their panties in a tangle, and argue the behavioral economic theory that's been published and peer reviewed, and a guy named Richard Thaler won a Nobel Peace prize in Economics on the subject, lets set it straight. Your ""opinion"" and ""personal choice"" doesn't hold a candle to observed behaviors that are known to be suboptimal.

If you sell off your winners based on the fact that it has run up and you are taking back your initial investment and letting the ""house"" money ride, you are making the decision based on the wrong criteria's. You make buy or sell decisions based on the underlying fundamentals and outlook for a company, not on some imaginary amounts split between your money and house money. Also, the stock does not know you own it, it doesn't care, it moves in the long run based on fundamentals. ""short term the stock market is a popularity contest, long-term its a weighing machine"""

I simply mean whatever you initially tossed in to invest or “gamble” with just make sure you sell that amount and put it back into your normal rotation of funds.  I simply gave advice based on your question.  If this method doesn’t work for you (buy and hold) just do your research and look for stocks that might pop from media exposure.  I will warn you though... it’s a GIANT risk if you’re not educating yourself daily and following every ticker. It’s easy to see how much money people “have” and think we can all be day traders and just stack millies all day with no problems.

04/04/2021,stocks,"Yeah it really depends on your stock choices. As the years have gone by I've adjusted my strategy a bit. I look at large potential growth and invest. If it balloons I either cash out completely if I think it's too much growth to justify or I cash out my initial investment and use that to invest in dividend long term ""never sell"" stocks. 

Some of those large growth potential stocks a keep in and loose my ass. So I've learned if you see crazy gains and get gitty, don't get greedy. Take at least the initial if not the gains and put it somewhere safer, or keep half as cash for later opportunities. 

I'm 30 and been actively investing since 18. Stocks like tesla I'm mad for selling. But other stocks like sears in thankful I did. It's hard to let stock you really believe in go. So if you do, only sell a potion.

We are arguing in the context of “hold long term or profit take”, so holding long term will usually beat out profit taking, less friction. But people believe in profiting off volatility, so they trade around it. It’s a suckers game long term. Only works for high fliers with no revenue, no profit, no business model companies and SPACs, thays where the strategy works due to volatility, and investing substantial amounts in that area is essentially a recipe for disaster. 

Also it’s not truly a hedge if one sells to take back their original investment. A hedge would be closer to using the funds from selling off the original shares and buying a long dated put on the underlying. Where one can help stabilize the returns but still remain bullish long term."

04/04/2021,stocks,What does you being a CPA have to do with anything? We all have degrees and PhDs here coming out our arseholes. Have some decorum and respect the letters you earn enough not to throw them about as a trinket in your game of oneupmanship. It makes you sound insecure.

04/04/2021,stocks,"You're referring to the open position left behind as ""play money"", which is pretty much nonsense in something as liquid as stock markets. Gotta agree with the other guy, it's all just your money."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Right, having it being a personal decision doesn’t make it less suboptimal. I hear it all the time about “personal choice” when someone pays off their house early even though their interest rate is 2.5% on the 30 year mortgage. They will say “it helps me sleep better” and I will say “you need to learn how to sleep under different conditions and also optimize your allocation to use the easiest form of leverage available to a regular person that can’t be margin called” (I promise I’m fun at parties)

You pulling out your initial investment is essentially just reducing some losses and capping returns. So you can say to yourself and other people, “well I didn’t lose any money, I pulled out my initial investment” While that may help with “losers” that you picked, it also affects that 1-2 mega winner, and you 1/10th your stack. 

Remember, when it comes to investing, volatility is a fee and not a fine. Volatility short term scares people and they withdraw “their money” and let house money sit but if you invested in a great underlying stock, you let it all ride (and double down during sell offs) and pay that volatility fee upfront and expect for the stock to go up and down and sideways. Collect your millions in a few decades."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Haha thanks man. I'm really young still, so I figure if I take out a lil bit of profits here and there on stocks that aren't as stable as MSFT or AAPL then I'm for sure to make at least some money to hedge against a worse case scenario. It's also not a majority of my portfolios. I have a retirement ROTH, I have a bit in real estate and I am just trying to set myself up best for the future. I would LOVE to be able to retire at 40! I still got over 10 years to go.

The main reason I bring this post up is because the stocks that are risky in my portfolio all tanked anywhere from 30-60% these last 2 months and if I had taken at least a little bit of profits then I'd have at least more buying power now. And if I sell something that proceeds to explode, well at least I made money, can't complain there! I definitely have my share of 30-40 stocks I follow daily and track, although I'm not invested in every one."
04/04/2021,stocks,He just wanted to sound edgy.  Judging people by what they do with “THEIR” money is the real infantile move.
04/04/2021,stocks,"Ok.  Let's make a comparison then.  A little analogy.  Try and get you on the same page.

You fund a stock brokerage account.  You buy a stock.  The stock value goes up $100.  You sell your initial investment.  Keep $100 of the stock saying ""if the stock goes to $0 and I lose the full $100, then I didn't lose anything"" due to the idea that the initial deposited value has not taken a capital loss.  The stock goes to $0 and you lose the $100.

You open a bank account.  I hire you to come to my house to mow my lawn.  We agree on a price of $100.  You finish mowing my lawn and I give you a $100 cashiers check.  On your way to the bank to deposit the check in your account, it blows out your window and you lose it.  You have not lost any principal from your bank account and have not taken a capital loss. 

These are the same scenario looked at differently.  In both scenarios you got paid for your time - $100... in both scenarios you lost the money... only in 1 of the 2 scenarios are you going to attempt to mentally gymnastic your way into explanations as to why it isn't a loss.

The inability to understand this is what makes it mentally infantile.  How you choose to view money is infantile if you believe one of the two scenarios isn't a loss."

i type in SPX and all i get as a result is something called E-Mini S&P 500 listed as a Future (i also don't really know what a future is).

so i guess my question is, when investing in s&p 500, is there a special ticker i need to search for ? if i google s&p 500 stock it gives me the 4000$ one that i can't find in my platform. does it have a different ticker or something ?"

Reverse merger companies have done their best, but:

> Class 5 vehicles: revenue

> Class 6 trucks: revenue

> Class 8 urban trucks: revenue

> The ideal commercial EV company would be aiming to add the vehicles below.

> (HYPE)

As has been indicated, no commercial EV company currently has any plans to produce all-electric vehicles in all classes, from Class 1 vans all the way to Class 8 long-haul trucks.

This is despite it being much easier to make an electric engine than to make an internal combustion engine.

This is despite the production of all-electric vehicles in all classes being a form of revenue risk management.

So, which company or companies have the potential to produce all-electric vehicles in all classes and become the Tesla of Commercial Vehicles?"
04/04/2021,stocks,I would say if you're looking for a new company moving into the commercial sector I would play Arrival. The way they make their vehicles makes it easy for them to design new vehicles specifically made for which ever company wants them. They are different in that the have there base model vehicle that they're able to tweak  for the specific client. They've talked about moving into larger vehicles as well besides the different size vans. They are just looking into a new power source (hydrogen) They also have been working on automation of the vehicles (I think with blackberry software). If anything the software they are making to actually run their manufacturing plants is pretty revolutionary. Main problem I see with them moving to far into this sector is that they still consider themselves a technology company first.

04/04/2021,stocks,"Past performance is no indication of future returns. That pretty much sums it all up. Your strategy seems unfounded and I'd suggest learning a bit more about the stock market before jumping in. After the ""corona crash"" most noob investors have seen nothing but green. They don't know what red looks like. Trying to determine the markets behavior based on this freak event is very short sighted and you'll likely end up with a rude awakening. I'd say it's very unlikely you'll 3x your money in 3 years and being able to time it to get out. In 2020 gains were easy but like I said it hasn't been a normal market. And we've been in a bull market pretty since 2008, when it nowhere else to go but up, and it's continued into 2021. A major correction or crash will happen at some point and when it does, you won't have time to react because most of the unloading will already have happened."
04/04/2021,stocks,"I kind of get what you are looking for. This is similar to someone who speeds whilst overtaking in their car thinking if they only do it for a short time, there is less chance of getting caught or having a crash.

The risk is always there. Investing in the stock market is not gambling, but putting all your money into high risk/yield stocks for a short amount of time is exactly that. Take the chance if you want, but be aware that anything can happen in 3 years.

Diversify your portfolio and your thinking my dude. Of that $1000, split it up between a few choices. Choose 3 high risk tech stocks or ETFS, and choose one other stock, something more stable or separate from tech. The younger you are the more risk you can accept as time in the market beats timing the market. Just have a plan for if this one doesn't unfold like you hope it will."

OP, it's theoretically possible and so is winning the lottery, the chance is just minimal. To see that kind of insane growth you'd need to invest in private companies pre-IPO. Or take massive risks that will 99% assured wipe out your money."

2021-04-03 21:52:38,stocks,"Hedging against Inflation/Rising rates Hi all.  Since this year has been amazing and crazy in every way...as a relatively young/new investor in trying to find the best balance of locking in those long term gains etc etc.

Recently I’ve been entertaining the idea of starting to build in commodities and possibly VIX into 5-10% of my portfolio as a hedge against the risk of market crashes etc.

I’m very heavy into ARK funds, a lot of tech and Fintech, CRSR, VW...trying to diversify a lot more as a way to mitigate risks.

2. What is the best way to implement this strategy in a portfolio?

The pharmacy profit margins are quite low now, and what was once a consistently-profitable business has been squeezed by a combination of insurance, coupons (like GoodRx), and, of course, PBMs themselves. Essentially, CVS has realized that the future of pharmacy as a consistently-profitable business lies largely with PBMs, the middlemen of pharmacy.

Leadership team is solid and Mr. Cohen has a proven track record with Chewy. They also have a world wide following. Personally, I’m investing long term because I like the stock. The company is deeply undervalued as analysts consider it a brick and mortar company but they fail to understand that GameStop is transforming into an e-commerce powerhouse that will rival Amazon.

04/04/2021,stocks,"It isn't in the way you'd expect.

The bid-ask spread on the contract gets divided by the strike price to normalize it.  
There's also a time-to-expiration factor.  
And there's a factor for the spacing of strike prices relative to the strike price.

But there isn't a scaling for the distance of the strike price from the underlying price.

The VIX really concentrates on contract spreads, and kind of ignores the widening of strikes about the underlying, as well as order flow and volume, and actual trading prices of the contracts (which will pingpong between the bid and ask and create quantization noise)."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Yes, those calls are factored into the equation and makes the vix drop..."
04/04/2021,stocks,Only if the strike had existed before and the trade caused the bid/ask spread on them to narrow.

Big investors who had seen massive returns in a short period of time, logically, decided to take their winnings off the table while not waiting to find out just how awful the accounting mistakes are. I don’t see the big money coming back in any time soon. Retail traders will hold the bags."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Well, there's no point on focusing on the purchase price, it is what it is.  Many people and institutions get on a stock at what isn't necessarily the high point, and it turns out it didn't have much left to grow during a popular buying time.

In addition to buying more, selling (at a loss), or holding until profitable or less of a loss, you could play options.

With some risk, and depending on how many share you own cash, you could sell covered options, and if priced well and they are never exercised, you could do this for some time until the price increases to where you can close your options positions and then close your long position.

not financial advice, because I'm just a newbie with a basic understanding of these things and you should always do you own financial research.  Its my disclaimer so you cant blame me later, it is reddit of course."

04/04/2021,stocks,"I think in general EV is overhyped.  It's starting to feel like marijuana did in 2018.  Everybody has these overly optimistic projections, and the market is going to end up oversaturated.  Production in Q4 of 2022, meaning first deliveries will start in 2023.

They did a press release to announce that they have 14,000 reserved, that's not a lot.

The ego of naming a company after yourself, for the second time after your first one failed.  I just don't see people lining up for this brand.

I dunno about this one.   I do like the fact that they are using contract manufacturing, so Magna bears a lot of risk.  Flipside, it's attractively priced vs. ICE cars so margins likely to be pretty thin.

I think a fair number of these EV companies will fail to deliver anything substantial.  Fisker seems to have a much lower risk profile so they may have the ability to outlast, but after the Ocean, what's next?  And does the tech Magna is able to deliver make it a compelling auto?

Their FAQ is littered with more details in 2021, makes me think they haven't completed their design yet."
04/04/2021,stocks,Existing car makers are simply better at making cars than Tesla will ever be unless Tesla stops patting itself on the back and makes build quality and manufacturing efficiency its first and second priorities for a decade.
04/04/2021,stocks,"Tesla was able to skip the traditional dealership model because its sales rate is relatively low and it's perpetually behind on production. No excess inventory and light output requirements make putting a lot full of cars in every zipcode unnecessary.

I mean, who could you trust if not these institutions? The market crashed AND it had a precipitous effect on employment for YEARS. 

It’s like 2008 we cut a leg off and we had to grow a new leg. 2020 was “holy shit we might all be dead tomorrow” and then a whole long “I’m not dead yet” while the govt injected trillions into the economy. 

Today, there’s just too much money in the economy. The government will NEED to either raise taxes, raise interest rates, or find other ways to reduce money supply as it’s causing a run on the market, a run on real estate — pretty much a run on anything with any potential value holding power."

04/04/2021,stocks,"The Authorised Participant (AP- the firm that operates the ETF) is responsible for rebalancing what the EFT holds, to best reflect whatever is being tracked.  ARK, in your example. 

Due to the frequency, unpredictability and sheer speed with which most underlying reference measures move, APs automate this process as far as they can. 

If a corporate the EFT holds is listed on a trading venue anywhere globally, I imagine it will import the most up-to-date price it can get as possible from wherever that is, based on prescription designated in the ETF portfolio. 

But.... If the corporate or economic enterprise invested in is not listed.... things get super rank. An equity holding in a private (unlisted) incorporated entity is usually (I think) subject to the ‘fair value’ assessment guidelines in IFRS 9. (I’m not linking - have fun swimming in accountancy piss....)

Whereupon ... I see your point. Such a judgment on proper monetary value is inherently ‘active’. In private equity manager due diligence governance, the investment committee will meet, look at the hard stuff, and come up with a figure they think fair. And that committee should have a marked degree of independence from the investment manager (the value of whose collective vehicle will factor in and depends upon). 

And I imagine that, not only for the price to assign the ETF operator has to make for the equity in the going concern, the going concern has to assign value to its own .... stuff. Which couldn’t be done passively, I don’t think. Particularly if what they’re doing is developing products, tech, etc. that aren’t being sold yet, in anticipation of future profits coming in after the boxes are ticked, the thing goes to market, and sells. All of which is a big ‘hopefully’ with zero guarantees. 

Which all adds up to ... it being impossible for a pioneering ETF operation like ARK to remove all elements of judgement from its price formation procedures, if it has unlisted outfits trying new things that can’t be valued without a table of people hashing out and agreeing upon a monetary figure to allocate that couldn’t, properly, be considered ‘passive’, in the sense that someone else - like the market - came up with it, and they’re simply importing and integrating it into the price of shares in their own collective. 

I imagine their prospectus deals with it. I’m going for a yonder to see what they say :)

E: ARK ETFs all look actively managed. Off to find this PRNT thing now :)

EII: Yeah, this isn’t ‘tracking’ the index step-for-step. Its mandate correlates with the index, and the performance it seeks to secure is expressed similarly. But it isn’t looking to simply ‘do what the index does’ - like for like. 

I think it would be better described as using the index as a benchmark whose performance it looks to match or better with its own investment decisions. That may involve sharing a heavy correspondence with the index, in terms of what it holds and how much. 

Apart from use of the word ‘track’ in the literature (which I’d have steered away from if I’d written it, personally) it’s not a ‘tracker’ at all - it’s an active vehicle with the same focus which looks deliver returns along the same lines. 

So, in response to the question ‘how can I mitigate potential shifts resulting from the active nature of the fund and its system for remaining in step with the index?’ 

It’s active, based on an index of near-identical mandate. Shifts are made by decisions human fund management professionals make.

What you want to make sure is that your tech is diversified.  (FinTech, Communication Services, Semis, Auto/EV, etc).  You have a long term horizon, so some tech overlap is going to be ok.

If you want some shorter term plays that aren't tech heavy, I currently like a few staple plays that haven't fully recovered yet.  Specifically Coke and Tyson Foods.  If you're expecting inflation to take root, the gold miners have pulled back a lot (GOLD, NEM).  As for financials, Blackrock is solid.

These brokerage accounts have their minus and pluses. On the spread aspect, if you have one your brokerage should close them on the same day. One guy here lost 27K since the spread didn’t close simultaneously. When you buy spread you buy the whole deal. Both or four legs.

>I remember one time I had to wait 30 minutes for a limit buy to execute when the stock was sitting at that price.

The ""price"" is the last trade that happened.

The limit you set goes into the book as a quote, and the book is FIFO, so anyone else who offered the same quote before you gets filled first.

And market makers can get in front of the book. As orders come in they can fill them, often by improving the price relative to the current book (it'd be illegal to do it at a worse price than the book).

So there are a couple of reasons you waited. One is that you weren't first in line at that quote. Another is that nobody traded on your side while you were first in line. Another is that orders were being filled before they reached the book (though you should have seen the last price change if there was price improvement)."

Was the factory in Berlin already under construction in early 2019? That factory won't be finished until later this year, so maybe 2.5 years after they started deliveries of the Model 3 in Europe.

Are you saying that European customers should have had to wait for 2.5 more years to take delivery of their Model 3s?

This makes no sense at all.

The fact is that Tesla was always planning to start deliveries in Europe before the Model 3 was fully ramped.

I think they only exist as they do today because of hype for the companies and products versus the products themselves, as Elon has consistently over-promised features and delivery dates and his people caught up later.

Elon is not actually that good at building cars or rockets. His entire management style appears to be come up with a crazy idea while all the employees around around him works 80-120 hours a week to make it happen. He's a notorious micromanager, and you can wonder if that's to the detriment of his businesses.

His companies are also notorious for abusing his people, making them work excessive hours under incredible stress to get things done. His hype and PR work, people want to work for those companies, but I do wonder if it's sustainable in the long run.

These type of funds invest in a mix of domestic and international index funds and readjust as you get older and your risk tolerance changes, etc.

04/04/2021,stocks,"I'm a newb but I've thought about it and nobody's replying so here's some thoughts (that are CERTAINLY not financial advice). 

It's no secret viac lost a bunch of its price due to reasons unrelated to the company. That *can* mean it's time to buy, but it can also mean its price was artificially high in the first place. A smart thing to do might be to analyze it at its current price pretending the sell off didn't happen, then factor in extra uncertainty because of emotions around the sell off. Some quick look at fundamentals looks to me like its current price isn't currently crazy compared to similar companies. Mind you my eye is not practiced at this, so if you've done your own analysis that disagrees, then trust yourself. So I'm not looking to buy off fundamentals.

The question is whether the uncertainty is attractive to you. If you have some cash that's most valuable to you gambled, viac looks way safer and smarter than something like btc or GME since it's still somewhat tied to company value and is likely to stay that way. You'll want to already be someone who watches their stocks, and you'll want to know whether you're a long holder who likes the company to see decent correction over the next few years (therefore watching for a bounce to sell and reenter, but not caring if it dips further short term), or a swing trader (therefore hoping to sell a bounce even if it's not that big, and planning to cut losses if it slips further instead). That is, go in with a plan, then follow your plan.

I have risks I'm more interested in, so I'm not buying, but it was interesting enough that I looked at it. I'd expect most investors are better off looking for something less weird, but there are worse bets for a swing."

Acorns is very simple since it can create a portfolio for you but it probably won’t pay off with just $650 since there is a monthly fee that you would need to outperform.  Otherwise TD Ameritrade is probably the best vanilla choice.

(Above all do not use Robinhood btw)

Edit: I’m not advising against robinhood because of the GME drama I’m advising against it because it is terrible for new investors.  Their income relies entirely on people trading so they try to incentivize people to make emotional short term mistakes.  They easily allow people to take out margin loans the day they start investing, they make technical info much more accessible then fundamental and they put emphasis on very volatile markets such as crypto and marijuana."

04/04/2021,stocks,"I interviewed at a company. Didnt get the job. But the vp said 'We NEVER miss our goals, so don't worry about getting your bonus.' So I bought their stock. It was $50 at the time. About $180 now."

04/04/2021,stocks,"If you're telling me about it on Reddit then the semen is already priced in, I'll give this one a pass and look for other opportunities to get a good deal on semen."
04/04/2021,stocks,"OP says ""first of all"" in two separate paragraphs."
04/04/2021,stocks,"I agree. The company itself is actually very solid. The technology could be very transformative for many businesses, but It's definitely a long term play, like 3-5 years. But as of now it's current stock price is overvalued by quite a bit."
04/04/2021,stocks,PLTR is a longer term play if you have conviction in it. Look at 3-5 years. But for now it's definitely over valued. Bunch of people trying to pump it again to try and get out off it's ATH from February.
04/04/2021,stocks,"To like $45? Yeah... That's not going to happen this year.

I'll be happy with the 30% CAGR in betting it'll pay off. If it gets back to $30 by EOY, I'll be thrilled."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Uh huh.  Lotta people believe that.  TA is astrology for stocks and gets you no closer than throwing the dice.  But do what you like.

Wall Street bets on fundamentals and/or statistical arb.  I've worked on Wall St. for 8 years..."
04/04/2021,stocks,"I don't have to believe, I see it works for me so I'm happy. If it's not working for you, I doubt you are on wall street... You would lose all your clients money :)"
04/04/2021,stocks,"Your doubt is as misplaced as your trust in stock astrology.  But hey, do what you want."
04/04/2021,stocks,I always do. :)
04/04/2021,stocks,Cool
04/04/2021,stocks,"Google. It will probably be $5000 per share in 2025.  If it splits even better.  
It’s pretty crash proof as well when it comes to the more techy stocks."
04/04/2021,stocks,GME is life
04/04/2021,stocks,"Exactly it is what investing discussion is all about!

AITX has come up a lot :)

What about it stood out to you?"
04/04/2021,stocks,"Bingo, plus the movement is away from allowing deadly force to be in the hands of people that often have soo many issues."
04/04/2021,stocks,Lol never
04/04/2021,stocks,"The way Amazon warehouses work, unsold inventory is no issue unless the space is needed for something else. But if the warehouse is nearly full they build another where it can do the most good.

This could allow them to avoid some of that, and take advantage of the million acres of dirt-cheap retail space that's been freed up by retailers going out of business because of Amazon.

But anything Amazon can't sell online will probably be too old and busted to move in a storefront, too.

Or maybe they're anticipating the demise of Best Buy, which is Amazon's best showroom..."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Incredible Universe used to do this for large items.

Ikea sort of works this way, but you have to do your own warehouse picking."
04/04/2021,stocks,From my personal experience there. Yes. I do think so. Illumina doesn’t have the expertise with regards to clinical products - and with the exception of a couple of software acquisitions - Illumina has not done a good job recently in integrating acquisitions into the company smoothly. I wouldn’t be surprised if the Grail deal does go through - there will be massive politics and chaos with the integration efforts.
04/04/2021,stocks,"Actually no, I flipped the coin 22 times and came out ahead 22 times. But I am not flipping coins, but selecting stocks based on value and research. The question is is it possible, and if yes when is proof of concept. I believe if i can continue after 3 months proof of concept will be delivered."
04/04/2021,stocks,"I understand you, and to be fair, thats my main strategy for long term growth in what I call my retirement fund. 

This is more an intellectual exercise but with real money and consequences. I believe its easier to find stocks that will grow 1-2% in a few days than 25%ers on a consistant basis. And rather than pumping fresh funds into this, compound it and see where it takes me. 

I think the 1st month is relatively easy, and doable, the real proof will come in 3 months and on, as the compounding begins to take effect. 

As some have pointed out, in the first year you are not making that much, as far as an hourly wage is concerned when starting with 300, but by year 3 or 4, you are laughing. The trick is, as far as I see it, having the discipline and patience to stick with 1%, compounding, and staying the tortoise course rather than the hare. 

Ask yourself how many of the stocks that you thought were 25%ers, turned out to be 5%ers and after a couple of days started going south? Had you cashed out after 1%, and reinvested, where would you be? 

Having said all that, it only works with commission free trades, and in my opinion only with buying the underlying asset. I don’t short, option is not available on our platform in EU. We only have CFD, (contract for difference) and I personally don’t like betting against companies. I realise it may sound silly, but I prefer waiting a correction out and starting again, but having said that, even in a downturn there are stocks and etfs that go up when the majority goes down."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Look man, I dont know what to tell you. 22 days is nothing in the stock market, I'm not surprised at all you got better than 22% return in that time, what's uncommon is maintaining that over years because if you can't then what's the point. You came asking this sub if it was possible, got a resounding ""no"" and said ""hmm they must be the ones who are wrong"" if you weren't going to listen why'd you even ask?"
04/04/2021,stocks,"I wasn’t asking if it works, I was asking if I was overlooking something, such as regulatory issues, trading with unsettled funds, those aspects. That’s pretty clearly stated in my post. I was answering your comments because you took the time to answer, something that I appreciate."
04/04/2021,stocks,"It sure is. The OP didn’t mention why he thought he would be paying more taxes AFTER he retires but it’s sure possible. 

I, for one, would like to be cursed by larger tax bill in retirement than I’m paying now. Unfortunately, I’ll be like most and my income will drop in retirement and therefore my taxes will go down.

My example was simple but practical enough to show that it’s possible for a Roth to sometimes have disadvantages. Are you really arguing the Roth’s are superior for all situations and has no disadvantages in any case?"
04/04/2021,stocks,"XIV.

Never trust an investment bank."
04/04/2021,stocks,"yeah...bloody hands. it's always tough in the moment...averaging down is so difficult. you never know how low it will go though, so hard to judge"
04/04/2021,stocks,"oh yeah FOMO is rough. you got to control it and give your head a shake. if it is FOMO due to a sale i made...then the stock goes way up... i try to imagine myself if i were just first getting into the position. i ask myself what would i do in that case?  that way it erases all sunk costs that mess with your head.  

& interesting. glad the waiting thing works for you. i recently read a good article on emotions from the Wealthy Barber. it said the waiting strategy is not effective for most people because, if a stock continues to go down or up while you wait, it componds the emotion you feel.

04/04/2021,stocks,i like the first one. Warren Buffet just reads most days. Also heard the same thing from Mark Yusko on a good Real Vision interview. https://youtu.be/Dmg1V4KzKn4
04/04/2021,stocks,good luck! knowledge is king. i need to read more thick books too.
04/04/2021,stocks,catching knives is too hard for me
04/04/2021,stocks,"thanks for being honest. you will recover. it will be ok. we all make mistakes...who knows, maybe in the long run it will be a good move? it's what you learn about it that matters. Soros said the only reason he is rich is because he learned to correct his mistakes faster than everyone else."
04/04/2021,stocks,i think lucid will do well
04/04/2021,stocks,"oh, that must've been painful. sorry to hear . I'm glad you recovered. never trust them because it got shut down?"
04/04/2021,stocks,"for me, i was obsessed with the idea of avoiding drawdowns. i have learned that it's really not possible to do this."
04/04/2021,stocks,anything before 11am is pointless IMO...i generally just have a rule... EOD trades only. then i don't regret anything...but obviously I'm not a day trader
04/04/2021,stocks,"i thought of a strategy recently...like i will close my eyes and imagine what it would feel like for that stock to go down 30, 40, 50%. Would i still hold? If i feel any churning in my stomach, then i don't have enough conviction, and it's not a good idea. just a thought...haven't tried it yet. but trying to preemptively get in touch with my emotions to give the stock a virtual test run."
04/04/2021,stocks,do you know of Brent Osachoff of Volatility Trading Strategies?
04/04/2021,stocks,LOL...I was thinking the same thing. this is so boring! then a few holdings i had lost 30% and my portfolio lost 15. always got to be on your toes...but don't necessarily need to be making moves.
04/04/2021,stocks,"10 is too much for me. 5-7 holdings tops for me! imo there is no way a single human can manage more than 10 effectively.  buffett says 2 or 3 (ok it'sa bit extremei agree)...because 'why waste time on your 57th best idea?"""
04/04/2021,stocks,"let's be supportive, not condescending. the point of the thread is to admit our mistakes and learn from others' , not point them out. i am sure they are already quite aware what they should or shouldnt have done. we're all human . it's easy for you to point out someone elses mistake in hindsight."
04/04/2021,stocks,"I’m mostly Google and Game stop. I’m doing decent for a newbie. Not saying GameStop isn’t volatile, but it’s been pretty steady for a week now."
04/04/2021,stocks,AMC is a killer right now.  GameStop is solid though.
04/04/2021,stocks,Google is a buy as well. It will be $5000 a share in 4 years.
04/04/2021,stocks,Definitely going to buy more Microsoft
04/04/2021,stocks,"Dr Burry think so, as do many others."
04/04/2021,stocks,I do Google instead but not a bad way to go. Better then a savings account 🤷‍♂️
04/04/2021,stocks,"Rn I'm 50%BB and 50% GME not counting my retirement VOO fund. If all this stuff about GME is true, I'm gonna be able to retire by 40."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Past 2 months, right when I started my portfolio. I’ve survived and I’m up a couple grand, so maybe I’m decent at this. Baptism by fire."
04/04/2021,stocks,I’m Canadian and my portfolio is 90 % American
04/04/2021,stocks,Blackberry is awful. Thank god I only have 20 shares.
04/04/2021,stocks,I invested everything into the market. Money in a savings account does nothing. You just can’t be stupid and FOMO
04/04/2021,stocks,Seems like way more peasants are joining the fray as well. Stocks are going mainstream.
04/04/2021,stocks,"Your funny. When I heard what was in the ETF I was like,  this was made for smoother brains then raw chicken."
04/04/2021,stocks,That makes sense to me - probably the over all market would be easier for AI to track than individual companies.

04/04/2021,stocks,If we’re talking income per capita & consumer spending... it’s Chile and/or Uruguay
04/04/2021,stocks,"More men are employed in construction, that observation is not sexist because it’s a fact.  You could look at why and deduce many things, I deduce that men without formal education and lack of opportunity are relegated to dangerous jobs (true for women as well, though the jobs are different)

Men and women often have different interests, this has nothing to do with your implications that men use AliEx because they “research” and browse “Reddit.”  I would counter that with the multiple fashion-oriented subreddits dedicated to vetting AliExpress vendors."
04/04/2021,stocks,"No men go into construction because they are physically stronger and can do the job. Also men have more confidence that they can handle dangerous things than wimen. This confidence is also why they end up in more traffic accidents etc because confidence is not enough. :)

Testeron drives all this. It makes me feel scared that we today in 2021 think it's politically incorrect to have two different genders that are different. Or think there are 10 genders because someone identifies with being a bookshelf."
04/04/2021,stocks,"I don’t care for discussions of gender (especially in a stocks subreddit) beyond pointing out sexist comments.  Sweeping generalizations like “men have more confidence than women with dangerous things” is offensive to both genders.  Generalizations like “women use Wish because they’re afraid of Chinese things” is mostly bizarre, but offensive as well.

FYI You should do more research on the job of “construction.”  It’s a lot more than lifting bags of concrete around or whatever “manual labor is for men” argument you’re putting forth.   

Good luck on your quest for information."
04/04/2021,stocks,"I don't think its offensive at all but let's not discuss it anymore, fine."
04/04/2021,stocks,Both TSLA and NIO reporting triple-digit yoy unit increases and beating predictions says that EV is moving faster than anyone expected.
04/04/2021,stocks,"Glad you started this thread to get a more neutral opinion. I sometimes also wonder about 'positive shills', such as:

Would whales know more and try to initiate the squeeze? Set the selling minimum for retail way too high so they get out in time with the max profit? I mean, it is pretty easy if you promise everyone a million dollars.And some of the emotional stories by fairly new members, perhaps trying to make people hold longer for the greater good?It could be we're all being set up too. Even the fake news stories could be planted to push people in the reverse direction. ""shorts have covered"" -> GME: ""shorts haven't covered""

It just isn't likely that only the short side would spread news on the sub. Everyone on wallstreet has an agenda.

I am still in though, let's see where it goes, but like you, I don't want to blindly follow the mass to the moass.  


EDIT: formatting"
04/04/2021,stocks,"By the way, I suggest you cross post this over to wallstreetbets if you want a little more traffic and exposure. Have not seen anything posted over there on PSFE, which is shocking considering it has all the hallmarks of a great tech play with meme potential. Would love to see it start to get a little more mainstream traction! Those guys over there are idiots, but I’ll be damned if they don’t do a good job spreading the word out."
04/04/2021,stocks,Nevermind it just went through lol
04/04/2021,stocks,There were a lot of reports of brokers suddenly changing margin requirements without prior notice (25% to 100%) which forced people to sell.
04/04/2021,stocks,Nice! Just saw it.
04/04/2021,stocks,"I'm not anticipating a sell off based on recent signals:  Eli Nagler, a Senior Managing Director at Blackstone, just said:  “Today is a significant milestone for Paysafe and a testament to the  excellent work of their world-class management team over several years.  We believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward  to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a  public company.” Regarding Blackstone and CVC, who now have four senior  managing directors on Paysafe’s Board, Foley said, “They rolled a  significant amount of their investment which is a confidence builder.  They didn’t take all their money off the table… All of these things put  together really created the confidence among the investor base to invest  in the PIPE and then support the stock.” Also, the PIPE investors are  primarily insurance companies known for long term hold strategies and  they are closely associated with Bill Foley. As Foley recently said,  “Having a large PIPE basically validates the transaction.… The companies  that I’m affiliated with actually invested roughly a billion dollars in  the PIPE and forward purchase agreements so Paysafe was always a really  protected asset, besides the fact that it’s a great asset.”"
04/04/2021,stocks,"Their profit isn't actually that big. They paid $3.9B in 2017 and or now getting around $5.5B in cash and shares.  It's something like a 45% gain over 4 years even though they've spent a billion in M&A and nearly doubled revenue in that time.  From recent quotes, I'm inclined to believe that they'll want to see what the ""Foley network"" can do to share value."
04/04/2021,stocks,"Meh, I’m still very bullish on BB. Price target $150+ within 2-5years as a long term value play. 

I work as a junior equity research analyst for a hedge fund and I value public company stocks all day, sometimes it’s the companies that no one believe in are the ones that become the most successful, asides from tech since EV’s are paving way to the future so easy money go be made even as a basic-intermediate level investor within that industry/sector. 

BB has survived even during its worst times and that says a lot for those who understand. 

It’s not revenue that should be the main interest it’s the ability to build a sustainable competitive advantage among competitors relative to Porters five and withstand upcoming political economic and social catalysts that affects the market, the economy and most importantly your investments.

having said that to each their own."

04/04/2021,stocks,Is there any way to see whose money he lost? Curious as to why people would trust him with their money considering his shady past
04/04/2021,stocks,"He ran a family office so probably not. Those are the most opaque investment vehicles. And to give some relative perspective hedge funds are more opaque than family offices. When you say curious on why people trusted him with their money you have to consider the fact that he was leveraged which meant he was ""gambling"" with more than what he had."
04/04/2021,stocks,"thanks. so, after the merger will the ticker change name? form TPGY to something else ?"
04/04/2021,stocks,I think it will change to EVB

04/04/2021,stocks,Yes
04/04/2021,stocks,Thanks 🙏
04/04/2021,stocks,"Your series of replies directly contract how the system actually works, and is entirely full of errors and misinformation, and jumps to stupid conclusions about a short squeeze.

The holder of record is the one who has voting rights. If the shares have been loaned, such as if the owner has a margin account, or if the broker is maintaining transactions “in-house”, then the individual investor may not be the holder of record.

The notice the OP has mentioned is a public press release from a third party and not addressed to them.

Just because in your years of trading you have not experienced something does not give you the right to literally fabricate reality.

You should be careful when misrepresenting while presenting investing advice.

“If somebody believes they should be the holder of record for shares in their account they should contact their broker.” -how hard was that?"
04/04/2021,stocks,"contact your broker and say what? I want a certificate for my shares? they'd laugh at you, the fact you can see the shares on your account is proof you're a shareholder, you can vote - your 10 shares on whatever meme stocks you're on is miniscule and won't sway any vote.

you want a paper certificate that says you own the stock on your account? lmao, they stopped doing that in the 80s sport.

where's the misinformation or misleading?"
04/04/2021,stocks,Go Google holder of record and educate yourself.
