2021-06-13 19:22:05,wallstreetbets,I'll bag the dip
2021-06-13 19:25:08,wallstreetbets,Reading now! Thanks for updating
2021-06-13 19:16:02,wallstreetbets,I’ll be waiting for dips

2021-06-13 19:24:31,wallstreetbets,Your wife hedge against inflation with this gold covered D
2021-06-13 19:58:09,wallstreetbets,Solid play I think gold hits $2400 this looks nice.
2021-06-13 19:50:54,wallstreetbets,"You want an even better hedge? 

You should ask the sock puppet."
2021-06-13 19:42:45,wallstreetbets,Haha!
2021-06-13 19:34:58,wallstreetbets,"Long term crsr has more room to grow. Academy has to plop stores for serious growth, crsr has to do nothing but increase its supply line capabilities"
2021-06-13 19:08:25,wallstreetbets,CRSR baby!
2021-06-13 19:26:34,wallstreetbets,ASO to the moon. 🚀 ..continues.
2021-06-13 19:35:01,wallstreetbets,I don’t like that the CEO is selling shares in crsr…. Might just be my paranoia….
2021-06-13 19:04:34,wallstreetbets,"When AMC and GME are done ill think about ASO, or maybe buy a lambo.  Hell I might be working the dumpster behind Wendy's to fuel my stonk addiction."
2021-06-13 19:42:25,wallstreetbets,I feel you on this. For me it would have to be short term calls or LEAPS because I do see long term potential. But there will be price suppression for much of 2021 unfortunately preventing it from taking off just yet
2021-06-13 19:43:48,wallstreetbets,I was not aware of this. This combined with the eagle tree liquidation is not great news
2021-06-13 19:14:09,wallstreetbets,"Pay attention OP...WHEN GME AND AMC ARE DONE, WE WILL THINK ABOUT THIS SHIT...go tell that to shitadel too 😂😂"
2021-06-13 19:55:56,wallstreetbets,"Aye, I wouldnt buy leaps either tbh. Short term calls for wsb hype or shares for long term. It can trade higher than this, but I don't expect 50 a share this year as a resting place.

Beyond it being underpriced, it also holds iv really well. CCs are a cash cow on crsr"
2021-06-13 19:47:57,wallstreetbets,"He sold 63.5k shares on 6-3-21 @ $35 a share.

The COO also exercised 100k shares in options and sold them the same day at the same price."
2021-06-13 19:15:40,wallstreetbets,Bruh CRSR is number 1 in mentions this weekend lol GME is 6th
2021-06-13 19:33:03,wallstreetbets,How are you tracking this?
2021-06-13 19:37:38,wallstreetbets,"I love gme but its not worth 200 yet. Will be one day, but it'll probably come way down first.

And amc...dumpster fire going to 5 before eoy lol

Bought crsr for a similar reason to why I bought gme last year. Undervalued with tons of upside.

Oh, and the eagletree requirement is apparently not true, though given the type of fund they are, they are likely to continue to liquidate"
2021-06-13 19:46:53,wallstreetbets,"I have seen conflicting information about whether it’s true, but did confirm that they have sold positions throughout 2021 so I figured it was true. Regardless, seems like their selling is going to keep suppressing the price"
2021-06-13 19:51:11,wallstreetbets,"It probably will, but as insiders I believe they have to pre schedule sales, so they can't just dump first thing Monday. Also, they don't want to suppress the price, they are better off if it goes back into an uptrend as well.

And ultimately, them selling doesn't make the company any less valuable. Long term the stocks growth prospects are just as good either way"
2021-06-13 18:25:02,wallstreetbets,$0.35 reserved for the dip.
2021-06-13 18:22:26,wallstreetbets,will it cover your tuition? Hopefully take a load off that student debt
2021-06-13 18:39:46,wallstreetbets,Congrats
2021-06-13 18:39:08,wallstreetbets,Nice work man! What stocks have been some of your best pickups? Looks like IDEX has paid off well for sure!
2021-06-13 19:38:39,wallstreetbets,Not adjusted for inflation that is abouy how much I spent on college.
2021-06-13 18:34:19,wallstreetbets,That money gained from your OnlyFans account or you some rich kid playing with your mom's boyfriends money?
2021-06-13 19:50:35,wallstreetbets,You’re a fucking beast!!! Make sure u keep it all! Good luck!

2021-06-13 18:44:24,wallstreetbets,LFG! Congrats!
2021-06-13 19:50:51,wallstreetbets,Been there done that. This is the moment you take gains & run to next genius idea before profit turns to loss. GodSpeed Sir
2021-06-13 19:05:48,wallstreetbets,19 yo with that kind of money? Mom and dad spoon feeds you?

2021-06-13 18:22:15,wallstreetbets,What are your investments?
2021-06-13 18:27:44,wallstreetbets,You are correct 🤣
2021-06-13 18:28:31,wallstreetbets,The only load he is taking off are the guys that go to his dumpster behind the Wendy's
2021-06-13 18:27:21,wallstreetbets,"This will cover my tuition for about a year and a half, but I’m not stopping here🚀"
2021-06-13 18:42:59,wallstreetbets,"I originally turned 11k into 36 with the help of FCEL, from there I traded Tesla a bit along with some other energy stocks now I’ve decided to jump completely into IDEX"
2021-06-13 19:29:59,wallstreetbets,"Looks like he started w 10k, pretty good job, college is 70k a year tho so keep up the good work!"
2021-06-13 18:35:25,wallstreetbets,Money gained from working throughout highschool. Sadly only fans didn’t come out til later but that would be a good part time gig tho
2021-06-13 19:17:40,wallstreetbets,I truly believe within the next 3 months we could see the $6-7 range and EOY roughly $10-12
2021-06-13 19:08:16,wallstreetbets,Read the thread m8 I worked at a golf course on weekdays and as a soccer referee on weekends all throughout highschool
2021-06-13 18:26:37,wallstreetbets,Scroll to the right and you will see that I am in 100% on IDEX😂
2021-06-13 18:45:44,wallstreetbets,Lol fuck fuel cell me and my buddy bought a shot ton of stock at like .30 give or take held tight for a year or so we both sell andddddddd.
2021-06-13 18:45:34,wallstreetbets,Nice plays man! Keep up the good work
2021-06-13 18:36:06,wallstreetbets,Best of luck to you.
2021-06-13 19:01:48,wallstreetbets,"dang, what’d you work as in HS?"
2021-06-13 19:20:38,wallstreetbets,Well I hope you’re right. I was thinking $5-7 end of year but really IDEX all it needs is a good piece of news to run along with decent market momentum. It did so back in January with ok/decent PRs. Average at 2.62
2021-06-13 19:23:57,wallstreetbets,"All right, I take it back, Sorry m8."
2021-06-13 18:52:03,wallstreetbets,Man that’s tough I’m sorry for your loss😔
2021-06-13 19:04:42,wallstreetbets,I was a youth soccer referee for the weekends and also worked at a golf course on the weekdays
2021-06-13 19:22:22,wallstreetbets,That’s the exact reason I think it will hit the $10-12 range all we need is one good solid piece of PR
2021-06-13 19:28:21,wallstreetbets,No worries my guy
2021-06-13 18:54:29,wallstreetbets,Did the same thing with riot as well but bought that at like 1.80sold when it was below a dollar
2021-06-13 18:58:35,wallstreetbets,"Damn I’m sorry to hear that, trust me and buy IDEX, not only are they producing wireless electric charging panels but are also set to have 6 EV vehicles set to release sometime within the very near future"
2021-06-13 19:00:02,wallstreetbets,I'll throw some in seen in topics here for quite a few months now.
2021-06-13 19:01:59,wallstreetbets,Sounds good my friend
2021-06-13 19:49:51,wallstreetbets,Man this scene both in the book and movie made me cry... still gives me goosebumps.

2021-06-13 18:24:17,wallstreetbets,Very nice DD and you're a confident man OP I love it. Hope CLNE brings that good week. I am too excited.
2021-06-13 17:58:13,wallstreetbets,CLNE turns 🐄💨 into tendies.
2021-06-13 18:30:08,wallstreetbets,"I like it. I personally think that you should sell the calls for what you get rather than expiring. I assume that you won't let them expire if it's at 24.50 instead of $25 on Friday. That being said I think my personal attitude is that this is a play that has a huge upside in the short term (this upcoming week) and a huge potential for long term. To me, it's a no brainer. If you are worried about the gamma squeeze then buy stocks instead of options. This companies long term prospects are nowhere but higher and so even if the week doesn't go as we plan, you aren't going to lose money on a play on CLNE."
2021-06-13 19:22:39,wallstreetbets,"CLNE bullish, I like the stock!"
2021-06-13 17:58:37,wallstreetbets,Where are your green crayons?
2021-06-13 18:55:30,wallstreetbets,I’m in with 16 shares
2021-06-13 18:06:23,wallstreetbets,Nice DD. I have seen price targets ranging from $17 to $41. All have one thing in common.....all targets show that CLNE is currently extremely cheap and has major upside 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 i
2021-06-13 19:10:42,wallstreetbets,CLNE 🐮 MOOOO NDAY SET TO KICK OFF

2021-06-13 19:32:51,wallstreetbets,In at 13.81. Would love to see it hit like... $16. :D   (Old fashioned smiley right there)
2021-06-13 18:51:02,wallstreetbets,"The use of a 10% discount rate on the DCF is realllly low.  I know we like it here, but this is a risky growth company with a *very* small revenue number, you're not even projecting them to break 500 until 2024.  Even the cash flow projections are next to nothing in the grand scheme of things.  I'd bump that up by at least 125 bps"

2021-06-13 18:48:03,wallstreetbets,"The US produces 32,914,647,000 MMcf of natural gas. What percentage does CLNE produce with Renewables?"
2021-06-13 19:59:08,wallstreetbets,"Amazon receives warrants for 53.14 million shares of CLNE common stock at an exercise price of $13.49/share. Those warrants become available to Amazon at set intervals as Amazon moves towards its commitment in the agreement to purchase $500M in fuel from CLNE.  Also, Jeff Bezos had to agree to be locked in a giant, sealed hamster ball with 3 cows that have each been fed a #4 from Taco Bell and a 6 pack of Milwaukee's Best.  This will be shown via pay-per-view- please contact your local cable provider.

13.28 million of the warrant shares are immediately available to Amazon.  Amazon will have incentive to exercise these warrants the higher the share price rises over $13.49.

These warrants will essentially act as a dilution when exercised by Amazon.  However, CLNE stands to gain the $500M in revenue plus $716.86M from the warrant shares over the life of this agreement.  Amazon has until 04/16/31 to exercise the warrants.  Once/if fully executed, Amazon would own 19.99% of CLNE common shares."

2021-06-13 17:35:43,wallstreetbets,"""What do you call an investment that costs you $58m per year?

A shitty investment""

-GM probably

In response to ""anyone can see."" If you want to play it for a short squeeze, sure I'm down. But as an investment, a company that is barely able to produce any product and definitely can't make money is a bad investment."
2021-06-13 18:50:39,wallstreetbets,"What does workhorse offer?!  They can barely put together 7 trucks a quarter..  and you think that is worth 10 billion?! Lol!!   When Elon wanted trucks he didn’t buy out Ford.  Why the hell would he want a poorly ran company that can’t even produce delivery trucks?  This seriously made me laugh out loud.  I can’t believe how many workhorse fanatics their are. The company is a joke.   They can’t produce, but always seem to come up with excuses."
2021-06-13 17:23:03,wallstreetbets,I was getting lots of positive comments and someone I’m guessing a short had it removed they are worried for sure
2021-06-13 18:19:50,wallstreetbets,Workhorse is the XRP of stocks. Zero anything important. Somehow has a following
2021-06-13 18:31:19,wallstreetbets,So they’ve got a drone? Do they have electric trucks too?
2021-06-13 17:33:09,wallstreetbets,"You realize brightdrop is GM right ?  And nothing WKHS owns would be of any value to Tesla. He's clearly not interested in delivery vans. Its a very small niche market, low volume, and low profits."
2021-06-13 17:47:15,wallstreetbets,Workhorse is going nowhere.
2021-06-13 18:28:20,wallstreetbets,This company is trash.

2021-06-13 18:27:58,wallstreetbets,There will be all kinds of mergers in the EV world in the coming years. A lot of big winners and a lot of big losers too. WKHS is postioned well because they have a lead amongst everyone currently.

2021-06-13 17:34:16,wallstreetbets,I divorced the bipolar bitch I was married to and married bipolar stock to replace her. You can have her (disclaimer she will steal your money but is great in bed) but you have to buy WKHS at face value and anything under $100 is a steal.
2021-06-13 18:31:44,wallstreetbets,You should see their exec team. A bunch of old gray haired ex GM people. And now their spin off has an old GM plant. Hmmm
2021-06-13 17:45:49,wallstreetbets,“Can’t make money” guess you forgot about the small 325 million dollar buy order from Pride group for WKHS trucks.
2021-06-13 18:52:09,wallstreetbets,They put 36 together in April and will be up to ten a day in the coming weeks. The problem was with the battery supply chain and we have now have the same supplier Tesla uses which is the best in breed in the industry.
2021-06-13 18:53:16,wallstreetbets,I was invested in workhorse hoping they would get the USPS deal and scale up and partner with Ride to mass produce trucks. Without a major factory producing truck body’s in mass they will only be a 10-15 truck a quarter company.

Have 3 size of trucks. 450 cf, 650 cf, and 1000 cf. They are looking to bring the the first refrigrated EV to market soon and Sysco (huge pockets) are rumored to be the player who wants them. Would be a bigger deal than USPS. Should hear about that offering by EOY."
2021-06-13 18:17:45,wallstreetbets,"Delivery and logistics is the opposite of a low volume, niche market. I will grant the margins probably aren't great though."

I am long Workhorse and they nearly sent me to finincial ruin naked shorting the company because I've been all in since late March so if you think I am rooting for the hedges you are insane.

2021-06-13 17:50:02,wallstreetbets,"I can read their financial statements, either that's pay on delivery (which they currently can't do because they can't ramp up production) or they got the money and still couldn't turn a profit.

Like I said, if you want to try to scalp the stock fine. If you (or TSLA or GM as OP states) want to INVEST in the company, you should probably wait until the CEO at least pretends that they won't need some form of dilution to raise capital to cover expenses"
2021-06-13 17:59:49,wallstreetbets,Get out of here intern
2021-06-13 19:00:15,wallstreetbets,"Their last conference call they announced they assembled 36 at Union City in April. That plant has capacity for 60k vehicles itself.

Not only that, they have signed a deal with a subsidary of Morgan Olson who wants to purchase chassis and assemble bodies themselves. That is a pretty big deal going forward as Olson is a major league player in the truck market and also has ties to USPS."
2021-06-13 18:16:06,wallstreetbets,It's super annoying because people whine about it constantly on WKHS and then you find out what they actually tried to post... quality DD doesn't get deleted.

2021-06-13 18:06:09,wallstreetbets,I wouldn't go long on this company until the scalp is over.  To be honest I'm 280 shares on this pump and dump but only so I can take the profits and buy more F
2021-06-13 18:23:24,wallstreetbets,"Where? I only see 3 recent posts to WSB from you. 2 were links to tweets, and one was a Meme post that was actually just a link to a text post on the WKHS subreddit."
2021-06-13 18:23:35,wallstreetbets,No you stay long and you get rich. Stocks go up. Stocks go down. This is a huge growth play and $15 is a great entry IMO.
2021-06-13 18:44:00,wallstreetbets,"Think of this MotorboatingBoobies.... The company was $150 million market cap when I invested in them and were a finalist in the USPS deal worth $8 bilion. That is doing more with less and that they got that far should tell you this company not only has a great product but also going places.

USPS isn't dead just yet either. A lot happening behind the scenes but what is nice is that the negative catalyst is out of the way now and why a $15 entry is a good place tos tart."
2021-06-13 18:18:36,wallstreetbets,"My bought Reddit account? Are you insanse? Look at my twitter handle with the same name @ clevelandleader or my stocktwits page @ baberuthhomerun who has been pimping workhorse and RIDE for months on end.

2021-06-13 19:14:49,wallstreetbets,"Lordstown Motors is more or less a call option for the company. They own a 10% stake in the company and will earn commisions on the first 200k Endurances that sell. The Endurance was the Workhorse W-15 and LMC spun off from Workhorse to try to bring that market with the help of GM.

I believe that LMC probably had banked on the USPS deal (they would have built the chassis at that plant) and now under the eight ball because it fell through. 

I do think LMC will find funding and things will proceed but worst case scenrio is that we still own the skateboard and could sell that to any other party. LMC is no risk high reward for WKHS going forward."
2021-06-13 18:30:22,wallstreetbets,"I upvote all the time on here and the subreddit WKHS. I really was a lurker on WSB for some time (long before it became mainstream) but now that my horse is in the spotlight I decided to check in and do some education. 

Believe me ... the hedgies have done no favors to this company. I was in under $3 and the short interest was insane even then. They wanted them to fail but their product is too good not get ahead and now they are primed for take off because they were overshorted. Pure capitalsm and I love it."

2021-06-13 18:41:46,wallstreetbets,"I honestly don't know how reddit works but I had this account when I ran a very large news website of the same name, hence, the twitter handle. Named after a defunct Cleveland Newspaper. We once had an alexa ranking in the top 30k most visited sites at the peak. I used the Cleveland reddit to drive traffic to stories.

I see a lot of karma on my end but again, hadn't really used this account for a long while. Someone sent me some reddit gold or something. What exactly can I do with that?"

2021-06-13 17:06:48,wallstreetbets,"40% owned by insiders 

70% owned by institutions

Wtf type math are you doing?"
2021-06-13 17:21:54,wallstreetbets,The only WWE show you’ll see is me pounding your wife with my PP
2021-06-13 17:42:25,wallstreetbets,"Although unusual it is not uncommon for insiders and funds to own more than 100 % of the outstanding.  You have to realize that the short % adds to available shrs that can be owned by everyone.   Example, Start with 100 shrs borrow 20 and sell them to new owners and there are 120 shrs that can be owned.  But only 100 shrs get to vote.  

What is the short % of the outstanding now?  More importantly what was the SI on 3/31 in relation to the fund holdings? 
Short interest is 8.2 mil now, which is 18.2% of the outstanding.  It had to be higher as of  3/31.  The McCahn’s shares are all Class B shrs and not counted in the 45 mil outstanding.  See the DEF14A SEC filing the rest of the insiders own about 175K shrs or 0.4 %.  See table on page 36. 

Anyway Outstanding+ Short = Funds + Retail + Insiders

45 mil + short # as of 3/31 = Funds 53.9 mil as of 3/31 + retail on 3/31 + 175K insiders

Someone needs to find the 3/31 short interest at Ortex or wherever to make this comparison 

Back in 2009 a lot of the homebuilder stocks had funds holdings greater than 100%, it wasn’t uncommon at all.  TOL, KBH, LEN if I recall all would typically have 105% fund ownership, 20 or 25 % short leaving 15% or 20% for retail"

2021-06-13 17:57:10,wallstreetbets,"Well done and thanks for sharing. Quick questions given I haven't looked at your code: the sample is determined by looking at only those stocks that have been mentioned in selected subs, is that correct? And I presume you end up with a longer list of stocks than what you have presented? Lastly, whilst we have an overall sentiment, how do we determine the volume of interest?

2021-06-13 18:13:26,wallstreetbets,You are extremely exposed with the number of shares you have.  Please consider selling half and putting it in to something safer.  I think you can get a pre 1965 quarter for around $4.
2021-06-13 16:49:26,wallstreetbets,My cnbc app says this stock is 119% owned by institutions. How can a stock be more than 100% owned?
2021-06-13 16:49:37,wallstreetbets,TWNK = sounds 🌈

2021-06-13 17:33:22,wallstreetbets,I don’t know what he just said but it sounds good!
2021-06-13 18:44:01,wallstreetbets,"TWNK has 116%. I don't get why these get reported as over 100%, so I don't read to much into the precise number. But it does give me a sense that there is high ownership, and a lot of it looks to be relatively passive. To me that is a signal that high volume might move it quiet a bit initially."
2021-06-13 17:08:28,wallstreetbets,"""CNBC says""

Should we tell him?"
2021-06-13 18:46:57,wallstreetbets,A 5% move over the past month is not much of a breakout.
2021-06-13 17:08:57,wallstreetbets,"These are rough numbers, used as an example...

&#x200B;

AMC is now \~50. If you buy a call option at like 85, the cost is \~5. So AMC doubles to 100, then how much do you make:

(100 - 85) / 5 = 3x

Ok. You triple your money if the thing doubles. (After AMC has already increased by 10x)

&#x200B;

TWNK has not even doubled once. You can by 30 strikes, and if it doubles to 33, then you would be getting 10x-20x. 

&#x200B;

So yeah, TWNK call options are more expensive than they were a week ago, but they still offer way better payout than anything that has actually run hard. If it pretty much impossible to get those kinds of returns from AMC, BB, CLNE, CLOV, GME...

&#x200B;

You make insane money on options by buying them BEFORE the stock explodes. And TWNK has definitely not exploded yet. 

Once the thing explodes the price for the options get jacked up enormously because everyone already realizes the price can get stupid.

&#x200B;

TWNK is in a great spot where there is buzz, but not widespread awareness."
2021-06-13 18:46:06,wallstreetbets,"I get high numbers of institutional ownership from TD and morningstar as well

2021-06-13 18:28:28,wallstreetbets,Twinks. Run HARD. Jacked up enormously. Widespread. And the Twink hasn't exploded yet? No clue about the stock but I'm pretty sure I'm gay after reading that🏳️‍🌈
2021-06-13 18:36:11,wallstreetbets,"I’ve never seen option price predictions done like this, is this right? It seems way too simple and straightforward lol. Wouldn’t you need to take greeks into consideration too?"
2021-06-13 17:34:12,wallstreetbets,Yea but why is twink gonna spike?
2021-06-13 18:42:14,wallstreetbets,I am not making a prediction. I don't know much about the greeks at all. I just calculate what the returns are to my calls if the stock moves a certain amount.

It is just a stupidly entertaining trade."
2021-06-13 19:06:06,wallstreetbets,"I’d recommend briefly looking into Delta and Theta before buying too many more options, especially for stocks that are getting more attention.  Options pricing (and therefore the gains you could get from it) isn’t as straightforward as it seems, and not understanding theta could cost you money even if the option ends up being ITM.  I just don’t wanna see an ape make the same mistake as me and lose money on something even if it was technically the correct bet."

2021-06-13 17:20:36,wallstreetbets,Agree. Clov is the best play. Huya is were it is because of Chinese risk.

2021-06-13 17:24:34,wallstreetbets,"After the Hyundai deal fell through and the impending lawsuits I'm not sure it's a great play. Speaking as a bag holder that bought in on the last pump.

2021-06-13 19:02:06,wallstreetbets,CRSR is one of a very few select stocks being mentioned here that I have full faith in. This literally can't go wrong! Good luck!
2021-06-13 16:43:14,wallstreetbets,I always think that shares are the play with corsair.. Also gotta support them. I will sell or exercise all my calls and just hold the shares for 8-12 months and see how high it will go.
2021-06-13 16:28:06,wallstreetbets,"Corsair is such a fucking good play

2021-06-13 16:14:54,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I’ve been eyeing Corsair calls too, will probably pick some up tomorrow at market open"
2021-06-13 17:12:39,wallstreetbets,Market makers- “How many times do we have to teach them this lesson?” As they smack it back down at $35. Let it trade for 200 days to get technical support points and then decide when this time is the time it makes it past $35.

2021-06-13 17:00:26,wallstreetbets,"Corsair…. this company comes around every few weeks or so. Let me just tell you from experience, shares are the play here. Your calls will be eaten by theta and any significant gains are never held longer than a day or two."

2021-06-13 16:26:10,wallstreetbets,I’m not sure yet. Generally I’d go for the risky yolo 2-week expiry but on Corsair I think it’s genuinely undervalued. So perhaps a leaps into 2022 or December 2021
2021-06-13 18:24:32,wallstreetbets,"Honestly if you don’t want to take any risks, just go for the 2023 calls. I’m sure you’ll make good money. The stock price is bound to go up. 2023 calls will make you more money than buying just shares."

**SPY 6/18 $320** calls are at the price of **104.20** which gives us a total value of:

#$1,042,000

No TA and no DD needed. Invest in a boring index **on a dip** and you can secure your retirement.

1.	⁠Every analyst projects CLNE to be higher than it is. While the consensus is around the 20’s some say as high as 40.

2.	⁠Absurd play happening, if it closes above $13 on 6/18 an enormous amount of shares are bought

3.	⁠Great company overall, IE not a bag, constantly focusing on growth and gaining all kinds of new contracts.

4.	⁠Amazon is contracted with them at ~$13. Amazon is not in the business of losing money.

5.	⁠Two down days after a monster rally is nothing. If that is enough to chase you out, i genuinely don’t understand how you have any money left.

6.	⁠CLNE getting more mainstream interest from Cramer, social media, etc."

2021-06-13 18:25:42,wallstreetbets,"Heres my bear case for the beginning of this week:

1- Netanhyu being ousted. This creates instability and thus will most likely cause Israeli money to be pulled from the markets thus resulting in a domino effect short term.

Now we must remember, the markets are a mass gathering of groups even if theyre in another country

2- G7 results 

Their talking about canning the entire industry to move towards clean energy. This includes Aviation, shipping, railroads etc. Now i know this is all talk but the crowds are finicky. Could be bearish for coal

3- Forced labor

Another thing that is horrible but affects finances. They want to disrupt the global supply chain of everything you get cheap(insert buy 🇺🇸)

Can be bearish for metals, industrial, tech, agricultural, solar, and garment sectors.

Im probably dead wrong and dont know what im talking about. But just my speculation. I know the fed keeps pumping but remember that the true price of any derivative is the most recent price.

Plus the fed and the witch. Just be careful and dont get impaled.

Could be bullish for memes etc as rotating back into where liquidity is- and retail is a good way to farm 💰"

The yield curve, XLF, boom and bust

The lowest point of a economic cycle is a inverted or flat yield curve, when the credit spreads are tight or negative between short end and long end of the yield curve and there is least incentive for banks to create money in the system through lending activity. This can be called the end of the late cycle and the beginning of the early cycle.

Once LT yields have reached a bottom, it begins to go up in anticipation of improving economic outlook. Yield begins to steepen and lending activity starts to pick up. The early cycle peaks when the yield curve is steepest and XLF is at all time. In this stage the economic outlook picks up and then peaks. No more upside surprises. The YC then peaks and starts flattening again. This marks the beginning of the mid cycle. When lending activity is still present in the economy, but it is falling. The YC peaks with the XLF. And as XLF rolls over, so does the market (usually!) since the moment calls for revision of the valuations broadly.

The middle cycle continues as long as the credit spreads in the YC is still decently positive. It ends when the YC is almost flat - marking the beginning of the late cycle.

Watch out for the XLF and the YC. If the YC and XLF has peaked, in traditional sense it might call for a correction. Not saying it has to happen, but it usually does. The correction from early cycle to mid cycle usually is ~ 15% to 20%.

These cycles used to happen over a longer period of time historically. But we live in an era of super fast business and financial cycles. Unnaturally so, because of Central Bank active intervention."

2021-06-13 18:42:06,wallstreetbets,"

1.) General sentiment is it's a positive.  


2.) Growth sectors.  FFs don't control the narrative nearly as much as they used to.  Texas power outage was a perfect example.
Green energy has a potential economic boom for growth and well paying jobs.  


3.) Global supply chain has been affected by a whole pandemic thing for 16 months. If anything, it will be improving & had time to adjust over the summer months. About the only area that is waning is businesses that relied on saturated labor markets (Fuck Greenspan on a sidenote) to underpay for shitty positions.  Otherwise, you didn't really detail a cogent point with respect to *forced labor*  

Summertime post pandemic is going to be flush with spending & ripe for new business entities. Think of it as a healthy pruning of old models and forced discovery of future ventures to unshackle old commerce that was entrenched.  

Green dildo summer is upon us, and this time bers hibernate over summer break. 

Go out to eat, go see a movie, fuck some strange while boozing at a bar, & get vaccinated...  or don't & be a terrorist to humanity & turn your back on George Washington & shit on the memory of our founding fathers!

2021-06-13 19:16:03,wallstreetbets,I missed out on the dip because I was strapped for cash. Seems like it’s getting a bit over pumped by the short/meme run-up so it might correct sometime soon. Then again I’m retarded and who knows.

If it's compressing the brainstem or causing brain herniation, chances of survival/recovery are lower.

I mean, since no one can see the future, the whole point of TA is to bias your guesses so that you're more likely to be right than wrong.  Right time to buy IMO was when the channel broke."
2021-06-13 15:51:24,wallstreetbets,Not really it broke out that channel over a month ago and tested multiple levels after.
2021-06-13 16:01:26,wallstreetbets,Channel’s break all the time and continue on their downtrend. You have to wait for confirmation or else it’s a guess. My opinion
2021-06-13 18:12:43,wallstreetbets,Apes see future. Moon travel soon.
2021-06-13 16:40:05,wallstreetbets,If you are doing TA you’d set a stop loss at the last support after it broke the selling pressure line.  Not wait a month for a trade that now has more potential for a lower price consolidation. My opinion.
2021-06-13 16:03:09,wallstreetbets,"And channels break and continue upwards all the time, too.  That's my point... it IS a guess.  ""Confirmation"" doesn't change that.  All trades are guesses.  TA helps your guesses be right more often than wrong.  But there's no such thing as a ""guaranteed"" trade, no matter how much ""confirmation"" you see."

2021-06-13 19:10:07,wallstreetbets,"Would you be ok selling 400 shares if this hits $100? And getting paid for making that decision now? Basically how the option works. And if it blasts through to like $120 on the day of expiry, you still have to sell at $100. But you get to keep your shares and the money for risking the potential sale if it stays below $100"
2021-06-13 15:44:30,wallstreetbets,Time will tell bud time will tell
2021-06-13 18:41:03,wallstreetbets,How's that negative
2021-06-13 15:59:42,wallstreetbets,Some people arnt cut out for it I completely get it... but I just started trucking .there are truckers that make way more like 3k a week plus I have no expenses so I'm able to pocket more and invest more lmao I'm happy for u though this is just the beginning!
2021-06-13 19:13:02,wallstreetbets,I would rather just keep my shares n maybe do like 1 call? So if it does expire in the money I can just buy more shares with the profits lol...plus fidelity only let me do level 1 options trading... so I guess they dont trust me lol
2021-06-13 16:01:20,wallstreetbets,Those guys are also taking on twice the liability if you’re talking about Owner Operators. I just couldnt stand not having a life and sleeping 4 hours a day.

2021-06-13 17:31:51,wallstreetbets,"I used to drive parking lot, hauling cars from Georgia to California making 4K a week, good times! Hell of a pay cut to sleep in my own bed…"
2021-06-13 19:18:44,wallstreetbets,"It sounds like you don’t really want to lower your position. If I’m selling a call, I’m selling it at a price I’m ok with losing the shares at. If I want back in, then I will sell a put at that price. If you want to keep the shares, you can just buy the call back before it expires"
2021-06-13 16:05:21,wallstreetbets,"Not a trucker but from what I remember from my conversations with people who are, those owner operators can make ""$200,000"" but after all the associated costs like maintaining their trucks they were barely making above $50,000 take home. Not terrible wages but not what people have in mind when they imagine making 3-4k a week."
2021-06-13 16:03:05,wallstreetbets,Its str8 I'll make the sacrifice 👍👍👍
2021-06-13 19:21:15,wallstreetbets,Dam u smart! I'll leave that to the smart apes. too complex for my ape brain lmao
2021-06-13 16:07:23,wallstreetbets,"Usually you are correct bud. Lots of people put those numbers out there to get young bucks in the industry. But when all is said and done owner operators really Dont make that much more than company drivers, take on all liability, and generally have to run their trucks year round if they wanna turn a better profit. Most em end up divorced and dont know their kids. Essentially its a shit job with fake freedom lol. I liked the lifestyle, hated the job. Saw the whole country though."
2021-06-13 16:58:07,wallstreetbets,"The industry is tough I understand that's why I belive teams is the best way to go to secure the most profits I drive with my brother... both single not married and no kids lol I guess that's why I belive I can compete with the industry 

It wont be easy by any means... n yes there ARE very successful truckers out there.. u just gotta work smart n hard.. I've seen them myself"
2021-06-13 17:23:13,wallstreetbets,wow great dd on trucking. time to buy puts on your social life.
2021-06-13 17:01:18,wallstreetbets,Nice well i wish you the most success possible. I teamed with a stranger. It was garbage.

Since you’re with your brother im sure thats workin out better. Good luck. Checkout NIO after ya sell your amc gains :)

2021-06-13 16:34:16,wallstreetbets,What in the hell am i looking at? Not a single damn crayon on this chart.
2021-06-13 18:47:12,wallstreetbets,"I would nope out of CLNE. They're notorious for share dilution, and their stock parallels crude prices almost perfectly (usually). You have to ask why with the year-high oil price their share price is pogoing, why the announcement of their partnership with Amazon was treated with yawns...

I sold the stake that I had after it got back into the green, I'll use the money on a less-risky move such as scratcher tickets or a mail-order bride.

Opinion, not financial advice."

2021-06-13 15:17:58,wallstreetbets,"The chart is cut off for some reasons so it's the price. Every-time the price moves up 1% it gets an X. It will keep getting an X every 1% gain until a 5x reversal happens.  When it goes down 5%, then for every 1% it moves down you will see a O. Using this method support, resistance and breakout patterns are easier to spot (apparently). People use previous price movement to spot the support and previous breakout patterns to estimate the bullish scenario."
2021-06-13 16:42:04,wallstreetbets,"And with that amount of tic-tac-toe, we can't lose"

I saw CLOV hit $28, didn't sell and now I'm like fuck lol. 

Holding CLNE, if it hits $30 I'm selling at least half my shares and will re-buy on a dip if it comes down to it."

2021-06-13 15:23:30,wallstreetbets,"Hey, thanks assholes, now I have a fourth contender to choose from. It's going to be harder to decide where to throw my money away on something this week. 

Lumen sounds futuristic and they shoot lasers down the internet pipes so that's a win right there. Box ticked. 

It's trading within spitting distance of its 52 week high so my chances of buying at the peak are better than average. 

It's a buy rating from me. This is not financial advice, as if that wasn't obvious."
2021-06-13 15:00:28,wallstreetbets,I was going to take gains until I saw Burry was into it. Guess I'm going long.
2021-06-13 16:12:52,wallstreetbets,Bra' you've gone total retard and you're getting Luminar confused with Lumen

No no"
2021-06-13 14:41:14,wallstreetbets,Am long like 40k total in shares and buying every dip
2021-06-13 14:53:09,wallstreetbets,I looked at this for div investing but couldn’t pull the trigger
2021-06-13 15:46:20,wallstreetbets,"My completely biased non-technical reasons to stay out of them.

I haven't looked at them in years.  USWest, Qwest, CenturyLink, and now Lumen.  Same regime...new names.  Never seem to get their shit together.  Had massive amounts of debt, and then they bought someone with even more debt (Level3)....which had made a recent acquisition of floundering Time Warner Telecom...which had absorbed failing XO Communications.
From a customer perspective...Level3 was awesome for IP Core stuff.  Since being acquired...customer service and repairs suck *as.  Their competitors are constantly underbidding them on price too.  Circuit delivery times have grown exponentially.
My last reason...I know someone that is a lifelong sales gal.  She's always been ahead of market in following the potential sales money.  She recently bailed from Level3 to join one of the mega-tech companies.  One that is currently taking large pieces of traditional telecom away from the sector.  You'll have to guess who.

Maybe there is some upside there...seem to have quit borrowing and are paying off debt....but my couple of decades around that industry tell me to stay away from companies with piles of debt.  They like fold when money gets tough to borrow because of the sky high costs of improving services, while having to compete with C-LECs that got sweetheart long term deals that keep LECs from being able to raise prices."
2021-06-13 15:31:22,wallstreetbets,Burry still in this?
2021-06-13 17:46:02,wallstreetbets,"Corrupt shitty telecom leftovers, hard pass.

A lot of these shitcos were spun off from ma bells grandkids to hold all the bad wires and market areas they didnt want to spend improving because they already spent the billions fleeced from dumb daddy govt."
2021-06-13 14:59:17,wallstreetbets,"Cant wait for amc and gme to pop, definitely buying more shares, love the dividend."

2021-06-13 15:11:01,wallstreetbets,"Good points for sure. Both are warning signs. But now the yield is below 7% due to the share price rise about $15, and the YoY declines are getting smaller - like 3.5%. The reason in the past for these sales declines is management getting rid of low-calorie revenue and contracts - but more recently the CEO has stated LUMN is finally focused on sale growth..."
2021-06-13 16:35:33,wallstreetbets,"Yes the good old USwest, Qwest days! LUMN is generating $3B in Free cash flow - paying $1B in Divy so reducing debt by $2B per year. But also when they can redeem that old junk Qwest debt with really high interest rate - they are and replacing with new debt 200 basis points lower further increasing their free cash flows..."
2021-06-13 15:35:28,wallstreetbets,He chopped of half of his pos in last 13F. He exited gamestop early too though.
2021-06-13 15:08:13,wallstreetbets,Thought the same intially...but went for uwmc. Better   Outlook and also nice dividend!
2021-06-13 16:41:43,wallstreetbets,Maybe I'll have to watch it for a while.  Probably still a bit early for me to think that zebra has changed its stripes.
2021-06-13 15:46:33,wallstreetbets,I have about the same position size in each.
2021-06-13 15:49:36,wallstreetbets,"Im still following Lumen by the way, but i'm hessitant with last weeks. Feels like i missed that boat. Do you still think there is room for growth? Dividend aside? If you can convince me I'll get some."
2021-06-13 16:31:43,wallstreetbets,"Yes the move up from single digits is great if you bought then - but now at close to the 52 week high? But this stock was well above $20 a share after the L3 acquisition - and fell hard when they cut the dividend in half to pay down debt more quickly...

&#x200B;

I think we move back above $20 this year - COVID bounceback play, and realization the L3 assets alone are worth more than $20. Buy LUMN - sit back and collect the divy, and sell covered calls and puts for extra Juice!"
2021-06-13 15:52:30,wallstreetbets,I have no clue man. Communications infrastructure sounds good to me. They have their name on a local stadium. Cheapish stock. Good dividend. Buy and hold.  Im not a stock trader.
2021-06-13 17:00:32,wallstreetbets,Ok you got me. Sounds reasonable. Stepping in. Good luck to you and if not I'll hunt you down like a Pig j/k ofc.
2021-06-13 15:55:43,wallstreetbets,Hmmm will do more research. Tnx idea
2021-06-13 14:20:38,wallstreetbets,I’ve owned it for 20 years. The money is in the dividend not the stock price. This group is getting sillier and sillier.

2021-06-13 14:27:13,wallstreetbets,This stock never moves.
2021-06-13 14:25:04,wallstreetbets,"Even covid vaccine dropped the price from 40s to 33s and then it took gruelling 5 months or so to come back to 39s. I agree it was hedge funds and MMs moving it down and suppressing it.

2021-06-13 15:23:30,wallstreetbets,"This is dumb.  Market cap is so big that most catalysts can't budge it.  Like moving an iceberg with a rowboat.  If you want a nice stable place to forget about you money for 10 years and make a nice dividend, PFE's great.  But you ain't gonna get rich."
2021-06-13 14:21:55,wallstreetbets,"Why now?  

News of approval for use in younger people and increased orders of the vaccine both in the us and globally barely made this thing move much. What’s going on now compared to a month ago that’s going to cause it to moon and not, say, gap up then back down a few days later??"

2021-06-13 15:42:48,wallstreetbets,Baba so cheap right now.  Need to keep buying these dips.

2021-06-13 16:59:16,wallstreetbets,My issue is I doubt CCP would ever want one single company becoming too powerful. They were sending a message not just to BABA but about growth in general.

2021-06-13 16:24:56,wallstreetbets,China owns large stakes in all big Chinese companies. They are purchased/held in shell companies.

2021-06-13 18:04:57,wallstreetbets,Or have both stocks been overvalued this whole time? Maybe the trade war and tarifs are making Chinese stocks a bad investment.

2021-06-13 19:36:19,wallstreetbets,"that’s fair. But the low volume recently means a big move will happen soon. I think given the fundamentals it should be to the upside. But in case I am way too early, I got 2023 LEAPs so I have time and if it drops way too much, I will average down"
2021-06-13 18:41:53,wallstreetbets,They don't just own stakes. They control the companies. They once switched around the CEOs of their 3 major telecom companies just to prove a point to them.
2021-06-13 18:08:32,wallstreetbets,"DCF models would suggest they are fundamentally undervalued right now, but yes the main concern seems to be geopolitical right now."
2021-06-13 19:41:28,wallstreetbets,"Tariffs mainly hurt the US, not China as much"
2021-06-13 15:19:26,wallstreetbets,You gotta risk it to get the biscuit
2021-06-13 18:45:28,wallstreetbets,Yup I personally would not bet on anything Chinese especially if we enter a Cold War with them it maybe illegal to trade them in the future… cal options would sink like crazy
2021-06-13 19:47:42,wallstreetbets,"Debatable. If goods from china cost too much for suppliers to ship,  production will be forced to come back to the US. 

We need a strong working class, and we can't have that if we compete with China's slave labor and lack of safety/pollution standards."
2021-06-13 15:21:31,wallstreetbets,This is true. I’ve gone full retard on oil for late summer. Never go full retard.
2021-06-13 19:55:02,wallstreetbets,"Hey I don’t disagree with you there. Just pointing our that we are hurting more than they are right now. Chinese manufacturers have already started to move to Vietnam to sell to us. They’re more agile than you might think. It takes time to build up manufacturing capabilities. And even if we did build it up, BABA is mainly focused on Chinese domestic consumption anyways. It isn’t affected by us. If American money leaves Chinese stocks, Europe will slowly go in, which is what has been happening"
2021-06-13 15:23:02,wallstreetbets,Best place in the spectrum is smack in the middle between boomer and retard. It's a fine line most days though.

2021-06-13 17:16:49,wallstreetbets,Legit.  Clov pull back represents a solid re-entry and 1st time buy when the interest is still high on this stock.  Short interest went up a lot when we collectively pushed the price to $23 earlier in the week so now we have even more we can take back if we push hard this week.  I'm definitely increasing my position.

2021-06-13 15:36:29,wallstreetbets,"Could you also do analysis comparing the moves to the  similar moves for American-Multi Cinema and Game at the beginning of their runs? That would give this post more validity. Otherwise it feels like anything gaining momentum outside of the 2 get technical analysis that supports price drops. Can we also relate borrow rates to short interest% as well.. we know that higher borrow rates promote movement to close borrow positions... just a couple of thoughts if this post is for technical analysis.. it seems at times that only the technicals for supporting a particular direction in price movement is shared.  
   Over 100% institutional ownership w.r.t something like CLOV, with tons of options out there.. could there be pressure and a strategy to push those options to a place where they expire out of the money.. so the premiums are collected? Can we look at which institutions may be over leveraged with put options (is that an indication of naked shorting) This week is a critical week (3rd Friday monthly) for options.

2021-06-13 14:48:10,wallstreetbets,"This is a very fair analysis on CLOV. I was initially bullish, but am noe quite bearish on the short term. I think considering the PPI comes out Tuesday and the Fed will be speaking about it, there is a good chance that it falls beneath its prior lower resistance levels.

I see Monday being a very likely bulltrap before a heavy sell off from further inflation fears this week. Position of 1 former OTM @16 call (sold), now puts @14, 13.5, 11, 10 and 9.

Edit: Just to add I do like the company's service innovating a stagnant healthcare industry, but that industry moves quite slow. Even at $16 I think that price point is only obtainable on its own steam by 2024-2026. $24 5-8 years or more."

Diabetes is one of the most prevalent medical conditions in the US. SENS is currently awaiting FDA approval for 180 day usage. I think this stock is going to take off. To get an idea, you can take a look at its competitor DXCM which has increased >400% in the past few years since FDA approval of its device in 2018. The trends are bullish and there's some upcoming catalysts."

2021-06-13 15:49:29,wallstreetbets,"Personally, I do value TA (within reason) and disagree that it's BS.

But.

It becomes significantly less valuable when many of the participants in that particular stock are not using TA. In other words, heavy retail meme stocks.

Why?

Technical Analysis is a self fulfilling prophecy. If enough people accept or acknowledge that a stock has a support, resistance or trend line, and they're trading off that, then all of a sudden that TA is very valuable.

The more common the TA indicators are, in theory, the ones that will provide the most reliability because they are the ones that people are using which will create trends.

The big problem with TA is that algos the big institutions use will take advantage of that and play around them to catch retail and smaller institutions out.

I don't use TA to make trading decisions per se, but I do use it to identify stocks that are more likely to breakout, where I should look at buying or selling based off previous support or resistance levels.

This is all more for day and swing trading though. For investing, it makes sense to approach it slightly differently. In part, because it's a lot more long-term and fundamentals will be more applicable to the decision.

You probably know all of this, but in case anyone else is reading and is curious about TA I thought I'd write a slightly more detailed response."

2021-06-13 13:36:41,wallstreetbets,Picked up BABA $210 calls this Friday for Nov 2021 expiry .
2021-06-13 13:44:27,wallstreetbets,"These are some great calls. Im glad to see someone so bullish on BABA.

BABA is a legit great play at the current price. I think it will moon without WSB support, but if this stock gets meme level attention it’s going interstellar."
2021-06-13 13:40:32,wallstreetbets,I wish. This shit has been stagnant.
2021-06-13 14:21:20,wallstreetbets,This is the confirmation bias I need. I’ve been watching it continue dropping to near 52 week low.  Going to dump a few thousand $ in calls soon. Godspeed.
2021-06-13 14:04:21,wallstreetbets,"So could you explain how it being blacklisted isn't an issue? Was BABA not on the list? I truly don't expect Biden to do anything against china so I'm sure their are loopholes and it was just for press.

I've been eyeing BABA but I'm balls deep in RIDE rn because it will be so easy for them to hit ATH making it a 200% up from here lol"
2021-06-13 14:58:59,wallstreetbets,"Ant group has nothing to do with BABA anymore. One facet from the China regulation that fined BABA was to separate Ant group and BABA so it doesn't monopolize the system in China. This weakened Ma's position, and BABA is trying to reduce Ma's position in the company, they just haven't decided who it's going to be.

Combine all of that plus US regulation toward to China, there's reason why China stocks are plummeting. But I do agree that it's undervalued just for BABA itself. Will it ever go to ATH of $300 anytime soon? Probably not, and US regulation isn't something that you can slack off of these. Biden is ACTIVELY trying to cut power of China more than Donny, and you can see it on his agenda. I do believe these tensions are not good for U.S. money to be invested in China."

2021-06-13 14:46:04,wallstreetbets,"What makes you confident ANT will be IPO this year? And even if it does, given the regulation, political risk, and current sentiment, it's likely to severely affect their valuation. Baba owns 33% of ANT group."

2021-06-13 17:59:40,wallstreetbets,"I love Baba (Its my 5th largest position I think), but if you november timing is off, you will lose money on an amazing no-brainer company. What's the point? Its one thing to lose money on a stupid company, but losing money on a no-brainer is kind of unfortunate. I would convert those into shares and keep them forever. Check back in 10 years. Will make much more money EVEN if your calls end up being timed well.In the very least, convert into january 2023 and keep till expiration.

2021-06-13 17:28:36,wallstreetbets,Assuming wsb has enough buying power to move a 500+ billion stock. This is something else than GME my friend. GME value not even 3% of that from BABA.
2021-06-13 18:20:06,wallstreetbets,"This isn't some small company like GME or AMC. BABA is a 600 billion dollar company, retail buying alone can't make this stock moonshot like the other meme stocks"
2021-06-13 13:55:39,wallstreetbets,"Yes lot of consolidation and volume has been really low . SP at the 2019 levels . Watch volume and once it comes back , it’s going to fly ."
2021-06-13 14:14:08,wallstreetbets,BABA was never on the black list - either the original under Trump or the updated one under Biden . Issue was more around Chinese regulatory cracking down on Monopolies ( like US planning to go after Big tech ) . Anyway that’s settled with a fine and Chinese regulator give go ahead to ANT ipo ( owned by Jack MA ) couple of weeks ago
2021-06-13 13:52:40,wallstreetbets,No - the Chinese regulatory risk was overblown and at this point it’s all settled with ANT ipo given green light . Money will come back to BABA once ANT ipo is announced . It’s an easy $300+  stock based on valuation and it’s at 2019 levels even though revenue and earnings have grown over the last two years . Expecting a bounce back to 240-250 range as the first step of the bullish run before August .
2021-06-13 13:48:58,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, if things go even further south with China (politically) then all China stocks will suffer. Only reason I haven't taken the trade"

2021-06-13 16:55:44,wallstreetbets,G7 already looking at them who knows how they’ll fair going forward and investigation of COVID being a wuhan leak has not been helping.
2021-06-13 18:27:47,wallstreetbets,"Got it, so you have a lot more other Baba. makes sense. I will buy a jan 2023 tomorrow morning"
2021-06-13 17:48:25,wallstreetbets,Apes talking about value? What kind of nonsense is this?
2021-06-13 14:30:32,wallstreetbets,Yah Charlie Munger made a big investment in Q1 at the current prices . Will see how much he added in Q2 when they report in July .
2021-06-13 14:17:38,wallstreetbets,"Jan 22 ? You never know / if things align, it can reach 300 this year  . It should reach 240-250 by august . At that point you could roll it over to Jan 23 to buy more time"
2021-06-13 14:26:14,wallstreetbets,On June 3 - ANT got regulatory approval for the newly formed Fintech subsidiary which was the major obstacle / remediation measure for the IPO . ANT needs to re-file for IPO with the new company structure but that’s more of a process delay . Of course to make money you have to invest before the IPO  is formally announced not after it !
2021-06-13 14:49:02,wallstreetbets,"They got the national license on June 3rd. More than the actual date , we should see progress and news around the IPO which would be positive for BABA. We just need the sentiment to change for Chinese stocks for BABA to reach 300 by end of the year ."

2021-06-13 15:18:38,wallstreetbets,How do you roll over a call?
2021-06-13 16:36:12,wallstreetbets,Haha no he recently talked about BABA and how undervalued it . Investors like Charlie munger don’t keep for 2 months and sell at a loss

2021-06-13 14:25:22,wallstreetbets,I thought new/low karma accounts were not allowed to post here...or did they never officially implement that?
2021-06-13 13:46:26,wallstreetbets,"I think most people's concern about day trading is because of the rumors of naked shorts. If you sell those shares back, they can make them disappear like that never happend. Rumors say that there are about 74% more shares of AMC that there were supposed to exist.

I will be looking to buy the $11 strike 6/25 weekly on Friday afternoon and it will be nothing but hookers and blow on 6/25.

2021-06-13 14:30:10,wallstreetbets,"This could still pan out for you. That's a hell of a gamble.  I think the current reddit sentiment on the stock is pretty mixed at this point.  I personally got out of it when the ceo went on kramer in case it was a death kiss and my concerns for the housing market.  CDOs and sub prime  lending caused the crash in 08.  In the last couple of years we're seeing trading of distressed mortgages come back but renamed as BTOs (bespoke tranche opportunity).  My concern is that with covid,  the shutdown of the country, closures of small and large businesses/loss of jobs and people getting really behind on their mortgages with the no-foreclosure/eviction thing... Not only could the whole economy be in trouble but especially the housing market. The other thing that might more directly affect mortgage stocks is that approvals are at the lowest they've been since 2014 so there's less volume. Over 70% of approvals in 2020 went to those with 760+ credit scores.  On the flip side though, rates are crazy low right now which is great for mortgage wholesalers like these guys.  I could be completely wrong about all of this and likely am, but these are just my smooth brained thoughts. 🤷‍♂️🦍"

[here is proof](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-qnx-adds-another-certification-to-its-embedded-software-portfolio-301165498.html)

As you can see there is something going on with blackberry stock. Based on this comparison analysis it's a **massively undervalued** company that's leading charge in EV, iot, connected cars, ai cybersecurity. Rest of these companies only provide a small component of Unified Endpoint Security (UES), only Blackberry provides all components you need for **UES (next gen security architecture)!**! Meaning, an enterprise or government only needs to use a single platform **blackberry spark** to enable UES across their network of iot (computer, laptop, servers, phones, drones, cars, etc). The other companies only provide small part of UES, so it's more expensive for enterprise to go with other companies because then they have to deal with multiple companies to enable UES. Example, crowdstrike only provides Cybersecurity and does not provide Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) or Car operating system. **To enabled smart and connected future you need UES, UEM, Car Operating system and ai security and only blackberry has all these under a single platform!!!!**

**Blackberry Spark has UES and UEM**. No other companies listed in this table provides both solution. 

Blackberry leads in car security and operating system...none of these other companies have car software. 

Blackbery owns 70% of ai cybersecurity patents and has the most advanced and mature machine learning model. the model prevents cyber attacks before they happen...meaning it prevents the attack from executing!! All together blackberry has **40,000 patents**!! 

So at this moment the company's leadership in EV and iot and cybersecurity should value it around 70-80 Billion or at MINIMUM $140 a stock!!

This is just my analysis and DD. Please invest after doing your own DD. This is not a financial advice. 

**Wish you all apes Godspeed**!!! you all have found a true diamond!!"

2021-06-13 19:34:56,wallstreetbets,"Chen is a brilliant turn around specialist. He sold Sybase to SAP.

BB is severely undervalued and is currently working with IBM and AMZN. IBM/Amazon should buyout BB at a minimum 4x current market cap which will make the sale comparable to Zscaler and Okta. Apple is also a good candidate but they're too cheap.

BB isn't a meme stock and shouldn't be classified with GME and AMC. For transparency, I own stock/options on GME and AMC."

2021-06-13 11:39:20,wallstreetbets,i went all in at $7. if you don't beleive my analysis try visiting the proof i posted. you can verify all the information through their PR releases. You can call every car OEM and ask which operating system they are using in their cars including EV and connected cars.

2021-06-13 15:43:58,wallstreetbets,"That’s kind of my point. Demo it. I’m tired of hearing Blackberry say “that’s what we’re going to do.” I’ve seen the same 3 slide decks floating around for months.

Also, Blackberry needs discipline. Stop licensing out their designs to whoever to make yet another qwerty smartphone. It confuses the market."
2021-06-13 11:43:30,wallstreetbets,"I guess I don’t see as that much of a breakthrough. The Car2Go network 4 years ago knew when the window was down literally 1/8 of an inch and wouldn’t let me end my rental from my smartphone.

I bought Blackberry as a cyber security play 1.5 years ago and sold after I felt that during covid they couldn’t capitalize on the work from home scramble as other companies did.

I still like Blackberry, I just wish they found a better way to monetize that data (as AWS has done with their business model). I’ll probably jump back into Blackberry though at the right price.

Edit: Blackberry owning, storing, and protecting the data isn’t an extra cost. It’s a huge value to the OEMs. VW just had 3 million North American customers data get breached. There’s an opportunity for Blackberry I think."

2021-06-13 12:24:46,wallstreetbets,Down seems like an understatement when looking at competitors evaluations
2021-06-13 14:25:18,wallstreetbets,"Not sure the settlement amonut as nothing was publically released but for BB to settle without further litigation I would think it plays out to their favor.  Also, seen this week that BB is now suing SNAP for patent infringments so they aren't messing around and given the fact they own a majority in the market for EV software patents they are making known they aren't afraid to go after infringers.  This should solidify their market stance in future EV progressions so they don't end up like the celluar buisness they was years ago."
2021-06-13 16:22:04,wallstreetbets,"The settlement is likely the sale of patents. It's going to be big money but 5b seems excessive. The patent sale, if it is to FB, will certainly include an inflated value to cover pain and suffering for stealing the patents in the first place. Having a German court offer to shut down Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram is what got FB to settle. It's not going to be cheap.

Since no one knows what the settlement is, it's not fully baked into the stock price."

2021-06-13 13:42:13,wallstreetbets,QNX isn’t the “operating system”. It’s the kernel. Blackberry doesn’t own the full stack. And currently Blackberry receives 1 license fee for each car sold.

2021-06-13 19:33:49,wallstreetbets,"> ...zero trust on single platform that’s NSA and department of defense info network certified?

No, I can’t, nor do I want to go through the trouble. None of the F500s I’ve worked with cared about those certifications, though.

> Tons of other companies have UEM and UES

Cisco, Kaspersky, Comodo, etc.

Many more companies are on the path to integrating their security and management as well. Not to mention MDR and EDR solutions

Edit: also, a lot of the analysis of BB sounds like an advertisement for my last company. We used damn near the same wording when it comes to stuff like AI & Machine Learning & “zero-trust”. It’s just the current industry buzz words.

Like what does “advanced AI engine” even mean? Damn near every company claims that.

“Leader in AI Cybersecurity” What makes them a leader?"

BB had to get their ducks in row before enabling ivy. The key was cybersecurity infrastructure. With cylance ai integrated into Ivy and QNX, it's much safer now to collect, process, and update car modules over Ivy. Wait for OEM announcement soon."
2021-06-13 13:17:18,wallstreetbets,"They are splitting ivy rev half half according to Chen. Blackberry will provide edge processing software and security infrastructure for data to move from and to AWS, and Amazon will provide their machine learning model to develop services. Amazon or blackberry does not own the data. The data will be owned by oem of the car. They can decide to store it on any cloud provider if they wish. 

I don’t think oem will decide to store any sensor data in cloud due to amount and cost. Once necessary value is extracted from data then the data becomes useless. The models developed from data by blackberry and Amazon is enough to develope apps and services. 

This is why blackberry and Amazon don’t want the data. It’s usefulness to them."

2021-06-13 14:00:48,wallstreetbets,What I think hurts Blackberry the most is it's name and product history.  While it made good cellular products and was a leader in moble security it couldn't capitalize and got beat.  Now it has a chance with EV and contracts but to see the share price increase dramatically I think BB will have to prove itself first with generated revenue and growth in the autonomous software security sector.  Once this starts to get realized I could see the share price getting back closer to 2008 levels.

Release an API for these apps. And, their marquee OEM (Ford) recently switched that component of the business to Google. 

I think car companies have realized: they aren’t good at making apps. I’m not saying Blackberry can’t do it. All I’m saying is I doubt Blackberry’s ability to execute on their vision. They had 2 CES appearances with Amazon and I don’t feel any closer to seeing this thing working in reality."

2021-06-13 17:24:09,wallstreetbets," I'm long FSR... But keep an eye out for the 2022 lockup... Hopefully they will change the shorting laws by then... If not... it's been the pattern that companies short every single share available before lock up expires... And wait to cover well after lockup has expired when there's a ton more shares on the market, So when they cover it doesn't bring the price up and nearly as much as it took it down..

This has been my biggest annoyance recently

From UrbanDictionary

""""""

twink   
A ""twink"" is usually considered a homosexual male with attractive, boyish qualities. Typically from the ages of 18-25, and often thought as a young, white, fashionable male.  
  
Most likely a term coined from the snack cake ""Twinkie""; a pretty, yellow cake with a thick cream filling, and most importantly, nearly phallic in shape.  
""Man, look at that twink over there.""  
""What did you say?""  
""You know--cute, youthful? Totally a homosexual? I'm gonna talk to him""

2021-06-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Are CVS and Walgreens in Trouble if Amazon Enters the Retail Pharmacy Market? | The Motley Fool Rite Aid is crazy undervalued. 25 billion in revenue and only 55 million shares outstanding. Also has significant short position for the size in available float.  Trades like 2 times EBITDA.  They've been turning around the company. I've been to their new stores and they are incredible.  As story from MF says they could be a smart target for Amazon.  If that happens a bidding war could take this to 100 quick. Has more revenue than McDonalds....
2021-06-13 11:33:23,wallstreetbets,I wouldn’t trust ordering a PS5 through amazon let alone life saving druggies
2021-06-13 10:29:00,wallstreetbets,Rite aid also already sold half the company but their second deal fell through so realistically only half the company could be bought by a larger entity
2021-06-13 10:36:27,wallstreetbets,"Not unless Amazon starts negotiating with insurance companies as an exclusive provider. Our insurance requires us to use CVS for Rxs. This includes their specialty dept. Amazon has the money to do this, but it’s more to why? Most of Amazon’s business has been in newer areas: E-Commerce, streaming, Smart tech.,  etc. The retail pharmacy (including home delivery) is already built by these companies. People also like the ability to go to an actual store for something as important as an RX or other medication. Those that don’t can have it shipped already. 

In other words, Amazon can’t bring much to the market that isn’t already there. That means Amazon is forced to negotiate with insurances, gather a team of pharmacists to fill the Rxs, market to people/companies to use them and more. Amazon would spend a ton of money and resources in a market that is already fully developed and is competing against giants already established. It would be high risk spending. I doubt this is where they go."
2021-06-13 10:39:13,wallstreetbets,I don’t trust them to sell me underwear that isn't counterfeit.  Not so sure drugs are a good idea.
2021-06-13 10:31:21,wallstreetbets,"I think one of the most interesting parts of the article was the comment made by Brian Orelli:

# ""If they ( Amazon - AMZN ) bought, let's say, the Rite Aid, that's probably the smallest of the three. I think if they did that, that would allow them to ramp up really quickly. Obviously, if they just rebranded them as Amazon stores and then they can also integrate package pickups and returns into the store and that will get people into the store. I think that would be the biggest worry for the pharmacy companies."""
2021-06-13 12:25:35,wallstreetbets,"Yes and no. Their stock would be, but Amazon doesnt face the same logistical and payroll hurdles that RA, CVS or WMT do. When it came to boots on the ground Amazon would be on THEIR turf. Not vice versa. Probably a losing prospect for direct competition. They would need to obliquely attack the sector as they did with Grocery (whole foods). Niche. High end. Locations without as much local competition. They couldve bought kroger or safeway or piggly wiggly but didnt."
2021-06-13 16:04:26,wallstreetbets,This is extremely speculative but I’m bullish as fuck on Rite Aid and it has very high short interest
2021-06-13 10:50:16,wallstreetbets,"Amazon is going to have difficulty making more retail acquisitions as there is an anti-monopoly sentiment more so in the EU right now but growing within the US.

Amazon ultimately probably needs to split into three parts and the great thing about that is you wind up with a pure cloud play if they do it fast they can beat IBM’s break up toward the end of this year or early next year.

Back to Rite Aid the fact that this ain’t gonna happen doesn’t preclude a run up on sentiment. Washed up rundown brand check! Plausible but improbable scenario check!

Lord I haven’t been to a Rite Aid in ages, there are “new ones”?

CVS put in one of their new ones near me. They are “health oriented “. But it’s a bust. No alcohol."
2021-06-13 19:07:08,wallstreetbets,CVS RiteAid Walgreens have destroyed the profession of pharmacy. Can only hope Amazon gives them integrity and brings Some relief to pharmacist.
2021-06-13 10:40:25,wallstreetbets,"I was looking into Rita Aid this week. The company is a pharmacy that lost money during a pandemic and lockdown. 

How. The. Fuck. Does a pharmacy lose money during a pandemic??"
2021-06-13 10:07:02,wallstreetbets,Interesting!
2021-06-13 11:03:41,wallstreetbets,Amazon tried to acquire rite aid years ago and were denied then CVS adapted their doc in a box model and are slowly implementing them into stores across the US. I held CVS for years and saw great growth and dividends
2021-06-13 14:10:50,wallstreetbets,I'm a pharmacist. Amazon actually looked into acquiring Rite Aid about 2 years ago. Right afterwards they acquired pillpack instead. It is widely believed that the initial merger talks were a way to steal company secrets then leave Rite Aid with nothing.
2021-06-13 11:12:04,wallstreetbets,You guys see the legislation making its way through congress right now? Fucking anti-monopoly laws looking to break up big tech into individual service segments....
2021-06-13 11:12:21,wallstreetbets,"The rite aid in my town just shut down a few years ago and turned into a Walgreens, I was under the impression that they’re not doing so hot right now but I’ve been wrong before and god dammit I’ll be wrong again I’m sure"
2021-06-13 11:49:00,wallstreetbets,They r already in trouble they both have not shown a profit in years
2021-06-13 13:13:46,wallstreetbets,"CVS is strong as hell right now.  

Remember… only a third of their business comes through their retail pharmacies.  They make their real money as a pharmacy benefit manager (Caremark) and as a health insurer (Aetna)."
2021-06-13 19:05:42,wallstreetbets,If they enter with the same price point and insurance company tie ins...yep.

2021-06-13 11:42:31,wallstreetbets,The mark up on Rx’s isn’t all that great that would be my main reason for thinking Amazon would pass on this. But who knows…
2021-06-13 11:44:56,wallstreetbets,"No this is media hype pushes by a hedge fund. Citadel increasing their position in Amazon by 2,000%+ right before the MGM announcement still seems to be paying off if you go by news headlines."
2021-06-13 13:40:11,wallstreetbets,"AMZN isn’t touching them. With anti-trust legislation on the table right now, the last thing Amazon is thinking to do is expand into another industry until it blows over."
2021-06-13 15:24:59,wallstreetbets,I dont know. Amazon has demonstrated that its overhead is so small in comparison to its revenue that it does not give a damn about opening random competitor businesses to streamline the supply chain process.
2021-06-13 15:22:46,wallstreetbets,LOL
2021-06-13 10:34:15,wallstreetbets,"Yes, there are currently more than 2,500 Rite Aid retails stores.

Interesting enough, with the recent acquisition of Bartell Drugs by Rite Aid, RAD is now the #1 retail pharmacy in Seattle.   If Amazon acquired Rite Aid, then Amazon would be in a terrific position to provide local prescription drug benefits to its 75,000 employees that work in the AMZN Seattle headquarters."
2021-06-13 10:52:35,wallstreetbets,Isn’t that the whole point of possibly buying rite aid?
2021-06-13 13:12:06,wallstreetbets,💯
2021-06-13 13:41:50,wallstreetbets,This is the reason every tech company that has tried to disrupt healthcare  has failed.
2021-06-13 11:04:36,wallstreetbets,"If I had prescriptions on home delivery, I would 100% go with an Amazon company over Walgreens. Their delivery reliability is unmatched."
2021-06-13 11:28:30,wallstreetbets,"So they become sears 2.0

If you didn't know sears was originally a mail order catalog. So they were the Amazon of the non-internet world."
2021-06-13 10:55:37,wallstreetbets,"Rite Aid in PA is nicer than CVS and Walgreens. If they’re rolling out their new model here first, I think everyone else will be surprised by their improvements."
2021-06-13 11:35:32,wallstreetbets,"It was Walgreens that tried to buy Rite Aid, not Amazon.

And Walgreens ended up settling for almost half of Rite Aid.  They bought approximately 1,900 stores in 2018 for approximately $4.4 billion."
2021-06-13 11:38:13,wallstreetbets,"There are so many ways to get prescription these days, there is no chance that an Amazon acquisition of Rite Aid would be an issue.

The successful argument could be made that an Amazon acquisition of Rite Aid would actually improve competition.  Today Rite Aid is the 3rd larget retail pharmacy chain.  However, Rite Aid is only in 19 states, while the leaders CVS and Walgreens are nationwide.   An acquistion by Amazon could create a third nationwide retail pharmacy chain, thereby increasing the prescription drug competition throughout the USA."
2021-06-13 11:39:39,wallstreetbets,"The Rite Aid in your town was bought by Walgreens and coverted into a Walgreens.

Walgreens tried to acquire all of Rite Aid in 2015, but ended up settling for almost half of Rite Aid stores in 2018. They bought approximately 1,900 stores for approximately $4.4 billion.

Rite Aid currently has 2,500+ retail store locations throughout 19 different states and is the third largest retail pharmacy in the country."
2021-06-13 16:15:50,wallstreetbets,"Yes, CVS is a good stable investment.

If I am a boomer who wants to earn 3 - 5% per year on my money, I should invest in CVS."
2021-06-13 10:29:46,wallstreetbets,NO POLITICS
2021-06-13 10:22:55,wallstreetbets,You don't get out much do you?
2021-06-13 16:19:24,wallstreetbets,"Actually, Amazon going after Rite Aid would be seen as a good thing by the US Government.  Today there are only two national retail pharmacy chains --- CVS and Walgreens.  Even though Rite Aid is the 3rd largest retail pharmacy chain in the country, you can't call it national, because Rite Aid has stores in only 19 states.

If AMZN were to acquire Rite Aid, they have the power to expand the number of stores and take the chain nationwide.  That would be seen as a very positive move by the US government, as it would create more competition throughout the nation in the prescription pharmacy segment.

Amazon could use this argument to make its point that its size and diversity actually helps to create a better more compeitive environment that provides lower costs to consumers.  When it comes to the healthcare industry, this is an important point."
2021-06-13 15:42:44,wallstreetbets,They bought Whole Foods to speed up brick and mortar.
2021-06-13 12:27:24,wallstreetbets,Now that's interesting...
2021-06-13 11:14:39,wallstreetbets,Where are people hearing this talk from I’m debating opening up a long position on RA but I need a little more insight here
2021-06-13 14:13:19,wallstreetbets,"The whole poi t of buying rite aid would be to acquire its PBM, which is the most profitable bbn part of the entire company. The PBM alone is worth more than the entire Rite Aid market cap."
2021-06-13 10:54:46,wallstreetbets,"Yes, if they felt this is a market that they can add something too. My point is, even acquiring Rite Aid would be expensive, and they can't bring anything to the market that isn't already there. 

IOW, what does Amazon add to a tough, filled market with Rite Aid? They can save RA, but why?"
2021-06-13 11:13:08,wallstreetbets,"Yes, delivery right to the porch pirates.

Did someone say drugs? PROFIT!"
2021-06-13 12:26:03,wallstreetbets,exactly this. I sure do miss sears.
2021-06-13 16:23:26,wallstreetbets,"It's got a sneaky growth component though...

As more of the economy reopens, Caremark/Aetna are reopening plays as increases in employment will drive increased revenues.  

This isn't just a dividend stock at this moment."
2021-06-13 10:33:38,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-13 16:21:50,wallstreetbets,Amazon can make a similar argument for nearly every industry. That its scale and resources aid consumers. But it destroys competition and it’s unfair to have AWS subsidizing the destruction of CVS and Walgreens. I’m not doubting they would innovate within the industry. But enough is enough and the latest string of bills against them echos the same message.
2021-06-13 15:54:42,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. I wouldn't put it past them to acquire a retailer for pharma. The only issue is that pharma is one of the most controlled markets and entering into it is a political and administrative nightmare. 

&#x200B;

That being said if any company can do it its definitely Amazon. Still to risky for me to play but if something gets announced then im game."
2021-06-13 11:21:08,wallstreetbets,"Motley Fool just did a piece in which Brian Orelli stated:  
***""If they ( Amazon - AMZN ) bought, let's say, the Rite Aid, that's probably the smallest of the three. I think if they did that, that would allow them to ramp up really quickly. Obviously, if they just rebranded them as Amazon stores and then they can also integrate package pickups and returns into the store and that will get people into the store. I think that would be the biggest worry for the pharmacy companies.""***

Also, a week or two ago, the independent research firm, CFRA Research, updated its analysis on Rite Aid, and made the following statement:

***""On a separate note, media outlets have reported Amazon is looking to increase its physical drug retail business to compete head on with CVS, Walgreens, and RAD. While this would certainly intensify the competitive landscape, we think it will take AMZN considerable time to compete on the same scale as the incumbents since there are over 20k pharmacies among CVS, WBA, and RAD vs. only 350 Whole Foods locations if AMZN were to start at its grocery stores. It would make more sense for AMZN to acquire a regional drug retailer like RAD to quickly establish a physical presence.""***

So, talk among analysts and the media of a potential acquisition of Rite Aid seems to be gaining some traction.  It's not just chatter in forums any longer."
2021-06-13 11:27:41,wallstreetbets,Oh wow! So is Amazon hinting at delivering rite aid prescriptions?
2021-06-13 11:28:07,wallstreetbets,One company to rule them all.
2021-06-13 11:20:46,wallstreetbets,"Home delivery is already a thing for prescriptions, you know that right? 

But that does bring up an important point that Amazon has less physical stores if you don’t trust your porch. Rx are expensive and the liability of leaving 10s of thousands sitting on a porch might not be something Amazon wants to deal with either. People cant always wait for a claims process to finish while figuring out what happened to their life saving medication."
2021-06-13 13:09:22,wallstreetbets,Ever heard of ‘signature requirement’?
2021-06-13 13:14:16,wallstreetbets,The corporate stories are amazing.  😎👍
2021-06-13 10:37:39,wallstreetbets,No I mean read the rules and delete it.. I would hurry
2021-06-13 14:16:05,wallstreetbets,And in the darkness bind them
2021-06-13 13:43:27,wallstreetbets,"Signature requirement is seldom actually done and anyway for most people it makes it inconvenient.

In the past I’ve received prescriptions in the mail and via other carriers and they’re either left in the mailbox or simply left out but they weren’t controlled substances which I’m assuming I would hope have actual signature required.

We have Luxer lockers in my building but packages often wind up in the one big shared locker where they got pilfered or laying around outside the lockers because the lockers are full or because the delivery people don’t know how to deal with the lockers. 

Finally I have observed homeless people selling prescriptions apparently prearranged to people in nice cars. Hell I even saw a sign on the back of a road sign nearest CVS that said “will buy insulin call (number)”

So there is a brisk market for stolen medication (and sadly, sometimes even people’s own needed medication) and more delivery is only going to increase the problem."
2021-06-13 18:16:11,wallstreetbets,"You mean that thing that has been totally ignored and not enforced by anyone all of covid? It was already sub 90% at best before or ""John Smith"" or ""Left with neighbor"".

I've had firearms dropped at my doorstep coming back from warranty or custom work. Signature required my ass."

2021-06-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"WISH for next week I'm not going to talk about squeezing as I don't really know what the short positions are on WISH so I will let a smarter ape than me comment on how likely a rise from short coverage is. I just wanted to to point out that the average analyst price target is  over $18 a share so I picked up a bunch under $10 and I will likely pick up more on Monday

I've seen less talk about wish lately and more emphasis on uwmc. I have no problem with this as I've had a ton of shares in that turd for the last 8 months. However, I just wanted to point out to people that despite the current meme status of WISH, there is a lot of real potential and value in the stock. You can buy shares with the hopes of a short cover and still be glad you did long term regardless of what happens in the next few weeks

Someone please correct me if I'm wrong, but the general consensus seems to be that people like getting counterfeit Chinese garbage delivered slowly...I'm not usually their target demographic but after all the feedback from wsb members, there's actually a lot of crap I want to try ordering now...specifically fishing gear.

At this point I don't have that many shares and I bought low so I have no reason to pump the stock, so someone please let me know if there is something I'm not seeing. Because it seriously looks like this stock could have potential for a lot of gains in the next 5 years.

If nobody can convince me that WISH isn't going to rise, I think I will have to buy more shares and some leap options on Monday

Have a great weekend apes

It isn't netting increased customers, so the acquisition of new customers is killing their business and then people aren't staying on their platform in favor of other e commerce.
It is very encouraging their revenue from sales is so large in comparison to how Amazon's margins were so slim back in 1999-2000. But the marketing cost is too high. 

Luckily they have cash on hand for a 200million loss to stay afloat for 6 years.

But cheap mirror tiles or led strips or something just to try for random reasons. Sure wish can fulfill that just fine.
The wait can't vary from few days to several weeks.

2021-06-13 14:02:39,wallstreetbets,"Based on the limited research I have done, WISH looks great but they need to work on customer service and product delivery. I don't think its the WISH company itself, but the vendors who use the WISH platform, which many are Chinese and low quality from what I read. Customer service seems almost non existent too. I checked recent reviews since beginning of the year and they surprisngly have the majority as 1 star from the US only? I have to do more research but the facts are the company with the current reported financials seems to have great potential and their share price does not represent what they are currrntly worth."

2021-06-13 12:19:59,wallstreetbets,Couldn’t agree more.. imaging what WSB rocket fuel can do to an extremely undervalued company like WISH

2021-06-13 11:22:19,wallstreetbets,"I’m in too. Wish actually do have solid foundation with 10% of insiders holding its shares and it’s backed by Singapore Government Temasek Holding with close to 9%. Morgan Stanley, Vanguard, BlackRock, JPMorgan all part of it’s shareholders."
2021-06-13 16:42:53,wallstreetbets,Agree... I was deep in UWMC then started looking at WISH.  I think both companies have very positive futures so I reduced my UWMC to have position in WISH.  Again I like both companies but UWMC has analysts suggesting it is worth $10-$12.  WISH has suggestions of $18 to 30.  I don't shop at the Dollar store but that doesnt mean a ton of other people don't.   I will gladly invest in a bigger version of the Dollar store even if I never use it personally.
2021-06-13 11:36:17,wallstreetbets,lmao there’s nothing safe about wish it’s a meme stock. even in terms of fundamentals it’s a terrible company with zero quality control
2021-06-13 13:14:14,wallstreetbets,The most underestimated news for Wish is the uncertainty over the breakup of Amazon. Wish appears to be in the best position to take advantage of it.
2021-06-13 10:44:25,wallstreetbets,Ok poomper

2021-06-13 13:50:36,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-13 16:47:21,wallstreetbets,$50 has a lot of sound coverage.  I haven't seen $100 in the next year but I also didn't believe in those other two companies that hit $75 and $400 this year
2021-06-13 11:27:26,wallstreetbets,"I believe there's room for growth and before the growth stocks derailed, it was trending upward and received analyst price predictions much higher than 10 bucks. Perhaps wish is not a great business models but people really do like cheap crap so I think it will grow. See harbor freight for reference. Terrible company, terrible products, expanding like they're Walmart"
2021-06-13 12:38:38,wallstreetbets,Perhaps I should have waited until Monday or Tuesday to start a position but timing the market is for fools so I will average down if it goes red Monday
2021-06-13 16:15:44,wallstreetbets,"At least, should congress do anything about Big Tech monopoly, Wish is best positioned to profit from any anti-trust laws affecting Amazon. I expect bounces in $WISH on mere rumors coming from Washington."
2021-06-13 10:39:57,wallstreetbets,Those were cheap. Too bad you couldn't get more. I bought at $9.90
2021-06-13 10:43:55,wallstreetbets,Its dumping to $2 on Tuesday. Calling it now.
2021-06-13 12:13:59,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-06-13 10:22:42,wallstreetbets,It's down enough to have immediate gains if wsb targets it again. I just meant that the risk was lower since you would be a bagholder for a decent stock if no quick price action occurred
2021-06-13 11:01:14,wallstreetbets,You would be 100% wrong here. There is lots of holders of GME AMC that’s how this whole thing got started. Half this sub are holding. Hence the 💎🙌🏻 where do you think that started?
2021-06-13 10:17:56,wallstreetbets,Right ? Go to r/investing for that gay ish
2021-06-13 10:42:56,wallstreetbets,Not everything is a pump - but wish clearly is.
2021-06-13 15:05:05,wallstreetbets,"20 $ expires 6/18 even strikes option at 17, 18 are great buys currently. Obviously not financial advice. this is gambling but hey it beats buying a worthless lottery ticket at the local corner store."
2021-06-13 11:34:39,wallstreetbets,"Interesting, when is that from?"
2021-06-13 11:49:43,wallstreetbets,"Wish’s SI is only 10% because the lock-up has expired.  Bloomberg misread their prospectus, but I expect that to be corrected soon since the prospectus said 6/14 anyway (earlier of 6/14 or 180 days after filing S-1, which was May)."
2021-06-13 13:08:05,wallstreetbets,I'll check it out later. Thanks
2021-06-13 11:11:10,wallstreetbets,But why are you saying it will crash?  What gave you that idea? Do you have any information DD to back up what your saying?
2021-06-13 10:44:55,wallstreetbets,I'm not trying to unload anything. I have a small interest with a low purchase price and was looking for a discussion to help me decide if I should get more next week or if I'm missing something important. I can't speak for up voters
2021-06-13 10:13:38,wallstreetbets,It already did.
2021-06-13 10:29:44,wallstreetbets,I don't see it going much lower than $8 so 20 percent downside from here is an acceptable risk to me to possibly get a seat to the moon
2021-06-13 10:30:14,wallstreetbets,Buy puts and post your loss porn the following week
2021-06-13 11:08:42,wallstreetbets,Why?
2021-06-13 11:10:02,wallstreetbets,Why or where do you get that from?
2021-06-13 11:00:38,wallstreetbets,Doesn’t matter how low the stock gets shorted to. The fundamentals are solid so at some point the stock will catch up to them. Just keep DCA until that happens.

90% of people who recommend it have 4 month old accounts and never post screenshots of their positions, it's a shitty pump and dump."

2021-06-13 11:40:22,wallstreetbets,"Lol, Wish is a platforms for sales to direct deal with buyers. Wish only provided logistics and a place for buyers and sellers to deal. It doesn’t provide control on items selling in its platform. You Got What You Paid For :)"

2021-06-13 13:00:28,wallstreetbets,That's fair. I grabbed the last of the shares I could afford Friday with the same advice in mind (don't try to get too clever timing the market).
2021-06-13 10:42:26,wallstreetbets,"yeah, usually when i see meme stocks, i do some judging,  and if i like it, pick up like 10 shares and see how it does. 

depends on how much i have on hand when im hunting for buys"
2021-06-13 10:55:51,wallstreetbets,In your dream maybe 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-13 10:59:30,wallstreetbets,"Why?  Do you have a reason, or just like to shit post for dramatic effect?"
2021-06-13 11:35:51,wallstreetbets,"Well show your short positions then, or stop shitting on people with long positions. 

Oh wait, I assume your not confident enough about your $2 call to actually bet money on it.

By the way, I am not a big fan of wish myself but I'd definately buy the shit out of this stock if it was to get dumped to $2."
2021-06-13 10:24:35,wallstreetbets,"Yes it’s risk is lower, but if you’ve noticed the guys here apparently have ADHD now and can’t focus on anything fir more then 5 mins, they’ve been pumping 18 different stocks this week so targeting isn’t likely"
2021-06-13 11:11:19,wallstreetbets,"You mean bag holders that got stuck after the dump. Most of us cashed out near the peak and have been day trading it ever since, no one smart is diamond handing anything. Here’s a tip, when someone demands diamond hands look through their profile, you’ll see typically they either don’t have shares or got stuck buying in too high.

Also realize this sub has been around far longer then the GME craze and it’s purpose has never changed, only new investors came and thought they could change its intent."
2021-06-13 11:07:53,wallstreetbets,Where do you get that point of view from?  Have your done any DD on the stock?  Have you seen their financials?  Or you just here to spread some unfounded doubt ?
2021-06-13 17:26:50,wallstreetbets,"$20 SP with in 5 days expiry! Man....

I need to learn how to play options because that is crazy risky

Why not go a few months out? Why risk expiring so soon?"
2021-06-13 11:47:43,wallstreetbets,Ya that's from before may 15th when float was only 60M. Float is now 463M.
2021-06-13 12:03:45,wallstreetbets,"Yes, these are my findings as well. Lock up expired."
2021-06-13 11:22:58,wallstreetbets,"It's supply and demand. Price consolidated around $8 because it's been reported that was the price the insiders paid. The insider trading history is nothing but sales, no one who works there is buying it. The market was getting ready for the insiders to dump before this whole pump. That's suspicious as fuck. Insiders have to be astroturfing WSB."
2021-06-13 10:46:05,wallstreetbets,Yeah you're missing something HUGE. On Tuesday the remaining shares leave lockup - the market us going to be flooded with those shares. Good luck seeing a green day for the next couple of years.
2021-06-13 10:44:13,wallstreetbets,That was a tank for ants!
2021-06-13 15:05:55,wallstreetbets,between the multiple incoming class action lawsuits and the expected low to no earnings? idk its a thing.
2021-06-13 12:56:09,wallstreetbets,They are the world's leader in advertising bongs and butt plugs. How dare you speak about WISH that way.

EDIT: Unless an echo chamber is what you’re looking for that is…"
2021-06-13 13:13:52,wallstreetbets,Where do you guys get this shit. I use wish all the time to find sweet shit for my cars I can't find anywhere else. I got shares at the IPO because I can see the potential for the company. Just keep scrolling troll go pump game at 300 and AMC over 50 those are the pump and dumps this stock actually has mad potential.
2021-06-13 19:29:16,wallstreetbets,Hey! I heard they got delivery time down to 4 months! So there’s that for good news.
2021-06-13 14:22:04,wallstreetbets,"Yea but what you described is like every swap meet in existence. Some people like to spend their money on trash. Additionally 5 top 1000 analyst have it as a buy on tipranks. People who get paid big bucks to analyze companies, and not some weird neck beard on the internet who’s afraid to take his shirt off at a pool."
2021-06-13 16:05:40,wallstreetbets,Why do all the Wish apps have 4.5-5 stars on the App Store…
2021-06-13 13:11:15,wallstreetbets,"Total garbage. Can't believe people are pumping this shit. Trashy website, selling trash copycat products. Wouldn't be surprised if half that garbage is made in child slave labor factories.."

2021-06-13 13:16:01,wallstreetbets,Yes numerous times just got a package wendsday and have 3 More on the way lots of chicks love it young ppl to but go buy game at 300
2021-06-13 15:15:33,wallstreetbets,Right?? I do not understand the support for such a garbage site.
2021-06-13 12:37:28,wallstreetbets,"Damn, didn’t realize I’d find the guy smarter and more business savvy than both Jack Ma AND Jeff Bezos. Who is our hero? Can I see your Facebook? Would love to put face on the guy who I only imagine is secretly the richest man in the world? Which guy on Forbes richest 100 list are you?"
2021-06-13 16:45:21,wallstreetbets,I like Coke more than Pepsi.  That doesn't mean other people don't like Pepsi.  I don't go to garage sales either but they are huge in the US.  Your comment is lame to suggest that because a product is cheap that the company doesnt have a huge future.  They dont make the products.
2021-06-13 12:07:51,wallstreetbets,Yep just like Amazon. Most of the stuff bought is from droppshippers from China
2021-06-13 11:47:55,wallstreetbets,yea well maybe that’s the problem doofus lol
2021-06-13 13:16:58,wallstreetbets,It's bs hating
2021-06-13 13:37:46,wallstreetbets,"🤦‍♂️i really didn’t think i’d need to explain why it’s bad but i guess there are a lot of people like you here. if you’ve ever used wish it should be pretty obvious to you they have ZERO control over product quality. that means unhappy customers, which believe it or not, is REALLY BAD in ecommerce"
2021-06-13 16:00:16,wallstreetbets,"Short term is unpredictable. Long term. Their continued growth suggests they'll reach the same range as other utlity oriented social media like Uber, Lyft, abnb, even youtube has an estimated mkt cap of 100 Bn"
2021-06-13 10:53:44,wallstreetbets,that's what I also used to do.. I went from having 26 different stocks all various amounts of shares but got it down to 12.. 3 I will never be able to sell because I pre bought at the IPO.. and they went down like my mom on a man with a mustache
2021-06-13 10:45:42,wallstreetbets,I'm similar in that I rarely go deeper than 1 percent of my portfolio
2021-06-13 11:01:08,wallstreetbets,Lockup expires and the insiders that are holding get to finally sell. All the wish posts on here look like insiders trying to pump up the value before they sell.
2021-06-13 10:27:23,wallstreetbets,"It's because nobody wants to buy something that already pumped a little so everyone wants to pump the stocks that haven't been looked at, that they bought cheap calls for. However, lot of people with 06/18 WISH calls so I think you will see some pumping. I barely have any so I legitimately wanted to start a discussion and see if I should buy more"
2021-06-13 11:27:25,wallstreetbets,"Cashed out near the peak.  So you cashed out when it was 30$ 6 months ago?  This sub had 700,000 the day before GME. Then shot up to 4,000,000 in 12 hours. Now it’s over 10,000,000 90% of this sub have only been here less than a year. 
So what was its purpose?  
I never bought GME or AMC. I didn’t see the value in use companies. But GME is 300$ a share. Not worth it based on their financials.  But when I looked into wish their  up 75% from their 4q last year.  So I thought seems like a good pickup at 9:50 a share.  Considering when they were losing money they were 24-30 a share."

2021-06-13 17:33:02,wallstreetbets,Hmmm 🤔 perhaps I should but I’m also just getting into options myself. So there is that :P
2021-06-13 11:31:45,wallstreetbets,So you think insiders will dump at $10 when they paid 8 and analysts are calling for upward movement of 80 percent in next year? It's possible but seems unlikely to me
2021-06-13 11:54:36,wallstreetbets,Yes I can see the insiders from Morgan Stanley need the WSB sub to help them make profits.
2021-06-13 10:49:57,wallstreetbets,"Did WISH do something to hurt you? Show me on the doll where wish touched you. Seriously though, you're running around crapping on wish like it's your job.

2021-06-13 13:41:43,wallstreetbets,Then you get an instant refund and wish let's you keep the product!!!!! When I had to return something on eBay I had time get my money back from the seller and they ignored me plus I had the hassle of returning the package!!!! The bs associated with counterfeit items and returns is unbelievable I had to take a picture of the item that was sent wrong boom instant refund and got to keep the product anyway 🙄

2021-06-13 11:41:31,wallstreetbets,The draft prospectus you may have seen got changed at a later date - and the prospectus says in big red letters that that change was a risk.
2021-06-13 10:38:50,wallstreetbets,"Pretty low downside compared to other memes. Gme is worth about 5 bucks at most and amc is right around there too. If apes stop holding and shorts prevail, huge downside potential. Of course it looks like that won't happen anytime soon so I'm going to hold amc too"
2021-06-13 11:42:43,wallstreetbets,"What are they doing illegal? I just wanted a discussion to help me decide if I want to put more into this. I just thought it was odd that you were coming at it so hard. I don't think insiders would want to unload their shares at 10 bucks but you could be right. If it drops significantly Monday, I will consider taking a bigger long position. Thanks for the input"
2021-06-13 17:45:21,wallstreetbets,I’m embracing something that’s for sure. Glad to be welcomed. I’ll be sure to buy you a Lamborghini with my earnings. (A promise I see a lot in this forum which begs the question how many have delivered yet? 😝)
2021-06-13 13:52:18,wallstreetbets,You should visit r/wish ….
2021-06-13 11:06:01,wallstreetbets,You would be 100% wrong here. There is lots of holders of GME AMC that’s how this whole thing got started. Half this sub are holding. Hence the 💎🙌🏻 where do you think that started?  I’d love to see the GME AMC holders sell Monday and buy WISH. That would defiantly 4X everyone and force the shorts before the usual 10 am dip.  But you can’t move an APE once they are holding.
2021-06-13 11:48:49,wallstreetbets,Wait to see the price on Wednesday before deciding
2021-06-13 11:23:56,wallstreetbets,Fair enough but that's kind of what I said. I was just making the point that the only value in those stocks above 10 bucks is ape power and you never know how that will play out long term
2021-06-13 11:57:40,wallstreetbets,So you think it tanks on Tuesday? Why would insiders sell this low?
2021-06-13 11:58:57,wallstreetbets,Because it's been - and will go - lower.
2021-06-13 12:01:45,wallstreetbets,That logic is not very sound. It went lower with the majority of growth stocks that hit highs and have been getting punished for awhile. Why would a ton of insiders bail because of the short term price fluctuations? Not saying you're wrong but that was a pretty weak explanation

2021-06-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks! This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. I have also added the Week-on-Week stock price change due to popular requests. 

The market, in general, has continued to rally strongly and it has been a pretty good week for investors. The top growing stocks I [shared last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ntlyqy/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) had made an average return of 6.6% with Workhorse Group making a whopping 19% return in one week! Now, let’s jump right into this week’s list!

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/p9znai9z91571.png?width=1042&format=png&auto=webp&s=064000d3d54a7e847dc1bec4905f9380db5e05c8

AMC and BB are now the top 2 most discussed stock! Both generated almost the same amount of discussion, but investors, in general, were more bullish about Blackberry as reflected in the sentiment. The returns on both the stocks were muted with AMC and BB returning just 3% and 2% respectively. ECommerce platform ContextLogic(WISH) had a wild ride with the stock rising 90% and then dropping 46% over the next two days. Investor returns wise, Clover health is the front runner returning an insane 67% in one week. Also, Tesla dropped out of the top 10 list for the first time in 2021!

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/s5j78yn0a1571.png?width=1233&format=png&auto=webp&s=241763eda48057740436f648ba342b56a7999cd4)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.

**Wendys($WEN):** This was definitely a long time coming. Wendys shares soared more than 19% on Tuesday after the company became a meme stock in Reddit. There was no new fundamental news from the company that changed the investment perspective other than an announcement that the company will bring back its popular Summer Strawberry Chicken Salad.

**Clover Health($CLOV):** had its best week yet since inception with the stock returning 67% in just one week. Reddit investors sparked another rally with the stock price soaring more than 200% and then fell sharply! The stock was trading at 6 times the normal volume. Even though the company has an optimistic business model, the current rally was predominantly driven by CLOV’s high short interest (43%)!

**Senseonics Holdings($SENS):** $SENS exploded in mentions and the stock jumped 22% during intraday trading without any new news from the company. Its a small Maryland-based pharma company, which specializes in the development of products made to ease the burden of diabetes monitoring. The company had announced news of a promising trial but that was long back. The current rally was majorly based on its short interest (25%) and increasing chatter!

**Clean Energy Fuels($CLNE):** $CLNE had a wild week with the stock shooting up 31% on Wednesday due to the retail crowd but then promptly tumbled 17% in Thursday afternoon trading. The drop was due to the information that its largest shareholder reduced their stake in the company by 1.25 Million shares. The retail crowd is still extremely bullish on the stock as seen by the sentiment.

**Invesco Mortgage($IVR):** The company had a spectacular crash at the beginning of the pandemic with the shares losing almost 90% of its value. It has been growing slowly over the past few months. The stock was trending in relation to the current uncertainty regarding inflation rates and how Fed is going to adjust its rates.

**Honorable Mentions:** ContextLogic($WISH) chatter grew by 487% and UWM Holdings($UWMC) by 373% but were not high enough to make the top 5 list. Another interesting finding from my program is that mentions of CPI (Consumer Price Index) grew by more than 900% last week showcasing the rising discussion about inflation and its impact among investors.

Hope you enjoyed this week’s top stocks issue!

2021-06-13 11:01:48,wallstreetbets,"SENS announced their trial results a week ago. How is that ""a long back"", as you put it? Short interest was part of it, but the news is relevant here, even if the response was (slightly) delayed. 


It's just like how FEYE dropped initially when they announced the sale of part of their business (sold the news), people realized they'd have 1.6b cash on hand, and then it's been rising ever since (bought the news because selling this news was absolutely retarded)."

2021-06-13 15:14:53,wallstreetbets,Also pushed by Wendy's the company themselves. They're savvy at social media marketing (see twitter account)

2021-06-13 18:04:02,wallstreetbets,Eat my DingDong you Twinkie.
2021-06-13 17:38:26,wallstreetbets,"Check out the Delta on those options.  The 40 strike right now has a Delta of .7718 with open interest of 107,077 (easily the most significant strike likely to expire ITM).  Those calls represent 10,707,700 shares.  Of those, 8,264,202 are already owned if the sellers are Delta neutral.  So they need to buy 2,443,497 by Friday.  Won't be all at once as Delta will gradually increase closer to expiration.  

But check out the open interest on 300%+ IV strikes above 60, with high Delta considering how far OTM it is.  Let's just look at the 73 strike.  Open interest of 31,895 with Delta of .2754.  Implies shares owned if 100% Delta neutral, is 878,388.  All of those will be sold over the next week.  

That's just 1 strike.  There are many, many strikes far OTM that will expire OTM.  For example the furthest OTM strike, $145, has open interest of 41,929 and Delta of .0465 which implies they're secured by almost 200,000 shares.  Those are definitely getting sold.

Looking up and down the options chain it looks like there's more OTM than ITM (if we strip out ITM options with deltas already at .99).  And the selling may create a negative Gamma ramp.  If it goes below 40 (I don't think it will), Holy fucking shit, look out below.

Edit: I'm pretending covered calls and spreads don't exist because they make a back-of-the-napkin calculation harder.  And the Gamma squad pretends they don't exist also so whatever."

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

2021-06-13 14:00:59,wallstreetbets,I watched them and others use CLOV as a pump and dump last week. Their position in AMC is the roulette equivalent of putting chips on every number. They’re hedging their bets. Precarious position to be in for them.  They’re going to take a loss no matter what happens to AMC. They’re just minimizing the loss. CLOV is like their ATM though.
2021-06-13 11:46:48,wallstreetbets,No other stock get as much backlash as CLOV does. Makes sense how much it’s shorted. Far more than any of these meme stocks. Proves it’s the right buy and due to how much HFs have invested against it I doubt any of these accounts are real that ate backlashing it. Their wallets go deep their resources endless.
2021-06-13 12:22:22,wallstreetbets,Look at the purchase dates. That is key. They are *cough hedging their bets.

2021-06-13 14:02:20,wallstreetbets,"Personally, I see $100 as very realistic. If you combine the >40% short interest with the fact that about 1/4th of the shares can't even be sold until it closes at $30 for 90 consecutive days, you're basically looking at a powder keg. I think once it hits $30, it will be a matter of days before it hits $100 because not only will shorts start to cut their losses by covering, but they'll be getting margin calls, forcing them to cover."
2021-06-13 12:14:41,wallstreetbets,Might be. For me is AMC the better play since I can here effort more shares.
2021-06-13 17:35:52,wallstreetbets,This is why it's the next play. Stocks need controversy to get shorts. Others don't have enough shorts to squeeze.

There are many companies out there to choose from that you can invest your money in. Who’s to say one is better than the other. Is AMC worth 50?!

Sure it’s great for the dating world but it’s just a freaking app and It is sitting at 47.62.. 
Ok, COUPANG  did over 42 billion of revenue in 1 quarter!! Sure, they didn’t show profit because they had to spend the profits to make money! Expanding cost money, infrastructure, logistics, planning, vehicle fleets and hiring employees etc. It takes time for sure but the results is what investors want! They are putting things together in Singapore and they just opened up as a testing in the Japanese market of Tokyo! Big things to come from COUPANG!!

Not an easy one to analyse. On the DAILY chart:  We see an Impulse 12345 down. Is now possibly at end of B(?)  DOWN  (white) in corrective ABC wave IV UP (orange). The next one would be C UP (white), expected to reach the grey zone (in the blue rectangle). Next is the downturn in wave V DOWN. MACD indicator is at a junction, which means it is uncertain if this will turn up or down. This is where the next chart comes up as an alternative reading.

[Elliottwave analysis of RIDE IMPULSE 123 \[4\]  UP](https://preview.redd.it/26w0osza11571.png?width=2732&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3435e1be41ced7c168e0965dd0f00f86503da8a)

[Alternative reading A \[B\] Down](https://preview.redd.it/stbccwoi21571.png?width=2732&format=png&auto=webp&s=9abf64ce62bab5cb7a74fba0884c19dfd3b1bf0a)

In this reading, RIDE is in a corrective wave ABC and currently in ((C)) (orange) and in that C wave subdivided in smaller ABC, there possibly already in (C) (blue), subdivided in a smaller 12345, now possibly at start of \[2\] UP (green). The MACD turning down soon is confirmation. RIDE in this scenario would be aiming for 6.69 - 4.70 or lower.

Conclusion: at this moment it could go either way. If  LONG in, I would stop loss at 8.91 currently the B low point."

2021-06-13 09:39:17,wallstreetbets,You spend all this time reading the chart and drawing on it only to have “is this the top of B wave?” Meaning if you bought puts now then they burn with theta in case it’s not the top of B. So how can you trade this with any conviction? Think about the hours you spend on the chart vs the hours you could’ve spend on something else … TA is nice but at some point it becomes not worth the time spent on it

It only went to 8.91 on FUD, that re-emerged with price at 15.81 on a recycled fear about a startup that needed some money to reach “full scale” production of the Endurance."

2021-06-13 12:47:27,wallstreetbets,"No that was just fake reporting. They made the decision to build their frames in house because steel and everything has gone up so it was going to hurt their margins. (Plus GM left them a lot of robots used for that so it wasn't that expensive) 

They also bought all the microchips for their cars up front because they didn't want to run out like some other manufacturers. 

So basically those 2 things made them spend more money (which they opted to do because they know a loan is coming, they just can't disclose it). And they said ""if we do not get more funding we will make 1000 less trucks this year, but if we do then full production is back on"".

The loan is a govornent ATVM loan which Is the best money you can get so that's why they are waiting and not just taking an asset loan on their factory which they could do in a heartbeat. (Still 550million on hand, they are far from poor)"

&#x200B;

I'm going to tell you why Cemex (CX) is the play that will win back all the money you somehow lost during this insane bull run of a stock market. You might be asking, ""the fuck I want to buy Mexican concrete stocks?"". To which I would face palm and say, ""Okay let me do your DD for you"". Cemex is the largest ready-mix concrete company and one of the largest aggregates companies *in the world*. The company generates roughly 24% of sales in Europe, 23% in Mexico, 30% in the United States, 13% in South America and the Caribbean, and 11% in Asia, Middle East, and Africa. So when you buy Cemex stock, you're buying into a multi-national holding company that is headquartered in Mexico and that is primarily engaged in the production, distribution, marketing and sale of cement, ready-mix concrete, aggregates and clinker. Is it clinking yet? 👉🧠

&#x200B;

You've probably heard about the steel shortage. Concrete is *the* most used building material in the world. And demand has been so insane that supply can't keep up. Here let me spoon feed this for you.

 [There’s a cement shortage, too? Yes. And it halted road repairs in northern Idaho. | Local | magicvalley.com](https://magicvalley.com/news/local/there-s-a-cement-shortage-too-yes-and-it-halted-road-repairs-in-northern-idaho/article_ed2ac4b7-6c7b-5d7a-a366-d2288f578088.html) 

 [Contractors now facing cement shortage across Texas (kxxv.com)](https://www.kxxv.com/brazos/contractors-now-facing-cement-shortage-across-texas) 

But while other companies are spilling the spaghetti on this opportunity of a lifetime, Cemex is running ahead of it to come out on top. They've been opening up shuttered plants left and right faster than you open up behind the Wendy's. For those who like movies, enjoy.

 [(426) Good News for CEMEX Customers Along the Gulf Coast - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69tspN9QUcM) 

&#x200B;

Cemex has also been insanely innovative. You remember how those self-serve kiosks and in-app orders took your job at McDonalds and made the company extra profit by cutting labor hours? Cemex just unveiled their CemexGo, making it easier for people to place orders on their phone. Now ordering construction materials is as easy as ordering tendies.

 [(426) Ready... Mix... Go! Ready When You Are. - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSG7BhXlHf8) 

&#x200B;

You may have heard that cement production is bad for the environment. Guess who recently unveiled and produces the industries first net-zero CO2 concrete? That's right. Cemex. Bitches.

 [Vertua Net-Zero CO2 Concrete - CEMEX](https://www.cemex.com/sustainability/climate-action/vertua-net-zero-carbon-concrete) 

With all the talk of going green and infrastructure spending, Cemex looks to win big if the Green Deal gets passed in the European Union.

&#x200B;

Did you know that Cemex's last earnings report had them with an quarter over quarter earnings per share of 1475.90%. You can keep throwing money at overpriced stocks with no profits, or throw money at at underpriced stock with profits. Tech stocks are retardedly overvalued, but Cemex has a relatively low P/E ratio. People love the CEO. He gets a 89% approval rating from Glassdoor respondents.

 [CEMEX Reviews | Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/CEMEX-Reviews-E10918.htm) 

&#x200B;

Did you know the U.S. is also looking to pass an infrastructure bill? Boom to the moon more profits.

I'm not the only one who thinks so, there was a Cemex DD not too long ago. Pretty soon this sub will be full of gain porn.

2021-06-13 11:35:36,wallstreetbets,"Certainly. They've been aggressively paying off debts debts accrued when they overextended themselves in the past. The pandemic financial environment has been great because they've been able to renegotiate debts for cheap, continue to operate as a essential industry, suspend their dividend, continue to buy back stocks, and take advantage of extreme demand while restarting operations where there previously has been a lack of demand. The seeds they had sown with the investments that caused a lot of these debts are finally paying off.

Tesla's debt to equity ration was as high as 1.279 in June of 2020. It is at 0.41 as of March 2021. Cemex's debt to equity ration was as high as 1.625 in September 2020. It is at 1.06 as of March 2021. Not saying CX will explode as much as Tesla did, for other obvious reasons. But just want to show that CX has been aggressively paying off debt in recent quarters. For comparison, CLF currently has a debt to equity ratio of 2.4.

Still lower stock price than where it was back in 2002.  That's 2 decades.  That's ""a while"".

4x since last year means ""1 year"".

Two different things. That should be simple enough for you to get it (hopefully).  Cheers!"
2021-06-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Voice of Reason: Take profits! Our record stock market highs right now are not caused by a healthy economy,

but the fact that much of the loaned money goes into stocks

which artificially drive up their value. (This is known as “asset inflation”. No wealth is being created here, the numbers are just being unnaturally propped up by the money printing)

So it's imperative that you take profits. I know diamond handers won't ever sell, but if I can reach one poor soul to wake up, and to put their profits into assets that will hold it's value.

And if you just prefer stocks, even putting them in say, companies that will be around 20 years from now would be far less risky, such as Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft ect.

The alternative is to completely chance it and see how long you can ride this bubble, but the odds are totally stacked against you. You will never be rich this way.

2021-06-13 11:04:01,wallstreetbets,I segment long term holds in one account and casino bets in another account. Keeps things nice and tidy. It's retarded not to take profits at 100%+ on meme stocks but that has to be balanced with the fact that scared money makes no money.
2021-06-13 10:25:56,wallstreetbets,I'm taking the opposite approach.. Buying calls on everything and using all the margin available! Selling when my account has enough zeros to buy the $ 200 dollar bag of coffee and $90 dollar gallon of milk that we are inevitably going to see in 5-10 years.
2021-06-13 08:49:36,wallstreetbets,Cool story bro

It’s a win-win scenario, especially since options basically give you leverage, so the loss on the hedged position gets covered by the gains in the other.

Of course, we may trade sideways, which would kinda fuck my ass and spread my anus wide for the crab market to stir up my guts. But there’s no free money in investing, so I just hope this won’t happen"

2021-06-13 13:58:37,wallstreetbets,Yeah that's fair. I think options are pretty straightforward when you're just looking at calls and puts but I guess it is pretty easy to end up tits up.

2021-06-13 14:02:23,wallstreetbets,I don't underestimate that IV as I just went all in on AMC $55 calls on Friday afternoon.
2021-06-13 14:03:06,wallstreetbets,How to see options: there is no free money dumb ass read a book
2021-06-13 12:06:28,wallstreetbets,Right! I was like there not expired yet….
2021-06-13 14:09:54,wallstreetbets,"Could go either way this coming week imo, best of luck! Sitting on 100 shares still."
2021-06-13 14:09:43,wallstreetbets,"I think that people make three major mistakes with options.

1 They buy them way to deep OTM to save money. Stocks trading at $50 and they buy with a strike of $100 hoping it runs up to $125. 

2 They don't understand time in relation to options. If I ask you about the Greeks and you say shit I love 300, don't touch weeklies. They also think that they have until expiration to sell. If you are banking on the last few days to bring you ITM, you should probably cut your losses.

3 They are greedy shits. If your way the fuck up either sell or set a stop loss where your still up so when it inevitably craters after the peak you still walkway with a little extra cash.

Only times I've lost money on options is when I make one of these mistakes."
2021-06-13 14:11:24,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I'm not holding through the madness. I'm probably out Monday morning, win or lose. If they go nuts I might hold into Tuesday. But I'm jacked to the tits for tomorrow morning."
2021-06-13 14:22:54,wallstreetbets,"Not trying to be sarcastic, so you have never been wrong about a stock pick? Your losses are just from the 3 rules you posted?"

2021-06-13 07:03:18,wallstreetbets,Why
2021-06-13 07:44:16,wallstreetbets,"I had similar gut feelings for later in year, so bought a few thousand in october/nov VIX calls and SPY puts.  Hope the world ends for you next week(s) though or you are pretty much cream pied."
2021-06-13 09:57:34,wallstreetbets,"Fake and 🌈 market keeps going the wrong direction. Sorry for your loss. I've been playing this with SPX puts that I only hold for a few minutes or up to one day max cos every fucking dip is bought in this fake and 🌈 market.

And I never hold overnight cos fake and 🌈 futures always go up overnight."
2021-06-13 08:21:41,wallstreetbets,"My apology is owed to u/thinkMonthly. I misread this post this morning and made a snarky comment (which has since been deleted) about this trade. 

I was wrong with the misrepresentation of the trade and the tone of the comment. I apologize for my rudeness."
2021-06-13 07:10:43,wallstreetbets,did you buy them cuz investment banks and hedgefks bought tons of puts on HYG for next week??
2021-06-13 08:59:38,wallstreetbets,You know how triple leverage etfs work?
2021-06-13 07:45:15,wallstreetbets,Imagine everything is going to open in the near future and people get back to their normal life soon meanwhile there are some people think market will crash because of little inflation and shit!
2021-06-13 07:56:33,wallstreetbets,"OK life lesson. Inverse ETFs were designed to have a short lifespan with stock splits built in. They are used to hedge long plays not to be the basis of an entire play! You ideally don't want to be holding one for more then a week or two.

As for people in the comments, ""country gonna reopen all good shit no crash.""  The country will reopen during flu season, people will get sick at offices freak the fuck out and refuse to go back to the office. It will create an interesting affect for the government and should covid cases start spiking the government will shut us back down.. that is the concern for a crash. Not reopening but the people's response to it.

Lots of people have enjoyed sitting on their ass collecting free shit and even more have enjoyed remote work. The new normal is going to look different."

2021-06-13 08:53:46,wallstreetbets,I can't tell you how much i lost with these plays. Until papa Powell pulls the plug this aint happening.
2021-06-13 10:22:04,wallstreetbets,I think there is a good chance of pullback Tuesday due to the producer price index numbers that come out a lil inflation scare. Then on Wednesday I’m sure he won’t but if Jerome Powell talks about tapering that could really spook markets to a 5 to 10 percent correction. But most likely a lil inflation worries Tuesday and Jerome calms markets Wednesday saying it’s transitory
2021-06-13 14:04:10,wallstreetbets,Never short the spy.
2021-06-13 07:22:51,wallstreetbets,This seems all sorts of insane to me.

2021-06-13 15:58:30,wallstreetbets,"inflation good for stock market anyway…its priced in fuckin dollars. 

it is not good for your savings account"
2021-06-13 12:47:45,wallstreetbets,While that is true in some situations holding TQQQ over QQQ netted much larger returns over a long holding periods. Even with all the fees and rebalancing. So triple leveraged ETFs are a good long term investment in a bull market.

1. Spxs is a 3x inverse of spy

2. Why would you buy calls on something at an all time high???"
2021-06-13 07:51:40,wallstreetbets,"SPXS is an inverse ETP. It moves in the reverse of SPY. So if SPY and the market as a whole eat shit, this moons. SPY being at an all time high is why this is at an all time low. It's also triple leverage so if the market does take a dive in the shitter he will be rich."
2021-06-13 07:42:34,wallstreetbets,Please tell me you’re kidding. I just never know anymore.
2021-06-13 07:48:36,wallstreetbets,Rethink this.
2021-06-13 08:01:24,wallstreetbets,Being incorrect is not what I'm faulting you for. It's the strident condescension with which you stated it is the problem.
2021-06-13 07:52:09,wallstreetbets,"Based on what and if you are certain of that, why so many DTE?

EDIT: Just checked and those are calls for September are almost a third the price."
2021-06-13 07:57:10,wallstreetbets,But triple levered?
2021-06-13 07:44:35,wallstreetbets,"I do not know if you are correct here.  But I have been steadily trimming back my position because of the current record highs.  The paradox here is that although I do not believe a crash is  necessarily imminent, I am in a way contributing to a crash by pulling back.  As I assume many people will."

[Positions or GTFO](https://preview.redd.it/26w88p88j0571.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=693eb93762291535f9749f353c42f1788521ad16)

\- Ehang is going to facilitate the transportation of millions. Imagine having a man-sized DJI Mavic where you just take a seat and fly to your destination automatically. 

\- The airworthiness approval may come sooner than expected (fall 2021)

\- The next is the upcoming VIVA TECH event in Europe (June 16 - 19). There will be many participants, but Ehang is likely to be the only one that is ready to fly humans around. Ehang estimate the UAM market will be worth $1trillion by 2040

\- You can witness a Competition in the field of EV. Starting at Tesla to NIO to General Motors trying to push through this oversupply on the market. Therefore the idea of flying electric cars, also known as air taxis has gained particular public attention. With still very little competition in this field there’s less risk to worry about but great potential to exploit. 

\- 50% of freefloat shorted

\- Even at 129,80$ a few weeks ago no insider sold his shares and no dilution happened. Insiders are convinced about the true share value which should be right now at around 8B marketcap = 150$ shareprice"

on one side, you have a company that has a TERRIBLE business plan and a one off service (no one is going to have their ancestry retested twice) and while they now offer a health potential risk based on DNA, it is not a renewable service.

on the other hand, they have the biggest by far DNA with full profile database and lots of pharma and research interrested.

basically terrible B2C and a B2B full of potential but no real plan yet.

Three hours before she's supposed to be coming over, I get a text. *""Hey, I'm out of gas, could you cashapp me some gas money""* 

I've never met this girl, and we've only exchanged like a dozen messages. I ask her how much she needs, since I figure it's probably just like $5 to get some gas in the tank and make it to and from my place. Nope. $30. She wants me to buy her whole tank.

I (stupidly) dumped my entire bank account into $10 calls for this week. Is the chance of a gamma squeeze pushing share price very high at least above 0, or would you guys say the options chain are mainly just hedges and/or a trap? Never did well on witching days in the past..

I know the chances are basically 0 for these $10 calls to hit but they're a penny each. Theta is a bitch but couldn't they at least go up to say, 2 or 3 cents each?"

2021-06-13 17:10:55,wallstreetbets,I'll try to let you know from the library computers
2021-06-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Have AMC shorts already covered enough to stop momentum ? **I know this may become a controversial post here so I want to preface my post with the following: I am not here to convince anyone of anything or to argue, I just want to make sure people are aware that some potentially important data may be missing from their research. This is also why I phrased the title of my post as a question, not an affirmation, since estimates can obviously be wrong.**

According to the ShortSight Screener (S3 Partners data: a reference on the Bloomberg Terminal): a decent amount of short covering may have already occured for AMC (short interest data).

I know Fintel is showing a higher short interest but they use outdated official data which is not updated often (and they use a different number for the float than S3 Partners and Yahoo Finance).

S3 Partners provides more frequent estimates of the short interest.

Again: I am not here to convince anyone of anything or to argue, I just want to make sure people are aware that some potentially important data may be missing from their research.

Disclaimer: Not financial advice. I have calls in WKHS, CLOV and \*ticker that can't be mentioned here\* because they are the most shorted stocks (in that order) according to my research. Since someone has already asked about what my research process was, I may make a more detailed post later on about how my research led me to WKHS, CLOV and \*ticker that can't be mentioned here\*.

2021-06-13 09:21:32,wallstreetbets,Hold and buy. 💪
2021-06-13 08:26:10,wallstreetbets,"I believe there’s been a lot swept under the rug on this one. That 100% run up a week back would’ve been either Fomo+gamma from the insane options chain, or a few shorts exiting. My money is on Fomo+gamma.

Well over 80% of the float is being held, and the options chain this week could bring that (if exercised) to over 100% of the float. The hedging for $73 will do that all on its own in my opinion.

Edit: when the MM are hedging for these calls, who do you think they need to buy them from? 🥲

It’s far from over.🚀🚀"
2021-06-13 11:37:22,wallstreetbets,"Hundreds of thousands of calls just expired ITM on Friday and AMC broke through the daily resistance with an increase in volume for two days. If anything, the reversal is happening early this week"

2021-06-13 06:35:50,wallstreetbets,AMC showed a nice First Green Day with good volume Friday and it held its gains. Pretty good chance of gapping up Monday morning.

2021-06-13 10:27:09,wallstreetbets,"if you look at the chart for it the last six months or so and add up the volume of shares traded it doesnt even come close to the amount that is said to be held by us investors compared to whats left available in the float ..so they are  non existent IMO- theres a lot of shares  that we currently own that for the most part aren't even real ..so if they are margin called from here on in they have to cover our invested assets which is why a lot of the days it spikes up. Now, its been holdind a pretty steady support level of $42 to $43 last week and a half...it has a very very high ceiling due to the bullshit fake shares these crooks are allowed to create in order to attempt to cover their shorts and puts gamble that didnt pay off...this is not financial advice Im a total dummy who diddles himself while I drool, but Im holding shares and calls to rape these corrupt shitbags"

2021-06-13 03:49:35,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, the AMC play has been remarkable for it’s poor initial setup from the start. Credit to the ape army. I wouldn’t bet against the ape army finding their way to a win but yes I believe it’s an uphill battle at this point. Ortex shows ~12% short interest.

Why is gaming important in the EV space? Just listen to Elon Musk drool over PS5 performance on road trips with autonomous driving & AMD. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl\_-bFNRJaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_-bFNRJaw)

But that IS NOT ALL: Valve will LAUNCH an AMD portable handheld soon! HL3 anyone???

(source: Chris, The Good Old Gamer): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFn6LzUFTTA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFn6LzUFTTA)

In essence not only the PS4, PS5, XBOX X & S, but also Valve is going FULL AMD.

Who do you think Ford, GM, Chrysler, BMW, Audi, Volkswagen, Renault/Nissan will go with?

[MERCEDES ALREADY MADE THEIR CHOICE.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dninScDsGno) You want a BENZ AMG??? You need AMD!!!

[AMD & MERCEDES AMG: Be the Changemaker](https://preview.redd.it/1o27ml9jzy471.jpg?width=1289&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=83cc982101a2836424ecabcfa053b1ed76353626)

**ENTERTAINMENT IS KEY and AMD is all over it**

Software will be tailored to AMD's processing pipeline. As an example, **Unreal Engine 5** ALREADY performs better on a 6800XT than it does on a RTX3080 (up to 12%  better, as per Digital Foundry's performance benchmark - see screenshot  and video link below).

[AMD 6800XT on left with 61fps - Nvidia RTX3080 on right with 56fps](https://preview.redd.it/eruzko9mwy471.jpg?width=1289&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5fcbb478a1bcc940bd8c564b5d6b6ace551aa401)

(digital foundry's benchmarks) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99VwDGyLg0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99VwDGyLg0)

Unreal Engine 5 (with Lumen) will make Nvidia Ray Tracing obsolete. This software solution is much more efficient at managing illumination, allowing it to work with non-RTX hardware.

Enthusiasts are pumped with AMD's Computex presentation, where Fidelity FX SuperResolution was shown. It aims  to provide up to 2x performance while super sampling images up to 4K. And the kicker is that this solution will be OPEN to ALL platforms, including NVIDIA GTX and Intel.

**Intel's Raja Koduri** (Head of Intel GPU, formerly an AMD employee) has already confirmed they are looking into AMD's Fidelity FSR (as per his tweet a few days ago). They want in!

**So yeah, AMD is the future of GAMING**

But on the stock analysis front, AMD has also begun its climb towards previous highs.

It made a huge recovery since my latest post, when it was trading around $72.

AMD is currently trading at a Price/Earnings multiple of 34, with a market cap of $98.7B

Nvidia is has a P/E of 84 (over twice as much), with a market cap of $444B (over 4 times more).

But when you look at AMD's latest financials, the differences shrink.

On Revenue, AMD has sales of $9.7B and net profits of $2.5B. Nvidia sold $16.6B for a net $4.3B.

How does that support Nvidia being over 4 times more expensive than AMD? **It just doesn't**.

If AMD were to trade at the same multiples: EPS of 2.38 \* NVIDIA's P/E of 84.28 = $200 per share.

At $200 per share, AMD's market cap would be $243B... STILL HALF OF NVIDIA!!!! (WTF?!?!).

Think about it, it is bound to close the distance towards $200 per share in the next 12 months.

The reasons are simple: Tesla, Valve, Unreal Engine 5, Ryzen 3D stacking and 50% growth for 2021.

The Xilinx deal WILL CLOSE in the next 6 months. THE BREAKOUT is IMMINENT!!!

To summarize, the product pipeline is AMAZING, not to mention the leaks on RDNA3 and Ryzen 4.

The new clientele is incredible: TESLA and Valve, added to Microsoft and Sony, with more coming!

Add the Xilinx FPGA accelerators integrated to AMD's Intellectual Property and fuel the rockets!!!

**REMEMBER:** In a matter of months you will be kicking yourself for ignoring this post!

The MOON is for amateurs.... WE'RE GOING TO MARS BABY!!!... with TESLA AND AMD!!!

MARS - THE RED PLANET... WITH LISA AND ELON. PRIMATES AND APES TO COLONIZE IT IN 2022!!!

**..... ALL ABOARD!!!!**

&#x200B;

**EDIT:** I forgot to mention Samsung and AMD on their next flagship phone.

The phone is called ""Galaxy S22""... FFS!!!! What other signals do we need????

It isn't MARS anymore APES!... We taking over the GALAXY! :D

Load the Falcon Heavy with all the BANANAS!!! We never coming back! :D

Yes I understand there is some irony involved... but this is a boomer stock and not going to get pumped by WSB. 

In essence, OP thinks AMD will break out to NVIDIA levels because they are going to essentially sell more PS5s... which are low margin products not remotely comparable to NVIDIA datacenter chips. There are videos of computer engineers BEGGING Nvidia to drop prices because they are forced to buy. That is a company with seriously moat and have continued to milk the fuck out of their clientele. AMD trades at a lower P/E because it's in the business of selling PS5s (and barely has any capacity for CPUs to meet demand) and doesn't have hopes to ever compete with Nvidia's market. It's that simple. 

Don't argue with me. Just watch what happens in the next two years."

Today, the fact that Nvidia is valued over 4 times more than AMD, is proof that AMD still has room to run. Tesla, Valve, EV market needing GPU's and CPU's, the next auto revolution is coming. They don't need oil anymore.... they need Chips.

If you buy the stock for 12 months... while the PS5, Xbox X, Tesla and Valve devices stretch their legs... you'll be more than safe. Mostly as the x-mas season is coming and people will want to game at home once the winter shows up.

2021-06-13 02:53:01,wallstreetbets,"It corrected pretty hard year to date... taking it down to $72.

This was after beating estimates and raising guidance to 50% sales growth (from 37%).

But **NOW** with Tesla's announcement and COMPUTEX, along with AMD's share repurchase plan ($4B), I find it hard that it will continue to drop.

Plus, during the next months the following events will occur:

\- Q2 results to be reported **NEXT MONTH** (beating estimates **ONCE AGAIN**)

\- 5700G and 5600G APUs to go on sale in early **August** (blessing for gamers).

\- Valve to announce handheld with AMD chip. Expect this **before Q4 holidays**.

\- Xilinx acquisition to be finalized (expect this for **December**)

\- Zen 3D chips to be launched (increasing gaming performance by 15% average)

\- More leaks on RDNA 3 and Zen 4, which are already incredible."

Over 3 million people died. We had a Global Pandemic and the worst year of our lifetimes.

Alcohol and antidepressants are sold like hot-cakes. This amount of pain is a black swan event.

Yes, people are forced to stay at home (AND WORK FROM HOME). This means they save on commute, parking, cafeteria, restaurant, dry-cleaning, etc.

Restaurants are struggling to hire people... so they are raising salaries.

Incomes will grow... savings will grow... and people will need to vent their COVID-19 fatigue.

They can buy a Tesla and self-drive, they can move to the Caribbean and Work From Home, they can work over Zoom or Skype. In ANY of those scenarios, AMD stands to win.

COVID-19 isn't going away. It will survive, just like the regular flu has, for centuries.

For liability reasons, working remotely is here to stay.

Digital entertainment has begun its revolution. eSports and Massive Online Gaming will continue growing, thanks to photo-realistic imaging, etc.

Just think of VR with photo-realistic realtime entertainment... many will cherish being single.

Just ludicrous performance. They are bundling to ensure dominance.

Nvidia and Intel can't do that... so AMD will take the cake."
2021-06-13 11:04:23,wallstreetbets,"Mr. EffUtube,

Intel can barely compete with AMD on the CPU front. They are getting trashed in the DataCenter. Just read about Epyc servers and see how they absolutely STOMP Xeons.

In the latest Intel report, they admitted that they aren't growing in Datacenter... while AMD grew double digits. That's because they are eating Intel's lunch.

On the consumer front, just look at the Amazon sales stats: [https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Computers-Accessories-Computer-CPU-Processors/zgbs/pc/229189](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Computers-Accessories-Computer-CPU-Processors/zgbs/pc/229189)

Nvidia is buying ARM cause they want to get into the CPU world.

Nvidia and AMD compete in the EV space (as AMD won Tesla, after Nvidia lost them).

On the GPU front and parallel accelerators, it is AMD vs NVIDIA.

Nvidia overtook Intel in Market Cap this year... they are the dog to beat.

AMD took over consoles (overtaking Nvidia) and now they took EV, while aiming to acquire Xilinx and solidify their position.

So yeah, do your diligence. AMD and NVIDIA compete on parallel processing (GPU & Graphics). This means Ampere and Turing (from Nvidia) compete against Big Navi (AMD). Try to find a RTX 3080 or a 6800XT at MSRP.... GOOD LUCK with that!

They also compete in software, e.g. Fidelity FX Super Resolution (AMD) vs. Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS from Nvidia).

They both have outsourced production (Fabless) and they both compete to manufacture through TSMC.

The truth is, Nvidia and AMD are the real fight. Intel is trying to get back in the fight."

AMD is the true innovator and is about 3 years ahead of everyone except Nvidia at this moment.  Once they release their new chiplet designs... It's going to push them into the lead, especially with FSR coming out next week. (June 22nd)"
2021-06-13 14:19:58,wallstreetbets,"No dude, it isn't thanks to the PS5.

AMD is in the DataCenter, with EPYC server chips (Google, Amazon, Tencent, Alibaba,etc).

Those ARE DEFINITELY NOT low margin products. Quite the contrary.

DataCenter is where the REAL Margins are. Hence, they buy Xilinx.

Xilinx isn't in the PS5.... Xilinx is in the DataCenter.

El Capitan (Dept. of Energy), the Supercomputer in Singapore, Germany, etc.

But still, you are missing my point.

The key word is ENTERTAINMENT.

Let me give you an even better hint: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnR5BBNxzHs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnR5BBNxzHs)

What is the first thing that comes to mind when you watch this video???....

Let me guess: ENTERTAINMENT... (wink wink).

Today, we are MILES AWAY from the ENTERTAINMENT AMD is moving towards.

So no, you are wrong, AMD's success isn't about the PS5. AMD will have a market cap of over $200B when the PS6 comes out.... and even higher when the PS7 is out.

It isn't about Sony, it isn't about the the PlayStation....  it is about ENTERTAINMENT.

That is what TESLA knows... Mercedes knows... and so does Unreal Engine 5.

Zen 3, with 3D stacked cache... will drive entertainment towards addiction, beyond potato chips or any other type of ""stacking/pairing"" or ""stacked cache"" you've ever heard of.

You feel me?... (wink wink). The future is coming... (watch the video)."
2021-06-13 18:06:02,wallstreetbets,"Lol reminds me of comments about Intel a few years back, and their moat. NVidia is executing well, AMD might not be able to catch them unless they stumble, but the reason they developed a moat is non existent competition. AMD had no competitive machine learning hardware, and no incentive to compete on software as that needed the hardware to back it up.

Today they're likely to get the hardware, they have the funding and software engineering chops (especially after Xilinx). They have everything to gain. Doesn't mean it will happen, but risk reward.

Software is hard, expensive, but it's not that hard - where a $100bn well funded company can't catch up. NVidia can spend more on software, but realistically software only takes you so far, it's not magic."

Thank god those idiots were wrong.

AMD took the gaming crown from Intel... and is giving Jensen a run for his money.

So yeah, not only they own the console world... but now they are with the #1 EV player.

Soon, many more car brands will want PS5-like entertainment.

My advice, only invest what you don't need to use within the next 2 years.

Look at Amazon sales figures for consumer CPUs: [https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Computers-Accessories-Computer-CPU-Processors/zgbs/pc/229189](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Computers-Accessories-Computer-CPU-Processors/zgbs/pc/229189)

Do your diligence before writing a comment.

People are willing to spend more money for better tech. And AMD is cashing in on it.

50% revenue growth year over year!!!... How much did intel revenue grow????

Apple proved people are willing to pay $1500 for top of the line iphones.

Better tech will ALWAYS be worth more money. Intel has now become CHEAP.

The notion that a 16 core CPU with 192mb of 3D cache is worth $700 is RIDICULOUS.

Wait and see what AMD charges for their Zen 3 chips with stacked cache... and how impossible it becomes to buy one.

You think cheap wins???... Why aren't people buying pentiums then???

Intel is actually losing the war... that's why they had to hire their 3rd Top General (Gelsinger) within 5 years... after Swan and Krzanich s#at the bed.

Dude, do more diligence, seriously."
2021-06-13 18:10:45,wallstreetbets,"Which CPU is faster? Some in 8c range hover around parity, which can make a decent value proposition after they lowered prices."
2021-06-13 16:10:15,wallstreetbets,"You still don't get it. The entertainment industry is HIGH MARGINS.

Consoles currently are not... because they needed to keep AMD a float 5 years ago.

Today, it helps RDNA2 have hardware dominance over the consumer landscape.

It isn't just about the PS5... it's about the next 5 PlayStations.

It is about Samsung Galaxy S22 gaming, with real-time ray-tracing on a $900 phone.

It is about in vehicle gaming, with 5 player/passengers... connected to the web.

It is about unparalleled ENTERTAINMENT experiences...

Let me help you get it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnR5BBNxzHs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnR5BBNxzHs)

Watch that... tell me if that isn't high margins.

Forget consoles at $500. That's like Apple charging $300 for their flagships 5 years ago.

I'm talking home entertainment systems for $3000... with VR and 3D audio.

""Stacking silicon with modern I/O Entertainment""... catch my drift ???"
2021-06-13 15:23:04,wallstreetbets,It'll go back to $90 next month and break $100 before October.
2021-06-13 11:10:54,wallstreetbets,Yeah consoles will never die. If anything they are going to become more profitable than ever as Sony and Microsoft have plans to release consoles more frequently with incremental improvements.

2021-06-13 13:04:49,wallstreetbets,"FPGA companies aren’t investments for growth. FPGAs have been trying for decades to become what GPUs already are. Not to mention big companies are doing their own ASICS. Altera was a mediocre  investment for Intel, just as Xilinx won’t do much for AMD."

2021-06-13 03:34:35,wallstreetbets,Better buy Xilinx for the arbitrage
2021-06-13 19:17:54,wallstreetbets,Yeah. Options can scare some. But I'm confident AMD will be $100+ when these options expire and I will be well ITM.
2021-06-13 02:56:57,wallstreetbets,"I'm talking about the wider market crashing,  and AMD coming down with it. 

Look, I could be wrong, but Burry is warning again and looking at where things are and a long term S&P chart convinces me a major crash is coming - the rise during a pandemic makes no sense at all.... I also think the catalyst is likely to be a stock I've made a play on."
2021-06-13 02:57:11,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely agree. I would argue the $105 to $110 range is today's fair value. By year end, with Valve, the APUs being sold like hot cakes, Xilinx closed and beating Q3 and Q4 results, the price should hit $130, or roughly $160B in market cap."

2021-06-13 11:43:28,wallstreetbets,Yeah I’m thinking the same thing. I find it interesting how low the stock is. AMD is in everything and the company has only been growing the last 3-5 years. And the next 3-5 years the growth should double the previous years. If it hits $100-110 by August that would be massive gains. I know they are working on buying back shares now so that’s a plus.
2021-06-13 08:48:04,wallstreetbets,Yes but the increase in guidance was based on the increase in sales due to Covid. A big part of investing is knowing when to buy in and that time is after the next earnings falls below the expectations.
2021-06-13 12:16:53,wallstreetbets,"You realize they’re struggling to hire people rn because of benefits ending in September right? Salaries aren’t going up and the economy is going to shit itself, people are not going to have the expendable income for entertainment now that it’s not being direct deposited to them by the government.

2021-06-13 11:25:42,wallstreetbets,"I agree w all of this.  Nvda is one of my biggest stock holdings and has done me very well over the years, i just keep trimming at the top and adding at the bottom, slow and steady, with jensen imo cant loose. That said, AMD has done an amazing job!! 
I bought some intel w the ceo change, hoping for a faster turnaround but shit, ive lost my patience and any faith in him frankly, that vm ware background wasnt so great afterall.  So, mon i think ill sell intel and buy amd, dont want to leave the chip space, but hopefully im not totally just playing against myself."
2021-06-13 14:01:11,wallstreetbets,"Sir. I dont know how old you are. But all of this has happend before. P4 / Athlon XP. It was same story back then, except ATI was getting its ass kicked on its own.

While AMD CPU are better products for consumers and they are gaining traction on server market the ""TSMC"" shortage doesnt effect intel cause they have own plants(as much)While Nvidia/AMD do bid for TSMC production Intel is still pushing CPU to OEM, and in alot more flavours. 

DLSS / infinity is just gimmicks trying to sell more cards. And its poor at. People just dont have any choice due to shortage of GPU.

I for once would never buy my RX6800 over 3080 but there are no nvidia cards to buy.

Still, I do have AMD and I do hope they can sort their production and fulfill demand. Even in laptop where they have, what, two/three APU?"
2021-06-13 15:57:21,wallstreetbets,"Pluto is not gas, it's solid rock. Other than that, I agree that AMD will become the backbone of the galactic economy."

2021-06-13 11:41:55,wallstreetbets,"Indeed. Absolutely agree.

Plus, just think of what Apple did with their iPhone when they began charging $1500 for a f#cking cell phone.

In a world where photo-realistic VR home entertainment is growing... even for adult entertainment (...) ... how can consoles ever die????... They just won't!!!

The money being saved in wining, dinning and putting up a farce will disappear... The world of fast-food adult entertainment is coming...

Arthur Clarke was right: ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."""

But at $1700, nowhere close to MSRP.

It is because the pandemic forced people to consider HOME ENTERTAINMENT.

Again, the key word is entertainment. It's all about entertainment."
2021-06-13 13:21:15,wallstreetbets,"FPGA are for the Electric Vehicle revolution...

AMD already has a foot in the door with Tesla and the APU & GPU in every Model S/X.

You think they are spending $35B without a plan ???....

Intel had Krzanich and Swan as CEO's...

...you want to compare them to Dr. Lisa Su from MIT ??? really???...

They have a plan. The have a product pipeline. They want the IP (intellectual property). They already have a deployment plan.

Zen 3 with stacked cache is just an appetizer. They will combine IP and build stronger processors, while increasing their production share from TSMC (who is investing $100B and recently announced 1nm technology).

Wake up man... AMD bought ATI/Radeon for $5.6B in 2006.

How did that turn out???...."
2021-06-13 08:39:30,wallstreetbets,I have 200 shares. I've been selling theta and swing trading calls and reinvesting the profits into more shares. No way this thing doesn't rip after the merger
2021-06-13 19:26:07,wallstreetbets,"I'm confident too... but I know the stock is being pushed hard.

AMD coming out with the stock purchase plan is proof that they knew their stock was being shoved around. It won't stop... and may continue moving wildly for the next 3 months. Some people can't stomach too much volatility. I'd rather they stick to the stock... and be safe."
2021-06-13 03:08:48,wallstreetbets,"Again, even if general markets drop, you have the Q2 results next month.

People **NEED** entertainment and consoles will continue selling like hotcakes.

If you think the stock price will drop, just look at the price of their products: The 6700XT, 6800, 6800XT, 6900XT, 5950X, 5900X, 5700G and 5600G... all being scalped online ABOVE their MSRP. Not to mention the PS5 not being available around the world.

Their product prices are rising and they can't meet demand... It's a **FACT**.

This **WILL** translate into higher sales figures and higher profits.

Anything they can produce will be sold... above MSRP. They are printing money.

Not to mention the product pipeline and the $4B share repurchase plan.

I think that after bouncing from $72 the stock can only go in one direction..."
2021-06-13 05:48:37,wallstreetbets,"Game stop, right? Or Stop the Game.

Dude... Biden is getting Trillions, with a T.

Biden ALREADY has higher approval rating than Trump ever did....

Why do you think that is????....

You pump trillions into any economy... the results will be obvious.

The VAST majority of people still believe in Government Institutions.

Look at what happened after the January 6th attack on the Capitol.

The crazies (led by an orange clown) had to go into hiding....

The Vast majority of people support democracy, support their government and are finally willing to call-out the anti-vaxers, flat earthers and racist karens.

Derek Chauvin will spend a LOOOONG time in prison.

The notion that the rhetoric spread by a loud minority will develop is BS.

The American People woke up to their worst nightmare... a Fascist Running their country... and they THREW HIM OUT.

The District Attorney of the Southern District of New York had ""residential real-estate"" reserved for an orange clown.

This results in the middle class having a shot at a decent living again.

Bezos being called out for his trip to space is just the beginning.

The middle class is coming back... and so will affordable living for the vast majority.

You may not see it that way. You may miss the orange clown. You may think we are doomed.

My only reference to TSMC relates to them having the cutting edge in state of the arts technology. Period.

Sure, DLSS and Infinity FSR are gimmicks... I AGREE.

But Navi 31 (RDNA 3) is expected to be 2.8x the performance of a 6900xt.

Check the leaks from last week.

We are talking about the LARGEST jump in performance EVER.

MCM chip design from the people that brought 16 cores chiplets to the desktop.

Really !?!?!?... You think 10gb of RAM is better than AMD's fine wine tech with 16gb ?

Good luck enjoying your 3080 for 6 months after you find it!!!....

On your laptop comment: LOL. Thanks for bringing this up!!!

Check the ASUS ROG G15 Advantage Edition: Smartshift + Smartaccess memory

Basically, a 6800M with a 5900HX for $1650...

It smokes EVERYTHING with an MSRP of a 3070 with a shintel, at less power.

Dude... they are finally bringing APUs to the desktop (5700G and 5600G)... as consumers were PISSED they were only available to OEMs.

And now people are complaining that they need to wait until August.... LOL

Consumers are desperate to game while working from home.

Not only in their Tesla, but also in their desktops and living rooms.

They raised guidance from 37% to 50%... and they are STILL conservative.

The closer we get to year-end, the harder it will be for the market to ignore the fundamentals.

My point is the following: It is bound to breakout.... even if there's a new strain of Covid-19 and it doesn't go away. Even if there's high inflation. Even if interest rates go up. The way I see it, the stock can only go in one direction.

Do you know University Grads, with Masters degrees, who are old enough to remember the Athlon days, have paid their student loans a decade ago and are willing to write stock articles on a Sunday?

I love tech and programming. I'm what people called a Nerd or Geek in the 80's.

Today, nobody's laughing at us anymore. Geeks rule the world.

Let me give you a hint... I made more money during the last 2 years with my AMD holdings than with my gross salary. And I'm not stupid enough to have my entire portfolio in one stock. I diversify, just like any smart accredited investor should.

Do you know what the term **accredited investor** even means?....

Look it up. It basically means banks can approach me knowing that I won't be able to claim I'm a naive lamb who didn't know what he was getting into.

$10K ?... You think I'm writing an article on AMD because I hold $10K?

Are you serious?

I've walked data centers... IBM, Amazon, Google. You name it.

I've gotten used to work with fan noise of a server farm. Not during this decade, nor the prior decade. I'm talking during the 90's.

I bought at $2 and sold at $20. Later buying back again at $26.

No, not $10K. Think again.

I know the stock is being overlooked. Some people are trying to get cowards to sell the stock, so they can buy it for themselves.

AMD knows that too... hence, they launched their stock repurchase plan.

If you ask me, I want the idiot SOB's who are briefly shorting the stock to burn their hands off.

The tech AMD is working on is nothing short of incredible.

They expect 2.8x performance from Navi 31 when compared to Navi 21.

That is just unheard of. MCM (multi-chip designs) for GPU's are the holy grail.

GPU parallel processing with scalability is any IT expert's wet dream.

Even more so than AMD's latest tech (which they released last week).

Over a quarter of a million views on youtube. I suggest you see it too...

Remember, people here aren't joking around anymore.

You don't agree or like my arguments, go against my trade.

People want to take a holiday cruise to the Caribbean, stay in fancy hotels, go back to the movies, etc. etc.

Over 3 million people died due to the virus.

We've had the work from home revolution, meaning that employees spend a $h\*tload less in commute, parking, cafeteria, restaurants, etc.

There is a TON of money waiting to be spent.

The last pandemic was in 1920 (Spanish flu). Look at what happened from 1920 to 1939.

Almost 2 decades of uninterrupted growth.

Central Banks have pumped money to keep humanity afloat.

**EVEN Republicans** supported money being given to people so they stay a HOME.

Republicans wouldn't be caught dead giving a penny to anyone who doesn't break their back working. Yet they signed thousands sent to people to stay at home.

The economy will come back HARD, cause the suppressed demand is creating inflation (look at PS5 prices)."

They know any company beating results is bound to continue growth.

Big money just ""shakes the boat"" a bit... to scare the faint of heart to abandon ship.

This happened to Apple, Amazon and Google in the past too....

But in the long run, if you are growing sales at 50% (year-on-year), or you have Mercedes and TESLA backing you.... along with Microsoft, Sony and Valve... you are unstoppable.

In the long run... AMD will push a data processing revolution.

Epyc chips in the DataCenter... are revolutionary.

MI200 cards in Machine Learning... are revolutionary.

Zen 3 with 3D cache... is revolutionary.

Gaming in the EV world (with autonomous driving)... is revolutionary.

Gaming on a 5700G or 5600G without a discrete card... revolutionary.

So to answer your question: ""Dollar cost average.""

We bounced from the $74 red line 5 times already....

That was before the $4B share repurchase plan, before Tesla's confirmation, before Valve and before the Q2 results (coming next month).

We recovered 12% from $73 in 4 weeks.... but Q2 results are coming.

A decade later... yes.

TODAY, we know why the crash happened.

The Fed DID NOT pump helicopter money at the problem...

Ben Bernanke did his thesis on the 1929 crash. He understood why the crash wasn't contained.

Since 2008, we KNOW what to do. We are surviving COVID-19 as well.

The only problem we can't throw money at is an imminent asteroid....

As with enough time to plan, we can give Raytheon/Nasa enough money so they can shoot it down.

And even when a crash occurs... in 2030.... you think entertainment will be forgotten???

Entertainment addiction has not reached cigarette levels yet...

I'm talking VR home entertainment... with photo-realistic imaging, 3D audio and real-time ray tracing at 8K.

Today, you try to spend $500 in a console... and you get scalped.

Tomorrow, you'll be begging to spend $3000 to enjoy the Caribbean with Jenna Jameson... from the convenience of your living room.

The DD you didn’t ask for (mods plz flair as shitpost) In my last shitpost I outlined that UWMC is on the way up and it is, I’m just not intelligent enough to know why. With the Russel inclusion and $300 million buyback the short term looks sweet as shorts are going to to be forced to cover or stand to lose with massive buy-side pressure coming from different angles. 

But any crayon eating retard can tell you those aren’t catalysts that are particularly suitable for mid to long term growth. What is a sustainable business model is generating cash with lower margins. Now I don’t know what any of this means and to double down on my retardation I’ll even say a company like RKT needing 250 basis points to compete with UWMC at 120 basis points seems like UWMC is legitimately primed to take market share from RKT and all of the other big players, who I don’t know because I’m too busy watching cuckold porn to care.  


Let the cocaine bro crack an egg of knowledge upon your lovely head. 


“the margins in retail are substantially higher. Therefore, the benefit to the consumer is not as good. And that's why it's silly that the broker channel is only 20% of the market. If it's cheaper for the consumer, faster for the consumer and easier for the consumer, why do consumers still go to those retail lenders and pay more fees? It's because they just have not been educated. And that's one of the things we're going to be working on is educating consumers.

Realtors and LOs understand it mostly, but consumers definitely don't understand. And those large retail organizations, they need those higher margins or they can't compete because they have massive infrastructures with bloated executive comp, along with massive amounts of money in marketing and TV commercials. They spend a lot of money on things that make it so they can't be profitable at 100 basis points.”

-Mat Ishbia.  

This is one of the reasons why UWMC can raise guidance while everyone else guides lower in a rising rates environment. 


_____________________________________

If a loan is worth $100K and the basis points that UWMC is getting are 150. Then the profit made on the loan is $1.5K. 

This is really important since UWMC has a lower cost structure than RKT. So UWMC has the ability to offer more competitive loans while still making a profit."

Their are other mutual funds and ETF's that very tightly track the Russel index and they will all place Close of Business orders for the exact amount the the 24th or 25th.

2021-06-13 06:14:41,wallstreetbets,I make max profit at $11.  If it goes higher it has no impact on me.
2021-06-13 17:07:51,wallstreetbets,Ideally I don’t close it.  If after close on Friday the stock is above $11 then etrade will get the shares for me and hand them off to the guy who bought the $11’s from me.  The $1 spread turns into cash in my account.

2021-06-13 11:30:12,wallstreetbets,The difference is defined risk.  He will need to either cover the 10 put with say the 5 put to invest as you described in a retirement account.
2021-06-13 12:18:44,wallstreetbets,It makes sense.  Only question is how much $ this ties up.  Brokerage won’t let you naked sell puts unless they place capital in reserve to hedge it.
2021-06-13 12:47:55,wallstreetbets,"I don't have this trade on.  It was simply an example of one way to YOLO, another way would be buying the shares outright, another way would be buying the calls.  All of those can provide infinite gains.  The rate of return depends on how you choose to measure, Return on capital, return on cost basis, return on buying power etc.  

OP's trade is a PMCC, I'm not indicating that it's good or bad, but I don't consider a PMCC a YOLO.  The trade I mentioned is just a synthetic long position, you get all of the upside and downside without having to buy the shares.   The cost basis on your synthetic shares are 10.05 now versus buying at $10.22 right now.  The 5-cents paid returns 17-cents in gains (>300%) even if the stock simply trades sideways.  If you don't have the funds to cover buying the shares at $10 then yes it would be naked and on margin (level 4 or 5 options on fidelity).  If you have the funds, you keep the money in your account for buying power. 

I use fidelity, but rarely do naked puts unless it's a unique market event.  I'd rather have the other leg as well by selling straddles or strangles.  Naked only applies to puts when you don't keep enough dry powder in your account.  Naked puts don't bother me as the max loss is still defined, if that concerns you the simple solution is to turn it into a spread."
2021-06-13 13:46:16,wallstreetbets,"It ties up $ if you do this as a cash secured put.  If you do this without the cash it's on margin and it ties up what they call your ""non-margin buying power"" on fidelity.  It's a bit misleading as ""margin buying power"" balance is for equities, and ""non-margin buying power"" is what you need to look at for options.  You need to ensure you have enough balance there (which is a percentage of your overall portfolio volume) to ""cover"" the puts if needed.  If you have enough, then the real cost is margin fees.  

Margin is calculated daily and charged monthly.  A short option is calculated at 35% of the underlying's daily value so with the stock at 10.22, you would calculate $10.22 x .35 x 100 = $357.7 margin value per contract which is used to calculate interest.  $357.7 x 4% annual margin (your rate may vary) / 360 = 3.97-cents of interest per day per contract.  I wouldn't recommend this if you are just starting out, but that is how the math works for anyone curious.  Good luck with your trade."
2021-06-13 12:54:37,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but a synthetic long requires level 4 options which basically nobody has. So it’s kind of irrelevant in terms of strategy.

If you’re backing the naked puts with “dry powder” then they’re not naked, they’re cash secured.

Let’s look at his position of 160 contracts. Naked selling the 10 puts would require 140k of “dry powder” in the account. He only put like 7k into this position.

He wasn’t looking for infinite upside, he was looking for massive returns with limited leverage which he achieved quite well. 

Compared to your strategy, the 140k of dry powder would mean he could go in with that 140k and buy another 2000 of his play. Which would mean that he could still 300% that into half a mil, whereas you’d be leveraging your 140k for the measly infinite upside - which would require a run to $50 or so to pay out half a mil. Since you’re ineffectively leveraging the returns on that 140k.

His is a much smarter use of capital, and also a bigger yolo since the potential multiple is greater than a $50 event."
2021-06-13 13:29:47,wallstreetbets,">If you’re backing the naked puts with “dry powder” then they’re not naked, they’re cash secured.

This is why I mentioned that I rarely have a naked put position in my portfolio.  It has nothing to do with this trade.  

If he wanted to maximize returns on capital; margin would be even better if you want to go down that path.  Going 100% margin at a $10.22 stock price this calculates to under 4-cents per day per contract. If he had 270 July contracts he would paying $10.71/day at today's prices and $354.12 total interest paid through July expiration (once again calculated at today's prices).

A PMCC is not a YOLO, what's next here's my AMC collar YOLO?"
2021-06-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Li Auto [LI] - high short float, improving financials, growing EPS. To the moon? I watched a video a few weeks back about shorted stocks shooting up, so I went on FinViz and looked at some stocks that had 30%< short float, and I was surprised to see Li Auto on that list. I've been invested in Li since it dropped down to 21$ in mid-April just cause I believe the company has some potential despite it being pretty hard to find information about.

A couple of positives the company has which made it seem appealing to me:

* First off, it's an EV company, so that itself made it seem a little appealing. China has one of the fastest-growing EV markets in the world. While a lot of stuff the Chinese government is doing is questionable, it is doing a lot to fund the transition to EVs to lower its carbon footprint. For example, many Chinese cities like Shanghai/Beijing are giving increased driving privileges to EV owners. 
* Yeah, we have other Chinese EV companies like XPEV, but to be honest, the other ones seem to be copies of Tesla rather than their own companies. I feel Li won't have to compete with Tesla/all those companies because it targets different people. Just look at the websites. XPeng's cars literally look like Walmart versions of Teslas.
* Compared to companies like NIO and XPEV, LI's financials look a lot more stable, in my opinion. For example, LI has 600 million more in sales than XPEV, but LI's market cap is much lower. This makes me think it is a little undervalued. Also, the projected EPS this year and next year is a lot higher for LI than XPEV and NIO. 
* XPEV's target price is roughly 46$, and it's sitting at around 41$ right now. On the flip, LI's target price is around 35$ while it's sitting at around 28$ right now. So I feel LI's got a lot more to gain as of now.
* My final point is that LI's heavily shorted, with 32% of its shared shorted. Institutional ownership is also up by 50%, and Goldman gave a price target of 62$. 
* \^I got all of the financial info from finviz/yahoo finance. 

Overall I think this stock has a lot of potential. This is obviously not financial advice. Actually, the main reason I'm even posting this is to see what other people think of this before I double down on this stock and funnel all my cash into it. But let me know what you guys think!"

2021-06-13 00:08:10,wallstreetbets,"no offense bro but :
LI has more of a float then wkhs and AMC therefore it would be a lot harder for US to take advantage of the high short, it would be harder to move the needle. Li also has a market cap of 25 billion, AGAIN would be harder to move. NO OFFENSE, definitely think it is a good LONG term hold"
2021-06-13 00:11:05,wallstreetbets,"It looks somewhat promising but they've got the same 'non-profit' problems that a lot of EVs have. I don't like how the whales increasing all seem to br generalized clean energy funds but the whales decreasing seem to be all deep-rooted in China, so that makes me wonder if they know something we do not. 

Do they make something besides the SUV?"
2021-06-13 09:39:48,wallstreetbets,NO on Li
2021-06-13 00:15:34,wallstreetbets,Do you have a better idea to pump and dump a stock?
2021-06-13 02:46:22,wallstreetbets,"China is such a huge market that the big 3(Nio, Li, and Xpeng) all have a lot of potential. I bought Nio at $60 right before the big sell off but I'm not really worried about at least breaking even on this one. My only regret is not buying a bunch more when it was $30. Especially if they start selling internationally. China doesn't have a ton of oil so they should be determined to get everyone into EV's soon. I wouldn't be surprised if they outright ban gas powered cars in a decade or so."
2021-06-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Little late posting this but it is worth the wait.. $AMC Gains!

Good for you, I love seeing you guys getting paid instead of the already rich and elite.   

That's just how greedy these cock suckered are.   They are so fucking wealthy that losing money ant shit, believe they have money hidden through out off shore accounts.    They enjoy the power they have to control stocks and or markets.   And that power slipping away hurts them most"

2021-06-13 17:31:04,wallstreetbets,"I just laugh when I see gain posts and it’s all contracts. 

 I would like to see the gain posts from actual stocks not naked contracts.

 What the sec needs to do is stop letting companies or retail investors do naked shorts, puts, and calls.

 I think it’s great you gambled on contracts but this is exactly what it is and plus I get a kick out of how the sec doesn’t flag people for naked contracts when they do this.

 Gains are great but I feel like naked gains like this is what is turning the investing realm into retail investors."
2021-06-13 07:01:04,wallstreetbets,Have to ask. Is this the Robinhood app. How do I get this view of contracts?

2021-06-13 19:13:32,wallstreetbets,"He already sold. Hence, the profits."

2021-06-13 08:55:42,wallstreetbets,It’s Options and it’s a little complicated. You’ll loose all your marbles if you don’t know what you’re doing or even if you think you know what you’re doing. I got into it a little bit before but quit trying. So I just buy shares high and sell low like a real retard.
2021-06-13 10:48:29,wallstreetbets,"AMC $30 Call = a contract to purchase 100 shares of AMC for $30 per share.

6/4 exp - 9 buys = the date the contracts expires, he has 9 of these in the picture.

$38.70 = the premium of each contract.  This is the price per share he receives if he sells the calls to close.  Since each call is 100 shares, and he has 9, you multiply this number by 900 to get the current value if he sold.   

You see at the top AMC was at $68.80, so he could instead exercise the options and buy 900 shares for $30 each ($27,000) and then keep or sell them for $68.80 each ($61.920) and potentially profit $34,920 minus his original premium."
2021-06-13 10:29:17,wallstreetbets,"You can buy a call option that's associated with 100 shares, less than the price of buying 100 shares.

It's somewhat like he bought 3400 shares.

The difference, the options are worthless if they hit their expiration date and the stock price isn't high enough."
2021-06-13 01:44:38,wallstreetbets,"I sold it at time of the screenshot which was that price, later in went as high as 77$, which I could've held onto until then for even bigger profit, but I can't predict the future. Hope that clears it up :)"
2021-06-13 12:34:14,wallstreetbets,Don’t exercise. Sell instead
2021-06-13 01:04:43,wallstreetbets,Im having a hard time with my call option since im new to them. I purchased 1 call option for on may 14th for strike of 26 expiring this Friday. Cost was 1.20 per contract and now it’s 23.53. How much do I need in my account to exercise it? Or does it make sense just to sell? In your non financial advise btw.
2021-06-13 12:30:25,wallstreetbets,Never exercise options. You’re literally throwing away money
2021-06-13 06:07:13,wallstreetbets,He already sold the options.
2021-06-13 11:11:26,wallstreetbets,You lose whatever premium you paid for the contracts.
2021-06-13 12:56:02,wallstreetbets,"....that's how *all* options work. Regardless of broker.

Unless you mean ITM options, those typically get auto-exercised by most brokers if you have the cash in your account."

2021-06-13 01:51:34,wallstreetbets,"Alright follow me here, there is a new housing development. You goto the builder and say, I would like a contract (call) to be able to buy a house by x (let's say 2 years) date for 300k, so you give him a down payment of 20k. 1 and a half years later you come back and houses in that neighborhood are 600k in value, so you choose to exercise your contract and buy that house for 300k, therefore making 300k in equity immediately because the value if homes has gone up.

Let's say at the end of that 2 years houses are only 220k. So you let the contract expire worthless because if you exercised you would lose not just the 20k down payment but also 80k in equity instantly.

This is how I understand them, idk if this helps at all. I'm also new to options but this was how it was broken down to me at least for calls. And it really helped me understand at least for the sake of buying calls.

If you sell the call yiu basically become the builder in this scenario and you're kinda hoping that the call expires out of the money so you keep the premium (down payment) and your shares (the house) 

Someone correct me if I'm wrong me dumb illiteratesimian"
2021-06-13 15:11:24,wallstreetbets,"It’s a contract between the Buyer (who we’ll call Bull) and the Seller who we’ll call Melvin.

Bull: “Nice stock you’ve got there. Let’s make a deal. I’d like to have the option to buy 100 of them off you for $150 each. I’ll pay you a bit of money now for the contract. Let’s keep this contract good for… idk, a couple weeks.”

Melvin, thinking to himself: ‘It’s worth 100 right now and the price doesn’t move much. I’ll take this retard’s money and still have my stocks.’

Melvin, aloud: “Sure, I’ll take that deal. Gimme $20 and you’re on.”

Bull: “Well, I emptied my savings account and put a second mortgage on the house, so I’ve actually got $200,000 around. Can we make this deal 10,000 times?” 

Melvin: “Sure.” (Inwardly starts laughing)

Stock Price: (Increases suddenly to $125 on some good news)

Bull: “Sweet, closer!”

Everyone else in the market: “Hey, this one’s ripping! Buy buy buy!” 

Stock Price: (Rips to 140)

Melvin, quietly sweating this whole time: ‘Fuck, fuck, I didn’t have a million shares when I wrote that. Better buy a few more on the way up to lessen the pain if it keeps going.’

Stock Price: (Keeps going up because of more buying. Now at $175)

Bull: “Oooh, sweet! If I had $100,000,000 to actually buy all those contracts out, I’d be a genius!” 

Rich Organization: “I’ll give you millions for those contracts because I have lots of money and would like to make it into more money.”

- selling: you paid 1.20, it's now 23.53, you get 2233$. Pretty awesome for a 120$ investment. (2233-120)/120 = +1760% yield.

- exercising: you paid 1.20, stock price is roughly 50$ when I'm writing, so you need to spend 2600$ to get 5000$ worth of stocks. (5000-2600-120)/120 = +1900% yield."
2021-06-13 01:08:59,wallstreetbets,"You need 2,600 to exercise, not gonna tell you to sell or not but that’s how much you would need in your account for it to let you exercise"
2021-06-13 04:01:34,wallstreetbets,"If you exercise them the only gain you make is the difference between the stock’s price and the strike price of your calls.     

If you sell the call you gain also from the IV (implied volatility), theta (time left before expiry) and gamma (I believe) so you would make more profit that way."
2021-06-13 05:07:11,wallstreetbets,"There are very few reasons why you would ever want to exercise a call option.  (For example, you are watching the stock rise and waiting for the maximum value when you are suddenly hit with a case of explosive diarrhea and have to run to the restroom. You end up pooping out your intestines and get rushed to the hospital, waking up after your call options have expired and exercised for you automatically by the broker.)

The highest profit comes from selling because it factors in time theta."
2021-06-13 02:17:51,wallstreetbets,It’s not wise to exercise call options. Just sell it back to the market and keep the gains.

2021-06-13 01:59:17,wallstreetbets,Wtf are you talking about!? An option contract gives the owner of the contract the right to buy(call) or sell(put)100 shares at an agreed strike price. You pay a premium per share to purchase the contract. The change in premium price is where you make or lose money
2021-06-13 01:03:55,wallstreetbets,And if you are right you make money and if you are wrong you lose money.

Some will also attempt to sell the option 1hr before market close if out if the money (below $30).  If you do neither of these and hold the contract after market close on the expiration date the contract becomes worthless, and you lose the premium you paid for it."

2021-06-13 13:36:12,wallstreetbets,"So that is actually broker specific. If your call is ""in the money"" ITM, you will generally BUY 100 shares at the strike price of the contract for EACH contract .

If your account doesn't have the liquidity to do this, some brokers will auto sell the position around 3pm or 4pm Friday before market close on expiration, some brokers might execute the buy sending your account deeply negative, and rarely a broker may leave you letting your option expire not exercised making it worthless in the end."

2021-06-13 02:23:27,wallstreetbets,Why not? Please Explain
2021-06-13 02:07:06,wallstreetbets,"Wtf are you talking about? You pay a premium to purchase the contract or option, of 100 shares that gives you the ability but not the obligation to exercise at the agreed strike price. It's not just change in premium that makes you money, you can choose to exercise the contract and take the share if I had a $10c with a break even of 12.65 and the stock was at 15$ I could exercise the contract and still make money"
2021-06-13 01:17:54,wallstreetbets,You guys are making money?
2021-06-13 02:40:41,wallstreetbets,"**When screenshot was taken- AMC was trading at $68.30 per share. So $68.30 - $30 (strike price) = $38.30 per share of the contract. 1 contract = 100 shares.** 



Strike price is $30. 9 buys = 9 contracts. Each contract is 100 shares. So 9* 100 = 900 shares. 

AMC is at $49 and change (for simplicuty- round up to $50). Take the price of a current share and subtract the strike price-- so $50-$30, which = $20 (your profit per share minus the premium- price you paid per share of each contract). 

So profit or gud Green= $20 * 900 shares = 18k. Minus the premium you paid for the call contracts. 

** person has the OPTION (not the obligation) until 06/04/21 to BUY or SELL their options. Most people will sell their rights to exercise the option(s) and take the profit and move on. That's not always the case-- he could buy the underlying shares at $30 per or 900 x $30 (27k plus premium paid for the options).  

So you have purchased for 27k- shares that are worth 50k on the open market."
2021-06-13 15:39:49,wallstreetbets,Me too will like to know more about options.
2021-06-13 12:30:39,wallstreetbets,Mine three brohiems
2021-06-13 16:37:40,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, still a little confused

So the risk is the premium for each contract.

He paid 38.7 per call/contract which has 100 shares per call/contract.

Beucause basically, he's only at risk o losing 38.7\*9 = 348.0, but has huge unlimited upside with a much lesser risk of losing a lot of money if he bought 900 shares at 30 and it tanks to 9. (18.9k loss).

I think I'm getting this wrong still, because the potential upside is (in this example 34,920 - premium (384) = 34,580 profit) is so much and the loss is so much more limited (to the premium) than a normal share buy.

&#x200B;

The other explanatin is he paid 38.7 per share for the right to buy a 30$ share at a later date. But this means 38.7\*900= 34830 $ in total. Then you'd still have to buy the 30/share = 27,000.

And then sell the the shares at the peak price 68.8/share \*900 shares = 61920.

But this doesn't make sense because you now have 61920 (revenue) - 27,000 (cost of share of 30/share) - 34,580 (premium) = only a measly 340$ net income for the huge amount of capital, risk and speculation (that it will go >200%) involved involved.

Either explanations don't make sense to me.

One explanation gives me huge upsides with little downsides.

Another gives me huge downsides with little upsides.

So I know I'm getting it wrong."
2021-06-13 13:21:41,wallstreetbets,"So you have the ""right"" to buy them, but what if you  do not have enough actual funds in your account to cover the purchase? 900 shares, even at 30 bucks is 27K. a Hella lot of money to some of us Newborn retards."
2021-06-13 13:46:27,wallstreetbets,Gotchu. What if you sell a call before it expires I’m assuming the broker can’t request or sell you the call option if it’s already sold before the strike price or date is reached?
2021-06-13 08:58:52,wallstreetbets,"> if I can get 2600 dollars into my account I'd get more shares than I would just buying them at the current price.

Exactly. The question now is whether you want shares to have them, or to sell them instantly. 

Keep in mind what I said is true only for the current prices. Who knows what will happen tomorrow."
2021-06-13 13:25:51,wallstreetbets,"Just sell your call and pocket the money. Love that everyone is making coin off AMC, but it’s incredibly risky long term. There’s no justification for this valuation."

Current price - $26"
2021-06-13 01:13:51,wallstreetbets,"you are buying 100 shares at the price of $26 per share, therefore it has to be in your available trading balance"
2021-06-13 17:18:24,wallstreetbets,"It is an option contract, so you have the option to exercise the contract(buy the 100 shares at the agreed upon strike price), you can sell the contract at any point before the expiring date, you can roll the contract which means you use the profits made from the premium to purchase other option contracts in the future, if you let the contract go or somehow forget about it the contract will be sold on your behalf and depending on your broker depends on what time they do that."
2021-06-13 02:27:04,wallstreetbets,If u want more shares for a price it’ll never drop back down to then it’s definitely wise to exercise the option if u have capital available
2021-06-13 04:06:40,wallstreetbets,"What you can sell the option for has two parts, what you can exercise the contract at and instantly sell at current price and the difference in between  (extrinsic value) and the premium it costs to speculate it will go higher with days to expiration + Implied Volatility (intrinsic value). When you exercise your contract, you lose the money on the intrinsic side, so unless your about to expire, it’s generally not worth it to exercise."

2021-06-13 17:20:17,wallstreetbets,Ok 👌
2021-06-13 12:33:53,wallstreetbets,Or just sell and buy shares at the current market price. You throw away all the extrinsic value of the option by exercising.

2021-06-13 05:58:07,wallstreetbets,He paid 120 and not 1200. that s already paid and was the premium to be have the right but not the obligation to purchase 100 shares at 26
2021-06-13 11:34:39,wallstreetbets,1 contract x $1.2 premium/share x 100 shares/contact = $120 premium
2021-06-13 17:21:28,wallstreetbets,"Lemme know if you need anything else cleared up, I thoroughly enjoy helping other apes🦍🚀that’s what this movement is about, one big family💰🦍"
2021-06-13 17:17:45,wallstreetbets,"I’m sorry, he sold them for $3870 per contract…  We don’t know what he bought them for.  Let’s say he paid 1,000 per contact when he opened the position.


His two options:

Sell the contracts.  Profit = (3870-1000) x 9.

Exercise the contracts.  Profit = ((share price - strike price) x 900 ) - 9,000."
2021-06-13 07:10:25,wallstreetbets,"So, is it typically then bought at that price in order to hold or sell the stock yourself, or is the option sold to someone else who then buys the shares? I guess the question is do you need to have the money to exercise the option or can you cash out by selling the contract itself. I've never traded options before."
2021-06-13 17:37:57,wallstreetbets,Ok then bro.thanks🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍💪🏼
2021-06-13 17:39:10,wallstreetbets,"Ok,  that makes a lot more sense.

So the risks/up of options is

For option 

Option B - exercise them.  Huge upside, but little obligation. The risk isn't completely minimal either. E.g: At 1000 (guess), that's 9000 fo 9 contracts. 

To break even to be worth it is that ((share price - strike price) x 900 ) >> 9000 dollars. Which is a risk although depending on the contract price, it is a more limited controlled risk - still not insignificant.

&#x200B;

For option A

You can make money even if you don't have sufficient funds to buy 900 shares of AMC, If price rises enough, you can sell the contracts for a profit at X price - contract price.

The risk is if it tanks, you can't sell the contracts and you lose 9000 dollars (contract price) with nothing to show for it. Just a complete loss of 9000 with no shares at all."
2021-06-13 08:24:09,wallstreetbets,"It is up to you. If you option is about to expire and you feel there is still room for the stock to grow, you can exercise and hold the shares. But most people would sell the option and buy contracts with later expiration date. Make sure you learn options before testing the waters. While you can make a lot of money, most contracts end up at $0"
2021-06-13 17:43:09,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, Option A is going to be the best way 99% of the time.

Option B, you’re essentially losing the premium."
2021-06-13 16:14:58,wallstreetbets,"I still can't find any explanation that I understand about options and calls. 

Do I need a certain type of account or share amount before I can do this? I see no options or calls on wealth simple."

Yes, prices will go down, but the thesis is that prices will remain elevated to a point where all these non chinese steel makers will still be printing $$$ big time.

Throw in the fact that there will inevitably be countries around the globe pushing for infrastructure spending to restart their economies from the covid impacts.. US is the first, and maybe the biggest.. but Russia, India, bunch of Asian, and South American will probably follow too.

I personally do not think prices will plunge, or that the supply demand situation will be resolved anytime soon.

Just seems like I always here about it when it's to late. Do you have to basically be 24/7 on Twitter or reddit or the stock market & do you need to buy a computer or can it be done from your cell? Sorry for all the questions just seems like I'm stuck and dont know what I'm missing to get to the next level of the game"

2021-06-13 01:20:19,wallstreetbets,I cashed out when I hit 100% profit. If I had watched it carefully and gambled and been greedy I could have made more but I was happy with that profit.
2021-06-13 17:31:46,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I was up 385% on my options, and then watched them tank. Sold them off at 104% profit. Crying all the way to the bank on this one."

2021-06-13 18:00:19,wallstreetbets,"Sure, you're reading it right.  You can see the headers in the first image... they're the same for the other images but I couldn't get a good screenshot from fidelity and didn't want to photoshop the headers in.   The rows are all of the individual lots I bought.  First the date acquired, then the date sold.   The first $ column is the total I sold each for, the next is my cost basis...  the total I paid for that lot.  The green numbers are the profit, so the the total sale price minus the cost basis.

&#x200B;

For CLF, I 've been buying for a long time, so you'll see some of dates acquired are march."

Very green week though! I could have taken more profits and not gambled with some profits.  The net result still turned out well, I’ve given up on perfection."

Careful risk is your best chance.  Don’t blow up your life savings on a single play.  Make some calculated bets and be ready to accept you were wrong before you lose 100%."

2021-06-12 23:21:56,wallstreetbets,Money is money
2021-06-13 00:47:03,wallstreetbets,Are you talking about the ownership that Citadel has in AMC?  Which you can find looking in their 13F.
2021-06-13 01:46:39,wallstreetbets,"Selling here actually takes momentum out of Citadel's pump and dump and leaves them with less money (by taking more for yourself), since you're not giving them your money by refusing their bags.

2021-06-13 19:25:10,wallstreetbets,I applaud you good sir. I made the mistake of not stopping and I was gambling from 300k to a million. I ended up with only 30k after I bowed out.
2021-06-13 14:08:09,wallstreetbets,Always a good choice.
2021-06-13 17:37:39,wallstreetbets,Were you already invested in clove or did you notice it was on the rise so you slapped some money down on bid?

2021-06-13 00:55:21,wallstreetbets,Buying again for round 2?

You're either a bot or dumb enough to let one trick you. You're being used. Btw even IF what you say about shitdel's stake is true and still accurate (you're basing this off of data that's MONTHS old), that's relatively nothing compared to their percentage in your shit stock. Also, predatory hedge funds like Shitadel have a history of spoofing calls so they can sell naked shorts. Buy your hf pumped stock all you like, but get your facts straight."

2021-06-13 02:04:24,wallstreetbets,"For the people wondering:  
  
Tesla - March 18th 2022 Calls at $950 strike price. 
He paid $243 ($24,300 as there are 100 options) for each option (7 in total, so $170,000) and the stock needs to reach $1193 by March 18 2022 for him to break even. (Strike price $950 plus the premium $243 = $1193).       
    
Current Greeks (June 12 2021 - this is per option contract. so so multiply by 7 to get the total amount).   
Delta: $28.   
Vega: $170.   
Gamma: ~$0.   
Theta: $17.  

Obviously those numbers aren’t fixed and are subject to change, but currently his option will move if:    
  
- Every dollar the stock goes up his option goes up by $28 (because he bought 7 contracts, this number will be $196). (Delta). 
      
- Because gamma is effectively 0, he will not get a compound effect on the delta. So each subsequent dollar move up in the stock price will also give him $28 (multiply by 7 = $196). (Gamma)   
  
- Each 1% move in Volatility will give him $170 (multiply by 7 = $1190). 
This is probably the best way for him to make money back, Tesla currently has very low volatility so most likely going to go up in volatility in the future. (Vega)   
  
- Each day the option loses $17. This value will only go up in the future (multiply by 7 = $119). (Theta decay). 
    
Bear in mind that these dollar values go down the same rate they go up.  
  
Best way to make money back is with Volatility. Gamma being effectively zero makes the delta compound effect much harder.   
Also Theta is only going to increase in amount, so time is against him.   
  
Lessons to learn.   
- Only go into Leaps when IV Rank is low otherwise Vega will be working against you.   
- Don’t go all in on an option like this.  
- Right now is a good time to buy Tesla options especially Leaps, IV Rank is low.   
- It seems they bought in Jan-Feb 2021 time when Tesla was trading around $900, so not too far out of the money and Tesla was trending upwards.    
  
I’m not sure if they bought before the January earnings call, which is not a good play as IV crush is a very real thing no matter how far away the call option expiry is. (Earnings bring anticipation, which brings an increase in expected stock price move. This increased expected/actual volatility occurs before the earnings call and then drops if the earnings are anything less than stellar).  
  
Edit:    
  
General rules -   
  
If IV Rank is high, sell calls/puts.   
If IV Rank is low, buy calls/ puts.   
Don’t sell naked calls unless you have the capital to cover your position.   
Sell puts to earn premium in stocks you don’t mind owning in the future, at a price you are willing to pay (the premium you earn lowers your entry price).    
  
Best playbook:  
  
Sell puts in a company you want to eventually own shares in.   
You either get assigned and own the shares, or you don’t and you keep the premium.   
Repeat until you own shares.   
When you own the shares, sell calls at a price you are winning to sell the shares at.   
You either get assigned and make profit from the buy price compared to the sell price, or you don’t get assigned and you keep the premium.    
Rinse and repeat"

June historically has been a green month for TSLA for the past 4 consecutive years iirc. If you held it that long from when u bought in at $243/contract, might as well ride it out and double down if you can. Again, from my perspective, your only hope is the next 3 earnings report being exceptional and Implied Volatility going thru the roof. You still have \~9 or 10 months which is a lot of time, so work your ass off and double down or start thinking about a sugar momma/daddy."

It seems like the saying does not apply as it previously did.  Perhaps due to more instant technology, ease of trading, the 24-7 reality, and other factors.  Perhaps societal and global shifts are factors.  Some sectors may be more prone to this.  Some sectors may not be affected at all.  Any thoughts appreciated."

Thanks for the write up."
2021-06-13 03:30:03,wallstreetbets,How can I know if IV is high in the option I'm buying? Also is IV the same for every strike call option or does it change? Is Vega an indication of IV on the option?
2021-06-13 06:12:27,wallstreetbets,"Sshhh, don't educate the masses 🤐"
2021-06-13 05:01:16,wallstreetbets,">Gamma: ~$0.

Gamma is not measured in dollars. It is the first derivative of delta with respect to the underlying's price, so its unit is delta. A gamma of .1, for example, means that a $1 change in the underlying causes delta to change by .1"
2021-06-13 02:51:22,wallstreetbets,Can you explain this again in more ELI5 terms? Hard to understand this as I’m just starting to learn more of the advanced options and such.
2021-06-13 02:58:17,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a Wendy"

Think there is a typo. Break even should be 1193."
2021-06-13 04:47:43,wallstreetbets,Sir how did u learn all of this... can you suggest books or sites ?
2021-06-13 04:50:13,wallstreetbets,So at this point is there hope for this booty for him to recover or should he just cut his loses?
2021-06-13 05:02:07,wallstreetbets,"This is what I’ve been doing in the 7 months I’ve gotten into options and have a 95% win ratio. Selling long term puts in single dollar stocks is low risk and low rewards but still made some nice walkin round money that I just reinvest.

2021-06-13 06:42:22,wallstreetbets,What's iv?

2021-06-13 07:55:26,wallstreetbets,Now can you explain so even a retard can understand it?
2021-06-13 08:02:16,wallstreetbets,"> - Only go into Leaps when IV is low otherwise Vega will be working against you.

I'm not sure I get this. 

as I understand it, the IV of the LEAP is unique to that expiration date,   the current IV would bear very little impact to the IV of the leap?"
2021-06-13 08:05:06,wallstreetbets,"This is WSB sir, not a place where the wheel is appreciated :)"
2021-06-13 08:43:37,wallstreetbets,How do you determine IV in a company?

2021-06-13 10:00:28,wallstreetbets,What is iv rank? And how could u see the strike price?
2021-06-13 10:17:01,wallstreetbets,Wow I had no clue so many things are in play with options
2021-06-13 10:20:38,wallstreetbets,This guy fucks.
2021-06-13 10:24:57,wallstreetbets,I developed a wrinkle in my otherwise smooth brain after reading this comment
2021-06-13 11:06:17,wallstreetbets,I just buy options. People do all this analyzing?
2021-06-13 11:32:06,wallstreetbets,Would there be something he could do now to hedge these losses?
2021-06-13 11:35:13,wallstreetbets,"This is a great post, thank you. When you say sell puts in a company that you want to own at a lower price, do you mean that I should buy the shares of the company at the current price and then sell puts on those shares for the lower price that I want - or just sell naked puts without owning the shares first for the lower price that I want and just make sure there is money to cover the puts if they get assigned?"
2021-06-13 13:07:42,wallstreetbets,This Simple wheel strategy works most of the time.. I love it!
2021-06-13 13:34:58,wallstreetbets,"Man I need to learn more about this theta thing. I basically look to see if I will be above the break even point and call it a day. I have:

Delta is 0.9247

Theta is -0.2167

Edit : Btw thanks for reminding that tsla leaps are super cheap, ill prob get one on monday."
2021-06-12 22:52:48,wallstreetbets,Good question. It could be play money for someone with millions; but what's more likely is they're average Joe's who made a few gains then got over confident and lost on an epic scale.
2021-06-13 02:22:11,wallstreetbets,"They already paid the money for the calls. Those same calls are practically worthless now. That's assuming they didn't borrow the cash to pay for them.... in which case they don't have to pay anything back. They just straight lost 150k.


If they did borrow the money to buy the calls, then I would suggest creating an alias and try and get out of the country."
2021-06-13 07:27:07,wallstreetbets,"He bought a call so this was money (or margin) he already had. He has a couple choices.
~Ride it out,  believing the price will go up
~Double down, buy more calls to bring the breakeven down.
~Take the loss, sell then go sit in a corner and cry.
~Roll up/out, sell these calls and buy some with a lower strike and/or more time"
2021-06-13 02:15:02,wallstreetbets,"Always have a job that pays you so you can buy the dip. I had nio leaps and was down like 80%, kept buying the dip, its so easy to average down with how hard it crashed lol. Now I'm only down 10% but if I haven't bought more id still be down 70%. Would make a shit ton if it ever goes back to previous highs. 

Also buy shares cuz you can hold that shit till you die if you have to. You only lose if you sell!"

2021-06-12 23:37:26,wallstreetbets,"Well GME blew up due to retail investors rallying against hedge funds, then mainstream media picked up on WSB and retards like you flocked to this subreddit barely knowing anything about stocks, let alone option trading."
2021-06-13 02:51:40,wallstreetbets,"Hence the risk with options. Should the stock price go up, the option goes up with it but you were investing less money while controlling the same amount of shares and therefore the percentage gain is much higher than simply owning the stock. It’s basic risk reward concept. At one end, you are making more money but on the other end you can lose it all. 

Many people that own plenty of shares in a stock will even place put options if they think the stock might dip but don’t want to sell the stock as it can work as a good hedge in case of a price drop."

2021-06-13 06:05:38,wallstreetbets,"The premium is the total of what is left + what is already lost… however, he has until 3/22 to make a gain, which I truly believe he will KILL it with TSLA by the end of this year"
2021-06-13 08:47:01,wallstreetbets,"No, this is a $950 strike with a $243 premium, making his breakeven the sum of those two, which is $1193. As long as TSLA closes over $950 on expiration, OP won’t lose everything, but needs to go above $1193 for OP to fully recover the premium paid."
2021-06-13 14:46:10,wallstreetbets,Yeah. The other 15% was Enron leaps

2021-06-13 02:35:26,wallstreetbets,"Someone selling calls.  Likely a hedge fund that expects tesla stock to not break $1,100"
2021-06-13 04:37:02,wallstreetbets,"Just FYI:   
  
It’s unlikely going to be one person who will get the $170,000.   
Because he bought 7 calls, someone might have sold 5 calls and someone else sold 2 calls etc.   
The assignment is random (as far as I’m aware) so his 7 calls premium may or may not go to one person. It might even go to 7 different people!  
  
Let’s assume it did go to one person.   
  
The person that sold these calls is now $170,000 richer.   
But that is not the whole story. There are different reasons someone would sell a call.   
They can sell to:  
- Close an already open position. (Sell to close)  
- Open a new position. (Sell to open)   
  
If they are closing an already open position, that means they bought the call some time in the past and are now closing their position.  
Their profit will be determined by how much they sold the options for and subtract how much they bought the options for .   
   
If they are opening a new position (sell to open). 
Then that money is still tied to the option. They only make (I mean keep) the money if the option decreases in value. The money is immediately deposited in the account, so they can spend it however they wish, but if the option goes against them then they have to get the money back, and then some.    
  
If, for example, the person who got the $170,000 sold (even though in this case it would be bought, as he initially sold the calls in the first place) the calls to close his position.   
  
He would make $170,000 - $25,165 = $144,935.  (The amount that OP has lost)
  
He would only make the total $170,000 if the calls end up being below the strike price (plus the premium) at expiration."

The underlying goes down? Well, you don’t have to sell your shares, but you’re still usually losing money even though you were right about the price staying under a certain threshold. Sure you’re not losing as much money as you would if you *hadn’t* sold a call, but it still feels off."

2021-06-13 04:02:22,wallstreetbets,"**How can I know if IV is high in the option I'm buying?**    
  
There is a thing called [IV Rank](http://tastytradenetwork.squarespace.com/tt/blog/implied-volatility-rank), which ranks the current IV against what it has been in the past and gives it a percent ranking.   
If [IV ](https://www.tastytrade.com/definitions/implied-volatility)is currently high, relative to its past performance,  then the IV rank will be 70% or above.   
If IV is low then the IV rank will be 30% or below.    
  
**Also is IV the same for every strike call option or does it change?**    
  
It is actually a curve. It is lowest ATM (at the money) and highest far ITM or far OTM.   
BUT, that is just IV. IV rank is different.   
The IV rank would be the same, I think, for all strike prices and would go up or down in unison with the overall increase or decrease in volatility of the overall stock. (Someone correct me if that is wrong).   
  
**Is Vega an indication of IV on the option?**
  
Vega does not indicate IV, it just shows how much the option price is affected by IV. 
IV is actually calculated by the people trading the stocks/options. So we are the ones that determine if IV goes up or down. Hence it being very hard to calculate, as who knows what everyone is going to do at any particular time in the market."

Ran out of organs, you have blood, correct?? Sell that and buy more!"
2021-06-13 11:48:14,wallstreetbets,"Not really.

You have these options:

1 - Cut losses (probably the best option).  
2 - Let it ride and hope the price and volatility bounces back (you are down 85%, can only lose an additional 15% ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|shrug)).  
3 - Buy more calls. You have to expect Volatility and price to increase and earn money back that way.  
4 - Buy puts. If you think Volatility will increase but you think the stock price will decrease. But in this scenario you’d probably sell the calls, otherwise it’s stupid as you are guaranteeing to lose money on one or both trades simultaneously.

You wouldn’t sell calls or sell puts or buy stocks to hedge as IV is low, so unlikely to decrease to make you money, and the stock is trending downwards.

The play has gone from:  
“I think this is a good idea because of XY and Z”  
To  
“I’m praying the stock rebounds, otherwise I’m fucked”.

The second scenario, you are at the mercy of the stock rather than the other way round.

Maybe someone smarter than me can explain how to hedge out of this. But to my understanding, if you buy options at high IV and the IV decreases and Vega far outweighs every other Greek. The only way to “hedge” is to buy more calls. Everything else won’t work."
2021-06-13 12:06:15,wallstreetbets,"Well, both.  
  
But I was specifically talking about Selling puts without owning the stock. You can’t really sell naked puts, as most brokerages require you to have the money to buy the stock at the strike price before the transaction will go through.   
  
For example. If the stock of Tesla is $500 and you wouldn’t mind owning it at a price of $400. You sell puts at the $400 strike price.   
  
Let’s say the premium (money you earn) is $25.  

The costs are:  
- $400 x 100 (number of contacts) = $40,000 (the amount of capital you need to make the trade). 
- $25x 100 = $2,500 (the premium you receive)
  
If you get assigned then you pay $40,000 for those 100 shares, but you collected $2,500, therefore reducing your cost basis from $40,000 to $37,500.   
So you bought 100 Tesla shares for $37,500 even though you “paid” $40,000 for them.  
  
So a strategy.   
Let’s say you own 100 shares that you bought outright at $600 and they are currently trading at $500. So you are down $10,000. 
If you sell puts at a lower strike price than what you paid for them, the premium you collect will reduce your cost basis and/or the shares you are assigned will reduce your cost basis.   
Do it well enough and you can reduce your cost basis from $600 per share down to $400 or lower, reversing your loss into a gain."
2021-06-13 14:01:21,wallstreetbets,"You paid $23 premium on AMC calls expiring in a week? 
  
The Delta is close to 1, so a $1 move in AMC will move the option price $1. 
It would have made more sense to buy the stock.  
  
Owning the stock will have these benefits:  
- Vega - this will go against you if Volatility goes down, even if the stock price goes up.   
- Theta - this is going against you (as it always is for buying options)
- Break even - this is quite high for a short date option. You need the stock to go up by 15% between now and option expiry just to break even. Whereas if you bought the stock, a 15% increase will be a 15% increase.   
  
I’m expecting a big AMC move myself, but your play is a little risky (of course, that’ll be dependent on when you bought the option and what the Greeks were at the time of purchase)"

2021-06-13 13:24:35,wallstreetbets,"Are people finally getting that TSLA was obviously, blatantly overvalued? I don’t know how many times I’ve said this and gotten a storm of Musk cultists telling me how they are going to take 100% market share in electricity or some bullshit lol"
2021-06-13 13:54:31,wallstreetbets,"Although annoying how often Elon comments on B T C. Tesla is not merely a car company, its more so an AI and energy company. Investing in Tesla is investing in artificial intelligence tech that will power autonomous cars, drastically changing personal travel (cars will then also be a platform for entertainment like your iphone- 30% of Apple’s revenue is generated from the app store) as we know it today but also be licensed across other industries. It is investing in batteries that will power cars, but also store energy for all. The issue with power consumption and peak energy usage amongst large scale utility companies is there’s no way to store enough energy no matter how its generated. Tesla has engineered batteries down to the chemistry to manufacture industry leading battery tech. They are already and will deliver more utility scale power grids projects. Check out the ones like South Australia’s Hornsdale Power Reserve powering 50,000 homes, in Hawaii, in NorCal, in Texas and more. So yeah Tesla’s coming for the utility companies too.

Also forgot to mention when Tesla perfects their full-self driving tech (its excellent already btw) then they’ll deploy robo taxis taking market share away from uber and lift.  So many bright revenue channels ahead for Tesla I can’t even name them all.

No wise investor would overlook Tesla’s roadmap ahead."

2021-06-13 08:12:18,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn’t bet against Tesla. I especially wouldn’t bet against them after having done no DD. I’m sure we can agree that them not having catalysts for the stock going forward is glaringly untrue. They have quarterly reports, vehicle releases and Hype from R&D events (battery day, AI day, FSD day, 🤷‍♂️). If you took a position against them I would second guess the move."
2021-06-13 00:29:41,wallstreetbets,"If you look at the distribution of services, Apple falls well below Android in China compared to the US or Europe. In the last five years it's market share in China hasn't increased during this time, even slightly decreasing while Europe and the US saw their iOS market share grow slightly.

They'll copy what they can and push for their intended product to become the most socially accepted one. That is pretty well their modus operandi."
2021-06-13 04:05:12,wallstreetbets,"I think the better analogy is that they would've done that to Ford/Honda/Kia/Toyota/etc already.

Apple is more of a designer thing at this point. They don't make the best phones on the market and haven't for a long time. But they have an ecosystem that works only with its own products, and they have been increasingly more about name recognition. 

This actually makes it harder to knock them off. People don't just want Apple for what it can do, they want it to be fashionable as well. So it's not good enough to just rip off the tech. The same way you can't just slap a different logo on a bag that is made identical to a Gucci bag."

2021-06-13 05:42:06,wallstreetbets,a market maker who specialises in making prices in options all day long. they will receive $170k but their position is hedged so the cost of hedging will eat up most of that $170k
2021-06-13 07:55:28,wallstreetbets,"You probably know this but for others reading, if someone sold $170k in calls they are very likely to buy to close their calls when at this point and keep $144k  of the premium they were paid.
They can then put that money back to work rather than letting it be tied to this option."
2021-06-13 09:48:11,wallstreetbets,"This is what has always confused me about calls and is why I stick to Stonks. Wouldn’t OP only be out the cost of the premium for the contracts? Since they’re not obligated to exercise the call to buy the underlying stock? 

I can’t even begin to tell you how many youtube videos I’ve watched explaining options and I still don’t get how this person is out 170k instead of only being out 25k (premium costs).

Oh wait, i think i see now, he bought 7 contracts so his premium is actually 25k*7 which is how we got to this 170k number… my bad."
2021-06-13 03:17:50,wallstreetbets,"I have a question about that. Does someone who sells options physically own that stock? In case I choose to execute do they have that set aside?

I buy calls mostly on questtrade, afaik a call is a promise I can buy the stock at this price at Or before the expiry date. Is questtrade promising they will get me that stock and where do they get it? 

TY to whoever can answer this."
2021-06-13 10:59:02,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been trying a couple different methods for covered calls. Because I agree with you. An example would be a stock that goes up and down $1-$2 every day.  DKNG, NIO, PLUG. Stuff like that. I follow those 3 regularly.  Buy 100 shares of DKNG at $54 and when it goes to $56, write a call. When it drops back down to, say, $53, cover your call and hold the shares because they’ll probably bounce back up. Getting the timing right would be the hardest part."
2021-06-13 10:41:56,wallstreetbets,"Have you got your eye on any Tesla leaps?

2021-06-13 03:24:01,wallstreetbets,"Most transactions occur with a market maker, which they usually hedge any directional risk immediately. You will only get shares if you exercise the call early (and pony up the cash to buy the stock), or if the option is in-the-money at expiration."
2021-06-13 03:31:02,wallstreetbets,"They have an obligation to provide the stock if they’re assigned (you execute), but they don’t have to own the stock when they write the option.

They could have written a “naked” call, with the plan to buy the stock as needed, though that purchase may become quite expensive. They could also buy another call from someone else, at a higher strike price to limit their maximum losses (if they get assigned, they always have the option to execute the call they bought). A third choice is to buy another call, at the same price but a further out date, I think people do this if they’re expecting to write multiple times (eg, write 12, 1 month calls using a single 12 month call they bought as insurance if they get assigned).

But the simplest is a covered call, where they do actually own the underlying stock."
2021-06-13 03:27:48,wallstreetbets,"Maybe yes, maybe not. If it's small fry (a retail seller) then it's likely they're doing covered calls, in which case, yes, the seller would own that stock. 

Most likely no. Most likely it's a giant like BlackRock selling the options, and the giants are usually selling naked calls.  

It could also be a random dude with a margin account selling naked calls (in which case his broker would liquidate his account when his trade goes against him past the limits delineated in the margin contract). 

Sometimes big guys blow up their accounts too. Archegos went bankrupt after losing $20 billion in 2 days earlier this year. 

That's the kind of shit that can happen when you trade naked."
2021-06-13 07:19:38,wallstreetbets,"Not necessarily, I feel a covered call is the best way to sell calls(my opinion) but there are other forms of collateral and risk mitigation like Vertical  Spreads if you can't get your hands on 100 shares."
2021-06-13 09:08:46,wallstreetbets,Yes. It's a covered call. I sell calls weekly/monthly on stock I own at least 100 of.

Just going by the indicators (Greeks and IV Rank) I would buy calls AND puts. A Leaps straddle.   
  
A 620 Call/put long Leap straddle (17 June 2022) will cost you $27,000 right now.   
At its peak (March 2021) it was worth $55,700.   
BUT, it has little to no volume, so you’d be stuck with it for a long time. 
  
The stock price is unlikely to stay where it is going forward, the stock is too volatile. So betting on either a big drop or rise is the best bet. 
Basically playing for Volatility and not worrying about direction.  
  
You’d lose if:  
- The stock price doesn’t move.   
- IV stays low, or decreases.   
- The stock price bounces around but ends up in the same spot.   
 - Theta kills your gains.   
  
You’d win if:  
- Volatility increases, regardless whether the stock price goes up, down or sideways.  
- Stock price drops or rises dramatically. 
  

But personally I’m sticking with AMC, GME, SPCE and CLNE.

They move in unison, but are affected to different degrees (different rates).

Delta, for example, will be 1 far ITM, 0.5 ATM and 0.1 far OTM.

A $1 move up in share price will increase the option price for each option contract, but have a greater effect ATM (and ITM) compared to OTM.

It is overvalued based on where they are at now, but if they achieve FSD they wreck Uber and Lyft plus semi manufacturers. Rideshare is a $100 billion industry, and class 8 trucks is $360 billion industry.

So would they keep FSD for themselves as a competitive edge? Or do they license it to other car manufacturers for several thousand per car sold? Do the licensing math.

Everything rides on Tesla completing FSD to reach their potential, which would revolutionize transportation. But they are the best positioned to do so."

2021-06-13 15:30:18,wallstreetbets,"You have a lot mixed up, I will try to address some of the basics but you need to do some serious reading before you're ready to trade options.

&#x200B;

>Does someone who sells options physically own that stock? In case I choose to execute do they have that set aside?

This question doesn't make a lot of sense because it's completely depending on what options they're selling.

&#x200B;

Based on your comments you seem to think calls are directly correlated to puts, like one is the opposite of the other. You can buy a call or you can sell a call. You can buy a put or you can sell a put. Your question is not specific enough to give a straight answer because you didn't specify what kind of options they're selling

&#x200B;

If you sell a put contract, you obviously don't have that stock. The one who BUYS a put needs to have the stock, otherwise he's naked.

&#x200B;

You sold SOMEONE the RIGHT to sell TO YOU, PERSONALLY, a block of 100 shares at an agreed price per share(from here on 'P'). This transaction is made THROUGH a broker (Questrade) and is usually BETWEEN YOU and A MARKET MAKER, but can be BETWEEN YOU and ANOTHER RETAIL INVESTOR, you NEVER KNOW who is on the other side, that's why there is a middleman, the broker.

&#x200B;

With this transaction, you get a premium and if they decide to excersize, you pay them 100xP and you receive 100 shares. So, what YOU need to have to be 'covered' is cash. Specifically 100xP.

&#x200B;

I just answered the following questions:

&#x200B;

>So questrade in my example would be the market maker for a regular call? And they will sell a put for every call or change the price based on theta-delta etc accordingly?

Just to reiterate:

Questrade is NOT the market maker in your example, it is merely the middleman, the broker. They processed a transaction BETWEEN you and (probably) a market maker.

They will not sell a put for every call, banish the thought that they are opposites from your head. The way to hedge a call you sold is to have that block of shares locked up in case they exercise.

&#x200B;

>And if my call is itm on expiration day after 2 pm and I don't cancel it or have enough cash to fulfill they will liquidate my account and keep the shares themselves and charge me a fee for the inconvenience?

this question doesn't make sense, hopefully by this point you will know it doesn't.

&#x200B;

A call is not an obligation to buy stock at a specific price, but merely the right to do so. You don't HAVE to exercise your right, but you can if it's itm. Or, if you don't have the cash to exercise you sell that right"

2021-06-13 11:03:35,wallstreetbets,"No prob. The main difference is that in the wheel you sell CSP on a stock at a price you’d wanna be at, and collect that premium until you get assigned, then sell CC on the stock. For instance, take your example of DKNG. Before you own any you’d wait for a red day where it dips to $52, sell a put for $50-51, etc and collect premium until you get assigned."

2021-06-13 12:10:43,wallstreetbets,"I’ve definitely bought when IV is high, but Delta and gamma have to make sense to overcome Theta and Vega.   
  
If the stock price goes up but volatility goes down, so long as the price increases enough to offset Vega and theta then the play makes sense. But it is riskier, obviously, as you have 2 out of the 4 Greeks going against you. Theta is always against you if you buy options. So best to have the other 3 Greeks in your favour.  
   
I am currently in this situation with AMC for example. High IV rank but I believe the stock will increase in price enough to offset Vega if volatility decreases (which I don’t see happening until an earnings or conference call if some kind)."

2021-06-13 02:58:18,wallstreetbets,"Their FSD is never going to get signed off because it has no clean data. 5 years of ML and they're still manually fixing edge cases like winding streets in san francisco, it's just not going to happen. it's taken so long for them to even get it into beta that mobileeye, the company they dumped because they delayed their camera-based FSD over safety concerns, has managed to build a camera-based self driving system that can also integrate into a lidar system. Rest of the industry is moving on while Tesla is praying that datamining will solve everything."
2021-06-13 03:28:24,wallstreetbets,"They’re behind the rest of us who work on autonomous driving companies. They recently admitted to lying about their capabilities to the California DMV. 

This exact same thing happened with Mercedes Benz about 4 years ago. Company hyped up their capabilities than it comes to light that it’s bullshit to incentivize investment in said company. I’m not joking when I say Tesla is full of shot on this front. Great company but Musk constantly talks about stuff his engineers know they can’t do."
2021-06-13 03:04:25,wallstreetbets,Lyft & Uber already sold off their FSD programs … they will pony up whatever is asked to whatever company breaks through … Apple the secret dark horse that has joined but the market leaders still looks to be Waymo / Tesla

2021-06-13 11:18:22,wallstreetbets,citadel is many things. its a huge company that employees thousands of people. the market making employees are probably not the same as the hf employees and probably don’t know what each other are doing since they are in competition with separate p/l. this is how they make money by competing with everyone in small groups even internally.

2021-06-13 10:36:33,wallstreetbets,"The standard boilerplate recommendation to maximize [theta munch munch](https://youtu.be/Y7f8tV-P35c) is sell to open at 30-45 DTE and then buy to close or roll at 7-14 DTE.  I've been dealing with very high IV underlyings so I've simply been waiting for them to go veritcal upwards and pick that moment to roll up and out.  Definitely can't roll on a mechanical basis, timing is everything since the slope of the underlying's curve is what options are largely priced on.  If it's vertical straight down then that's an opportunity to roll down and in.  Usually liquidity is pretty sketchy under those conditions though."

I suspect most of these people will just stick with Tesla unless something goes horribly wrong. Several have kids, so that's a few future customers right there."

2021-06-13 03:19:54,wallstreetbets,"How can you say that? A sufficiently advanced AI will be orders of magintude safer to drive than people. When humans drive, eventually with enough miles you will make a mistake, we are human and not perfect. When an accident happens with a human driver you will never be 100% sure of what really happened because people lie and make mistakes. If we switch to AI driving and an accident happens we can get to the root of the problem must faster and possibly prevent the same thing from happening to all the others using the AI."
2021-06-13 03:47:00,wallstreetbets,"I don't mean this to be antagonistic, I'm genuinely curious. I would assume that large amounts of data to cover edge cases is the critical piece to get to FSD. Iteration cycles. Pushing updates to cars. And having the cars on the road to continue collecting data.

I don't know what the critical mass is for mileage to be effective, but it would seem to me that Tesla has the clear advantage here."

2021-06-13 02:40:01,wallstreetbets,"The quality is way higher than a Chevy but still nowhere it needs to be for the price they command (IE the same as the Germans) . My Kia SoulEV is better put together than most of the Teslas I've owned. But my Model 3 is 4 years old at this point and still looks and drives like it was new, with only one minor motorized  component (charge port door) that needed to be replaced, and that has really been the only maintenance item besides a set of tires and washer fluid."

Unfounded assumption

Unfounded assumption"
2021-06-13 07:25:42,wallstreetbets,"Yes and they will stop being a status symbol as soon as there is litteraly any actual status symbol car manufactures building comparable cars. Not to mention by all accounts outside of off the line torque they drive like crap. The interior quality is dumpster tier. Regardless we are talking about whether their stock will stay bullish not whether or not they will still be a company. On that note jag was a status symbol for more than 4 decades and look at them now. 

But a company doesn't stay on top by just being a techy's found memory car. Ford is already poised to make the cyber truck, which was going to be a hard sell to truck people anyways based on looks, redundant. Tesla priced themselves out of the crossover/suv market, which dwarfs the sedan market. Basically every luxury car company in the world has started making has started trying to get into the family car market because being a status symbol simply isn't enough anymore. 

I'm not saying I don't necessarily think tesla can compete if they want to, I'm just saying that the future doesn't seem secured and the idea that they are currently valued at 578b is ludicrous.

Edit: tesla is a historic company that has made great strides in pushing EV's into the mainstream, but usaully the first company is just ends up being a jumping off point for other companies"

2021-06-13 05:07:20,wallstreetbets,"With software the first 80% takes 20% of the time. The last 20% takes 80% of the time. Bugs are hard. In the case of self-driving software, bugs are fatal. There is simply too much edge cases that no matter how many hours of data you have, it will not cover it.

The only possibility for self driving to happen is if they totally standardize the roads, remove human drivers from the equation, and somehow account for different weather conditions. 

The problem is too hard to solve period, not just for Tesla. They are currently trying to train machine learning models with more and more data, but it will never be enough. 

The only way to solve this is through some different paradigm that has not been found yet.

This is my opinion."

2021-06-13 15:46:52,wallstreetbets,"I disagree with you because Tesla CHOSE to not use high definition maps and instead CHOSE to use many camera sensors. Most car companies were only using one on the passenger side of the windshield. Now I agree with Tesla in using a lot of sensors but disagree in them not using high definition maps.

There’s a reason EVERY car company except Tesla is using HD maps. Everyone is focused on real time LiDAR when they never considered HD maps which are more important than either real time LiDAR or Tesla’s machine learning."

2021-06-13 05:53:03,wallstreetbets,"Need to update the matrix.  In overarching terms, European cars lag Japanese, Korean, and US brands in quality.  Tesla lags them all.  However, if Tesla matches the Germans, they are still behind Chevy on balance.  Tesla also benefits significantly from good will - people tend to forgive bad fit and finish in their Teslas that they would never accept from similarly priced ‘conventional’ cars.

Individual cars are exactly that, individual."
2021-06-13 02:40:43,wallstreetbets,"Teslas are built like shit. Tesla is not a car company and that shows. Their first car, the roadster one, wasn't designed by them either. It was in fact a Lotus Elise with a slightly different clamshell, and an electric motor instead of the Toyota/Rover ICE one."

In terms of high definition mapping, couldn’t Tesla create their own mapping with enough data? You said they are doing some of this by hand now, but as their model grows, couldn’t they switch mapping systems with their own?"

2021-06-12 23:04:44,wallstreetbets,"Retarded this week, autistic the next"
2021-06-13 02:33:54,wallstreetbets,So like him you found out about it by looking at charts and options stats?  Feast well with those calls
2021-06-13 01:40:00,wallstreetbets,"Since that stuff gives me headache to look at, I'll just look at you and follow you lol"

2021-06-13 00:49:13,wallstreetbets,😂🤣😭
2021-06-13 03:12:58,wallstreetbets,Lol fuck no theres no TA that is going to get you anywhere on meme stocks they are irrational.  Everytime GME or AMC pops you see a little jump in anything that was ever a point of focus on here.  So like I said I looked through the usual suspects most of which were either trading too high for my taste or had too much volume thus making options too pricy.  None of these I'm really interested in holding shares long term so I went with the cheapest most profitable option pun intended.
2021-06-13 03:08:21,wallstreetbets,This was a WSB play from a few months back.
2021-06-13 01:12:01,wallstreetbets,Excercise? who the fuck u think we are? Jeff Bezos? We don’t got that kinda dough
2021-06-13 00:55:59,wallstreetbets,CLOV almost hit 30 and has a 20% larger float than UWMC. UWMC is also shorted more atm
2021-06-12 23:07:19,wallstreetbets,"i hope my line goes up, thank you"
2021-06-12 23:32:05,wallstreetbets,I understand what you’re saying but UWMC hasn’t even been in the market for you say it that way lol
2021-06-13 03:29:27,wallstreetbets,And what ones are you looking at now?
2021-06-13 08:13:35,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that went nowhere and thats why I sold enough of the call contracts back to cover my initial investment and make a tiny profit if it ends up going south.  I mean long term it seems like a decent enough company to hold its just I like investing in what I know mainly tobacco, weed and commodities and putting money into anything that is associated with the mortage business for a long time scares the fuck out of me because who knows when 2007-2008 will repeat itself.

But shit their dividend aint bad.  I mean of all the stocks pitched in here regularly fundamentally UWMC has the best upside.

Im just wondering how long before some idiot ape comes in and reads this and starts grunting about AMC and GME and how they are the only good companies and will both be worth over 10 million a share and end capitalism as we know it."
2021-06-13 00:56:51,wallstreetbets,Well I hope that you’re right. So does my wife’s boyfriend
2021-06-13 03:22:48,wallstreetbets,I believe UWMC is only 14% shorted while CLOV is 45%
2021-06-12 23:36:08,wallstreetbets,"Yea, you’re right. It hasn’t been a long time (even though it’s felt like that). There have been tons of supposed “catalysts” to move this oversold and undervalued stock up…Russell inclusion, RKT ultimatum, fed rates, blah blah blah and yet it gets pinned down. What I mean is I’m sure at some point in the next few months it will pop, but I’ve had my hopes up too many times to feel comfortable with options."
2021-06-13 14:53:23,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a casino
2021-06-13 16:50:06,wallstreetbets,I'm in AMC but let's be real uwmc the company with real profit that is way undervalued. I get a little tired myself but being called you can only be an AMC or GME.

2021-06-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$CRSR : The rise of gamers The gaming industry continues to grow and is expected to reach a value of ~$290 billion by 2026. 

There has been a shift in the gaming industry. It's gone from a simple pass time or hobby and has become a full time career for some gamers and streaming professionals. Once thought to be an activity for the young, a simple pass time, has now proliferated through all age groups and demographics. In 2020, 64% of all American adults played video games. That's 214.4 million gamers.

Before Covid, in 2019, the gaming industry was already over 3.5x the size of the movie box office industry and over 14x in 2020. Gaming’s 2020 growth outperformed the growth of both movies and sports combined. The gaming industry is still expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of roughly 11% moving forward. 

It's also worth mentioning that the gaming market is continuing to shift from console to PC as the major gaming platform. In the past, PC gaming became sort of a niche. That is now shifting and PC gaming is rapidly becoming the platform of choice for more and more gamers.

Another contributor to the boom of the gaming industry are eSports. The eSports industry is set to surpass ~1.1 billion in revenues in 2021, a 14% growth from 2020’s ~950 million. 

**Corsair Gaming $CRSR**

Corsair Gaming is a designer and manufacturer of high-end PC gaming components and peripherals. 

They offer four different segments of products:

* PC peripherals: Keyboards, mice, headsets, mousepads, chairs, etc.
* PC components: Ram, SSDs, cooling, cases, PSUs, etc
* Prebuild gaming PCs for gamers who don’t want to customize their own.
* Streaming equipment: Microphones, green screens, lighting and capture cards.

The rise of gaming will continue to drive CRSR's sales. In 2021, the PC gaming market was estimated to be $45.5B with ~50% of all gamers using a PC to play video games. This creates a valuable market for companies who can provide value to PC gamer.

Corsair is a premium brand with solid market penetration. They are currently market leaders for gaming components and systems products and their products demand an average of ~40% premium compared to their competitors! This means their products cost 40% more on average than their competitors and they are still out-selling them. In a market where their target customers are PC gamers who are passionate and do research prior to making purchases, this is very telling and they are on track to capture a large segment of the growing gaming industry.

2021-06-12 22:28:00,wallstreetbets,Bought this stock a couple of months ago and have held every share since it make sense with the rise of gaming again and will rebound once the chip shortage settles down. This ape is with you! Godspeed fellow banana holders.
2021-06-12 22:40:43,wallstreetbets,Well looks like I'm closing my CC's on CRSR Monday morning
2021-06-13 10:11:59,wallstreetbets,CRSR is going to serve up some chicken tendies next week
2021-06-13 04:05:39,wallstreetbets,Let’s also mention that Corsair is known for the high quality of their components. They are pricey but you get top of the line equipment. A good example are their PSUs which are probably the best in the market.
2021-06-12 22:10:26,wallstreetbets,This is a great long play. I've upped my stake recently to 5k shares 20 leaps. They are cornering the market with smart acquisitions. They know their market and the best part is it has a huge TAM. I think they will be what Nike is to the sports apparel/equipment.

2021-06-12 22:46:14,wallstreetbets,What is a good price to buy at if you watch it
2021-06-12 22:45:50,wallstreetbets,"You don't even have to trust wsb on this play. Have a look at what analysts have to say about this stock  https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRSR/analysis?p=CRSR

Average estimate is now $46 a share and averages a strong buy ratings across recommendations. 

CRSR had excellent earnings last quarter,  low P/E and great cash flow.

It popped above $40 previously during meme run and it now sits at just above $32 with strong historical support at $31. So the upside is definitely there."
2021-06-13 01:26:33,wallstreetbets,GREAT POST!!! Been in corsair since 18. Leading the way in the industry and only have room to grow!!!
2021-06-13 12:36:49,wallstreetbets,CRSR - this is the way
2021-06-13 14:38:02,wallstreetbets,This is the play of the week.
2021-06-13 08:45:38,wallstreetbets,"I think, one thing that is missing in your DD that and hasn't been touched on a lot is their recent acquisitions.

* Elgato Gaming (Streaming peripherals)
* EpocCam   (Streaming app -> Now under Elgato)
* Gamer Sensei (eSports coaching platform)
* Origin PC (Pre build Gaming PCs and Laptops)
* Scuf Gaming (Game controllers)

I'll include this in my DD part 2 next week, but the baseline is that they are doing exactly what Ryan Cohen did with Chewy - building an entire universe of products around their hardcore customers, a strategy that will definitely pay off with the entire industry exploding."
2021-06-13 10:01:09,wallstreetbets,Nice analysis dude
2021-06-13 12:05:15,wallstreetbets,CRSR has awesome fundamentals and they make great products. Just got a wireless keyboard from them a week ago actually. When it breaks out of its sideways channel it’s going to fly. And IV is so low on its options. I’m loaded up on calls.
2021-06-12 22:04:52,wallstreetbets,"Huge potential, took a hit after the ipo. Been trading sideways for a while .. perfect time to get in on a breakout. Getting a good traction from last week. All the ingredients to moon. Let's go."
2021-06-13 12:23:56,wallstreetbets,Just bought some at premarket
2021-06-12 22:03:03,wallstreetbets,Man…. I remember seeing Crsr on release and bring to broke to buy any stocks
2021-06-13 11:19:32,wallstreetbets,"I like Corsair but it's price action has been garbage.
I've been rolling the $40 put for months now. I also bought a call option expiring December for $2500 that's already lost 50% of its value.
More interest in CRSR would definitely be appreciated. Many investors sold after guidance for 2021 showed that growth was slowing: 2020 revenue was $1.7 billion, predicted 2021 revenue is $1.8 billion. 
Similar to PINS in a way with a slowing of their American MAUs: when a single aspect of the growth story changes investors think the ride is over and get off prematurely.... then they sell their stock.
However, as OP mentioned, management of CRSR did say their profit margin would improve, meaning a lower P/E ratio aka UNDERVALUED AF."
2021-06-12 21:56:01,wallstreetbets,My boat is loaded might add some calls on Monday

2021-06-13 08:59:43,wallstreetbets,"I think in 2 years we will see cloud based gaming become more mainstream, Google stadia was dipping a toe in the water and most people's internet connectivity isn't good enough yet to facilitate it, but most developed economies are on the road to 5G and Full FTTP at this point so it won't be long before we begin to see the consumer PC components market begin to suffer. The fact remains we are not at that point yet though, but worth considering for those long term plays that literally no one on here is playing because we all have severe ADHD."

2021-06-13 10:45:21,wallstreetbets,"It kinda feels like the traders are loving this stock as it has been bouncing between 30 and 35 for months.  The CFO sold some shares recently but bought back the same quantity. He is on a preferential buy back scheme that allows him to buy some shares at something like 9 bucks over time. So he sold in the 30s and bought the same number back at the preferential price. Makes sense to take some profit. However some investors might not have looked into this and many sold out. 

The other thing is covid is still hanging around so I think Q3 and Q4 are important for the company to prove itself when hopefully covid is well under control."

2021-06-12 22:24:36,wallstreetbets,Corsairs trading 1.5x sales with rapidly expanding margins. AMD has nearly a 100billion market cap and Apple and others are doing in house silicon. Much more upside to Corsair if they keep executing.
2021-06-12 22:27:11,wallstreetbets,"Doesn't have to be one or another. AMD is a bigger market, but the price already reflects that. CRSR is an attractive spot to diversify into for gaming accessories. Small market cap -> larger potential yield/growth.

2021-06-12 22:46:10,wallstreetbets,AMD has already climbed the ranks.  There's so much more growth ahead for crsr.
2021-06-12 22:00:40,wallstreetbets,AMD has more potential I think.  Bought in around 12 a couple years ago.  They are not just in gaming but Tesla uses their chips as well.  Putting them in 2 very important markets

https://www.theesa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2020-ESA_Essential_facts_070820_Final_lowres.pdf

Players of all ages and backgrounds embrace that power of play through video
games. **There are more than 214 million video game players across the United
States**, three quarters of all U.S. households have at least one person who plays
video games, and 64% of U.S. adults and 70% of those under 18
regularly play video games. Large majorities of players say video games provide
mental stimulation (80%) and relaxation (79%)."

2021-06-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"What do you do with “Goodwill” on Balance Sheets? So whenever I’m analyzing a company, I typically remove “goodwill” as an asset of a company when I’m calculating what I believe the true market value of a company is worth. Especially when it’s a small cap or relatively unknown company.

Company’s like Coke or Starbucks, yes I get that they have large goodwills but how do you even calculate the value of their brands accurately? 

Anyway, my question is what do you do with goodwill when doing DD?"
2021-06-12 21:34:39,wallstreetbets,usually at goodwill i drop some used clothes off that i dont wear anymore
2021-06-12 21:37:06,wallstreetbets,"Goodwill is not a value of their brands. No idea why people think this. GAAP around internally generated goodwill is very stringent and not applicable for most companies. 

Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds its fair value"
2021-06-12 21:46:47,wallstreetbets,"You ask for an accounting lesson at 9:00 pm on a Saturday night? 
You have it backwards. Goodwill is an accounting spot to put the excess of price paid for a company over tangible book value.  It's not the value of its brand."
2021-06-12 21:50:16,wallstreetbets,This thread is confusing me.  Is WSB structured around placing bets on good solid companies?
2021-06-12 23:18:00,wallstreetbets,What's a balance sheet?
2021-06-12 22:00:46,wallstreetbets,This sir is Wendy’s… we have no good will except for maybe giving milk to someone that ate our amazing Spicy Chicken Sandwich
2021-06-12 21:35:08,wallstreetbets,"Goodwill has nothing to do with intrinsic value,  which is what buffett says is the best (and only) way to evaluate a company.  I would discard that figure."
2021-06-12 21:42:26,wallstreetbets,"Back it out. It’s not a totally meaningless number, but it does distort the balance sheet for sure. When I’m looking at a balance sheet, I want to see cash, inventory, fixed assets, & other intangible assets such as patents take up the majority of the assets. If there’s a hell of a lot of goodwill, I throw it out"
2021-06-12 21:33:58,wallstreetbets,"I think you are overthinking it. You are assigning a value to goodwill only to remove it. I don't think it's a factor in the first place. I trade on the value of a stock, not on the value of a pr campaign."
2021-06-12 22:31:06,wallstreetbets,Accounting goodwill has absolutely no value. Goodwill reflected on a balance sheet can be disregarded in terms of valuation.
2021-06-13 01:04:37,wallstreetbets,Its the thing that gets written down once the company realizes they fucked up and way over paid for my beanie baby business.
2021-06-13 01:22:38,wallstreetbets,Goodwill can be discarded in finding value of a company. An asset is a future stream of cash flows
2021-06-13 04:45:09,wallstreetbets,"Your question is valid and most comments here prove how little ppl know about accounting.

To keep it short, there is no „right way“ to do it, but most banks when evaluating a company do deduct it from non-current assets and equity. Personally I‘m not so convinced, I think the amount in relation to equity is what matters a lot."
2021-06-12 22:06:17,wallstreetbets,You eat it
2021-06-13 01:35:20,wallstreetbets,"Get rid of it as it has no comparative value.

It arises due to an accounting dilemma that has no good resolution. From an investor standpoint, Goodwill is mostly an irrelevant asset."
2021-06-13 11:47:44,wallstreetbets,I remove it. Goodwill just means they overpaid on acquisitions. Some will say it’s the value of “the people” and other assets that aren’t recorded like public sentiment. What people? They jumped ship or get fired half the time lol
2021-06-12 21:41:48,wallstreetbets,Good will is just good for a tax write off for the business.
2021-06-12 21:49:22,wallstreetbets,"When I took financial accounting,  goodwill was essentially described as the difference in what a company is bought out as minus the difference of assets and liabilities.  So if I bought a company for a thousand dollars,  and the company had 1000 in liabilities and 1200 in assets,  the goodwill is 200. But I wouldn't use that value for anything related to stocks"

2021-06-12 22:07:22,wallstreetbets,"Yes - this.

It is value paid on acquisitions they have historically made.

E.g. company is valued at $50 but they paid $80.  $30 goes to balance sheet at goodwill."
2021-06-13 02:44:03,wallstreetbets,"This. Deadweight. Can, however, be used to reduce net income via impairment or amortization (as applicable to private enterprises).

If it could be donated to Goodwill, many would and it still wouldn’t sell for pennies."

2021-06-12 21:46:58,wallstreetbets,Okay thanks. That’s what unusually do too. Especially when looking at small cap biotechs with tons of Goodwill.
2021-06-12 21:45:25,wallstreetbets,"So I don’t assign a value to it. When I’m looking at a balance sheet and see Non-current assets I subtract the goodwill to get an accurate value of the balance sheet. 

I also usually reduce Accounts Receivables by 5-10% and same with inventory."
2021-06-12 21:51:00,wallstreetbets,So is that how these small cap biotechs end up with such high goodwills? Each round of new capitalization and issuing shares causes the goodwill to skyrocket because they have no other assets or earnings?
2021-06-13 01:27:47,wallstreetbets,"Goodwill of 800 surely?

If a company is worth 200 (1200-1000) and you purchase it for 1000, then you book 800 of goodwill."
2021-06-13 10:07:54,wallstreetbets,I believe that is “other non-tangibles”
2021-06-12 22:55:55,wallstreetbets,Put them on eBay some people like to buy them nasty bitchez underwear
2021-06-12 22:57:22,wallstreetbets,"You could calculate “tangible net worth” which is what the banks do. But if you are investing in small cap biotechs who gives a shit? The value is not in the balance sheet, but in the potential of new technologies. What’s important for these types of companies is the rate of burn, and how long can it be sustained until profits."
2021-06-12 23:25:42,wallstreetbets,Here’s a solution: focus on net working capital. Who gives a shit about goodwill unless it gets impaired?
2021-06-13 01:38:16,wallstreetbets,"Do you step-up real estate and assets that have appreciated in value?

Why are you reducing Accounts Receivable and Inventory of a public company? Are you valuing these as a fire sale? Why invest in that case?"
2021-06-12 22:52:47,wallstreetbets,Issuing shares does not generate goodwill. Only purchasing another company generates goodwill.
2021-06-13 11:52:17,wallstreetbets,The small cap bio firms buy up all the companies they need sometimes through leveraged buyouts and that generates a lot of GoodWill. If anything I think it highlights how risky small cap bio firms are and the potential for high returns. These companies are loaded up on financial and operating leverage

2021-06-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CRSR - Mid term value and growth play with great upside and little downside I've seen a few other CRSR DD's here lately and wanted to add my own. Corsair likely needs little introduction these days, as their computer components find their way into a huge and increasing number of PC builds. Fans, radiators, keyboards, etc. Their products are great and the way the company is managed is just as good.

There is unfortunately not much long term data available on the company, as they only recently went public with an IPO in September 2020, when it [debuted at $15 a share](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/23/tech/corsair-ipo-ceo-interview/index.html). However I will do my best to analyze all the data about the company since then to prove Corsair has a great valuation as it currently sits at \~$32 a share.

As the above link states, Corsair had a revenue of 1.3 Billion ending in June 2020. Even through the first waves of the pandemic, with closures of factories everywhere, Corsair still managed to rake in cash, which they continue to do so. Using TD Ameritrade's platform thinkorswim, we can see revenue has still been growing since then, massively too. 

**Financials**

[TDA's Fundamentals on CRSR](https://preview.redd.it/nevpo4l6zw471.png?width=1595&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1b53934b0273547dee788d0e07b7a98c259fa57)

There's alot to take in right there, but lets analyze their fundamentals.

* Revenue growth was estimated at 65.75%. For a company to see that much revenue growth during a time that production facilities across the world are shutting down is nothing short of amazing. And that's not all for growth during Covid.
* Earnings Per Share in the last twelve months is at $1.59, pretty good. What's even better is that this is a 108% increase in the EPS of last year.
* Book Value Per Share rose similarly, with a yearly increase of 50.39%, bringing it up to $4.76 BVPS.
* Gross and Net Profit Margins saw in increases of 30.76% and 112.62%, respectively.
* At the same time, the Debt to Capital ratio dropped through the floor, falling 65.03% to strengthen the company's balance sheet.
* Financial Leverage decreased by 62.71%, showing their effort in paying off loans on assets.

As for valuation, Corsair's P/E ratio, the most well known valuation ratio, is at 19.606. Relatively high, but most value investors consider a P/E below 20 to be the range for a decent value stock. On the other hand, P/C and P/B are at 21.299 and 6.2857, higher than desired for value stock considerations. While the P/C and P/B can be used as a counterargument to my thesis, I am willing to overlook these numbers because Corsair's massive growth during a global pandemic highlights that this company can be considered undervalued and a growth stock candidate.

Additionally, Corsair has nearly [doubled expected earnings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/crsr/earnings) in 2 of the last three quarters. The numbers are as follows:

* Q3, 2020: Expected earnings of .26, actual was .52
* Q4, 2020: Expected earnings of .56, actual was .52
* Q1, 2021: Expected earnings of .34, actual was .56

This indicates Corsair's consistent results, with analysts underestimating the company's potential.

Now, lets look at a chart of CRSR.

**Previous 12 Months**

[Flat as a pancake](https://preview.redd.it/1sfmzvua9x471.png?width=1609&format=png&auto=webp&s=c243c5ead1888e7339ca7829b2e786764da180ca)

Now, I'm not personally one for technical analysis. I won't go in depth here, but anyone can see that in the last several months, the stock price has barely moved. down from a high of $51.37 per share in November 2020, it has settled at a stable \~$32 per share, rarely deviating more than a dollar in either direction. Part of this is because of the low volume in recent months. Since March 2021, volume has never gone below 500,000 and never above 4.8 million, with the 4.8 milllion figure being a significant outlier. In the past, Corsair has seen much stronger buy volume and can rise in price quickly, going from its IPO price of $15 in September 2020 to its ATH of $51.37 only two months later.

Why is this important? A stable stock price means low Implied Volatility. Low Implied Volatility means cheap options. IV is currently at 56.7%, and any increase in stock price above its resistance of $33 will see an increase in the price of all options. ATM weeklies can be as cheap as a $.37 premium per share for calls. LEAPS aren't terribly expensive either, although open interest on long term options is currently low.

**Looking Forward**

All this already sounds like a great investment, but as I previously mentioned multiple times, these numbers put up by Corsair were all during the Covid pandemic and it's factory shutdowns. As anyone who has tried to build a PC recently will know, semiconductor prices are through the roof currently because of [low supply](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/semiconductor-supply-shortage.html). GPU and CPU production is extremely slow right now, but just starting to pick up steam. Over the past year, [scalpers](https://www.pcmag.com/news/scalpers-have-sold-50000-nvidia-rtx-3000-gpus-through-ebay-stockx) have strangled the computer chip market and alot of people are straight up refusing to pay for these inflated prices. Once production is back in full force and consumers are building more PC's, peripheral sales will spike alongside them. This is where Corsair comes in. If they can put up spectacular growth numbers while a large part of the market sits and waits for prices on critical components goes down, think about what will happen when new AMD chips and NVIDIA graphics cards are being pumped out at breakneck paces, which will soon happen as vaccines are now allowing non essential businesses to ramp up production once again. Most analysts place the [price target](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/CRSR/price-target/) around $50, showing its strong upside.

**Conclusion**

Corsair is currently showing signs of both a good value investment and growth stock. They demonstrate a decent P/E ratio and increases in EPS, BVPS, revenue, and profit margin, alongside decreases in Debt to Capital ratio and Financial Leverage. The stock price is currently very steady at \~$32 a share, resulting in low IV and cheap options. As the semiconductor market warms back up as Covid subsides, Corsair sales will increase even more as more people build PC's with Corsair cases, mouses, power supplies, etc.

*Current Positions: 30 shares at $33.73, 20 Aug 21 35C. I plan on buying more shares and options.*

2021-06-12 21:34:50,wallstreetbets,"I see the same upside in it. I viewed it as a long term investment for growth and not a meme stock (though it’s starting to be pumped in the daily chat as if it is one). I started my position earlier this week with 500 shares and 125 calls (various strikes and dates, earliest being 35C 7/16 and longest being 40C 1/20/2023). I was going to add more this upcoming week, since I expected it to stay in its sub $32 pattern, but I’m not sure what this last minute spike will do to its regular movements. If there’s another dip this week I’ll grab another 500 shares and 75 more calls round out to 1,000 shares and 200 calls in total and that’ll be the cap for my investment in it."

1) Low operating margins 
2) Growth uncertainty. 2020 was a banner year due to COVID. Going forward, growth is likely in the 10-20% range. (55% growth in 2020 on 1.7b in revenues. ~17% growth guided in 2021 on 1.9-2.1b in revenues)"

2021-06-13 07:57:48,wallstreetbets,"It's going to $100 imo. People, even those who are bullish on an equity, let current price cloud their thinking on what an equity should be worth.

Their guidance is 260mm earnings this year, that's going to be conservative just like all of their estimates thus far and the colour on their guidance was for growth outstripping even what they had internally modelled. If, as I expect, they hit 300mm in earnings with a growth of 40% rev over 2020 that's easily deserving of a 30 p/e which would be a 9b market cap or about 3.5 p/s. These are not crazy valuations especially given crsr's significantly improved balance sheet.

9b market cap is $95 with this year's employee pay stock dilution priced in.

Holding 1000 shares at $35 cb and $50 is where I might consider just starting to take a little profit, not the target.

LOGI currently has an EV of x10 CRSR with a little over twice the predicted revenue for 21 and 3x the predicted earnings (using my numbers above which predict from the colour of each companies earnings call - logis was pretty bearish)."

2021-06-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Following sentiment on UWMC and got in early - is sentiment analysis actually worthwhile? I bought in some $UWMC a week ago. I started following Wallstreet bets and reddit a few weeks back and I've been able to find quite a few stocks. I also discovered a few platforms that track sentiment for reddit - and I wonder how good is sentiment analysis in general. At first I though it was bullshit but I used the below too buy in $UWMC a week ago, and its been pretty decent at spotting the trend and even now says a 93% bull market

&#x200B;

What do we think of sentiment analysis. I found this platform which looks neat so, I'm thinking of using it? Does sentiment analysis actually work? I also have some more specific questions

1. I know sentiment analysis uses NLP, can computers really understand what ""to the moon"" means etc
2. Is sentiment pre emptive or post occasion. I read that its usually post but for $UWMC etc seems to have been pre
3. Is it a consistent trading signal?

Quick addendum: people are saying a week ago isn't early which is true but the sentiment has been rising from year->month->week->day so it looks solid to me had I known about sentiment analysis beforehand."
2021-06-12 20:50:09,wallstreetbets,"A week ago wasn’t early. Sentiment on WSB shouldn’t be a deciding factor. If anything it’s a starting point to do your own research and see if it’s actually worth investing your money. Most of the posts are paid for by the company the post is about. If you treat it as more than an advertisement, you’ll go broke in 6 months."
2021-06-12 22:17:26,wallstreetbets,"This should be a good play but if you bought in to every stock anyone ever posted on here you’d be broke , as broke as I am …"
2021-06-12 20:52:14,wallstreetbets,A week ago  is not early I’ve been I uwmc since March
2021-06-12 20:43:41,wallstreetbets,"This is a good strategy listen up, when you buy it dips right? And when you sell it moons. So buy smol amt and sell, then buy again ☑️"
2021-06-12 21:25:02,wallstreetbets,Month ago was early. I got in with 500 at 6.82 and averaged up to 1700@9.50
2021-06-13 00:34:02,wallstreetbets,"But if this worked it would get ""priced out"". In other words, if there was a $100 bill on the ground, someone would pick it up very quickly after it hit the ground. If there is a website dedicated to using sentiment analysis to pick stocks, that means someone else has already picked up the $100, and now wants to share their knowledge with you on how they did it because they know it's not likely to happen to them again. (Step 1, bend over)"
2021-06-12 22:45:47,wallstreetbets,"You're supposed to buy when sentiment is bad, and sell when it's good.

[https://imgur.com/gChVQCP](https://imgur.com/gChVQCP)

I'm gonna buy back in if everybody's posting loss porn on UWMC next week. If it moons, oh well I already took my profit.

Oh and.. the only reason sentiment correlates to price action is because sentiment is formed FROM the price action, not the other way around."
2021-06-12 21:04:31,wallstreetbets,"I would be cautious following someone else's AI/ML pipeline. It may be really good but it's hard to tell.

NLP isn't going to *know* what ""to the moon"" means, but it can learn that phrase (or the words in it) are associated with being bullish if it sees enough examples of bullish comments with it and bearish ones without. Thing is, that means the model is only going to be as good as the labels/data you give it to learn from. Plus there's an additional layer of abstraction when you try to extrapolate from sentiment to activity. (People may be bullish on a stock but not actually buy it)

I know sentiment analysis *can* be a useful indicator, and it sounds like you've experienced that personally. To say it's consistent... I wouldn't count on it. This sub has been pretty phenomenally wrong in the past, and even when people are calling it right it's possible to lose money on a bet that was directionally correct.

Use it if your thesis is that sentiment is what's driving price action, but it's definitely not a one-size-fits-all-solution."

2021-06-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CLNE Annual Shareholders Meeting on June 14th @ 9am PST &#x200B;

""We are excited about the Annual Meeting, particularly because it provides our stockholders an opportunity to approve a component of what we believe is an important commercial partnership for Clean Energy. On April 16, 2021, in connection with entering into a Project Addendum to Fuel Pricing Agreement (the “Fuel Agreement”) with a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”), we entered into a Transaction Agreement with Amazon under which we issued to another subsidiary of Amazon a warrant (the “Amazon Warrant”) to purchase up to an aggregate of 53,141,755 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $13.49 per share, which was 21.3% more than the $11.12 closing price of our common stock on April 15, 2021.

Through the Fuel Agreement and Amazon Warrant, our board of directors (the “Board”) believes Amazon can become an important strategic partner for Clean Energy. Further, Amazon is purchasing low and negative carbon Renewable Natural Gas (“RNG”) from Clean Energy, which we believe validates using RNG as a transportation fuel at scale. We expect to provide RNG to Amazon through 27 existing fueling stations and 19 non-exclusive new or upgraded stations that we expect to construct by the end of the year. The new and existing stations will provide RNG in 15 different states across the United States, and we will own all the stations.

The Warrant Shares vest in multiple tranches, the first of which for 13,283,445 Warrant Shares vested upon execution of the Fuel Agreement. Subsequent tranches will vest over time based on fuel purchases by Amazon and its affiliates, up to a total of $500 million, excluding any payments attributable to “Pass Through Costs,” which consist of all costs associated with the delivered cost of gas and applicable taxes determined by reference to the selling price, gallons or gas sold. Importantly, if all the vesting conditions of the Amazon Warrant are satisfied, Amazon will have purchased hundreds of millions of gasoline gallon equivalents (“GGEs”) of RNG at today’s fuel prices from Clean Energy.

We believe a commercial partnership with Amazon will enhance our strategies, initiatives and efforts to achieve our goals to grow fleet and other consumer support for the use of RNGasavehicle fuel for our target customers and geographies. The Board also believes the proceeds from the issuance of our common stock to Amazon in the event Amazon were to vest and then exercise the Amazon Warrant in part or whole for cash, would enhance our liquidity in support of our operations, as well as our ability to execute our business plans and pursue opportunities for further growth. Accordingly, we believe securing this commercial partnership and incenting Amazon to purchase the maximum amount of fuel under the Fuel Agreement is important for the trajectory of Clean Energy. """

""To approve an amendment to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of

and certain other conditions, the Amazon Warrant may be exercised, in whole or in part, at any time before

That seems like there is no confidence in the company. And let's face it, the way wall street works you would think their biggest share holder would get a sniff of Amazon deal?? Curcious."

2021-06-13 08:52:41,wallstreetbets,That $13 price is basically a floor valuation too. My feeling is that Amazon gets a sweetheart deal because of the prestige they give to CLNE.

2021-06-13 01:33:51,wallstreetbets,"Hate to bother you bro, but could you ELI5 ""call options"" for me?

I've read a bunch and viewed a few YouTube videos, but I feel like I'm failing to grasp its fundamentals.

For instance:

A stock is currently trading at $5.

I think it will go up to $10.

So i put a call in for $7 @ 100 shares.

Then it hits $10, do I exercise the option to buy the shares at $7?

-------------------


Is this correct?


What do I need to watch out for when dealing with ""call options."""
2021-06-12 21:27:30,wallstreetbets,My calls and I hope so
2021-06-13 06:57:45,wallstreetbets,Closes over 13 on Friday is the key. It'll swing wildly as delta hedging plays a role during the week. At least that is my understanding (best guess based on reading). Gamma ramp works both ways so volatility will be high as delta hedging intensifies swings in both directions.
2021-06-13 05:16:22,wallstreetbets,Hopefully not the BB good news dead cat bounce. I’m not a cat

2021-06-13 15:16:48,wallstreetbets,what's your experation
2021-06-13 00:35:19,wallstreetbets,Made in WSB is stitched on the inside of my boxers.
2021-06-13 01:54:09,wallstreetbets,"I’m def not an expert or even remotely close to being a teacher. So you’ll have to keep that in mind from my off the cuff explanation. Basically in your example you’re correct. But don’t forget you have the ability to sell that call you bought for a higher premium, example near the end. 

Buying a call is a contract to be able to purchase 100 shares, at whatever strike you chose by the expiration date. Only if the share price is higher than your strike price at close on the date of expiration can it be executed. Some brokers allow early execution as well. 

As an example to show my most recent success with options I give you this, I bought x40 $40 1/22/22 BB calls in March for an average of $52 apiece. So I had just over $2k invested. Two weeks ago I sold those calls for an average price of $620 apiece. That was about $22k in profit. Now let’s say that instead of rocketing up like BB did for me, it crashed hard. Well if by that expiration date of 1/22/22 it still wasn’t close to $40 or even going up, it would basically be worth $0. And I’d have only lost what I invested initially ($2k). 

Now back to present day. I have x120 $13 calls that expire this coming Friday on CLNE. I stand to lose around $12k if I don’t sell those calls by Friday. Now the closer we get to Friday and the share price stays under $13, my premium value of each contract(average of $101 per) will steadily drop. But, if the share price starts to climb like crazy and even pass $13, they raise in premium value. Which I hope is the case of course. This was an extremely risky “bet”, so please don’t tell my wife lol…."
2021-06-13 07:17:09,wallstreetbets,"If you want to buy 100 shares of the stock at $7 then exercise it. You don't have wait till experation if it a US option either.

 If you are just looking for money then selling the Call is a better choice as it will incur less fees than exercising and selling the share back to the market.

Calls are the right to buy a stock at a specific price. The expiration is when that right is lost. The amount of time left and a stocks price, determines the options value.

They can also become illiquid and hard to close, especially near the expiration date.  So don't wait until the last days to take profit unless you want to own the stock. 

Finally, if there us a good amount of time left on a Call it will be worth more now than later assuming the stock price stays is above the strike price."
2021-06-13 01:37:39,wallstreetbets,"You don’t have to exercise the call. You can just sell it and take profit. Most of these retards don’t have the resources to actually buy the stock. They just gamble on calls because of the leverage. Wait a sec, I sort a guide. I’ll post a link. One sec.

2021-06-13 02:10:44,wallstreetbets,"I replied very shortly (but to the point) to another brain damaged (I think with that one quite literally as he said so) a few days ago:

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nv1518/comment/h12ic77

To watch out for with options is that you can loose your money very, very, VERY quickly. Can gain just as fast, but the odds are against, obviously."

2021-06-13 08:21:20,wallstreetbets,"If the price is swings big the Vega will go up. The Deltas for all strikes near the money will rise as more. Gamma's will increases as well. If u  understand that a Stonks Delta is always 1 then you understand the best you can get from a gamma is to push delta to one. 3-4 strikes ITM is usually about a delta of 1. By then all your potential profit is stock price movement and zero gamma. 

Pure Delta plays are all about Volatility minus time. 

 Say there is 5 days left on a $13 Call and the stock price is $13. U buy a call at open then the price goes to $7 then $15, then by 2pm it back to $13. You could potentially sell that call for profit assuming prior periods did not have that kind of price action."

2021-06-13 08:58:08,wallstreetbets,"Ok, can you point me in any direction to show that plan? Or is that your opinion, in which I respect your opinion."
2021-06-13 07:51:27,wallstreetbets,"One thing to mention as precaution. There is no need to gamble on a specific date for your expiration.

 Example: The play is by 6/18, you assume the price is going to moon bc of shorts covering. Playing the 6/18 calls might not be the best choice. If you buy  july or sept Calls  you get more time value and a higher a Delta. So if the price moons you get more per $1 move in the stock price. Plus, you keep time if the price move even higher later. Obviously you pay more now in premiun but you get a chance to cash in more and you can always sell the call back if the price goes the other way bc you have time value. Time is money. $$$

Usless you're just YOLOing that 6/18 it will move and need as many contracts as you can afford. I think this is a safer choice."

- currently trading at a P/E of 3.99
- mkt cap 2.65 billion 
- profitable last 4 quarters never dipping below .45 EPS
- literally paid off most of their debt during covid, long term debt owed is 30 million dollars (Big Lots debt/equity for the three months ending April 30, 2021 was 0.03.)
- compare to Cosco p/e 37, TGT p/e 18.5, TJX p/e 44, dollar general p/e 19
- yearly revenue of 6.2 fucking billion dollars
- same CEO and president for the past 3 years who has transformed biglots into a company that can make money again, even after a pandemic 
- Mostly has a history of supply chain and distribution services at petco, former coo and president of tailored services, former army ranger
Also for some 
- Public float - 32 million shares

Why is the P/E so low compared to competitors? Is it a buy? I’m trying to long something and during this great plateau I believe that biglots could trade at four times what it currently trades at, but I am a mentally challenged child who has access to his moms Amex card and blowing tendie money on Fortnite vbux is just not the same

Edit - at this rate, this post will be the top controversial of the week."
2021-06-12 22:03:57,wallstreetbets,"Debt is not a bad thing. 

Huge companies like $AAPL and $MSFT have mountains of cash but they still issue debt. 

If you're paying off debt that's like 4-6%, what's that say to your shareholders? To me it indicates that management thinks it's best return paying off that 4-6% debt. 

If you're into 6% returns go for it. I'm looking for a more aggressive company."
2021-06-12 21:31:55,wallstreetbets,$BIG is up 62% YTD. This might have been a bargain play at low $40s back in Jan. But pushing $70 now is not BTFD.

2021-06-13 03:30:59,wallstreetbets,On yahoo I see a debt/equity ratio of 136.55%. You are talking about 0.03… what is your source? I bought $big and sold immidiately after I saw the big debt.
2021-06-13 15:12:39,wallstreetbets,P/E ratio is probably because they aren’t growing as fast. Idk seems like it’s fairly valued to me but in a sea of overvalued who knows
2021-06-13 00:02:48,wallstreetbets,"While yes, debt in itself is not necessarily bad, it’s usually only good if a company is using it to reinvest in itself. We just went through a dip where a lot of good companies went out of business and others had to take on debt to survive, the fact biglots was able to thrive during the lockdown is valuable within itself. Currently their rating by S&P is BB-"

2021-06-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Options Chain Historical Data Search? I've been trying to find a source that easily lays out past data on options chains for you to see. I would like to see information about options that have recently expired or exercised. I have been unable to find a very good source for this so far. Does anyone have any recommendations?

Looking at data on recently expired chains may be beneficial and affect my interpretation of the Greek factors involved in options. I can certainly think of numerous ways this information could affect trade decisions, especially for a community like this that does often talk about the Gammas.

Let me know what you all can find out there.

EDIT: Several of the comments below have provided info on possible paid sources for this information. After a bit more research, I think that omnieq and optionistics have the best free data. 

Omnieq's limitations are a less than user friendly interface that doesn't seem to include all relevant data (in the free version at least), but there is a lot that I would find useful. Optionistics has some useful graphs with Greek metrics, but requires you to specify a single strike price and expiry date to see that information (you can't easily compare data for multiple strikes laid out next to each other). As a result, I will be using Optionistics to help me decide on a specific option contract after I have selected an underlying stock.

Article from the Morningstar:

In a sector where undervalued opportunities are few and far between, ViacomCBS (VIAC) stands out, trading 30% below our $61 fair value estimate. We believe the company is poised to capitalize on the trend toward increased consumer adoption of streaming services with its relaunch of Paramount+ in March and the success of its other streaming platforms like Pluto. The flagship service offers not only a strong on-demand library from the company’s deep library but also access to CBS and its wealth of sports rights, including the NFL and March Madness, which helped to drive streaming growth over the first four months of 2021. With the recent renewal of Sunday afternoon NFL rights, ViacomCBS now controls two of its most important sports rights into the next decade.

Antero Resources is an independent oil and natural gas co. that is involved in acquiring, exporting, developing and producing natural gas (NG), natural gas liquids (NGL), and oil properties in the Good Ol' U.S. of A.

**Highlights of Antero Resources:**

**3rd Largest U.S. Gas Producer**

**2nd Largest U.S. Natural Gas Liquid Producer**

**Owns 38% of core-liquids rich undrilled locations in Appalachia.**

For those that do not nerd out on Energy, the Marcellus Shale is a resevoir that produces NGL and oil and is the largest NG reservoir in America, producing roughly 35% of all of the United States NG supply. It is considered a solid play due to its consistent and predictable geology and recoveries relative to drilling and completion costs. Long story short, it is not a risky play in terms of exploration coming up unsuccessful, which is a plague in the industry, and on a energy company's books.

**Marcellus Shale**

**As of year-end 2020, AR had the following assets in the Marcellus Shale:**

\-515,000 net acres located primarily in northern West Virginia, which is strategically located bordering near Ohio and PA.

\-Operation of 1000 producing horizontal wells

\-17.6 Tcfe (trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent) of net proved reserves.

\-1,877 undeveloped core drilling locations.

**UTICA SHALE**

Now on to the Utica Shale, which is located a few thousand feet below the Marcellus Shale. Think of the Utica Shale as that girl in High School that you knew was going to be a smoke show but she hung out with the Drama Club and was a lil too quick witted for you at the time. Yes, we all know that this was mostly due to the amount of bong hits you did in your buddy's Honda Accord when out for lunch. I digress. Back to the Utica Shale and the great state of Ohio, where Antero has 91,000 net acres, 200 horizontal wells currently producing, 2.0 tcfe (here I'll write it again but remember it this time, trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent), and 494 *undeveloped* drilling locations. I italicized undeveloped because AR knows how big of a play Utica will be down the road. Also, touching on the critical importance of location, location. location, AR's acreage is located bordering West Virginia and PA. To emphasize the importance of their foothold, here are links showing AR's locations in reference to a map of heat spots for natural resources.

[United States Geological Survey Results of where Total Organic Carbon was high.](https://i.redd.it/gc5xdvgdww471.gif)

The United States Geological Survey's mean estimates of undiscovered, technically recoverable resources, indicate that the Utica Shale contains about 38 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, about 940 million barrels of oil and 208 million barrels of NGL.

**Natural Gas Futures:**

\-Rallied to eight month highs as of Friday 6/11/21 at the Market close

\-July NG (NG1:COM) was up 4.7% to nearly $3.296/MMBtu (Metric Million British Thermal Unit), which was the highest front-month contract settlement since 10/30/20. It also capped a 6.4% gain for the week.

\-Citing Data from Refinitiv, Reuters forecasts the average gas demand from 88.3B cf/day this week to 90.1B cf/day next week and 91B cf/day in two weeks.

\-Schneider Electric states that demand for feedgas for LNG terminals has risen since Monday 6/7/21 and pipeline exports to Mexico are reaching new highs.

**Q1 2021 Earnings Highlights:**

\-Over $600m of forecasted Free Cash Flow in 2021

\-Over $2.0B of forecasted Free Cash Flow through 2025

\-Over 2,000 premium undeveloped core locations

\-\~$1.84/MMBtu NG breakeven price, unhedged.

\-Leverage at 2.0x and expected to drop below 2x in 2021

\-Absolute Debt Reduction of $800m in 2020 and over $700m expected in 2021

Now, if you have gotten this far I am assuming it is because you cannot wait to comment about Environmental, Social, and Governance concerns and rightfully so.

**Here are some stats on AR's** ***Industry Leading*** **Environmental, Social & Governance Metrics:**

\-One of the industry's lowest in relation to green house gas emission

\-Very low 0.046% Methane Leak Loss Rate- No Flaring

\-83% of produced water reused in 2020

\-Goal to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2025.

**Speculation:**

According to Natural Gas Intel, a recent executive order on climate related financial risks is to be developed with the coming months. This executive order would require major suppliers to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and related risks. With this being put into play and the goal of net-zero emissions goal by 2050, as well as cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, Antero is in a very good position.

It is my belief that with AR planning on being net-zero by 2025, and being positioned geographically where they are in the U.S. they will somehow benefit from the Infrastructure Plan if/when it goes through. According to Forbes, prior to the pandemic, the economic boom that kicked off in SE Ohio at the Utica Shale around 2011 resulted in $86B in new capital investments and created over 200,000 new jobs for Ohio citizens by the end of 2019. Unemployment rates that had stood as high as 15.5% in 2009 dropped into the 5-6% range ten years later. It seems to me that the NG Industry, if done correctly in terms of the environment, could be a major benefactor from an administration looking to create a ton of jobs.

With private South American miners out of the picture, these EV companies are gonna turn to different companies. Companies like LAC and PLL are gonna have less competition. While EV is a slow growing industry, lithium is an immediate need for all of these companies, so increased sales are gonna pump them a lot harder than stocks in other sectors.

Not always, there are different methods of extraction. In Chile, yes there's danger to the ecosystem, but in Australia there's not. It depends on the mine, the local ecology, and the method of extraction - as with 100% of the mining we already do. Lithium extraction is better than cutting down the top of a mountain for coal, or open pit copper mining. And btw, we're going to need a lot of copper in a future populated by wind turbines and electric vehicles."

Comanche Peak Nuclear Plant in Texas filed for adding two reactors to their site in 2008, with a very good chance of getting it approved and would have added 3.5 GW of capacity. But in 2013 they withdrew the request because they couldn't compete with natural gas.

Meanwhile, wind and solar have gone on to supply 25% of Texas electrical energy needs. And another 35 GW will be installed by the end of 2023. Wind and solar are cheaper and easier to site.

Maybe one of these days these new Small Modular Reactors will turn it around, especially if they're allowed to use spent fuel from older reactors. But the first demonstrator for that technology is still at least 7 years away."

Next to the green arrow on the right is what probably will happen if this analysis is correct. Wave 3 will go up to about 38$ (by mid-summer?). We'll give a little back and then we continue our upward move to at about 88$. (by end of summer). \[The red rectangle on the right is the chart above.\]

2021-06-12 21:56:41,wallstreetbets,PLTR is honestly the only WSB long term investment.

2021-06-12 22:16:48,wallstreetbets,I was fortunate to get in BNGO at 1.07 10k shares. I sold 70% around the big run up at roughly $10. Got the rest still. Problem is they are getting revenue but its like $10-15m a year. Its tough to command a 3-4b mkt cap with low revenue.  The potential is there but it could take another 3 years.
2021-06-13 13:26:24,wallstreetbets,"Since Palantir was trading goofy and relatively horizontal throughout the year, I picked a random price ($24.70) and bought a wad of shares.

2021-06-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$WISH - Unbiased Technical Analysis ***TL;DR -*** WISH is stuck in both a long term downtrend and a short term one

Key support is **9.62**

Needs to get over **10.90** to break the first one

Needs to get over **12.29** to break the second one

Price targets/resistances from there would be **15.06, 17.39, 18.42, 19.42, 24.17 - 24.77 (zone)**

\---

Really helps to have an unbiased perspective on these sorts of things. It's much easier to give analysis like that when you have no position - so I figured I'd share what I'm seeing on the $WISH chart - since so many of you are balls deep.

Note that I do not have a position **yet** \- but if we break over **12.29** I plan on opening one.

[$WISH 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/6z8myap8lw471.png?width=2224&format=png&auto=webp&s=c21ca8d8c29fd1f47ab7dabd17e59ba256fc3fc8)

Starting with the near-term downtrend (the teal lines) - we've been stuck in this descending channel since the beginning of March. We actually got a close above it on **6/8 -** but it was a false breakout. I find these are much more common on high profile names.

Even so - to break out of this channel again we need to get over **10.90** on a daily close. This breakout point slopes downward each day. Until that happens - **the near term trend is down.** After breaking that - we will likely target the red line just above (probably on the same day they are close together and becoming closer each day).

Next - the long-term downtrend (the red line) - we've been stuck in this one since **1/28.** I've seen a lot of people draw this as a big descending wedge, but I don't think there's enough confirmation for that, so I prefer to just use this trendline. On 6/9 - we also attempted to break this one - but we never got a daily candle close above it. **This is the main one to break for some real upside.**

To break this one up - we need to get a daily candle close above **12.29 -** also sloping down each day. From there we would target **15.06** \- which would be the single most important resistance on the chart. If we can get over that - it should become support. Levels above are **17.39, 18.42, 19.42** and this supply zone from **24.17 - 24.77.** Look for every level to become support once we break them.

Also note the huge uptick in volume the past couple of days. I see a lot of people misinterpreting this as meaning ""whales bought in"" - but that isn't always the case. You have to look at **where the volume took place.** Yes there was a ton of volume on the first green candle - but even more on the red candles that followed - which is not bullish normally.

On the next breakout candle - **we want to see a large increase in volume again.** Look for that as additional confirmation.

Also note we are testing key support at 9.62 - if we are going to bounce soon it has to be here.

That's it - keep it simple - you don't need 1000s of paragraphs of confirmation bias and shitty indicators.

Good luck apes

2021-06-12 22:03:37,wallstreetbets,"There are other things than technical analysis to trade on in the short term, such as news and hype/popularity/sentiment.  I use a combination of expected news, fundamental analysis, a feel for general sentiment of the company, and the charts before opening my trades.  The charts are probably the least important of those to me.

That said, I'm not shitting on TA.  I think they are one of the factors you should look at, just not the only and not the most important.

I do have a problem with your TA here, though, because I don't feel it gives the most useful information.  You say what it needs to do to break the downtrend but not what the probability is or an expected timeframe of breaking the downtrend.  What good is knowing what has to happen if you don't know how likely it is to happenn or when it will happen?

That's why all the other factors are important, too.

You do at least say when you would open a position, but imo it would be much more useful to me if you said x percent of the time, a stock continues in its downtrend for x amount of months given similar situations, for example."

C3 is growing rapidly with a total revenue of $156.7M in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2020 compared to $91.6M in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2019 representing a year-over-year growth of 71%. Over the same period, the subscription revenue grew to $135.4M from $77.5M representing a 75% increase.

C3 has high total contract values for software subscriptions. The average total subscription contract values were:

* 2016: $1.2M
* 2017: $11.7M
* 2018: $10.8M
* 2019: $16.2M
* 2020: $12.1M

**BULL ARGUMENT**

C3 has a first-mover advantage in Enterprise AI due to investment into their products and technology over the last decade. They have “Lighthouse Customers”, or large global early adopters, in Europe, Asia, and the United States across a range of industries that serve as proof points for other potential customers. Some customers include:

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/6v6m5kedew471.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e44125b37976abacc041856b3b4fda5e7608a95)

There is an extensive partner ecosystem that includes strategic relationships with established technology leaders like:

* [Amazon Web Services](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181010005314/en/C3-and-Amazon-Web-Services-Expand-Collaboration-to-Drive-Enterprise-Artificial-Intelligence-Adoption)
* Fidelity National Information Services
* [Google](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180821005202/en/C3-IoT-and-Google-Cloud-Announce-Partnership)
* [IBM](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-02-27/correcting-and-replacing-ibm-services-and-c3-ai-announce-strategic-alliance-for-digital-transformation-with-ai)
* [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/09/microsoft-sees-gain-on-c3ai-investment-concurrent-with-ipo.html)

Although the average total subscription value is decreasing and may continue to decrease, C3 has restructured the sales organization and expanded the market-partner ecosystem to address small, medium, and large sales opportunities. The progress is promising as the average total subscription contract value for six months ended October 31, 2020 was $7.7M.

On February 1, 2021, the [launch of the Open AI Energy Initiative](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shell-c3-ai-baker-hughes-220000073.html) was announced by Shell, C3, Baker Hughes, and Microsoft. The initiative provides a framework for energy operators, service providers, equipment providers, and independent software vendors for energy services to offer interoperable solutions powered by the [BHC3 AI Suite](https://bakerhughesc3.ai/bhc3-ai-suite/model-driven-architecture/) and Microsoft Azure.

**BEAR ARGUMENT**

C3 faces intense competition and which could be an “early bird may get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese” type of situation as second movers could develop technology to improve upon any shortfalls. The main sources of potential competition include:

* Greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and larger customer bases
* Larger sales and marketing budgets and resources, and the capacity to leverage their sales efforts and marketing across a broader portfolio
* Wider geographic presence
* Lower labor and research and development costs
* Larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios
* Greater financial, technical, and other resources to provide support, make acquisitions, hire talent, and to develop and introduce new products

The Chief Executive Officer, Tom Siebel has received many [honors and awards](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181112005818/en/EY-Honors-Thomas-M.-Siebel-as-2018-Entrepreneur-Of-The-Year%C2%AE), but if he, or other senior management team members, were to leave the company C3 may not be able to execute their business strategy. Siebel is critical to the overall management and continued development of the AI suite and AI Applications. All of the executive officers are at-will employees and they do not maintain any key person life insurance policies.

C3 has a history of operating losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future. The sales cycles can be long and unpredictable and the sales efforts require considerable time and expense. This is due to investing into sales to large organizations that typically undertake a significant evaluation and negotiation process due to their leverage, size, organization structure, and approval requirements. A limited number of customers have accounted for a substantial portion of C3’s revenue. The top three entities together accounted for 34% and 44% of the revenue for years ended April 30, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The same entities have been with C3 for an average of 3.3 years.

**CONCLUSION**

Given the success of C3’s customers, I feel it will increase penetration of their existing customer base. They are primed to expand the major account sales organization to focus on large enterprise software agreements. Additionally, C3 will continue to develop high volume distribution channels to address the needs of small and medium businesses. I think they will continue to bring new product families to market that will develop into substantial recurring revenue streams. The total addressable market is rapidly growing and estimated to grow to $271B in 2024, a 12% CAGR from 2020's estimate of $174B.  This is a big opportunity for C3.  The lock up period [ended on June 7, 2021](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/ipos/overview?dealId=907559-94759), and earnings happened on June 2, 2021. I believe everyone who wanted to sell has sold at this point. I am bullish and think C3 has great potential for a swing trade, but more so a long-term investment.

2021-06-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"My brokerage just emailed me to borrow shares for a short sale (SOFI). IMAGE AS REQUESTED:  https://imgur.com/a/rpOsjdm




I've had this brokerage account for a little over 5 years or so (and other accounts for over 10 years), and this is the first time ever that I've come across a request to potentially borrow shares for a short sale.

It's specifically for the SOFI stock - a company I believe is solid and has great future earnings potential, so I've no intention to sell any time soon.

But this request for short sale prompted me to search for short sale interest for SOFI:

https://fintel.io/ss/us/sofi
* Latest Market Date	2021-06-11
* Short Volume	886,013
* Market Volume	2,769,300
* Short Volume Ratio	32%


So, what does that mean? I don't know.  I'm no expert, and barely understand the concept of stock holdings.  I just know that SOFI is a company I think will do well in the future.  So, I will just buy and hold for at least the next couple of years, and if the price goes down due to the short - I'll just buy a lot more."

2021-06-12 22:38:22,wallstreetbets,"SOFI is still so under the radar- regarding what it has emerged into the past year.. here is a summary of an article that does a good job of hitting the high points:

SoFi acquisition of Golden Pacific will make it a national bank, like JPMorgan Chase. This will allow SOFI to take direct deposits & make loans based on those deposits, rather than acting as a re-seller.
Sofi also offers Credit Cards & recently announced it deal to offer auto loans. Also, theres SoFi brokerage, which competes with Robinhood. 


Then add to the mix, Galileo, a payments processor (ie Stripe, Square ) it bought for $1.2B. Galileo dominates the Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) ecosystem. Galileo offers banking platform for over 90% of all digital banks in North America.  Over 70% of Top100 Fintechs globally are clients- including Chime and Robinhood.


All the deals are similar. SoFi is buying capabilities from small players it can roll into a full-service bank-and-brokerage offering for a national audience, running off a mobile app.
The comparison with JPMorgan Chase isn’t pure hyperbole.


**The Importance of CEO Anthony Noto**
         SoFi is the ultimate expression of this change and, in Anthony Noto, it has a leader who can drive that change home.
         ""It’s the jockey who matters on a horse like this.""   Noto is a former Goldman Sachs banker who helped take Twitter public and served as CEO. He’s also a former chief financial officer for the National Football League, one reason the SoFi name is on the new Los Angeles Rams stadium.


If Noto continues to run SoFi, I think it’s in good hands. He’s a West Point graduate whose business degrees come from the University of Chicago and Wharton School of Business. He’s still just 52. He could become his generation’s Jamie Dimon, who also got to the top after a flurry of deal-making with Citicorp and Bank One. ""Forget Chamath. Buy Noto."""

Doesn’t make any sense at all. Some people say the PIPE investors are shorting to lock in profits. I just don’t see that being the case. Why would any investor want to pay more than 1% week. This is pure speculation, but the shorts may have calls with delta much greater than the value of the shorts and they may want to send SoFi a lot higher. The open interest for June 18 calls - 25 and 30 strike was very high. Once again this is just one possible outcome and what plays out could be completely different."

2021-06-12 22:42:46,wallstreetbets,27% is ridiculous. Is there risk involved for op? The interest seems so high especially in the current market
2021-06-13 00:39:54,wallstreetbets,"I don’t have a margin acct (too much fear and lack of knowledge to play with borrowed money). This is the first time I’ve ever had this request, so not sure how it all works."
2021-06-12 21:36:14,wallstreetbets,"If you’re margin, they can borrow without asking. By law if you’re cash they have to ask, though they don’t always do that either.  Some accounts give them the right to borrow as part of your agreement, even though you might technically be cash, so by signing up to their service you’re automatically giving them permission to borrow them, and they don’t always pass on any of that fee or only pass on a small portion."
2021-06-12 21:26:44,wallstreetbets,"Stop being poor.

All the people I see that get these offers own a lot more shares than me."
2021-06-13 13:25:26,wallstreetbets,It's a cash account - I don't know enough to risk playing with margin.
2021-06-13 02:08:31,wallstreetbets,"I have an acc with them and they're amazing. They come up with new improvements at least once a month, and my experience with them has been 20/10 so far."

Long term shareholder?

Take the interest. Buy more shares.

Win-win."
2021-06-13 00:33:55,wallstreetbets,"A few months back, I emailed my broker and said this:

>I want your guarantee that **my shares really do belong to me**.  My shares are MY shares.  I NEVER want my shares to be loaned (rented, hired, used) by anyone else or any other parties.  There's a very nasty practice that is still going on in the US (and maybe other) stock markets where brokers lend (hire, rent) their client's shares out to large hedge funds and others who are short the stock.  i.e. **Naked Shorters**.  
>  
>This effectively gives the Naked Shorters a ""**Get Out of Jail Free**"" card, because it gives them time to optimise their position and wait for share prices to become more favourable, before they return stock or settle up.  These ""**synthetic shares**"" allow the Naked Shorters to manipulate the market and drive down prices by selling stocks they have borrowed and do not own.  **They are using the share holder's stock against them, punishing those who legally own the shares.**  
>  
>**GameStop (GME:US)** is a prime example of this, where well over 200 million shares are owned and are in circulation, but the company has only issued 70 million shares.  Daily share trading volumes for GameStop this year have been as high as 197 million shares / day - more than 2.5x the total shares in existence.  
>  
>I will never do business with a broker who take part in this disgusting and unacceptable practice.  Brokers who do this without their client's permission and understanding of the consequences should be bankrupted and imprisoned.

My brocker immediately replied and said: we will never lend your shares to anyone."
2021-06-12 21:30:28,wallstreetbets,"Why else would they need to borrow them, other than to short?"
2021-06-13 02:04:20,wallstreetbets,It will matter to him when they short the company out of business and his shares are worth 0 🤷‍♂️
2021-06-13 11:43:00,wallstreetbets,"lol, if everyone says it doesn't matter, every long loses by lending.  Don't do it.  Tell everyone else not to do it.  People need to learn why lending is a terrible idea."

It kind of blows my mind the stock is under 25 bucks"
2021-06-13 05:38:25,wallstreetbets,"Legit question

What if my account is a margin account but I bought the stocks without using their leverage? So can they still loan out my stocks without my permission?"

If anything it hampers the company if they want to raise cash.  

Shorters purposely try to signal boost negative news (real or made up) to crash the stock.  If they cannot short enough, they have no incentive to try to manipulate it."
2021-06-13 01:11:19,wallstreetbets,"What about loaning them out, collect fee, wait for price to fall, then recall shares."

2021-06-13 15:03:08,wallstreetbets,because shorts are ghey
2021-06-12 22:51:13,wallstreetbets,Depends on the contract of course but usually respectable brokerages have it risk free. 27% is huge but it’s usually on par with whatever the shorting party is paying for premiums. It’s pretty much like selling GME covered calls on the top or other similar moves when a stock is overextended in some directions.
2021-06-13 11:38:05,wallstreetbets,I don't suppose you'd be willing to say how many shares you own? I'm wondering if there's like a number or equity value that needs to be met before getting contacted like this.

2021-06-12 21:36:08,wallstreetbets,"I think the person you are responding to is referring to “them” as the brokerage. The brokerage is borrowing the shares to then lend them to a short seller who will in turn, short the shares. Brokerage isn’t trying to drive down the price."

Ergo: Schwab does not loan your shares even in a margin account, as long as you haven’t used the margin."
2021-06-13 06:45:06,wallstreetbets,Still a margin account and yes they can. Switch it to a cash account.
2021-06-13 11:13:09,wallstreetbets,Yes correct.  Loaning out client's stocks from margin accounts is one way brokerages make money now with the rise of commission free trading.  Brokerage firms got to make money somehow.
2021-06-12 20:46:21,wallstreetbets,"This is good insight, it looks like op isn't too familiar with options though. For someone who is familiar with options this sounds like the better approach. For OP, he sounds better off with the lending program. No shame in either approach imo"
2021-06-13 00:09:02,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the insight - I'll have to take a look and read up on covered calls.

2021-06-12 21:56:24,wallstreetbets,Yea that’s the brokerage’s incentive. Normally they do not short it themselves. They don’t care if the stock goes down.

2021-06-12 22:20:01,wallstreetbets,Only in extremely rare cases does the price of the stock actually harm the company or in this case the competition. They don’t (normally) have any financial benefit from the price going down. All they serve to benefit from is the short seller’s willingness to pay high fees to them in order to borrow shares.

2021-06-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"My experience with Moomoo app/brokerage firm and why I wouldn't use it and left. I wanted to post this in case anyone is researching the Moomoo app later before they consider opening a brokerage account on it and depositing money. Hopefully this will come up on a search and they'll be able to read about my experience, because not much comes up searching this app now. It's very frustrating to open a brokerage account and deposit money only to discover the app does not provide the services it advertises and claims to do. It turns into a mistake that takes almost one month to correct and get out of and get your money back. You're looking at 5 business days for an ACH deposit to clear. If you want to withdraw, that deposit has to sit in the account another 5 business days (plus a 3 day settlement time if you bought and sold stocks). Another 5 business days for the ACH withdrawal to clear and hit your bank account. And finally another 5 business days to deposit the funds and clear into a new brokerage account. 

Tldr - there's an imgur link in the comments to screenshots of the customer service chat and my options Level. 

	1. Orders do not execute properly, explained below. Notifications for orders don't always work, even though the slightest move for anything in your watch list sends multiple notifications. 
	
	2. They have no phone number available for customer service. Only chat or email with very inexperienced reps and takes a while to get a response on. 
	- Update on this, I actually talked to someone at Finra and found out brokerage firms are not required to have working phone number available for clients or customer service, which is frankly ridiculous IMO. Someone told me RH doesn't have a phone # either but I don't trade with them for other reasons so can't confirm that. If the internet or app or whatever goes down, or you have a problem difficult to explain via chat/email, you're just stuck. Can't call anyone or access your account in any way.
	
	3. Can't trade options even though they advertise you can and my account was set to Level 4 for options trading, explained more below. Customer service literally told me their system does not support covered calls. They claim to only support long calls or puts but I never could place those trades either. Definitely can't trade any advanced strategy either, spreads, strangles, etc. and I had nothing on margin even though I don't think that should matter for those trades. 
	
	4. No desktop option or interface.
	
	5. Their PDT system doesn't appear to work correctly, never counts or recognized day trades, but that may be a plus for some folks.
	

The Moomoo app is part of Futu which is appears to be an established, reputable, and successful large company. I recently signed up for an account because I really like their UI and the way it's easy to navigate through the stock data, especially the options chains, and you can change the name of the stock shown in the watch list, where I add my basis, which is very handy when selling covered calls and that basis is constantly changing. So as far as using the app for a watch list, that's the only thing I recommend and will continue to do.

	1. Orders do not execute properly. I purchased XX shares of AMC a few weeks ago. I set a stop limit order on Friday, May 28, and have modified it several times to increase the stop and limit prices. The last time I changed it was around closing on Wednesday, June 2, when I increased the stop to 55.50 and limit to 55. Luckily I checked it around 6pm the same day, and I saw the order executed at 5:39pm for 65.36. I did Not get a notification for the trade. I checked the charts on Moomoo, Schwab desktop program, Fidelity, and by tick on Webull, and never see it drop anywhere close to 55.50. I bought back soon after I so I still have my position. But the point is, it shouldn't have executed. Screenshots on imgur link. Please note the time stamps in those are CDT times and the times I reference here are EDT. 
		a. First, I've had accounts with several brokers and have never seen stops trigger after hours. In fact the order instructions on all of those other brokerages stated their stop-loss and stop limit orders would not apply to or be placed during after hours. I could be wrong on that, if anyone has experience otherwise, please let me know. That's actually a feature that I wish was offered. 
		b. When I talked to customer service they didn't even understand what a stop limit was. First, the rep told me I placed two separate orders. Then they told me the stop price of 55.50 was hit at 2:11 pm and the order didn't execute until 5:39pm because I ""had to wait in line behind all of the other orders that were placed before"" mine. On AMC, when the volume that day was through the roof, over 760 million. Obviously I wouldn't, definitely shouldn't, have had to wait hours for a limit sell order under the market price to fill. Plus, the stop wasn't set to 55.50 at 2:11pm, it was at 50.50 And I didn't change it to 55.50 until right before 4:00pm.
		c. I waited hours to speak to a supervisor, and never did, but finally got an email from someone after 3pm the next day. The email included a screenshot of the order book that supposedly shows a sell of 506 shares for 54.54 at 17:39:16.
			i. Note the previous transaction was for 65.36. The 54.54 transaction is red with a down arrow, as is the following transaction for 65.35, even though that's an increase from 54.54.
			ii. Also note, while my sell order filled at 65.36 at 17:39:17 (verified in his email and my trade confirmation), there is no transaction for that amount at that time. The last trade for 65.36 was at 17:39:15. So did my more execute before the supposed 54.54 transaction or did it execute for 65.38, 2 cents more, but I only received 65.36?
			iii. This transaction is marked with a ""U"" while every other one is marked with an ""I"". I'm not sure of the meaning or significance of this letter code. If anyone knows, I'd appreciate the insight. 
		d. Like I mentioned, notifications for order execution don't always work, even though the slightest move for anything in your watch list sends multiple notifications. Get bombarded by those and don't have many options to limit them to the ones you really do want to see.
		
	2. You can only speak to them through chat or email and they refuse to give a phone number. And they give different customer service email addresses. 
	
	3. Can't trade options even though they advertise you can. I wasn't aware of any broker that does not allow covered calls. Customer service told me I could trade long calls and long puts, but the app would never allow the order to to be placed, always giving me an error. 
		Update: After I originally posted this I looked at my account and saw that Moomoo had my Options Level set to Level 4. Yes that's a 4, not a 3. I've never had an account above a 3, and honestly didn't know what Level 4 was or that it existed. According to their definitions, Level 4 has all the permissions/trading ability as Level 3, plus it allows selling uncovered calls and naked puts. Here it is copied straight from the site. 
			Your option level:  Level 4
				Buying calls
				Buying puts
				Combinations (Coming Soon)
				Selling uncovered puts
				Selling uncovered calls
	
		Of course the last two on the list are trades I would never make, selling naked calls or puts, as those have got to be arguably the riskiest types of trades. But I tried to put in an order anyway to test it for a very cheap option on a very cheap stock, and of course it didn't work. And, I still can't even sell covered calls or buy calls or puts. Go figure. 
	
	4. No desktop option or interface. Self explanatory 
	
	5. PDT - not entirely confirmed, but on the plus side for some people maybe, their PDT count system doesn't appear work either. The system always showed me with 3,3,3,3,3 even after one instance where I sold, bought, sold, bought, sold, bought the same stock in one day.  
		a. I monitored this for several days ago and the counts never changed. Not sure if maybe that's because a couple of those trades were executed in extended hours. I need to learn how the PDT requirements apply to trades executed pre and post market hours. Still, the bought, sold, bought, was during normal hours. The first sell was pre and the last sell and buy were after hours. But all on the same day, it should've at least has one marked off and gone to 2,3,3,3,3.
		b. I still never made 4 day trades in 5 days out of fear that it would start working or was working and their system was incorrectly reporting the count in the app.

That's the gist of it. Sorry for the long post but I hope this helps someone in the future. Happy to answer any questions or hear any explanations as to whether there are legitimate reasons for why I encountered some of these issues."
2021-06-12 21:03:14,wallstreetbets,No idea why any U.S. investor would use a brokerage other than an established one like Schwab/Fidelity/Vanguard etc
2021-06-12 20:02:32,wallstreetbets,"I see what you're saying but a covered call is not a combination trade if you already own the underlying stock and then sell a call. It's only one option. The way I learned, a combination options trade involves more than one option contract, like a spread, condor etc. I can't trade spreads or anything like that in my IRA at schwab, but I can sell covered calls on stocks I own. I can also sell cash secured puts. If I sell a put, it locks up the amount of cash necessary to purchase that stock at that strike price until it expires. 

And yea, selling a covered call is a short position. And yea, selling a cash secured put is similar on the other side, same amount of risk. But I'm talking about selling an unsecured put or an uncovered call, those trades are extremely risky and a fast way to get liquidated if you don't have the funds available and it expires ITM. I don't know why any broker would even allow that for most retail traders."

2021-06-12 22:59:49,wallstreetbets,"Yea schwab UI on the phone sux. Schwabs smart trader desktop software, or whatever it's called, is at best OK, takes some serious getting used to and is outdated. And options are more expensive there. 65 cents a contract adds up compared to 2 or even 10 cents. Plus I've heard horror stories about fidelity liquidating positions on cash accounts. I still have a small rollover there I need to move actually. Only reason I tried Moomoo was specifically for the UI on the app. I still use it to manage my watch lists, price options and see all the Greeks very quickly, and do other DD. And futu is a well established company.

Edit, i take back what I said about fidelitys app UI. I probably hadn't looked at it in years and just checked it out. It is a lot nicer than what I remember."

2021-06-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"SENS — a warning 
Retards, I know y’all are super into SENS and there’s some great DD about it, but I want to discuss the other side of the coin. Eversense has a phenomenally high slope to climb. It is NOT going to become big in the diabetes world, for the following reasons:
1) the competition is hot and getting better: dexcom g7 being released later this year or early 2022 is going to be 60% smaller footprint site wise on the body and integrated sensor/transmitter. It is already hybrid loop approved with Tandem pump. Eversense is YEARS away from approval for this.


2) With Eversense you still have to calibrate twice daily and their next approval will still be once daily. With dexcom and Libre it is ZERO times daily. Why wear a continuous device you have to calibrate. This is the reason no type 1 diabetes patients prefer Medtronic guardian sensor.


3) yes it is 180 day implant but the TRANSMTTER on the skin will still need to be replaced daily. Who wants to do that??


4) Honestly people aren’t even getting a vaccine because of magnetic 5G concerns and there are multiple disposable and on the skin options on the market, you think AMERICANS will want an IMPLANTABLE DEVICE? And think of which states diabetes rates are higher. And overlap that with crazy conspiracy theory concerns. 


5) Most importantly — almost all insurance plans are NOTTTTT COVERRINGGGGG continuous glucose monitors if you are not on multiple daily injections of insulin!! With very potent non insulin medications coming out in the space (semaglutide which is already out, Lilly’s tirzepatide which will be out soon, and next gen double and triple incretins) the numbers of people on multiple daily injections of insulin to qualify for CGM will DECREASE. CGM trials look at decreasing severity and frequency of LOW SUGARS I.e. on insulin. The trials to show improvement in diabetes control from CGM are not coming for a while. Smaller trials done already show minimal benefit (ie not enough that insurances will change their mind).

Apes, be careful."
2021-06-13 01:46:33,wallstreetbets,Anyways you have some good points. So im all in on SENS monday morning 🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-12 21:15:11,wallstreetbets,"I do appreciate the different outlook and opinion and before I continue I have 826 shares at a 2.75 average.

This is a company I've done a lot of digging into and personally I disagree with a few of your points. 

From some of the feedback I've researched on the Eversense and the Dexcom G6 from users who have had the chance to use both a large majority preferred the Eversense.

A while back the stock crashed before the most recent run to $5 due to fears of insolvency after Senseonics tried to market their product them selves. Those fears have almost all but disappeared as their partnership with Ascensia has removed the marketing issue. If you look at the historical price of this stock before those fears this current price range was not uncommon.

I have a more realistic view of the stock price and think in 5 years time it could be in the low to mid 20s as we see them take some of the market share.

The 365 day device is exciting to.

As for the conspiracy fear stuff I have my doubts that will play to heavily into the market share of the product."
2021-06-12 20:45:38,wallstreetbets,"A warning - There’s a lot of misinformation and misguided opinions in the post. And this is coming from a type 1 diabetic who has used Dexcom for 2 years. I’m a strong proponent of all CGM technology, but Dexcom is by no means a flawless CGM system… it periodically requires calibrations, will temporarily give errors for several hours without readings, and sensors flat out fail at times. I’ve even had Dexcom’s insert device get jammed, with the needle stuck in my arm… had to rip the whole thing off and lost the sensor… I’m pumped to make the switch to EverSense once the 180 day sensor is approved in the US. So on #3, I’m you’re guy. And on #5, OP is way off."

2021-06-12 23:45:21,wallstreetbets,Never trusted this guy.  I always gone opposite of him and did well.  Buying 5000 shares of SENS
2021-06-13 10:12:33,wallstreetbets,"Viewed your profile, doesn't check out. Buying more sens"
2021-06-13 19:10:02,wallstreetbets,"1. dexcom is a shitshow. i use the g6. i dont care if it gets smaller if half the sensors fail or fail to deploy, ripping my skin open and causing crazy bleeding. nevermind the issues with accuracy sending all my family members emergency notices saying im almost dead when im fine. implantable or not, if the eversense improved accuracy and reliability, that's really all it needs to do. i was on vacation in mexico and had FIVE new sensors fail, leaving me without monitoring for almost 2 weeks before i could get home to my LAST sensor, and then had to come down to the wire again waiting for replacements to ship. if the eversense is reliable, game over.
2. if you want a dexcom or freestyle sensor to be accurate you still need to calibrate at least once a day - they just dont market it that way
3. not true. the transmitter needs to be charged for 15 minutes a day. and actually it makes everything easier. you can take it off for a shower or a dip in the pool and then pop it back on after
4. most diabetics are not antivax idiots because we are far more educated on these kinds of things by way of our disease. i am in a type one vaccine study. many of us know about these things and have a fairly deep exposure to the medical and health world. spend 5 minutes on the type 1 subreddit and youll quickly understand how scientifically literate we are. we get told dumb shit all the time about cinnamon and apple cider vinegar. we are used to taking shots and needing to trust the drugs and drug makers because otherwise we would be dead.
5. medicare covers. who are the largest group of diabetics? you are talking about type 2 diabetes. every single type 1 diabetic should be on a CGM. period. the eversense actually makes it cheaper for insurance companies. the reason why dexcom and freestyle are often a fight with insurance is because they are prohibitively expensive due to the rate at which you need to replace sensors and transmitters. their systems were purposefully designed to be expensive. its the classic razorblade revenue model. once the 180-day sensor is available in the US, it's a complete game changer. insurance companies only care about money and this will be cheaper and prevent additional issues (like ER visits) that insurance needs to cover. its a win-win.

bonus: dexcom produces a huge amount of waste. the applicator for the sensor is massive and its pure garbage once used and cannot be recycled. all of us dexcom users hate this. the eversense has next to no waste.

You should take the time to understand these things from the perspective of an actual diabetic. even moreso, a type 1 diabetic.  nevermind the fact that this same technology is going to be used to monitor MANY different health issues, not just diabetes. senseonics has the patents and is first to market. there's a chance they could get bought out by a big player, but either way, this is the future of health monitoring."
2021-06-12 22:22:38,wallstreetbets,Buy more SENS? Got it.
2021-06-13 08:34:03,wallstreetbets,"Pharma is always high-risk, high-reward. SENS has good odds, but there's no such thing as guaranteed tendies. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Still, reminders like this are probably good for the mass of newbies who throw their money at everything that gets mentioned a few times. 👍"
2021-06-12 20:40:24,wallstreetbets,"1) I mostly agree with this.  It is a competitive market and everyone is constantly advancing their technologies.  Current development for CGM is iterative.  Ie fewer calibration, more accurate, smaller, etc. 

No3 -  this is the advantage.  Removing the transmitter for current cgms means removing the sensor and you are unable to reattach/reuse the sensor.  With the eversense the transmitter can be removed and then reattached at no cost.

I currently use a dexcom g6 and would really like the ability to pull the sensor off and put it back on.  As of now, if I do that I am out $200 since I have to use a new sensor."
2021-06-13 04:54:47,wallstreetbets,I don’t get the competition argument. TSLA will also be getting more competition in the future but that won’t stop them from growing. And who said SENS need to dominate the market?
2021-06-13 12:53:01,wallstreetbets,"Just a few rebuttal for your points:

&#x200B;

1. There's always gonna be competition, but Dexcom doesn't have 180 day CGM yet, and Senseonics is working on a 365 day CGM. It's also possible for Senseonics to partner with a insulin pump company in the future.
2. Dexcom's CGM requires calibration also. If I was a diabetic with a CGM, I'd still be double checking my blood sugar with the finger prick at least 1-2 times/day just to be safe, as you could literally die from not managing blood sugars properly.
3. The transmitter doesn't have to be replaced. However, it has to be charged for 10-15 minutes, and you could do this while you take a shower or something.
4. Your argument is frankly pathetic. That's like saying buy puts for Verizon because of the negligible percent of conspiracy theorists. There's also benefits to implantable devices (e.g., you can technically get G6 wet with no issues, but you can't have it underwater for an extended period of time).
5. I believe Cigna currently covers Eversense, and more insurance companies may be on board once 180 day or 365 day is approved."

2021-06-12 20:40:31,wallstreetbets,Common SENS not so common :/
2021-06-13 01:44:32,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate your response and perspective.
I think many of the surveys about preference ignore that (1) patients with type 1 are going to lose hybrid closed loop w tslim (control IQ) and that is going to be huge and (2) patients with type 2 not on insulin are not going to have insurance CGM coverage. It cuts down the possible users. I think they’ll get there eventually, just not in a year or two."
2021-06-13 01:42:54,wallstreetbets,"This is exactly the main problem. They think they dont have to calibrate the g6 but its so inaccurate most of the time and they end up finger sticking anyways.. plus you dont have the freedom like the eversense gives. U cant swim with it, play contact sports etc. most type 1 DM are very health conscious"
2021-06-13 01:36:24,wallstreetbets,"Please describe how I’m “way off” re #5, though to clarify I am talking about DM2 for #5 not DM1. 

I would say your dexcom experience is not typical. In probably over a thousand cases have I heard one with as many issues as you have experienced (though am sorry you’ve dealt with so much). Online in discussion groups people with bad experiences tend to congregate and it seems like problems are happening more often than they are. The sales of dexcom and how rapidly they took market share from guardian even with Medtronic being first to develop hybrid closed loop was very telling. Remember this is even BEFORE they integrated w tslim. 

I’m not arguing that there will be no place for it or that it won’t get market share. I’m saying this is not transformational immediately, has issues, and C20 calls for Jan 2022 is crazy."

2021-06-13 14:16:38,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for your response. 


1. My point is not that it will never be a good company or not have market share. It’s that it won’t be happening for years. FDA is phenomenally slow. To buy crazy OTM calls thinking it’s going to burn up the space because it gets approval for hybrid closed loop in the next 6 weeks is.. crazy. 


2. No, there is no mandatory calibration for dexcom g6. You may be thinking about prior versions. No patient I know with dexcom checks fingerstick unless confirming a low. MARD is low enough that FDA approved for insulin dosing without calibration. 


3. Look again: transmitter needs to be replaced daily. 


4. Day to day the reality on the ground is patients are making choices and medical decisions for non-medical or biological reasons. Many patients believe Ozempic injection is injecting them with brain controlling things but that Rybelsus (same med-semaglutide) is fine. 


5. Not for DM2 not on insulin/only on basal insulin, which is the majority of patients. They cover as I mentioned above for DM1, or DM2 on multiple daily insulin injections. This is similar to other companies."
2021-06-12 21:00:35,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-13 00:07:55,wallstreetbets,"Depends. Eversense is cheaper than Dexcom ($333/month vs $450) so cash payers and insurers both benefit from the switch. Eversense also has insurance contracts already, including with BCBS, one of the larger insurers in Texas, at least. The same device that's 90 days now will become 180 days with the approval, dropping the cost to half of a Dexcom even if they jack up the price of the sensors."
2021-06-13 01:38:53,wallstreetbets,SENS does have the adhesive but its not as strong as the G6 cause they dont need to be on for 14 days which causes skin irritations
2021-06-13 11:22:01,wallstreetbets,"Their 180 day sensors are the same as their 90 day sensors. At $1000/sensor (cash price quoted to me when I started the process to switch from dexcom), even if they include a significant premium after the 180 day approval, they'll still go from 2/3 the price of dexcom to half the price or less. This is huge for cash buyers, and makes a combo N/R and CGM an even better deal for diabetics who don't wanna spend a jillion on Lantus so need constant readings to avoid the dangers of older insulins. 
This isn't even including the benefits of not losing $150 if the shitty stickers fall off."

2021-06-12 23:59:46,wallstreetbets,"As a diabetic and current Dexcom user, I see a lot of benefits to switching to Eversense. If nothing else, it's actually a lot cheaper, I have to do quarterly endo visits anyway, and I won't have to worry about failing sensors, my pharmacy being unable to get transmitters for a week at a time, or having a $150 sensor fall off because I scrubbed the wrong side of my belly in the shower.

2021-06-13 10:11:27,wallstreetbets,"We need huge traction on his because the short-sellers always drive the price down to $9.95 lately. Every time there are many posts on WSB or catalysis, you can see it jump to 10.5 even near 11 but they always push it back to 9.95. I wish the CEO would be more aggressive with his 300m buyback or WSB would gang up as a whole to teach them a lesson.  
  
Short selling is a nice tool but when you short sell a very profitable company, it is twisted in my book and should be punished.

P.S. 680 @ 8.53 and some calls"
2021-06-12 22:27:43,wallstreetbets,It would have been much more interesting if there had been a retard like me on Cramer the other night talking up UWMC rather than the CEO. I would have known enough to have started my story with my childhood in Albania.

2021-06-12 22:31:23,wallstreetbets,"New too but from what I'm understanding is you can buy out of the money calls for way cheaper premiums at the risk that you might lose all your money - if however you're confident that stock will blow passed your breakeven point you can make a fuckload but it's a huge bet usually.  


So from what I see is this person above bout 8 call options with a 10$ strike that expire on the 18th which should already be fine as long as sells or worst case exercises before expiry while they're still over 10$ on the underlying price. The 15 and 16$ calls he's really hoping the underlying goes over those by expiry by atleast the premium cost so that he can breakeven or profit, otherwise they expire worthless and he loses all the premium he paid for the options."

2021-06-13 12:29:44,wallstreetbets,"I've got a basic understanding now, but still a rookie. By ""betting"" the price will go up to a certain amount (strike price), you can buy in advance for a FRACTION of the share price. If it goes above your target (strike) you are winning I believe. So not only did you aquire for pennies on the dollar, in some cases, the stock goes up 10x, multiplying your earnings EXPONENTIALLY. 


It seems similar to sports betting..... (10-1odds, for example)
Am I close, guys???"
2021-06-13 12:05:19,wallstreetbets,I'm just learning about options. It seems a bit confusing to me so far
2021-06-13 05:59:41,wallstreetbets,"So say a stock is 6 dollars today. I have a theory that the stock MIGHT be 10 dollars next week, but I'm not super confident. So instead of spending all of my money on 100 shares for 6 dollars hoping to make a profit, im going to pay 20 cents per share to have the option to buy the shares for 6. If the price goes up to 10, I can buy for 6 and then immediately sell for 10. If it goes down to 5, I just don't buy. Suck it up that I lost the 20 cents per share bur at least I didn't spend it all for 6."
2021-06-13 11:58:13,wallstreetbets,For real my ars got smashed thurs and Friday. Don’t know if I want to lose another 700. But if it has a chance then I’ll try again this week to get it all back 🚀

It will probably get back up to $18-20(which was already my target price),but it’s not going any further than that any time soon."

Who decides how much you pay per share to have to the option to buy? Is that up to the individual or does the company set that price? And is there a limit to how many options you can buy?"

2021-06-12 20:56:47,wallstreetbets,Yeah that's generally what happens
2021-06-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CLNE Inked Contracts 🐄 🚀 🌙 So let me start by saying I like the stock and I own 600 shares of the company.  Over the last week I have heard a lot of chatter about Clean Energy Fuels Company and about how it’s a fake company or a hopeless venture.  Clean Energy Fuels specializes in high grade natural gas fuel known as “Renewable Natural Gas.”  This fuel is made by capturing the methane from dairies and waste facilities.  This process reduces the emissions of green house gases (GHG) by 70-300% depending on the source.  They now have 565 fueling stations in the United States and Canada, this number is going to grow by the end of 2021 due to the contract with Amazon that they signed which I will get into in another DD post.  So all that being said I see this as a growth stock company with great things in process and more great things on the horizon and here are the inked contracts that we know of over the last few months and their expected value.

Clean Energy Fuels has a profit margin of .22c per Gallons of Gas Equivalent (GGE).  This was as of March 2021, so this number could have fluctuated slightly.

1. Pac Anchor-                 2.5 million GGE/$550,000.00 margin profit
2. Cal Portland-                1 million GGE/$220,000.00 margin profit
3. Biagi Bros.-                   900,000 GGE/$198,000.00 margin profit
4. Ecology Auto Parts-    420,000 GGE/$92,4000.00 margin profit
5. Evo Transportation-    1 million GGE/$44,000.00 margin profit (5year contract)
6. Republic Trans. Works- 200,000 GGE/$44,000.00 margin profit
7. Matheson Trucking-   200,000 GGE/$44,000.00 margin profit
8. Valley Metro-                1.2 million GGE/$264,000.00 margin profit
9. Gardena City-               $4.6 million project for service and maintenance
10. Trans Dev-                    2 million GGE/$440,000.00 margin profit
11. BC Transit-                    13 million GGE/$2,860,000.00 margin profit (unknown duration of contract estimated 7 years)
12. Port of Seattle-            400,000 GGE/$88,000.00 margin profit
13. SP+-                               185,000 GGE/$40,700.00 margin profit
14. Pasadena City-             1.5 million GGE/$330,000.00 margin profit

These contracts alone have a value of $3,635,000.00 annually.  The trucking industry uses 22 billion gallons of diesel a year.  That being said there is still plenty of opportunity out there to sign more contracts.  If CLNE continues to sign contracts at this rate their annual revenue would grow $14,540,000.00 per year.

For those that think there is no way there is enough methane from 🐄 farts to support America’s trucking fleet.  This little 💎 was pulled from CLNE’s most recent shareholder report.

(Livestock- and landfill-sourced biogas represent a significant opportunity to produce RNG and reduce GHG emissions. Although LFG has accounted for most of the growth in biogas projects to date, biogas from dairy and other livestock farm waste represents significant opportunities for RNG production that remain largely untapped. According to ICF Consulting, Inc., the global consulting services company, by 2040, the U.S. has the technical potential annually to produce up to 34.4 billion GGEs of RNG, including up to 20.6 billion GGEs of ADG RNG.
All-in prices paid for RNG from livestock farms can be significantly higher than prices for RNG from landfills due to higher value available from state-level low-carbon fuel incentives for these projects. Given our market leadership in RNG, we believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of this market.)


Here are 4 more contracts that were signed with no exact numbers so these are just estimates.

Mission Trails Waste-  50 trucks $330,000.00 margin profit.
Salt Lake County - 60 trucks $330,000.00 margin profit.
Gardena City- 80 trucks $660,000.00 mp
Atlas Refuel - 50 trucks $330,000.00 mp

The estimates of annual profit were based off similar size fleets from previous signed contracts.

As stated above Clean Energy Fuels also has signed contracts with Amazon, UPS, and Estes trucking to name some other bigger companies.  They also have joint ventures with BP and Total SE.

I pulled this info directly from Clean Energy Fuels Company website.  Again I just like the stock and am by no means a financial advisor, but this should help show that this company is not a scam and should be valued much higher than its current share price of $10.70.  CLNE strong.

These last 4 companies are estimations as there is no exact information on how much fuel they will use.  I based my numbers off the previous contracts and how many vehicles they are fueling."

They could have sold through a private deal off exchange and it wouldn't impact the market period. If they flooded the market with 10+ million shares at once. It would send the stock dropping to $5. It's smart to sell stakes slowly overtime and not influence overall trade volume.

If a company truly valued its stock and felt its stock was below its intrinsic value. Why dilute shareholders, when you can use low interest debt to leverage the company.

A company can also use its shares as collateral on a secured loan.

2021-06-13 15:18:28,wallstreetbets,"From 2015 to now, haven't NOx and particulate emissions standards gotten even stricter? So new diesels have to have even more DEF and DPF, restricting power and adding to maintenance cost, making the transition to CNG more of an easy sell. Diesel mechanics all over the world see the writing on the wall. Climate accords and local pollution ordinances are going to make diesel go away."
2021-06-13 16:11:37,wallstreetbets,"If you owned a fleet, and could switch to CNG right now, would you? If you were an O/O, would you buy a CNG truck for OTR work? Would you be prepared for the rug pull on subsidies, difficulties getting the fuel, delays on maintenance? I can see it being worthwhile soon for local work, where companies can have drivers fuel on site and keep maintenance techs, but for long trips with few company terminals in between I wouldn't work for a company that didn't offer diesel."
2021-06-13 17:13:52,wallstreetbets,"O/O? Probably not. Owned a large enough fleet that I could secure a service and fuel contract? In a heartbeat.

If I didn't own a truck at all, and was considering purchase of a brand new piece of equipment? Tough to say.

Look in the car/truck maintenance subreddits and you'll see everyone talking about how modern diesels are shit for longevity. Blown turbos are the best possible problem to have. By far, DEF and DPF and EGR issues are the number one reason modern diesels get stuck in the shop for hours and hours of expensive maintenance.

If I had an existing fleet of diesel trucks, I'd absolutely consider adding a CNG rig to my fleet in order to do the true cost analysis on my own.

2021-06-13 17:25:52,wallstreetbets,"I can understand that. I think there's a lot of merit to what you're saying. It's worth considering as well that there's a driver shortage, and there are so many stuck in the ""old ways"" that many companies have to keep manual vehicles available, despite the fuel efficiency losses, just to get them to move. It might take a lot of positive marketing, exceptional pay, or a CDL training program/contract mill to get enough drivers to bite."
2021-06-13 17:39:08,wallstreetbets,"The driver shortage is the same as the McDonald's fry cook shortage. People are rejecting jobs that pay slave wages. I've worked retail, I've worked call center. Turnover is absolutely biting these companies in the ass. You've seen the security videos of day-one Amazon drivers backing over mailboxes. Do you want fresh meat pulling 80,000 pounds on the freeway? Or do you think maybe you gotta pay better to retain the good help?"

I'm sure if the average salary got bumped into the 70's to 80's more people would move things, but I really think there's a lack of qualified talent right now, especially with DOT medical requirements, long time periods away from home, and the expense of taking the time without income for even the ""free"" training. There are too many people who wouldn't for any money, and too many people that can't."

My dad romanticized the OTR life and always wanted to make that his goal. Didn't get there, but c'est la vie.

In 2021 when you see office workers get to finish all tasks from home and have literally zero commute, doesn't that make the road life even more painfully expensive for a young buck with a wife at home or kids at soccer games? So the only ones willing to take that hit in their personal life are guys who already did the family thing two decades ago and are in the stage of life where a fortnight away from home is welcome."

2021-06-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Wish.com Quick Analysis An argument can be made for WISH being a value play in the software sector. As of Friday’s close, their p/b sits just north of 6, relative to the SW sector average of 13.34. Current market cap is 5.86B on 2.5B of revenue in 2020 (2.3x last year’s revenue). Revenue is growing at a 34% YoY clip, with 107M average monthly users in 2020, representing 19% YoY growth. They are sitting on 2B in cash/cash equivalent assets, and their ATR is .3512 vs SW sector median of .1225, ranking 6th in the sector out of 291 companies. 

Their asset/liability ratio is also improving at 1.86, ranking 86 in SW sector vs 290 other companies. EPS improved drastically QoQ from Q42020 to Q1 2021, from -.9 to -.2, ranking 114 out of 291 in their sector. Additionally, WISH is currently about 59% institutionally owned.

From a kind user in the comments for how they stack up against competition:

it's only up %25 of all time lows. If it decided to go has massive room to run. its not like AMC already up %1500 or GME %10000

Shopify: 25x revenue

LSPD: 33x revenue

NVEI: 15x revenue

Amazon: 4x revenue

WISH: 2x revenue

From a technical standpoint, WISH is roughly 70% off of its ATH, and just bounced in the high 7’s. We continue to see rotation back into growth with the Russel outperforming other major indexes. WISH operates in over 100 countries with over 550K partnered merchants, and growing. Analyst coverage breadth is considerable, with most analysts in the 20/share range. WISH got beat up pretty badly at the beginning of the year along with nearly all of growth, but the technicals are pointing to a reversal. MACD is curling back up on the weekly chart, RSI is not overbought on the daily (around 49), we have seen follow through, and sector rotation back into growth is encouraging. Multiple time frames show price action curling back up after finding solid support in the high 7’s, and there is significant room to the upside short term before first fib level around $12. Shares profited % is only 6% and change - which can point to much more room to the upside. I am going to start scooping up some shares and options or selling premium to lower my cost basis moving forward, but have not yet jumped in."

The main issue that I can see for me related to wish is that I don't want to make yet another account at another retailer just to get baited into buying something or find that there isn't a lot of interest that gets generated to feed my retarded ways. IMO, Non gated foot traffic drives growth. The better the experience is and the more traffic you can get the better the underlying incentive is for the investor and the consumer.

2021-06-12 20:10:46,wallstreetbets,"Your taking into account their logistics rev. Their logistics rev is based on gross and not net so you need to remove 85% of that revenue in your calculations as no PE or VC firm would ever give a valuation or provide funding based on gross revenue. It’s pretty shady accounting actually yes it is GAAP accepted because they take ownership of the product and assume the risk and responsibility but it’s not revenue as it’s already slated to be paid to to the logistics providers. 

Below is from their latest 10-q:

2. DISAGGREGATION OF REVENUE
The Company generates revenue from marketplace and logistics services provided to merchants. Revenue is recognized as the Company transfers control of promised goods or services to its users in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company considers both the merchant and the user to be customers. The Company evaluates whether it is appropriate to recognize revenue on a gross or net basis based upon its evaluation of whether the Company obtains control of the specified goods or services by considering if it is primarily responsible for fulfillment of the promise, has inventory risk, has latitude in establishing pricing and selecting suppliers, among other factors. **Based on these factors, marketplace revenue is generally recognized on a net basis and logistics revenue is generally recognized on a gross basis.** Revenue excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including indirect taxes."
2021-06-12 20:14:51,wallstreetbets,"Let’s say you take an Uber for 20 bucks. Uber’s margins are 20% so you pay uber 20 bucks, they pay 16 dollars to the driver and 4 dollars uber collects and recognized as revenue. 
In the above example WISH, in their logistics space, is recognizing the entire 20 dollars that was paid to them as revenue. Though still has to pay out 16 dollars. It’s pretty shady accounting.

If uber booked gross rev like WISH does uber would had have $65B dollars in rev for just 2019. For a company whose market cap is currently 50B. Just to show you how misleading this gross rev number from Wish is in their logistics space."
2021-06-12 20:28:26,wallstreetbets,"Dude. It is perfectly standard practice & not shady at all to recognize gross receipts & itemize the related costs on the P&L. You’re trying too hard. That’s like saying any REIT that doesn’t report revenue net of interest & depreciation is being deceptive. The fact that their EBITDA has been improving over time is the proof in the pudding. And they were making progress on the bottom line well before their logistics business exploded last year, which means by definition expenses weren’t growing as fast as revenue. And you really think a business segment that grows over 300% in a year had no marketing costs to go along with it?? You think mgmt wants us to know how fast logistics revenue is growing.. but they’re not willing to pay so that vendors can know too? So you’d need to know that related marketing cost & back it out. You’re trying too hard"

Each call contract represents 100 shares of stock, so each contract actually cost 100 x 17¢ = $17.  

He bought 700 calls.  700 x $17 = $11,900.  700 calls represents 70,000 shares.

The call he bought for 17¢ is now selling for $2.17.  Thus he made $2/share x 70,000 shares."

2021-06-13 03:51:57,wallstreetbets,"Yup, back before this sub was planet of the apes and GME happened, the biggest wins were guys who bought cheap TSLA leaps. Some became multimillionaires. They had to hold for months so it wasn't an overnight success but it really paid off."

2021-06-13 13:25:59,wallstreetbets,The new maverick for $20k is a steal. I bought my '13 civic for like $15k
2021-06-12 22:32:30,wallstreetbets,"Dude I’m a teacher too lol I know the feeling...but the entry model starts under 40,000.  Think of all the gas you will save as well, that’s thousands of extra dollars over the life of the loan it’s not a bad deal at all

Edit: maverick looks cool too not trying to diss it"
2021-06-12 20:52:51,wallstreetbets,Ford Lightning! number 1 in Frunk size. And not much else.
2021-06-13 09:31:03,wallstreetbets,"That's the class of vehicles it is based on. The renegade is the direct competitor to the chassis the maverick is on. Putting a pickup bed on it doesn't give it the magic power to tow more, and the current chassis is already going to be advertising the max it can safely tow, for competitiveness."
2021-06-12 20:40:09,wallstreetbets,What caused you to look into this?
2021-06-13 03:47:14,wallstreetbets,"Nice trade bro. 
When did you buy them?
Last month with F was at $11 or last Dec when it was at $8? 

I was debating to go all in on leaps with F or BCRX.
Went with BCRX in the end."
2021-06-12 22:26:20,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-13 00:01:47,wallstreetbets,It’s freakin awesome! I blew my first investment account years ago on F options lol. I had no idea what I was doing

2021-06-12 23:34:17,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure wsb lord and savior bought LEAPS. I’ve never seen anyone trash them in general. Most of the trash talk is against people buying LEAPS and calling it a yolo

I still think vehicle prices are outrageous considering the amount of autonomy now cutting out wage expenses/health insurance etc for employees that have been replaced by robots.

2021-06-13 08:50:57,wallstreetbets,how far out to go for expiration would you say?

2021-06-13 06:29:16,wallstreetbets,"I wish you could buy calls on Bojangles. My buddy went just a couple days ago and you could either get pieces of chicken or a grilled chicken biscuit… They had no Supremes, no Cajun filet‘s. This chicken shortage is ridiculous.  

Got another buddy who is a chicken farmer, and his chickens go to Boj and chick fil a, and he said to fight the shortage, the integrators, the company that technically owns the chickens my buddy grows, is shortening the downtime between flocks to 15 days from 30 days. This should help in the next month or so. 

One can only hope."
2021-06-12 22:46:14,wallstreetbets,Oh gotcha. Im stoked abt the lightning. I love trucks anyways. Maverick isnt for me but I bet alot of pol will be interested. It looks pretty nice for what it is

2021-06-13 01:45:42,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I know a guy, who knows a guy, who makes synthetics. He told me they have been making a killing with making synthetic AMC shares. No more looking over his shoulder anymore. Also, he told me this guy got invited to the annual hedge fund strategy meeting on how to manipulate the market so that you end up losing money on every surefire trade."
2021-06-12 20:37:43,wallstreetbets,I don’t think you understand synthetic shares. Or you just mean something completely different.
2021-06-12 23:54:18,wallstreetbets,"Writing the call is a short position. You bet the stock won't reach that price pocketing the money to buy the call. If they were naked call then they had to buy the shares at the price they needed to in order to fill the calls. Unless they closed the position at a higher price than they sold it, it still a short position. Much more dangerous than buying a put."

2021-06-12 21:06:16,wallstreetbets,That breakeven price lmfao
2021-06-12 21:16:40,wallstreetbets,So you pretty much bought the shares.... Nice gains though.
2021-06-13 11:11:26,wallstreetbets,"I hope OP doesn't delete this post.  As a newbie, I learned a lot from reading this thread."
2021-06-12 20:54:27,wallstreetbets,"So controlling 9000$ plus $ of AMC for 3000$ with the option to opt out is stupid??? 1/3rd the overhead and if it goes up, wow, but ""I'd"" take any profit and rinse and repeat, it could change directions on a whim."
2021-06-12 22:25:29,wallstreetbets,Take those TENDIES and drop em into some $CLNE shares and 6/18 calls. I put all my gains from berry and popcorn memes last week into CLNE and already am up on my calls and shares. In a matter of weeks ive gone from 6k to 20k in my portfolio.
2021-06-12 20:46:35,wallstreetbets,Huh... I thought there was some complicated math I'm missing here as to why this would be a good play but this is just retarded right? He's leveraging 200 shares but he paid the same price as 200 shares....huh
2021-06-12 21:05:06,wallstreetbets,How do they work?
2021-06-13 11:31:48,wallstreetbets,What price and date are you selling roughly. Guessing you're selling slighlty otm like a week or month out.?
2021-06-13 09:48:09,wallstreetbets,Should this be my first option I buy?
2021-06-12 20:46:21,wallstreetbets,"I do that to add leverage on what I think are safe bets. 

If I'm wrong I get double fucked."
2021-06-12 20:26:03,wallstreetbets,Lmao
2021-06-13 12:38:37,wallstreetbets,"Generally I do 1-2 weeks out with under .20 delta but with AMC  I placed a 51c for .22 in the morning of June 11 expiring the same day. Basically a day trade.

Since AMC is so volatile, I wanted to do a day trade where the expected move is pretty much priced in. That’s how I chose the 51 strike and hence the low premium. I wanted a trade that had a high probability of expiring worthless.

A few hours later it started to test my strike and I didn’t want to lose my long calls if these short calls go ITM so I rolled. Moved up my strike to 59 cause it’s a new week, and collected a better premium , 4.09

I’ll closely monitor it, once I hit 50% return, I’ll close. Rinse & repeat.

My other covered calls expire worthless but AMC … it needs babysitting cause you 🦍 could screw things up for me. I kid. I love you guys. I HOLD FOR APE NATION!"

Id go atleast half in shares though so you wont lose ALL your money if it goes tits up, and kile i said you can play with selling calls too."
2021-06-12 22:10:00,wallstreetbets,"A short seller listening to fake retards constantly droning on about taking the stock to $69,420. That's who."

2021-06-12 22:17:30,wallstreetbets,"Because he made money, you worthless excuse of a simian."
2021-06-12 22:09:57,wallstreetbets,"I get using ITM calls for that. 
But when you’re paying 95+% of the share price as a premium, it’s not actually cheaper than buying shares. It winds up being more expensive than owning shares. I’m theory I understand what you’re saying. But when you pay 16.76 as a premium for a stock that’s worth 17 dollars, it’s just pure stupidity."
2021-06-13 12:19:11,wallstreetbets,Thanks buddy!
2021-06-12 22:27:55,wallstreetbets,"You’re not really this stupid are you?  

I mean I’ll make it simple. If someone offered to sell an apple for a dollar and I said, no sir let me buy it for 2 dollars, for no other reason than to pay extra. And then I sold it for 3 dollars. I’d have made money. But I’d be a fucking idiot. Because I made less money than I could have. For no fucking reason.

The OP just paid extra to call his shares contracts. That’s it. That’s all he did. He got none of the upsides or downsides of owning options. He just paid extra to own what are effectively shares. And there’s no explanation for it. He just wanted to pay more."
2021-06-12 22:23:48,wallstreetbets,"I totally agree with you it would have been overall better to buy the shares.

 I get the feeling it was more for internet points than anything.

 The good thing is that call is so deep itm that it's basically going to match the movement of the stock."
2021-06-12 22:12:38,wallstreetbets,"Sure there is minuscule leverage. I don’t know what the price of shares was when he did this but it must’ve been around 17.50. So he saved 75 cents a share. That’s his leverage. He will pay 1 dollar a share when he exersizes. So sure he saved 75 cents a share now, to pay 1 dollar later. Just seems really stupid"
2021-06-12 22:38:23,wallstreetbets,"You still made money on that apple, fuck it."
2021-06-12 22:16:18,wallstreetbets,"Right so he paid 16.76 a contract. Plus a dollar when he exercises. 17.76 for shares that were trading at 17.50 when he bought the contract. So he overpaid. And yea he’ll definitely find a buyer for the calls if he wants. But the same thing applies. He’ll get paid share price at the time of sale if he waits until Friday if expiry, minus a dollar, which effectively would be the same as exersizing the options for a dollar and then selling the shares. Either way he will have spent more on the contracts than he would’ve on shares. There’s no way around it. It was a bad trade."
2021-06-12 22:25:23,wallstreetbets,Yea you’re right. I mean what it comes to is this guy did basically buy shares he just paid a little extra so he could come on wsb and say he has contracts.
2021-06-12 22:27:44,wallstreetbets,Where does it say underlying was $17.50? If that’s the case then sure but the picture doesn’t show that
2021-06-12 23:04:37,wallstreetbets,"I’m guessing at 17.50. 
But just based on how options work. If he paid 16.76 for 1 dollar calls, the share price had to be under 17.76, which is essentially what he paid per share. Could’ve been 17.60 when he bought, could’ve been 17.00. But it was somewhere in that range."
2021-06-13 01:47:11,wallstreetbets,Dude did you triple in less than a year? Teach me your ways!! Nice job man.

2021-06-12 23:12:12,wallstreetbets,Maybe he bought too much options when up or maybe he sell when down .

2021-06-12 23:24:12,wallstreetbets,"It’s a double-edged sword because WSB gave me the conviction to make risky plays that really printed, but I’ve also lost money blindly following the herd mentality. Learn from your trades, and most importantly, inverse the crowd sentiment to make tendies"

2021-06-13 01:10:22,wallstreetbets,I’d say May
2021-06-13 01:20:03,wallstreetbets,Doesn't it feel great to start all over again!
2021-06-13 01:22:49,wallstreetbets,depends on if you think learning about WSB is when you gain or when you lose

2021-06-13 04:00:27,wallstreetbets,so y-o-y you made an inverse loss of close to +300%.
2021-06-13 04:13:46,wallstreetbets,Judging by the first spike in January probably around there… you can assume the range of volatility after that is options gambling followed by a period of 10k deposits to make it back to the peak of 32k in May. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|scream)
2021-06-13 04:14:32,wallstreetbets,"It’s easy, buy high, sell low, this can be used in several different contexts. I like the stock."

2021-06-13 12:37:16,wallstreetbets,300% plus gain in a year is sooooo lame.  Your portfolio would have been *only* $250 million in 10 years.  Pft.

2021-06-13 19:30:37,wallstreetbets,"Ouch. I'll guess that you discovered it end Jan and Apr. They didnt work out but you figured there are a few things you can tweak now to make it work. You tried again end May and had good results in early June and encouraged to really pile it on.

2021-06-12 22:31:31,wallstreetbets,Except for me who got into investing like 4 months ago smh. I kick myself for not getting interested years ago
2021-06-13 00:05:11,wallstreetbets,"not everyone. -50k realized 2020, +60k realized 2021, though plenty of time I suppose to lose it all by year end"
2021-06-12 22:41:19,wallstreetbets,There's no way 10% of people beat the market. Holding low cost index funds is the only sensible approach.

If you own 100 shares and want/need to sell.....

Queue 20 shares at market price.

Queue 20 shares at 10% below market.

Queue 20 shares at 10% above market.

Queue 20 shares at 20% above market.

Hold 20 shares  for future gains.

At least with this plan you get at least 40% of your shares sold in an hour.
Then after an hour you can reevaluate your price points and redistribute your remaining 60 shares with new sell orders."

2021-06-12 20:23:31,wallstreetbets,they’re just securities that perform 2-3x either in the same or opposite direction as the underlying index. tldr is they’re ok to use short term if you have a specific reason to but holding them long term they don’t perform as well as you’d expect because of something called beta slippage if you’re interested in reading more about them
2021-06-13 05:09:04,wallstreetbets,"I don't even know how this rumor got started.

Like, some of the other tickers, fine I can at least see somebody making *some* sort of case for it. But GME? That thing has been front page for months continuously. There wouldn't be anybody left on the sub if anyone who mentions GME got banned.

2021-06-13 05:44:21,wallstreetbets,I like this stock 🤩
2021-06-13 11:11:18,wallstreetbets,I’ve got calls in the negative that end on Friday. Hoping they go up this week.
2021-06-13 12:15:20,wallstreetbets,"Be careful. Looks a little over bought.

2021-06-13 15:10:14,wallstreetbets,"I put a small amount into calls a minute before close on friday, i immediately regretted because i know it's gonna blow up premarket tomorrow

Edit/: regret not buying more"
2021-06-12 22:26:27,wallstreetbets,"so you think, in your opinion of course, it would be a wise bet to throw a few grand into calls now or wait for open on monday?"
2021-06-13 13:28:58,wallstreetbets,"Cramer can blow me. But, UWMC is a legit long term stock play."
2021-06-13 06:52:26,wallstreetbets,What do you think is exactly the best time to buy? (US time)
2021-06-13 13:35:20,wallstreetbets,Did you get in prior to Ex dividend date?
2021-06-13 13:34:14,wallstreetbets,"Me too. Got them for $8 each a month or two ago. Considering buying some additional 6/18 calls or July calls. When is the listing to Russell index supposed to happen, again?"
2021-06-12 20:35:21,wallstreetbets,Wait you paid $11 per contract? What’s your average the fuck
2021-06-13 13:28:01,wallstreetbets,You must've gotten in around when I did with 6/18 12c at $8 each.
2021-06-12 23:23:28,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I have no idea - didn't even know you could buy options on the weekend. I toss a few hundred at it midweek to test the water, and I have to confess, I pretty good at losing money, so we will see what happens. It sure looks like it's gonna go, really hope it does."
2021-06-13 13:25:53,wallstreetbets,"My GUESS is that we will see a giant pop, a pull back of like 50% and then a steady rise throughout the day to ALMOST end as high as the initial pop.

So either right at open, or buy the dip when it pulls back after it pops at open.

Not financial advice I'm retarded..."
2021-06-13 13:32:07,wallstreetbets,"It seems to dip around 11am cst. It opens high, dips a bit, then comes back up. Even days that are slightly red, it usually makes up in AH. I was up 5200% on my 6/18 calls when it hit $10.78 at market open Wednesday, I believe, but missed it. now have some Lvl IV Theta Crush, but think it will end up ITM this week, so I'm kind of glad I didn't sell them then."
2021-06-12 21:05:00,wallstreetbets,"On the 14 call… 11 dollars. 

Got in before anyone gave a fuck about UWMC.

I also bought 8 and 9 calls while hoping it runs so that I could sell the 14s and exercise the 8s and 9s.

My avg on 8c: .70.

My avg on 9c: .56"
2021-06-13 13:38:32,wallstreetbets,"How many calls you got? Wish I had more than 20, but it was a moonshot when I bought so 200 bucks seemed like a reasonable amount to risk.

In hindsight, wish I’d yeeted my whole account into it."
2021-06-12 22:23:55,wallstreetbets,Bro that’s insane luck. I hope you make 10 bags off them when it runs.
2021-06-13 13:06:24,wallstreetbets,Legend! It’s always that guy 😂😂
2021-06-13 13:24:07,wallstreetbets,"I'm Experiencing some that crush on my June 18 $12 calls I bought for .08, but have a good feeling I'll be ITM this week. Considering adding some $11 or $13 calls to spread. Thoughts?"
2021-06-13 13:54:04,wallstreetbets,"I pussied out at only fucking 10.most of my liquid cash is in AMC. So same here. I turned margin account off so they couldn't lend my shares. Plus, I just started with a few other brokerages and by the time my funds cleared to buy, the options went up and I wasn't sure it would rise as much as it has."
2021-06-12 22:30:36,wallstreetbets,"According to RH I’m up 9000% right now because I sold 35 15Cs and took in more premium than I opened my original position with.

So I’m hoping those don’t exercise, but if they do, options that I spent 800 bucks on should make me like 13k.

My best case scenario is 14.99 by close friday, in which case I will probably sell part of my position and exercise to buy another 1000 shares. 

Will be fucking sick though if I can basically buy 1000 shares with 800 bucks lol.

Gonna be so fucking mad if it has a huge run. 40 bucks a share would make me 100k profit."
2021-06-12 22:38:47,wallstreetbets,"Something to consider on UWMC, the dividend is legit fantastic.

O is considered to be one of the best dividend payers. 

O is 70 dollars a share. If you bought 100 shares of O, you would get about 289 dollars annually in dividends. With the same amount of money when UWMC was 9 dollars a share, you would get 310 dollars a year in dividends.

It dropped all the way to 6.25. 

Doesn’t that math seem pretty obviously fucked up? And that’s why I jumped in weeks ago and have a 7.88 average."
2021-06-13 13:30:05,wallstreetbets,"With an .08 avg, you are in a nice spot. Those should massively increase monday at open if we hold. I’d say sell half at open monday and hold onto the rest, with a plan for quickly exiting if we pull back. You really need to be careful this close to expiration with how much theta decay ramps up.

Add calls, but make them debit spreads so you have a lower breakeven and a higher chance of not losing. 

Shares are also a great play right now.

If I remember correctly, a 9/17 spread had a 10.27 breakeven and a 127 max loss and like 560 max gain."
2021-06-13 02:07:33,wallstreetbets,Dude that’s insane!!! Why didn’t you do $25 calls instead? 😂😂 so I looked at my shares and I do have 106 I forgot I bought some before close Friday on a buy limit.
2021-06-13 12:21:30,wallstreetbets,Noice
2021-06-13 00:56:15,wallstreetbets,That’s insane. I’m definitely buying more shares soon. I have options and 56 shares 😊
2021-06-13 13:55:43,wallstreetbets,"I have shares as well. I didn't buy enough as I should have at that price because I was considering exercising them if it went up significantly. If I bought more, I'd do a spread or multi leg, considering this stock seems to not be overly volatile. But that would drastically minimize profit."
2021-06-13 02:13:53,wallstreetbets,"Cause selling 25c would have gotten me shit premium. I will say, i fucked up. Same day I sold em I could have closed them for .10. I should have taken it, but I wanted to let theta decay it the next day and shoot for .05. Instead, they closed the day at .18. 

On the positive side, we know damned well that there will be fuckery afoot trying to hold the price down. So hopefully it stays level or dips and I can bail."
2021-06-13 01:51:29,wallstreetbets,Get yourself to blocks of 100 so you can start selling calls. It’s satisfying as hell when you can sell calls and buy enough shares to sell even more calls.
2021-06-13 14:07:03,wallstreetbets,"Depends. If you want max profit, a 10/12 spread could definitely do it.

If you want to exercise with your sold calls worthless, go a month or two out and widen the spread. Try to keep your breakeven in the 10s since that seems to be support now."
2021-06-13 02:04:51,wallstreetbets,Absolutely. I’m going to get into that ASAP. It’s a much safer route to getting more $$$
2021-06-13 13:26:34,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-06-13 14:36:27,wallstreetbets,"Appreciate the help. This stock has been less than volatile, but lately seems to be taking off.
Plus, if it is added to index and w/ divi date approaching (if those are reinvested), it could

Isn't about stocks, is about a different market but the patterns are the same (The only difference is people who trade diverse markets are just as comfortable trading a down market as an up one). 

For books, Scott Carney is generally the popular choice. 

&#x200B;

But there's literarily 1,000s of people teaching this stuff (For free).  And most of the education is very similar. These are very old patterns. Some of them from as far back as the 1910s."
2021-06-13 03:42:31,wallstreetbets,Highly untrue. It has been shown that methods like portfolio weighting will beat the market in most scenarios. Playing the market is not the most profitable it's only the easiest and most passive. I think that alot of traders fail to beat the market have to do with their risk taking methods. They are willing to lose some money for the chance they hit big.
2021-06-12 21:33:24,wallstreetbets,"You're welcome.  The currency one is the one to keep an eye on. USD and JPY gaining are warnings of the stocks getting ready to sell.

Take a look at NZDJPY, for example,  into Feb of 2020 and into the low of that move, this moved before the big stock moves happened. It was a warning that investors were switching to safe currencies.

&#x200B;

Before all the big moves in stock there's usually reports of currency fluctuations, but these markets are not ones people follow. And they miss the warnings if SPX is at ATH when they come."

2021-06-13 12:13:13,wallstreetbets,"Other bear cases

1)  A higher debt load relative to peer aka LOGI. 

2) Lower YoY earnings growth relative to LOGI

3) Chip shortage/gpu scarcity will hurt new builds which will hurt sales of PSU/RAM/Cases.

For 1 and 2 its not 100% reasonable to compare to Logi.  Logi sells more business oriented peripherals than Crsr, which would have had a much more significant bump during covid and, frankly, will take a much bigger hit after.

3 seems more significant, but I won't hurt their entire product line.  Mostly just the stuff that is tied to a new build.   If they manage their portfolio they may actually be able to balance the lost sales in new build parts with increased sales in parts tied to marginal performance improvements, as gamers who can't afford a new build may go that route instead (""i cant build a new computer i may as well buy this hot shit keyboard"")"

Just adding that quick disclaimer before we're seeing loss porn with headlines, ""Apes told me to buy Astralis"""
2021-06-13 11:56:53,wallstreetbets,"Fair!

Whoever buys the ESports company that ends up being dominant will make mega returns, like getting tesla a year or two ago...but most will likely fail and the money may sit there for years (and of course, the dominant ones may not exist yet).  Definitely agree with the risks!"

2021-06-13 00:52:19,wallstreetbets,Very good question. CRWD is overvalued based on future growth optimism. Street is highly optimistic on CrowdStrike and have no trust in Blackberry's turnaround by JC and his projected revenue for coming years. Also short hedge funds are against JC's thesis of growth and profitability. JMHO.

This company is trash. They have zero/little revenue and have been a minor player for years. Their largest success has been in motorhome applications. Navistar owned them at one point, and it is crazy to see they are valued at 25% of Navistar now. 

They’ve essentially rebranded as an electric truck manufacturer, but it’s going no where. They aren’t winning contracts, have unproven management, and will be eaten alive by traditional. 

Looks back 100 years — Thousands of automotive manufactures came and went in the US. 3 made it. Workhorse has the decked stacked against them and unproven management with a sketchy company history."

But there are also people who buy at way abound the all time high, with no thought to the actual value of a company or the industry.  And when it goes south because it’s valued more than any other company,  complain because people are selling.  But there are hegies that purposefully drive a price down with vigor in order to try to get week minded people to sell at the rock bottom."

2021-06-12 22:33:46,wallstreetbets,RH has recently released this feature. Not sure if people will learn to take advantage of it and what kind of impact that will have on the broader IPO landscape in the market.
2021-06-13 01:08:36,wallstreetbets,Sometimes. I was offered 100 shares of Square at IPO price (like $9 or $10) for being a merchant on the platform. Sold it at $20/share to fund said business further thinking I was a fucking financial genius. FML.
2021-06-13 07:15:25,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I get offers every time fidelity has a new ipo coming through.   There are catches though:. Your account needs to have the cash available at the time of assignment.  You must purchase in 100 share lots. The shares that fidelity gets get divvied up between the investors that responded affirmatively to fidelity's buy-in offer.   More specifically, investors with higher value requests will likely be given priority than those just asking for 1 lot of 100 shares."
2021-06-12 22:24:56,wallstreetbets,">Bring poor is not the issue. You have to be rich to play.

You just agreed with me. If you're not rich, you're poor. If you're not first, you're last. If you can't participate in an IPO, you're a pour."

2021-06-13 01:03:49,wallstreetbets,"Not really. This misses the point that for most companies and early investors, the time value of money is greater than a small dip in IPO valuation. Remember that for many company employees and owners, this is the first opportunity to get paid for their hard work in a decade or longer. As for the companies themselves, they typically work closely with the banks selling their shares to work out a value that's both easy to sell and that meets the fundraising goals of the company - which honestly are secondary if not tertiary these days. Companies don't really go public to raise funds anymore. They go public to allow early investors and founders to cash out.

Even retail investors don't really get ""shafted,"" unless they're idiots who think an IPO is a good one day play, which (spoiler alert) they usually aren't."

2021-06-13 12:51:57,wallstreetbets,Im a fund analyst for one of the top 3 largest PE firms in the world. Most money managers only have small gp stakes in their funds and employees invest directly via internal coinvest. Management fees and carried interest are their primary revenue sources. Unrealized gains on their funds are not.

2021-06-13 13:09:49,wallstreetbets,You're talking about carried interest and its magnitude and recurrence for the FIRM is less than that of management fees. You're either smoking crack or was at best an uninvolved associate VP if you think deal-specific carried interest taken at the end of a funds life drives revenue more than contractual management fees charged on virtually all of the capital they are managing.

I wish the CEO would be more aggressive with his 300m buyback or WSB would gang up as a whole to teach them a lesson.

2021-06-13 17:21:24,wallstreetbets,People that shop on wish are not looking to buy products they actually want right away. It’s like an online version of “gadget and gizmos” that use to be in every mall in America. It’s nonsense bullshit stuff. Look up YouTube videos on influencers making videos on things they get from wish. Sometimes it’s great and sometimes it’s just funny.
2021-06-13 15:08:59,wallstreetbets,Almost every WISH thread starter is a really young account….
2021-06-12 21:58:19,wallstreetbets,"Share lockup is 5/16, not Monday. Marketbeat date is inaccurate. This correction has been posted in multiple posts"
2021-06-13 02:15:13,wallstreetbets,"Yes it's not a comparison because Wish is still a young company in comparison. When people bought amazon or alibaba at $10 you think they resemble anything that they are today? Amazon was just a glorified online bookstore at one point. Alibaba in particular makes most of their money through online ecommerce, which is why I am comparing Alibaba to Wish. Wish right now just has the foundation to become big down the road. We don't know what they will eventually pivot to, or what turn arounds they will make that will boost the business. That is why the share price is so low. And right now, it is extremely undervalued considering their cash/assets and growth rate."
2021-06-13 02:01:55,wallstreetbets,"Yeah baba actually has factories that make shit in China.

Wish just buys Chinese shit and mails it to idiots who think they're getting a good deal on stuff that Target and WalMart overcharge for. But it's all crap."
2021-06-13 02:09:53,wallstreetbets,"It really depends. There is a lot of crap on amazon and ali express. That is why you use reviews to help you decide. Wish has got that down I believe. I've seen their review section and you are able to post video reviews, etc. This separates the bogus stuff from the good stuff, just like any marketplace."

2021-06-12 21:42:14,wallstreetbets,"You understand it wrong. The gross rev is their “logistic revenue”. Something equivalent in the Amazon world is “sell by 3rd party seller, fulfilled by Amazon”. In this way, the revenue from selling 3rd party is marketplace revenue, and recognize as “net revenue”. The revenue for fulfillment (how they charge the merchant for fulfillment) is logistic revenue, and recognize as “net revenue”. This is a standard practice."

2021-06-13 09:46:52,wallstreetbets,"But wish doesn't actually do anything. It's literally just a squarespace e-commerce front for Chinese shit dropshippers. Its entire business model is misleading product photos or blatantly wrong product descriptions, hoping that you won't ask for a return because it's not worth your time to put the $2 junk back in the box."
2021-06-13 12:06:59,wallstreetbets,This is like saying Shopify and Amazon don’t do anything.
2021-06-13 12:09:22,wallstreetbets,"What does Shopify do?

You still haven't convinced me that wish is anything more than a dropshipper. The whole thing looks algorithmic like five minute crafts.

Edit: lol Shopify is just a squarespace specifically for e-commerce. So not even the right comparison. Shopify is basically the reason wish doesn't make sense to me. Anyone can use Shopify to make the next wish and ship Chinese junk everywhere."
2021-06-13 15:09:17,wallstreetbets,"Then why don’t you make the next Wish and sell it for $6b?  There’s more to making a marketplace than a Shopify website.  There’s technology and infrastructure you need to build to get sellers willing to sell stuff through your marketplace and buyers willing to buy.  Accepting payments, inventory mgmt and analytics, relationships with logistics companies, marketing expertise, and most important of all, substantial network effects…

Wish can take share from eBay as the low cost low service Amazon.  There’s no way for Wish or anyone else to compete vs amazon on the highly served high priced market, so they are going for the underserved market on purpose."

2021-06-13 03:34:56,wallstreetbets,"They are the largest wholesale lender in the USA as stated on their own website. You are correct in that they are not brokers but they are the underwriter for several loans. 

Wholesale lending defines the process of a lender providing the credit decision as well as the funding of a mortgage loan that was originated by a mortgage broker. Wholesale lenders have the underwriting authority and funds available to lend while mortgage brokers typically have a deeper presence in the marketplace than banks do and access to more loan product options.

I think your confusion is that this started as a SPAC. However Gores Holdings IV Inc., a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), merged with UWM Holdings about 4 and half months ago."

2021-06-13 09:48:35,wallstreetbets,Okay. Thanks! Could you recommend best program to watch charts? I’m a newbie lol
2021-06-13 08:11:39,wallstreetbets,"I'd recommend trying to read up on it way further, but I can give you a quick run down.

Call options means you're betting the price goes up, put options means you're betting the price goes down. The Strike price is the point at which your option becomes good, or In the Money. Each option is a contract for 100 shares.

So a call option expiring 1/2 with a strike of $3 means that if the underlying stock price (the share price) reaches $3 on or before 1/2, the contract is good and can be executed. If the share price fails to reach the strike, the option is no good.

Now, you can also sell your option contracts to others without executing them prior to the expiration date. This is what I have been doing. Generally speaking, you will make the same amount of profit if you execute or sell the option. I just don't have any interest in owning the underlying shares and rather buy more options."

As for whether it's a fantasy number? They're about as real as a stock's standard deviation is. In that they measure the aggregated expectation for potential price movements across many traders, based on which prices people are trading at. It also can be (and often is) used to compute what the expected movements are.

It's just another number that describes some aspect of the system. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"

2021-06-12 20:49:31,wallstreetbets,I LOVED $MVIS. But I sold it when it tripled for more $SENS and $NIO. I really liked $PLTR too but I just felt comfortable with other stocks. Maybe if $PLTR heavily dips below $19 I’ll buy back in.
2021-06-12 20:40:17,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I agree with you, but I think you missed my point entirely. Type 1 diabetics do need CGMs, and I’m sure we’ll the see the number of type 1s with CGMs rise in the coming years. However, my issue with this post is not that I think type 1s don’t need them, it’s that the population numbers in this DD are referring to type 2 diabetics, not type 1s. OP states that 13% of Americans are diabetics, as if that’s going to be the market for the sens. 13% of Americans are type 2 diabetics, meanwhile only a quarter of a percent are type 1. Type 2 diabetics very rarely use CGMs, and that’s not likely to change in the near future. If we’re basing our market estimates on the number of type 2 diabetics instead of the type 1s who will actually be the user base of this device, the numbers will be drastically inflated, and that’s the flaw I’m pointing out. I have no issue at all with type 1s using CGMs, I use one myself, I just think that this DD is failing to differentiate between type 1 diabetics (less than 2 million people in US, commonly use CGM), and type 2 diabetics (50 million people in the US, very rarely use CGM)."

2021-06-12 23:59:43,wallstreetbets,“the 30c bag this stock is valued at.” This makes no sense and proves my point that you don’t know about stocks .

2021-06-12 20:18:54,wallstreetbets,The revolutionary CGM would be the Eversense 365 day with both the sensor and transmitter subcutaneous with one/two calibrations a week. I wear the G6 but see a major disruption in the market with the 365 implantable sensor/transmitter. So that is why you try and buy at these prices.
2021-06-13 08:57:56,wallstreetbets,"Did you know that's being reduced in their upcoming model to 1? And most in the trial said it was only needed once every few days? And that the 365 will be once a week? 

No,  you didn't. Let's see what's better,  calibration once/twice a week or replacing the entire unit once every two? 

Only an idiot would think this isn't an improvement."
2021-06-13 09:22:04,wallstreetbets,"LOLOL!!! ""Entire unit"". That's just absolutely retarded. Doesn't take any more pain or effort than a single finger prick/calibration. You're reaching to make it sound more difficult than it is.  


Doesn't matter one bit if ""actually"" only needs calibration every few days. To insure the POS sensor is functioning properly, you still have to check twice a day, because YOU DO NOT KNOW if it is or not unless you do. If you're doing it less than twice a day, per the instructions, then it's your own damn fault if you end up in a diabetic coma and die. Go right ahead and ""assume"" it's working fine, ignore the proper usage, and see how well that works out for you. You're only one coma away from the ""follow the damn instructions, dumbass"" lesson.  


One or two finger pricks a day with Eversense, or only one prick elsewhere every 10-14 days when you replace the Dexcom sensor. Easy choice.  


Only an idiot would think Eversense is an improvement."
2021-06-13 10:47:27,wallstreetbets,"i just told you they are changing that to 1 day and it will be at once a week.

it's okay that you dont know what you're talking about. obviously you got burnt on sens the last time wsb took control of it and now you're in an angry spiral of hate against the stock. that's fine."
2021-06-13 10:49:15,wallstreetbets,you should probably get a life instead of spending all day shitting on every post in WSB
2021-06-13 11:07:18,wallstreetbets,"LOLOL!!! By the time they have it to once a day, Dexcom will have one that lasts a month with zero calibration needed. I also said ""One or two a day"", taking into account their optimistic claims of being able to produce a less unreliable sensor. As you really so damn stupid that you believe one company can make advances while the rest do nothing? By the time they're at once a week, Dexcom will have one that lasts half a year without calibration. That's how tech advances work. You really do belong here.  


Now, here's the real kicker. You aren't arguing with me. You're actually arguing with yourself and trying to blame me for the flaming bag of crap you stuffed your money into. If you really thought you made a good investment, you would have ignored my comment in the first place. You're the lifeless POS that wanted this, so I'm more than happy to oblige. You can go away at any time. Nobody is forcing you to sound like an idiot. You're doing it all on your own.

2021-06-13 14:03:42,wallstreetbets,Yes but on EC day it went down from about 41 to 37 after EC. I dipped with a smallish gain as I try to avoid losing money on my options. If I'd held I'd be more up but I'm still glad I got out.
2021-06-13 12:16:56,wallstreetbets,"Not at all!

IV stands for implied volatility which is a measure of uncertainty of a stock’s price. The more uncertainty there is, the higher the cost of the options for that stock. Compare for example the cost of options for $CLOV right now, which is a high volatility stock, with the price of the options on a low volatility stock, say $T. $CLOV shares are roughly half the price of $T but the options chain is more expensive. When there are big price movements on a stock, the IV goes up. It’s like the market is saying “I don’t really know where this thing is going next 🤷‍♂️ “

Before the earnings report, volatility is at a local maximum. No one knows for certain if it will be a good report or not, so IV typically goes up. Earnings reports remove uncertainty from a company’s future because you hear news directly from the company, so usually the IV drops fast after earnings reducing the value of the options sometimes quite dramatically. That dramatic drop in implied volatility is called IV crush. 

Usually you’re better off taking the sell side before earnings because option prices are high, and buying back after (sell high, buy low). In the cases where the thing pops up or down a large percentage, IV can sustain itself for a while though. Look at GME. The day after the last 2 earnings its price dropped dramatically. If you had bought a 220 put on it before the earnings this past week you’d have been able to sell it for a serious profit the next day. By the end of the week, that put was worthless though. If instead you had sold a 250/240 call spread you could’ve made a similar profit the next day, and by the end of Friday you’d have made max profit."

2021-06-13 12:58:40,wallstreetbets,Most people play earnings with puts only on the day of ER itself anyway. It is basically a scripted event that they woll rebound by next day and then trade sideways while you get assfucked by theta decay.
2021-06-12 23:25:40,wallstreetbets,…causing a rip?
2021-06-13 15:00:59,wallstreetbets,Don't ever take advice from anyone here. Careful.
2021-06-13 03:21:40,wallstreetbets,"Hey, I am getting some clue from your comment. But didn't get the term 'short-dated'. Can you give me some more light? Thanks"
2021-06-13 07:35:12,wallstreetbets,Just in the tip
2021-06-12 23:56:08,wallstreetbets,yeah actual financial advisors can't really help you with meme stock trading my guy
2021-06-13 00:14:34,wallstreetbets,"I'm in Lennar, and got it when it dumped with the broader homebuilding exodus from June 8-10. Likely cause of interest rates/inflation? Not sure why.

But you should, 100 percent, go and get some AUG calls on Century Communities or just stock. It's going to be a nice double (baseball term). Maybe more, depending on housing starts this month and next month, as well as how lumber continues to play out. So far lumber has gotten below 1000 as of Friday so that was good."
2021-06-13 06:19:56,wallstreetbets,"Sure.

Let's say a stock is currently @ $100 and I buy 10 options contracts with a strike of $105 and 60 Days to Expire (DTE) for $1 PS for a total of $1000.

The next day, the stock drops to $90. Well my options will go down as well, but may only go down to say $0.50 or $500 total since there are still 59 DTE and a lot can happen in that time. If I decide to sell I can get half my money back and move on.



Same situation but instead of 60DTE, I bought double the contracts at half the price per contract with 10 DTE. If the next day, the stock tanks from $100 to $90, my options will more likely tank 90% than the previous 50%. There is less time for the stock to make a rebound AND gain the ground needed to put my contracts in the money. If I decide to sell and move on, I can probably clear $100.

The first situation I would describe as semi-long dated or long dated options as there is a lot of time for price moment to occur and they have a lower delta. The second would be short dated because they have very little time and the delta, and theta, are going to put you in a world of hurt if it doesn't go your way."

After we hiked to a water fall with a deep swimming hole. Super clear n cold water. Best part about climbing and hiking outdoors and even climbing indoors is how incredibly attractive alot of the girls there are. Who would have thought a hobby that requires you to be physically fit would have a lot of hot athletic people doing it. Mind blowing I know.

2021-06-12 20:33:49,wallstreetbets,"This guy’s complex use of “there“ suggests that he has extensive legal experience.

And he’s right - the biggest problem with prenups is that somewhere between 40 and 95% of them are signed at knife or gunpoint. However, the problem is not the duress, its the lack of time to adequately consider the horrific ramifications of failing to sign the agreement.

The best attorneys recommend keeping your betrothed locked in a windowless basement room with minimal rations for a *minimum* of four months. Allow them to review the agreement during this time. Provide them with an old plastic flashlight (non-LED) that runs on D batteries to assist in their review. After the *minimum* four months have passed, demand that they sign the agreement while holding a large (.40+ handgun) to the back of their head. Make sure to *only* unbolt their *dominant* hand, but promise to unbolt their other hand and both legs *after* they sign.

To my knowledge, a prenup executed in this way has never been overturned.

You also can be voted out. 5 votes gets you in or out. You can nominate anyone but you have make sure they are good one … smart and not going to break rules.

Eventually we get the kinks worked out and this will be pinned - a second daily that anyone can see but only the inducted can talk in. So trade masters and ah shitpost senpais all in 1 place"

Do you need any spices? We have a lot of oregano here and I think it might be close to going bad, it's stinky."
2021-06-12 20:16:34,wallstreetbets,So Brazilian waxing is super targeted to one area and they don’t do the legs. They just bleach it…so it *glistens* in the sun. I’m not in support.
2021-06-12 20:21:10,wallstreetbets,Absolutely

Cleveland Cliffs is a good company and we will do fine vs. competition... But some of the shit posts here acting like this for a gonna moon to $200/share need to chill is all I'm saying."
2021-06-13 12:20:14,wallstreetbets,"It's possible to work for a organization and not believe in it. Just imagine all the people who hold jobs at the DMV. Your employment proves nothing. Now if you took your paychecks and have been investing in $CLF then you can say you believe.

2021-06-13 16:51:33,wallstreetbets,"Okay bud, good luck."
2021-06-13 01:56:20,wallstreetbets,X management is not great. They’ll issue equity in your face before they do anything worthwhile. They may not even be a company anymore in the next downturn because they won’t survive. This is also misleading because CLF hadn’t fully integrated the Arcellor Mittal US steel plants.

Should be 50% higher than where it's trading compared to CLF NUE etc. If you can read a chart and market cap, then you know this.

2021-06-13 09:42:36,wallstreetbets,Knew nothing about CLF but that is enough to justify 50 shares I suppose.
2021-06-13 01:53:06,wallstreetbets,"CLF is the largest producer of FLAT ROLLED steel.  CLF will never try to be the largest producer of steel as they want to maintain the price (plus LG is murdering smaller mills in his area for fun).

2021-06-13 05:22:34,wallstreetbets,Holding BB long term is fine. The only time I'd be worried is when they intend to sell their entire patent portfolio.
2021-06-13 06:40:42,wallstreetbets,This stock may certainly go up. There is also a chance it may go down. Potentially sideways.
2021-06-13 06:44:03,wallstreetbets,Holding BB too. Maybe buy some more come Monday

I dunno.. just doesn’t feel right to me. but hey if I’m wrong, that’s good for you guys. I’m going all in on a couple others that I see to be a bit more likely to hit big. I see BB as a long game"

2021-06-13 01:57:33,wallstreetbets,"Add this to your Bear Thesis:

1. Solvency issues will mean fleets who want to save money will be very wary about buying Endurances as they will be concerned about future cost of service.
2. If Fleets actually care about saving money why are they buying a $52K Endurance when they can buy a $40K Cybertruck?

Subtract this from your Bull Thesis:

1. Billions worth of assets - that is simply nonsense. Old auto factories don't go for much. Further, as EV's develop, it is important to have purpose built factories for that (hence why Tesla is building new factories and Lucid built a new factory). Old factories will result in inefficiency and difficultly scaling up production.
2. ATVM loan - The chance of them getting the loan should be assumed very low. They are just not given out anymore. Further, one of the things that people seem to agree the ATVM looks at, is whether you can survive without the loan. If the company is going bankrupt but for the loan, safe to assume they are not getting it. FYI, Lucid motors went through extensive due diligence for the ATVM loan, only for it to go nowhere. One more FYI, Steve Burns talked up the ATVM loan when he was at Workhorse, which also turned out to be nothing.

Will be curious how Lordstown Week works out... After messing up the SF250 and other issues they have had, my expectation is that Steve Burns has promised too much and things will not go well."

2021-06-13 11:10:19,wallstreetbets,"Correct, population grows, which means more demand, more available labor, more companies, and etc). Wealth, owning things of value, also grows, as we create better and faster than we destroy (zero sum means we are all cavemen still). Finally, empirically, the entire stock market has gone up in value about 10% per year (on average) for it's entire history.

Generally speaking, only radical economists claim the system is zero sum, usually to push an agenda...BUT, in order for you to sell high, someone must buy high.

Although the global economy grows at a steady rate, massive gains and losses are on a small enough time scale and wild enough volitility that we can simplify it down to zero sum.  If you lose millions on the stock market, itll take longer than a human lifetime for global economic growth to bring you back on it's own."

2021-06-13 06:54:14,wallstreetbets,"Though that Thesis is correct in most economic text books you also need to recognize that most of those are under the assumptions that all companies still pay dividends. It used to be that when you bought stock you had partial ownership in the company and got paid part of the revenue for being a partial owner. We have since then moved away from this and that is exactly why stock market is a Ponzi scheme. No stock actually trades off their fundamentals the media is just really pissed that AMC and GME went up and are about to expose the market for what it is, a way for the rich to steal from the poor legally.  Facebook and Google trade based off of whatever people are willing to pay regardless of their overall company value."
2021-06-13 06:56:23,wallstreetbets,AMC is about to be the most valuable company in the world for a short period of time. If someone doesn't recognize this by now they probably already went and bought clover health and are going to be holding the bag as it goes to zero.

2021-06-12 23:23:10,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been following NVAX and investing in shares and calls for about a year.  I don’t disagree with your assessment on risks related to approvals, but in this case, company is sitting on around $2 billion in cash due to the secondary offering shares it sold throughout the past year as share price went up.  They have plenty of money for the last stretch to get EUA approval.  As for EUAs, Novavax is going to be the last company left with any chance of getting a US EUA because no more phase 3 trials can be run against a placebo control population.  All future trials will most likely be needed to take place against a population with approved vaccines.  There’s of risk left in this company around whether they can finish ramping up their aggressive manufacturing expansion and partnerships.  But getting Emergency Use Approval in the US has been largely de-risked."
2021-06-13 07:03:28,wallstreetbets,How can you know anything if you dont do your DD or who ever does it for you dont know basic things about this company like the fact they got plenty of cash from Operation Warp Speed awarded by the government ...

I may be retarded, but how would you be in the hole 4,000, if you are short-selling the stock.  When you short it and it drops 5% wouldn't you be up, since you are shorting it? Maybe I'm not understanding the hypothetical."

2021-06-13 12:17:43,wallstreetbets,"FYI these Word-Word-#### accounts probably aren't bots, they're usually phone normies who auto-generated a username with google sign-in. I think the reason it looks like a suspicious pattern is because the kind of person who doesn't even pick a username is the kind of person that leaves a lazy comment is the kind of person that looks like a bot.

That or they're bots, but usually it's not bots.. just tards. If you think someone is really suspicious just reply with their username when you complain about them, making vague allusions to ""all the bots"" doesn't help anyone.

**EDIT**: I made the duplicate comment spam sensitivity threshold I implemented the other day a good deal more sensitive.

**EDIT 2:** I just implemented two layers of duplicate comment detection and removal. Let's see how this works. They don't have to be bots to leave shit comments, we can filter a lot of it out if you're willing to deal with your occasional short shitpost comments getting spammed.

Jeff begins walking across the street after having just watched his warehouse worker pee in a bottle and waste 14.234554563 seconds of valuable part picking time. He’s decidedly upset, but reminded that worker will soon be fired and subsidized by the suckers that pay taxes. He’s. Rock. Fucking. Hard.

His eyes catch Elon standing at the corner. The rain is coming down hard but is bouncing off Elon’s smug aura. They glare at each other and approach. Elon compliments Jeff’s bald head. Jeff’s pants begin to burst at the seam with his raging blood boy fueled boner. Elon talks for 25 minutes about how the hair transplant he received in his thirties gave him the confidence to launch a car into space. They inch closer and their lizard tongues interlock.

They decide they need to release. Jeff taps his wrist and two drones come in, grabs their uncircumcised meat socks and takes them to the local penitentiary. They’re dropped off in the open ceiling cell of Martin Shkreli. Martin, having just been pumped full of semen from the US judicial system decides two more are in store for the day. Martin grabs their weenies, inserts one at each end of his body.  Martin starts rotating like a pig over a campfire.

Elon exits Martins mouth after releasing his fresh load of sushi grade roe and asks if all is okay. Martin, teary eyed, looks at Elon and says one thing.

I ride the hype until it inevitably gets dumped by the funds and thus the cycle of WSBagholders continues and I got payed.

Jeff begins walking across the street after having just watched his warehouse worker pee in a bottle and waste 14.234554563 seconds of valuable part picking time. He’s decidedly upset, but reminded that worker will soon be fired and subsidized by the suckers that pay taxes. He’s. Rock. Fucking. Hard.

His eyes catch Elon standing at the corner. The rain is coming down hard but is bouncing off Elon’s smug aura. They glare at each other and approach. Elon compliments Jeff’s bald head. Jeff’s pants begin to burst at the seam with his raging blood boy fueled boner. Elon talks for 25 minutes about how the hair transplant he received in his thirties gave him the confidence to launch a car into space. They inch closer and their lizard tongues interlock.

They decide they need to release. Jeff taps his wrist and two drones come in, grabs their uncircumcised meat socks and takes them to the local penitentiary. They’re dropped off in the open ceiling cell of Martin Shkreli. Martin, having just been pumped full of semen from the US judicial system decides two more are in store for the day. Martin grabs their weenies, inserts one at each end of his body.  Martin starts rotating like a pig over a campfire.

Elon exits Martins mouth after releasing his fresh load of sushi grade roe and asks if all is okay. Martin, teary eyed, looks at Elon and says one thing.

How the fuck is this not a thing you ask Mr. Wonderful? I have no fucking idea either. Allow me to introduce you to:

Soyabi. Yes the name is trash but it’s guaranteed cash. Who wants to collect royalty checks on the reg? Getting drunk on the reg, fucking good times on the reg, yachts on the reg, sex on the reg. Basically, all the shit that most men fantasize about.

&#x200B;

Example:  buy put strike price @ $200 with a premium of $10.00, and sell put strike price of $201 with a premium of $11.19. In theory, any contract sets I get should immediately net me $19, no matter what the price of the stock drops to. And scale up to $119 per contract between $200 and $201.

Yes I believe in some of these companies but they are not in the same realm as CRSR right now in terms of undervaluation.

1.7B revenues, gaining market share, 2.9b market cap, RAISED guidance, new innovative products coming. 

I don’t give a fuck how awesome WISH or BB is. I’m sure they’re awesome and hope they do well. But it is CRIMINAL to say that CRSR is not undervalued. They make hundreds of millions in PROFIT, and they are TAKING ADVANTAGE NOW during a sentiment of their sector that is BULLISH. 

I’m not trash talking the other memes, but the very same people shit talking CRSR are the ones saying “insert unprofitable speculative or shorted meme that isn’t make money” to the moon and then say CRSR ain’t it when they make MORE revenue and MORE profit and ARE PROFITABLE.

American public bathroom stall panel gaps are wide enough to fit a laptop through. We're not even talking about an LG gram, surface or macbook pro 13. I think I can fit an MSI gt76 Titan with a full external panel fan or even some of those slim tower desktops. Full blown whiteboarding sessions seem possible through these generous door gaps. Why? Is this a cultural thing? Do people have lively work discussions with colleagues while post-processing yesterday's dinner? Efficiency is cool, but this seems quite dystopian. Although I'm not an interior designer, I would also think that the appropriate gap width to prevent people from doing drugs, passing out or doing other ill-advised activities is on the macbook air side not the Lebron's arm side."

2021-06-12 21:17:26,wallstreetbets,"Don't even ask the question. The answer is yes, it's priced in. Think   
Amazon will beat the next earnings? That's already been priced in. You   
work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are  
 made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know   
that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows   
the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born.   
Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was   
valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population   
growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how   
many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take   
the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced   
in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original   
thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the   
omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all   
and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the   
universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the   
universe). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether AAPL   
has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already   
been priced in and don't ask such a dumb fucking question again."

He saw a hand reach out to him from the sky above him and before he could grab it he heard a strong “it’s not your time”. He then snapped back to reality of himself coming back to life. From that point on he started dedicating himself more and more to christ. That’s the reason I personally believe in god, my grandpa has literally seen the proof."

2021-06-13 13:10:18,wallstreetbets,I would think one doesn't start with net rev but instead use gross rev then subtract against it on a different line item. Being in many countries and with eight subsidiaries allows them a non-GAAP approach for recordation. Just my two cents.

Not sure how updated this is but look at the insider and institutional ownership%. Adds up to over a 100% which is funky af. Bought in when it popped up on my unusual call volume watchlist and the chart looked good. Also SI of float is decently high around 30%"
2021-06-13 18:44:39,wallstreetbets,"Not positive, but data seems to be tripped up a bit that they're owned by parent company SCOOBY AGGREGATOR LP (\~56% ownership). Ortex showing about 80%  total insider ownership."

2021-06-12 22:21:08,wallstreetbets,CLOV will continue to go up and down and people will take their 30%-100% and leave but overall the support price will be higher in the process and those same people will reinvest and a higher average price point so even if the sell they’ll be back lol that’s just the game. Paper hands come and go but most importantly they are the main ones who panic buy so they definitely help

2021-06-13 05:56:15,wallstreetbets,That’s literally nothing. They own more in AMC. Fucking crazy how stupid you are. They don’t even own close to 1% of CLOV shares and you say they own it. You’re fucking braindead

2021-06-13 11:28:09,wallstreetbets,"I explained to you that Citadel does not own CLOV and in fact has more ownership in AMC than CLOV. You never responsed other with insults, and you call me a child? Jump off a bridge you inbred waste of oxygen"
2021-06-13 11:31:59,wallstreetbets,Just bc they have more ownership of AMC doesnt mean shit. They still have a large stake in CLOV which enables them to pump it for liquidity as they did last week. But again ur obviously an angry cunt who needs to defend his pump and dump investment. Good luck let us know how that dick tastes.

2021-06-13 18:22:07,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for this. Your DD is absolutely on spot, and I share your conviction 100%. I have seen very few CLNE supporters on these boards who have dug into the details as much as you have m ( \_ \_ ) m

However, we are preaching to the choir.

How about persuading the doubters by using your research and writing skills to counter the actual arguments that have been a huge cause of the price's downward pressure, arguments created by just [this one man](http://stockmarketadvantage.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Pavel-Molchanov.jpg) in a downgrade report of CLNE to underperform.

Immediately after that downgrade was announced (still can't find it anywhere even though it should be a publicly available report, as mandated by the SEC in its equity research/rating reporting guidelines), CLNE's biggest shareholder started a series of selloffs that have totaled over 25% since late April.

Some people say that these ratings are ignored by many, but the important thing to note here is that CLNE's biggest shareholder didn't.

Also, note that the day following the report's release, CLNE's share price dropped about 30%.

Though my search high and low for the report has been futile, the gist of the analyst's arguments, who is a representative of the controversial financial firm Raymond James, is [here](https://www.tipranks.com/news/article/clean-energy-fuels-amazon-deal-lacks-substance-says-analyst/).

I'd like to challenge you and all the CLNE supporters to answer these arguments with authority to win over the doubters and make this thing take off all week long!

Cheers."
