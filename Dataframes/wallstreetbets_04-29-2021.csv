2021-04-29 19:54:20,wallstreetbets,You made 50k off shares only. Damn. This makes me want to buy shares more now. I thought it would take too long to make a decent profit from shares.
2021-04-29 19:52:17,wallstreetbets,"Very well done, retard..
That's 10% of what MVIS did in sales for the entire quarter 🤣"

2021-04-29 19:56:15,wallstreetbets,I usually do options but temporarily switching to shares due to kangaroo market
2021-04-29 19:52:47,wallstreetbets,"OK when you put it like that, that's very sad."
2021-04-29 19:41:09,wallstreetbets,It wasn’t options. He bought shares.
2021-04-29 19:45:12,wallstreetbets,U my friend need to go back to the drawing board

2021-04-29 19:08:49,wallstreetbets,That’s like telling a manic to stop being depressed

2021-04-29 19:42:31,wallstreetbets,Sell the bags while they’re worth something.
2021-04-29 19:30:20,wallstreetbets,Hhmm I keep reading that it’s declining more tomorrow.
2021-04-29 19:28:09,wallstreetbets,Definitely going up
2021-04-29 19:41:34,wallstreetbets,I feel like there financials were pretty unimpressive.
2021-04-29 19:57:09,wallstreetbets,LMFAO
2021-04-29 19:48:23,wallstreetbets,lol you do this you’ll end up in the same situation again with $CLOV. Trust me people on here aren’t financial professionals.
2021-04-29 19:41:57,wallstreetbets,"Man, I so want to believe this."
2021-04-29 19:50:23,wallstreetbets,I keep hearing it’s going up tho??
2021-04-29 19:51:18,wallstreetbets,Should I buy puts to even out???
2021-04-29 19:32:37,wallstreetbets,Delusional
2021-04-29 19:58:33,wallstreetbets,Pretty much everyone who has been with MVIS for a while knew the financials were shit. That’s not the reason we’re invested
2021-04-29 19:43:40,wallstreetbets,Unimpressive is an understatement
2021-04-29 19:53:09,wallstreetbets,Well... pull up a 5 day or week chart and compare MVIS to CLOV. I think it’s pretty obvious which looks bullish.
2021-04-29 18:57:06,wallstreetbets,Yo magikarp. How about a special divvy for us poors?
2021-04-29 19:21:41,wallstreetbets,Papa Karp is building a mega tree house for late night Mamma Wood shenanigans.
2021-04-29 18:56:57,wallstreetbets,Jesus......
2021-04-29 19:31:03,wallstreetbets,All at the expense of the Palantards.   Glorious just like AMC lining the pockets of the executives through public offerings
2021-04-29 19:00:52,wallstreetbets,Have you all seen the increase in institutional buying?
2021-04-29 19:04:01,wallstreetbets,Hopefully he can earn a new last name
2021-04-29 19:32:05,wallstreetbets,I approve this message
2021-04-29 18:58:00,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure he has another 160m shares worth of stock options expiring EOY 2021 so he will create a billion+ of new shares this year.

Edit: comment below says 68M shares"

2021-04-29 19:13:07,wallstreetbets,so do i buy pltr or nah
2021-04-29 18:58:11,wallstreetbets,CEO Alex Karp was granted 141 million options that vest quarterly through August 2032. Sheeees this shit gonna be dead money for next 11 years
2021-04-29 19:09:39,wallstreetbets,"If that's not ""fuck you money"" I don't know what it is..."
2021-04-29 19:05:16,wallstreetbets,I wonder how the PLTR cucks will explain this away

2021-04-29 18:58:06,wallstreetbets,Agree!
2021-04-29 19:39:17,wallstreetbets,Palantards are okay with this. Karp got these guys hook line and sinker. If you bring up anything in that sub all you hear is fuck the short term this is a 10year hold lol. Palantards don’t understand opportunity cost and are happy to hold Karps bags.
2021-04-29 19:12:04,wallstreetbets,"Link? CNBC did talk about it 3 times today,  shark tank guy, cramer and the trader “guy” likes it"

2021-04-29 19:02:38,wallstreetbets,"Honestly? Probably less then they were worth today, unless MVIS gaps down even more than it is now

Edit: to be clear, not trying to be a dick, but until you’ve experienced IV crush first hand on a post-ER option that’s still decently out of the money, even when you’ve predicted the correct direction, you’re setting yourself up for major disappointment"

2021-04-29 19:59:24,wallstreetbets,Wow what a great tool! I just used it and it says I need to be at 12.33 tomorrow to get a 3X profit.. Thanks!
2021-04-29 19:07:03,wallstreetbets,Glad I have some $20 puts...
2021-04-29 19:11:33,wallstreetbets,I got these at 19 for ins... should be at least a 3 to 5 bagger!
2021-04-29 19:35:28,wallstreetbets,I don't see lidar!
2021-04-29 19:31:48,wallstreetbets,I was thinking the same thing. I need it to go down to 13 for some real 🎂
2021-04-29 19:00:30,wallstreetbets,I was hoping for a 5 timer but it looks like you will at least double or triple that...🎳🎈📈
2021-04-29 19:19:03,wallstreetbets,"No chance. IV crush and theta will keep them low. You will probably double up if it isn't moving green in the morning, if it is you'll get a few bucks.  No chance they are over $1.50 unless it actually gets to $10"
2021-04-29 19:25:13,wallstreetbets,"No chance of that if it’s only down like 15% tomorrow. If it goes down like 25-30%, maybe"
2021-04-29 19:38:53,wallstreetbets,"It says on robinhood ""3d perceptive lidar sensing"" do these retards not know everything is 3d already buying puts was the right call!"
2021-04-29 19:01:31,wallstreetbets,Hope so hahaha
2021-04-29 19:23:18,wallstreetbets,Well hoping for $1.20. 3x better than no-x..📈👊
2021-04-29 19:28:36,wallstreetbets,I'll post the result first thing in the morning. I wanted to make sure I got the Greeks in there for all you smart guys!
2021-04-29 19:28:02,wallstreetbets,If it stays under $14.87 then it'll definitely be at least 3x. The $14 was selling at 1.10 when the stock was at $19 today.
2021-04-29 19:44:32,wallstreetbets,Correct! And I believe that doing it early enough got me down low enough. Like I said hoping 3x
2021-04-29 19:37:59,wallstreetbets,"You’re comparing apples and oranges tho

After ER IV will be way down for anything that’s still OTM, and that’s a huge part of what determines option pricing. As of now your puts will still be 30%* OTM

*Whoops, maf is hard"
2021-04-29 19:47:36,wallstreetbets,"Yeah see what you mean, I really need this thing to go lower to see some real Jack, like 12"
2021-04-29 18:50:48,wallstreetbets,"As a long time holder of the boomer stock you just dropped 20k in, why are you thinking this is a WSB position?"

2021-04-29 18:55:03,wallstreetbets,"Lmao what the actual fuck

this is like “YOLOing” on T-bills"
2021-04-29 18:50:18,wallstreetbets,ZZZZZZZ
2021-04-29 18:57:20,wallstreetbets,"As an employee of att for the last 6 years (finally no more) this pains me greatly.

That said, it won't drop since it never moves and you'll get the dividend. This isn't WSB material it's like BoomerMaterial. You'll get your 7%."
2021-04-29 19:17:10,wallstreetbets,It’s like throwing 20k to a snail 🐌
2021-04-29 19:44:27,wallstreetbets,"You should sell these quick before it dips under $30 again and then rebuy somewhere under $30

How do I know? I bought a bunch of calls from dec 7-15 as it went from $29-$31 and then fell back below $30 before I secured any profits 

I hear ex dividend dates are best days to buy since it’ll for sure dip as dividend chasers sell out"
2021-04-29 18:50:20,wallstreetbets,"Wow, good luck to u my friend"
2021-04-29 19:11:34,wallstreetbets,How much dividend will you make this year  with dumping in 20k?
2021-04-29 19:37:19,wallstreetbets,this is the opposite of a yolo my dude
2021-04-29 19:43:29,wallstreetbets,This is less of a Yolo than driving around the block.

2021-04-29 19:56:43,wallstreetbets,Lmao. TIPS
2021-04-29 19:25:16,wallstreetbets,Do you get 7% every quarter or is it yearly? Sorry don’t know much about stocks and dividends.
2021-04-29 19:17:10,wallstreetbets,$1300 ish
2021-04-29 18:53:20,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, the dividends. I am not bullish on the market over the next year, and if there is a downturn I expect lots of people to run to the safety of high dividend yield stocks. AT&T consistently pays high dividends.   
... But analysts are mixed on AT&Ts outlook. The share price could easily wipe out a significant amount of the stocks value."
2021-04-29 19:22:26,wallstreetbets,You get an updoot but OP doesnt.
2021-04-29 18:54:21,wallstreetbets,I agree I’m just wondering what else because there’s also Disney plus and amazon

2021-04-29 19:47:36,wallstreetbets,"Right now its paying .52 a share each quarter, so I'll get $1300+ a year.
That's assuming revenue stays strong."
2021-04-29 19:23:11,wallstreetbets,I lose that much during my morning coffee.
2021-04-29 18:58:49,wallstreetbets,And that belongs in WSB why? R/dividends is where you belong
2021-04-29 19:02:25,wallstreetbets,Cause it’s a yolo...
2021-04-29 19:03:15,wallstreetbets,It’s about as YOLO and me chucking 20k into a high yield savings account..
2021-04-29 19:03:36,wallstreetbets,Do it
2021-04-29 19:02:48,wallstreetbets,"Wait, you put 30k on the line for a quick 25$?"
2021-04-29 18:38:06,wallstreetbets,Guess you’re long CLOV now
2021-04-29 18:51:54,wallstreetbets,"I have pennies in my account and follow all my picks religiously then i come to this sub and see the most retarded shit with like 50k-1mil. 
  
  
  
I need to just prostitute my anus or something."
2021-04-29 18:40:33,wallstreetbets,"You call that a loss?  I'm upside down in nearly all of my positions EXCEPT CLOV this much or more with iBio leading the charge at -$17k, because I was more retarded and bought last week....nice to have an $8 average 🙃"

2021-04-29 19:36:10,wallstreetbets,That's quite a few covered calls you can sell my dude
2021-04-29 19:06:48,wallstreetbets,I don’t think it’s over yet my friend
2021-04-29 19:58:12,wallstreetbets,That strategy works until it doesn't.
2021-04-29 18:46:13,wallstreetbets,I with you bois! Bought 5000 shares yesterday at $10.40. Got $50k in. Holding
2021-04-29 18:37:16,wallstreetbets,"Usually I scalp with stop limit buys so that the stock has some upward momentum when the order executes. Don't think I'll be doing that again.

Edit: and for those of you that can do math, I had a wash sale from taking a loss on a CLOV scalp that went bad before. I decided I don't want to sell at a loss because last time it came back, so now I'm along for the ride."
2021-04-29 19:04:08,wallstreetbets,"It’ll be fine, this is gunna bounce back hard. It’ll be $12-15 by EOnextW"
2021-04-29 19:28:55,wallstreetbets,Do you know what’s worse than going long? Going short...
2021-04-29 18:44:46,wallstreetbets,"Come on CLOV, you can do it. Get to $40 at least"
2021-04-29 18:57:01,wallstreetbets,LOL. Shit luck mate. Crazy to hear it though. I was just telling my gf last night how unlikely this is and boom...
2021-04-29 19:14:08,wallstreetbets,Is CLOV expected to jump up in value?
2021-04-29 19:46:10,wallstreetbets,What is scalping?
2021-04-29 19:49:18,wallstreetbets,CLOV for life baby .
2021-04-29 18:52:01,wallstreetbets,The lord works in mysterious ways
2021-04-29 19:17:05,wallstreetbets,Should have went long on GME lol
2021-04-29 19:14:06,wallstreetbets,Sammmeee rip
2021-04-29 19:04:00,wallstreetbets,Hell yes I did.
2021-04-29 19:45:51,wallstreetbets,At least it wasn’t on weeklies could’ve been a guh
2021-04-29 19:43:00,wallstreetbets,Guess he's long CLOV now
2021-04-29 19:12:42,wallstreetbets,"It wasn't that long ago that I only had pennies in my account too. Keep at it and it'll pay off, or you'll end up homeless and addicted to cocaine."
2021-04-29 19:42:40,wallstreetbets,Good thing this was only 30k or OP would fall in your retard category
2021-04-29 18:47:50,wallstreetbets,"I mean I'm down quite a bit more on positions that I'm not worried about. I know those will come around. This wouldn't be so bad if I knew anything about CLOV, but I've done literally zero DD on it. Was just trying to scalp it for a few bucks and then it tanked lol."

2021-04-29 18:50:55,wallstreetbets,"Yea...  


VIAC just launched internationally on March 4th for Latin America, March 25th Scandinavia and their still waiting on Australia... so maybe they just need a lil time.  
Haven't looked into how much money their other segments are doing this quarter.  
\-----------  
I like HBO/AT&T but they got tons of debt, but a they could see a big overall margin increase in my mind. Lots of other parts of their business to consider.  


Another point for movies this year is online rentals for Godzilla vs Kong might have been close to box office revenues due to covid-19.   


Only U.S. gets it free on HBO and worldwide ticket sales are roughly $70 million U.S.  and $500 Million International.  


I.e. Kong made $500 million in ticket sales and another $500 million renting online (that's only 25 million people).  
 (Only U.S. gets HBO Max + Free movies, so everyone else is choking up $25.00 to rent)  


Godzilla movies generally net like $500 million in ticket sales in Japan alone and the movies is being released late there on May 14th.   


1-2 billion dollars of profit from one movie is nothing to sneeze at for a single quarter.  


 I know people who rented Mortal Kombat and bought the game as well this quarter (another AT&T). I did not, but I made the switch from Netflix so could be a big Q2 2020."

Certainly. But a nearly 50% increase in 2 months? I wish you a helluva lot of luck.

Full Disclosure: I have no holdings/options plays in NOK."
2021-04-29 18:02:36,wallstreetbets,somebody give me money so I can invest it
2021-04-29 17:05:35,wallstreetbets,This is a dumb write up. NOK is destined to hover around just like SIRI
2021-04-29 17:44:06,wallstreetbets,I’m just curious. Do people “like the stock” for $NOK? I missed my hand in GME so I’d like in on the next thing that’s cooking 😋
2021-04-29 17:03:24,wallstreetbets,I been saying this for awhile now. I have shares and $7c Jan 21 as well.
2021-04-29 17:39:51,wallstreetbets,First maybe count outstanding shares? you can buy one million shares and dont even see the chart move lol
2021-04-29 19:09:51,wallstreetbets,Wow. Thanks for the update kromkite. Nok has been undervalued since 4G
2021-04-29 18:28:41,wallstreetbets,"Good god. Nokia is dead and so is Blackberry. Fan boys need help. This isn’t 2000. I get it, their patents and tech oh it’s so great. Nope, let it go."
2021-04-29 19:11:38,wallstreetbets,I have been sitting on my shares not really paying attention to it. I’m finally in the green today !

2021-04-29 18:18:46,wallstreetbets,More like super diluted 😎
2021-04-29 19:43:46,wallstreetbets,"I would love to see Nokia making a come back in the nearest future but I believe you’re wayyyy too optimistic about 5G. Yes it will probably change internet connection like 4G did, but we’re gonna need time and a LOT of money to build the infrastructures to support the demand. If I remember correctly 5G was supposed to be installed early 2021 but we haven’t seen or heard a place where 5G is operational. For me, I can put my phone on 5G mode but the performances are the same as 4G. If I were you, I would follow my guts and see where it will take you. If you win you win, if you loose you learn. For myself I won’t buy $NOK for the moment for 3 reasons : 
1. What I said on top. 
2. Being #1 with more or less inexistant competition doesn’t mean jack
3. To double their IMO they’re gonna need more that a conversion to 5G. To put that simply they need to increase their sales. While being the backbone of an eternal meme and one of the pioneers in the Mobil industry, their competitors are way to big, more active on the market, with a marketing capital that can afford superstars and footballers...
Good luck to all investors and who knows, maybe in 5 years people will buy Nokias instead of iPhones, Samsungs, Huawei and Xiaomi 🤷🏻‍♂️"

2021-04-29 18:45:28,wallstreetbets,"I'll say it like this: $NOK being undervalued has been said around these parts for a long time.

2021-04-29 19:08:17,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, I would hope a buyback is in order with the cash on hand and given recent profits. If retarded apes like us think this way, I would hope they are thinking along the same lines too. A buyback announcement would probably boost the price too."
2021-04-29 19:04:46,wallstreetbets,"Uh, they do NOT have 100 billion shares outstanding. 

Jesus Christ, do even a little research. 

It’s in the neighborhood of 5.6 billion right now."

2021-04-29 18:28:59,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't have bought if I thought they wouldn't but honestly think Nokia needs to do some rebranding. Every time I bring them up.people make jokes about old phones and playing snake. Noone is going to buyin if they think NOK is trying to compete with AAPL and Samsung.
2021-04-29 17:24:49,wallstreetbets,"Bingo, eventually the debt is going to catch up to them.

2021-04-29 16:16:52,wallstreetbets,Good news…it will be at $12 next Friday so you can average down
2021-04-29 16:20:26,wallstreetbets,"$0.5 Million in revenue somehow sounds a lot more than $500,000 in revenue"
2021-04-29 17:42:04,wallstreetbets,Bought first call today🤡🤡🤡🤡😅
2021-04-29 18:18:26,wallstreetbets,If only it was widely reported that the earnings were  expected to drop about 49%.
2021-04-29 16:22:49,wallstreetbets,"I love how on tues night everyone was like oh yeah 50 by friday, all these big announcements, blah bla blah, and now they're all like well we knew this would happen, its a long hold, the future is bright, christ."
2021-04-29 17:56:39,wallstreetbets,I’m sooooo fucked
2021-04-29 16:19:19,wallstreetbets,Cool. Those red stock prices live in my account now. Forrrrrreevvvvvver...

2021-04-29 18:29:22,wallstreetbets,Is this the room where the noobs buy high and sell low?
2021-04-29 19:01:31,wallstreetbets,My peepee hurts
2021-04-29 16:13:42,wallstreetbets,"F

Got out at a 2k loss because I was too greedy to take a 5k profit.

Oh well."
2021-04-29 16:53:56,wallstreetbets,Getting popcorn ready for MVIS loss porn posts 😎
2021-04-29 17:48:54,wallstreetbets,Bought 50@ $0.94 a couple of years ago. I'm just going to sit here and watch.
2021-04-29 18:31:13,wallstreetbets,"EASY rule to follow:  if you might cry, DON’T buy!!"
2021-04-29 18:54:36,wallstreetbets,Should of sold when I almost doubled what I put in.
2021-04-29 16:41:36,wallstreetbets,"I probably could not have played this one worse. Bought 200 @ $10.20. Sold all at $26. Bought back some at $20 and some at $19 expecting a rally. Looking like it'll be back around $15 by tomorrow. Just end me bro.

e: just to clarify the several hundred dollar loss I can stomach, just made the entirely wrong decision which I thought was funny."
2021-04-29 18:49:32,wallstreetbets,"$200 loss isn't bad. Could have been worse, I guess."
2021-04-29 18:38:31,wallstreetbets,I was going to buy puts on MVIS when it shot up. I hesitated and didn't. It proceeds to tank. Instead I bought puts on UPS after it gapped up huge on earnings. I proceeds to rocket further. I give up.
2021-04-29 17:44:17,wallstreetbets,Told my wife today would be exciting. Yesterday i listened to all the hype about buying  MVIS. Stared at my puter screen like a squirrel  for 5 hours waiting for it to take off. Tonight i will dream about what could have been lol
2021-04-29 16:52:24,wallstreetbets,"The first line of report ""we remain on track..."" I'm doomed."
2021-04-29 17:39:44,wallstreetbets,"Dang and I  was mad when I  lost $40 bucks. After reading all this, I'm 👍"
2021-04-29 16:20:07,wallstreetbets,Still holding for the buyout 🤷‍♂️
2021-04-29 16:26:30,wallstreetbets,I'm going to unfriend my neighbor who told me to buy MVIS
2021-04-29 17:23:34,wallstreetbets,When will you guys learn that companies that develope lidar sensors won't be profitable for at least 5 years?
2021-04-29 18:58:02,wallstreetbets,"To me it sounds like the penny people are blowing it up. And posting ,”HOLD.” For the benefit of them. And that’s a fact. We don’t need threads such as ,” if your in at x dollar you are probably to late now.” Well no shit shirlock. If that’s the case. Stop posting YOLO or HOLD. Stop false persuading people into benefiting you. This whole WSB shots only be all about gains and less YOLO or loss porn."
2021-04-29 19:40:49,wallstreetbets,I am kinda confused. So from the looks they didn't sell any product this quarter and all their revenue is from licensing which over doubled. To me it seems as though this could be part of the whole chip shortage issue and their production got killed or they didn't have any product left due to it. Not entirely sure why this would change everyone's perspective on the stock.
2021-04-29 16:08:58,wallstreetbets,"My butthole hurts

edit: to be clear I’ve been watching this company for a year now, the tech is pretty fucking incredible. Butttt maybe this isn’t their time to get huge."
2021-04-29 16:40:55,wallstreetbets,"Different tune being sang on this board now lol..past 3 days it's been 'mvis to the mooooon, get in before lift off! Mvis gang! This is only the beginning!'

When will we learn 🤣🤣"
2021-04-29 19:05:26,wallstreetbets,They pushed up earnings report earlier I thought that was a great sign? Oh boy 👦

2021-04-29 19:38:00,wallstreetbets,Bought may puts on this when it was in the mid-20's...inverse wsb ftw.
2021-04-29 17:48:54,wallstreetbets,"The moment I saw MVIS taking off on here, I bet against it. Bought 100 shares at 25 and change so I could sell a stupid expensive call. Sold a 5/21 17c for 10.50 a share premium averaging me down to around 15-ish. Just closed 2x 5/21 $22p for a gain of like 2 bucks a share. Small wins, but it feels great.

Inversing WSB is a good strategy, at least for MVIS lmao"
2021-04-29 18:35:07,wallstreetbets,I’m buying more out of spite. Viva la Larry david.
2021-04-29 19:20:15,wallstreetbets,"LOL did anyone even read the earnings report?

It was good and right on track. The fact you people expected more than this is phenomenal.

Their assets quadrupled from last year this quarter, In a recession year + they had increased research among other positive factors. Their biggest downside was revenue which we never expected to be high.

You people must have smoked crack expecting this to suddenly 10× value of something already up significantly YoY.

Tl;DR: Learn to read. Thats your first issue."
2021-04-29 17:52:54,wallstreetbets,"52 employees, total revenue throughout its entire lifetime: 40m. Never made a profit. Must be worth $3bil"

2021-04-29 18:41:42,wallstreetbets,I should've sold when I made a 150% profit. Now I'm walking a way with an extra 30 buck. Blow my fucking brains out now please.

2021-04-29 17:09:55,wallstreetbets,You guys are idiots... buying into microvision was never about current revenue it’s about the future of the company and what they will provide! Get with the program

2021-04-29 16:28:06,wallstreetbets,You guys expected good earnings? When did that cause us to get out of a stock and take a loss? What the hell are you guys doing? I thought we liked the stock? Not the imaginary earnings report y’all hallucinated. Ugh.
2021-04-29 16:15:33,wallstreetbets,Damn so happy I sold yesterday at like 23
2021-04-29 16:32:32,wallstreetbets,Some of you apes are still buying at $17 lol . . . this is going back below $10 by Friday.

My average is 10.8 so dont mind helping a bit"
2021-04-29 18:32:55,wallstreetbets,Are people surprised they had no revenue? I thought this was well known and people were buying it for potential future revenue? Their cash on hand has gone up and their product dev is advancing. What’s the issue?
2021-04-29 16:12:38,wallstreetbets,Those 20 puts looking sweet!
2021-04-29 17:17:18,wallstreetbets,"So I take it there was no buyout that so many people are predicting? I’m glad I closed by $30 calls. I picked up some stock just in case, but I see it’s going down. I hope that doesn’t wipe out all my profits before the market opens again. I don’t have the ability to trade in after hours.

Edit: whatever happens, I only threw in $290 on calls, took some profits and bought 29 shares, and have about $260 in cash leftover from the trade. So I’m still overall in the green. I just wish I didn’t get greedy and instead took $2000 when I had the opportunity."
2021-04-29 17:23:57,wallstreetbets,and dump.. gg

2021-04-29 18:48:46,wallstreetbets,I took 120% profit on my MVIS calls during its initial fall. Was up the next day and thought I was a weak idiot. Now I know I’m actually a genius and subconsciously knew this was going to happen.
2021-04-29 19:35:25,wallstreetbets,Didn’t spend too much money like other ppl on this sub but lost $100 :( sold at the right time tho cause it kept going down

2021-04-29 17:09:52,wallstreetbets,"$500k sales is an absolute joke, you can make more money flipping shit from estate sales. Zero customers and just rippin through the cash pile."
2021-04-29 19:03:40,wallstreetbets,"I just read their report & sales dropped from $1.5 million to just $500k. $1.5 million total sales is already pure shit for a tech company. $500k is just plain sad. I work for one of the largest sensor companies in the world & I actually sell LiDAR devices. These guys still have a tall mountain to climb in testing & actually winning business. Getting specifications within the automotive world is VERY difficult. It's probably the second hardest industry to work with, with medical being the hardest. Lastly, every tech company on the planet markets their new gadgets as ""best in class"", etc. We do it all the time. It still doesn't mean you'll actually sell it. I don't see this going parabolic unless they actually do get a buyout. Otherwise it's not worth putting money into."
2021-04-29 16:30:53,wallstreetbets,Mvis tomorrow is going wayyyyyyyy down take your money out and run while you can ginger bread mens!
2021-04-29 16:59:05,wallstreetbets,Buy the dip. By quarter 3 they will probably have a deal in place and the stock will skyrocket. Y'all are panicking and realizing losses based on emotion.
2021-04-29 17:54:32,wallstreetbets,"People here holding for a buyout.  🤡   


500k revenue, increased losses, no notable new contracts. These guys are RIPPING through their cash reserves. If you FOMO'd dump this shit on open and do yourself a favour."

2021-04-29 16:31:42,wallstreetbets,"Again, why's everyone acting like it's a done deal? Probably gonna jinx this but the earnings call hasn't even happened yet, if it's not gonna matter can someone explain why?"

2021-04-29 16:40:07,wallstreetbets,Please keep selling it and taking losses.. drive the price down real low... make it drop to under $10/share... PLEASE!!! I need it to drop to $9.25/share to  go YOLO and become a millionaire off it...

2021-04-29 17:14:12,wallstreetbets,All you paper-hands trembling at quarterly results. We knew it wasn’t gonna be good. We’re not in it because they made money (or lack thereof) in the past quarter. We’re in it because of the potential. Ya gotta think forward-looking and think beyond a week lol
2021-04-29 18:25:46,wallstreetbets,We can get it back up.  Get ur done!!!!  MVIS ALL THE WAY!!!

2021-04-29 16:31:22,wallstreetbets,Glad I didn’t fomo into this one 🤣
2021-04-29 16:32:50,wallstreetbets,"Ayyo I knew this was gonna plummet, apparently they've sold their stock every year to make money. If it drops to 10 I might consider buying"
2021-04-29 16:50:29,wallstreetbets,I just love losing money here 🙄
2021-04-29 16:54:17,wallstreetbets,"Loading up next time MVIS sees $10.50 again

The tech is good, but at the end of the day we just here to make some money and people who bought at the peak were just kidding themselves thinking it would go higher"
2021-04-29 16:59:18,wallstreetbets,My 5/21 5Ps will print
2021-04-29 17:07:30,wallstreetbets,Not surprising. Would love it to drop below my entrance point ($11) so I can average down tomorrow but probably won’t sink that low.
2021-04-29 17:09:32,wallstreetbets,"Bought 9 for 11$, set a limit for 22$ today but a bit too late, will sell tomorrow at opening in Germany, still a bit of profit"
2021-04-29 17:14:56,wallstreetbets,Glad I didn’t fomo into this one
2021-04-29 17:16:36,wallstreetbets,"Nice call MVIS yoloers

2021-04-29 19:23:30,wallstreetbets,Ok. I’m 15in @ $26.97 a share.  Take the loss and get out now. Or just hold and forget.
2021-04-29 19:59:12,wallstreetbets,Lets see who is the biggest losser i know i dont have much in or anywhere for that matter but im down one fifty and thats alot to me
2021-04-29 19:55:34,wallstreetbets,"Ah so you bought the Full Dip then, after getting the tip in, nice."

2021-04-29 19:35:41,wallstreetbets,"Expect a spike in CLOV at opening tomorrow as millions from MVIS try to recover their losses by jumping on the next hyped stock. Remember, those that are taking losses from MVIS are the type with limited trade experience and are likely to hop on the next ""in"" stock. Ape think buy opening, sell early afternoon. Don't be greedy. This is not financial advice. I'm not a financial advisor, I'm an ape, man."

2021-04-29 18:32:40,wallstreetbets,It was / is a great stock!  But I (we) played it wrong.  I was up over $3000 at one point.   Now I'm down that much.. Not WSBs fault.
2021-04-29 17:24:28,wallstreetbets,You really had to attack me like that huh? Going for the throat on that one.
2021-04-29 18:11:49,wallstreetbets,There is only ring and it’s one true master is DFV.
2021-04-29 18:50:01,wallstreetbets,"I feel like most of the time, when I start seeing a bunch of posts about a specific stock and how much people have already made, it's too late to hop on the buy train and I'd be better off going with puts.

2021-04-29 17:04:05,wallstreetbets,Underrated comment
2021-04-29 18:00:54,wallstreetbets,Nah you just need to follow them earlier.
2021-04-29 18:41:10,wallstreetbets,Inverse next time. Still lose money. This is the way
2021-04-29 18:36:28,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately alot of people are sheep and will follow without doing alittle research first. Believe me MVIS has  a future and will fly high. But research would show  very very little revenue. New Lidar still has to go thru final testing. After all that look for partnerships to emerge, maybe a buyout, substantial revenue. Then this will climb high. Don't know how screwed you are. I got in at $17 on hype, did some reading and was able to get out at $18. Wish I had read sooner and would of gotten out at mid 20's."
2021-04-29 19:50:55,wallstreetbets,I did stoploss and thankfully didn't lose money. I do think the company has real tangible potential but it is definitely a long game and isn't going to somehow change your life over night. I really just want to quit my shit job like yesterday. I just wish I was retarded before the gme squeeze.
2021-04-29 18:13:25,wallstreetbets,"So, so true."
2021-04-29 18:56:10,wallstreetbets,"I laughed so hard, so true"
2021-04-29 19:07:03,wallstreetbets,You gotta be like Frank or Mac’s approach to the DENNIS system get in for the scraps and get out fast.
2021-04-29 16:36:01,wallstreetbets,So glad I sold that shit when I was only down 2% 🙏🏻
2021-04-29 18:39:09,wallstreetbets,God I was so close to selling at 28. Oh well. Luckily my cost basis is like 11/share.

2021-04-29 19:09:19,wallstreetbets,I'm holding 60 at $23.99. Could be a lot worse I suppose but it was still a hard hit to my starting portfolio (Jan 2021). Probably going to just slowly average down and get out at first chance.

2021-04-29 16:14:42,wallstreetbets,Same. Fucked.

2021-04-29 16:37:44,wallstreetbets,"Good move. Look, just hold the bag and carry it, don’t succumb to the pressure and sell. Why take a loss? By years end the stock will be at $40 a share or at the very least $30/$34. 

How do I know this? Doc brown told me."
2021-04-29 16:43:27,wallstreetbets,It’s at where it was about a month ago... assuming it doesn’t completely tank it should recover fairly quickly. You good home slice!

2021-04-29 16:50:08,wallstreetbets,"Reddit took *vague* rumors of a *possible* buyout as a confirmed done deal. Just waiting for final acquisition price.

There was never any actual information on any buyout whatsoever. Basically a bunch of ""charlie day in the mailroom"" posts making ridiculous speculations."
2021-04-29 18:11:30,wallstreetbets,To be fair there were a lot of people on the MVIS subreddit talking about how people shouldn't get their hopes up too high and that the call was going to be basically exactly what it was. Of course the information that trickles over to WSB always ends up being the most optimistic and exciting takes.

I lose every time."
2021-04-29 18:56:21,wallstreetbets,"Oh you could have played it worse.

Join WSB just this week, FOMO on MVIS and buy at 27.  
Same day... Realize maybe not the right move... sell at 24.50. 
Next day... buy back into the hype at 22
and again at 21.20
and today see i'm on a rocket heading the wrong way

i mean.... I'm playing it long?"
2021-04-29 18:57:04,wallstreetbets,"I did like the exact same thing. I was so excited that I finally got in on the right side of these things. Made some money, sold it at 25 and then FOMO'd back in at 20 and here we are.

Unfortunately no big loss porn for you all to enjoy, I'm just back where I started."
2021-04-29 17:58:26,wallstreetbets,"Buy 200 x $10.20 = - $2040  
Sell 200 x $26.00 = $5200 - $2040 = $3160

Buy 200 x $20.00 = -$4000 + $3160 = -$840

\-$840 / 200 = $4.2 per Share

""4.2 < 10.2""   or   ""-2040 < -840""   or   ""same Sum in Shares but $1200 more Cash""

2021-04-29 17:02:45,wallstreetbets,"Same. I'm only down $500, not the end of the world. Sitting on 100 shares. In the long run it'll come back eventually but worst case scenario, it's a red sticker on my portfolio heatmap as a reminder of a lesson learned."
2021-04-29 19:08:11,wallstreetbets,Yeah but LAZRs worth 17B. Lol. Know what and why your investing in. A lot of retards on board but anything under $20 is a good price for now

The house (almost) always wins. A $30 profit is better than 50+% losses like we're going to see tomorrow."
2021-04-29 18:48:00,wallstreetbets,I'd wait an hour or two in the morning. It's tanking in AH's right now so it should have a morning bump back up a few%.

2021-04-29 18:15:45,wallstreetbets,Then why would you buy right before earnings
2021-04-29 16:45:48,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. 

Either peeps been drinking the hedge-fund kool aid or they’re gone crazy... 

I say, continue to drive the price down with this whining... please..."

2021-04-29 18:37:12,wallstreetbets,I'm wondering this too.  I thought we were going to diamond hands this bad boy
2021-04-29 16:31:29,wallstreetbets,Careful you might get hit with the uno reverse
2021-04-29 18:16:57,wallstreetbets,"I mean tesla is at the opposite end of the spectrum with a PE ratio >1000 and people still buy it. MVIS price is based on future potential revenue/buyout, not current sales."
2021-04-29 19:17:34,wallstreetbets,Interesting background. You should post this on the mvis Reddit as they prob need to hear it.
2021-04-29 18:13:53,wallstreetbets,"Will be too late tomorrow. It's going below 10, might open there"

2021-04-29 18:38:45,wallstreetbets,"If you believe in the fundamentals of the company, then yes, you hold. If you got it to ride a meme wave that's disproportionately launching a stock high in the short term, then holding is not always a smart strategy."

2021-04-29 19:46:34,wallstreetbets,I was up 800 and when it tanked Tuesday I got out at 500 gain from a 2 day hold on a 30.00 July option.  Just need to repeat this with a lot more money.
2021-04-29 19:54:12,wallstreetbets,How would you play it?
2021-04-29 16:40:39,wallstreetbets,So glad someone has the balls. I said it before and say it again. The ones who blew this up are the ones who got in at pennys per share.  Now all of sudden it’s dead....
2021-04-29 19:09:04,wallstreetbets,"I bought in when it was 24 or 27 (cant remember) at the open. as soon as I saw it drop 2 dollars pretty quickly, I got out. I've been this before lol not gonna get burned."

2021-04-29 19:17:51,wallstreetbets,Trust me it does suck as I’ve only been trading since January and most my stuff is deep red but if you don’t sell you don’t lose and yes you can buy your way out. It will take a lot of money but can be done.

That being said, this stock will be at $40/share by years end... perfect time to buy the dip."
2021-04-29 17:13:53,wallstreetbets,WallstreetBETS is a gambling sub?! Wow
2021-04-29 19:46:06,wallstreetbets,"You could follow this sub and make money. The key is to get in early, when a stock first starts gaining hype. I mean early like the first day or 2. Take your 5% - 10% profit and dip. By the time YOLOs make it to the front page it's too late. Don't let greed and FOMO get the better of you. Ignore all ""it's gonna squeeze!!!"" and ""only paper handed bitches sell"" comments. 

It's pretty obvious HFs are using WSB. Either they directly contribute to the hype or monitor it to their advantage for the rug pull."
2021-04-29 17:28:59,wallstreetbets,i wish i had the same chances of gainz as i would at a casino

2021-04-29 16:39:39,wallstreetbets,when the day trade fails.. go long
2021-04-29 17:13:15,wallstreetbets,I agree
2021-04-29 17:29:13,wallstreetbets,"this is what i'm thinking. it's gotta hit 30 by the end of the year. have patience. looks like this one is a long hold, but it's definitely a company that is growing and is going to make money."

2021-04-29 19:10:00,wallstreetbets,“Losses” haha have you ever read a company’s balance sheet before. Man there are some retards here
2021-04-29 17:39:08,wallstreetbets,"I think there are MVIS holders that have been absolutely sure about an impending buyout for like two decades now. This thing was trading at like 40 cents a share last year. Now it's at $15-20 a share, I'm sure some Microsoft M&A team is like ""fuck yea let's buy a controlling stake now."""
2021-04-29 18:55:18,wallstreetbets,"even if there was a buy out. the price was well beyond what anyone would pay.

the company made 3 MILLION in revenue last year.... and valued at a 3-4 billion. 

forgot to buy puts a few days ago because of meetings. 

called this shit out but my  post was removed...

2021-04-29 18:14:11,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but he also says on the flip side of this, if you have confidence then be greedy when others are scared, when mvis dips people will be too scared to buy back in, and then miss out on future mooning"
2021-04-29 18:16:05,wallstreetbets,And just buy puts.
2021-04-29 18:47:37,wallstreetbets,The best ones are the ones thinking life is over because they bought 10 shares at 24

2021-04-29 16:32:47,wallstreetbets,Should I sell
2021-04-29 17:25:04,wallstreetbets,I don't have any more money to pay for drugs. Can you sesh me in.
2021-04-29 17:51:35,wallstreetbets,"Yepppp.  Sold near the peak, bought back in and lost all my gains.  Bought the dip, made a tiny bit of money, bought back in at another dip and downnnnnnnnn to -30%.  Lost all my gains and then some."
2021-04-29 17:13:08,wallstreetbets,"Down 3% ... ""End me bro"" ... maybe trading isnt his thing"

2021-04-29 18:41:09,wallstreetbets,Or buy calls
2021-04-29 17:20:45,wallstreetbets,you really think it'll take that long?! I hope we see MVIS >30 by the end of the year. maybe this summer ??
2021-04-29 17:47:46,wallstreetbets,"lol, sure man. It's going ot be at 13 by Monday."
2021-04-29 17:45:20,wallstreetbets,In 3 months
2021-04-29 19:00:02,wallstreetbets,For real imma double down
2021-04-29 19:23:15,wallstreetbets,It won’t haha.
2021-04-29 18:40:45,wallstreetbets,"I bought more shares and the AH price recently fell below $15 (last I checked), so I'm estimating my losses here. 

I'm also using USD for the share price, but once you convert the market values to CAD it looks worse. An $800 USD loss is closer to $1000 CAD for example. My broker doesn't show my losses or gains in USD, only CAD. My dollars dont buy as much and lose more lol."
2021-04-29 17:29:11,wallstreetbets,I just need him to buy like 80m shares tomorrow at open and he can do whatever he wants

2021-04-29 17:00:32,wallstreetbets,I'm jamming to this bussin' classical
2021-04-29 17:50:56,wallstreetbets,over 100% gains in less than a week seems like a pretty solid short term play to me...
2021-04-29 18:04:11,wallstreetbets,"Stock went from 10.50 to 30 in like 3 days, no short term potential?"
2021-04-29 19:21:17,wallstreetbets,"I made nearly 100% profit on it. 

People who didn't make short term gains are greedy and held on for too long."
2021-04-29 17:38:37,wallstreetbets,How’s that call working out for you?
2021-04-29 18:03:06,wallstreetbets,"I fell asleep, how did it go? Good, like you hoped and mentioned?"
2021-04-29 16:46:43,wallstreetbets,"Can’t know until tomorrow. I sold all my puts today, buying more at open tomorrow to avoid the IV dump"
2021-04-29 17:08:19,wallstreetbets,I will make money
2021-04-29 19:28:36,wallstreetbets,Yeah I'll have better luck going and throwing it all on red
2021-04-29 19:29:03,wallstreetbets,I literally just sold my 12 shares
2021-04-29 18:56:22,wallstreetbets,Hmm good point.
2021-04-29 16:52:34,wallstreetbets,"I am so confused on why the panic selling is happening, if I knew we were in this for earnings report I never would have entered. Literally done here."
2021-04-29 19:48:56,wallstreetbets,"I’m wheeling it (CSP), just bought back my $12 put and opened a new one at $17 the day before it started dropping again… My effective cost basis (and yes I know this is not real) if I get assigned will be around $13.5 so if it stays above that all apples and if not oh well I’m a shareholder!"
2021-04-29 18:05:33,wallstreetbets,that still does not justify their share price. This is a sub $5 stock
2021-04-29 16:27:35,wallstreetbets,"I feel that.  Believe me, been on your side many times."
2021-04-29 16:26:42,wallstreetbets,Congrats
2021-04-29 18:59:03,wallstreetbets,Wish I knew more about it. The buyout seemed leaked or something. Will it rebound?
2021-04-29 18:34:17,wallstreetbets,I did that to lose money on this 🤢🤮
2021-04-29 18:00:37,wallstreetbets,Ape grip strength high. Brain strength low.
2021-04-29 18:09:01,wallstreetbets,true. i'm a little in between on it.
2021-04-29 19:39:38,wallstreetbets,MVIS hit $20 at least twice so far this year
2021-04-29 19:20:46,wallstreetbets,30 bucks?! What is that a gain for ants?
2021-04-29 19:07:22,wallstreetbets,Me too hallelujah
2021-04-29 16:57:56,wallstreetbets,"The moment I saw $100 end of week price targets getting thrown around for this stock I knew it was a wrap. 

You know Warren Buffet’s rules. When you see folks getting *that* greedy, you better run for the freaking hills."
2021-04-29 17:01:10,wallstreetbets,"Lesson learned, you gotta own the stock before it becomes a meme on WSB. Otherwise you’ll lose every time"
2021-04-29 17:59:24,wallstreetbets,"Lmao, I posted several times and was in the discord:

I got in at ~13 before dips and gains. This wasn't nearly as inflated as it was when it dropped to 10. That night, everybody started posting $650k+ positions of MVIS. Next couple days shot to 31. And yeah, rest was obvious.

Anytime you guys see A LOT of spam for one thing, assume that the dump is imminent."

2021-04-29 16:46:41,wallstreetbets,"that may be, but for some people its not, especially when your first starting out. I'm not selling, not because I believe it'll bounce back tomm but because that loss won't be realized until I sell, so i guess I'll hold long term...unless that shits hits 25 again then I'm outski bitches :)"

I’m not in MVIS, so this isn’t me defending my bags. But if you’re an actual trader with conviction in a play and not just an ape who reads rocket emoji’s on the front page, you stick with your stock until your conviction changes, which should be completely unaffected by price movement."

2021-04-29 19:07:18,wallstreetbets,Never believe anything you see on reddit especially when money is at stake. And no i do not think it will personally thats why i bought puts. I think this was some hedge fund funded bullshit to bleed people for money
2021-04-29 19:38:33,wallstreetbets,Ouch bro. Take comfort in the fact that you didn't lose millions like some people. Really hard not to beat yourself up for not taking the really nice profits at $23 - $26 though.
2021-04-29 18:09:53,wallstreetbets,"I should have done the same. I got in at 14.40 and was staring at in when it hit 28 and was thinking, I should sell this off.

Trust your gut y'all. I managed to move it and still make a nice 10% but that far 50% would've been nicer. Take the easy profit."
2021-04-29 17:53:08,wallstreetbets,I said that about gme when it was 40 and tsla when it was 170 pre-split. Buffet just got lucky bro
2021-04-29 18:37:25,wallstreetbets,"So you're saying GME Gang's ""10 mil floor per share is not a meme"" is a sign?"
2021-04-29 19:01:11,wallstreetbets,I shall take this advice next time... maybe when I get Fomo I should short instead of buy 😆
2021-04-29 17:03:06,wallstreetbets,Or own it when it is first getting hyped. If it's already had a 20% run in the past week either don't fomo or buy puts lol
2021-04-29 17:04:22,wallstreetbets,"It seems like you want to get in when sub notices it and get out when they start spamming it.

2021-04-29 17:45:23,wallstreetbets,Was it ever alive is the real question.  Or propped up by WSB hype?

2021-04-29 16:42:09,wallstreetbets,thats what i tell myself
2021-04-29 17:03:35,wallstreetbets,ok doc brown
2021-04-29 19:36:16,wallstreetbets,Yes “loss” they put into operating expenses to produce a top of the line lidar in 6 months. Money they raised and can keep raising quite easily haha you must be new to investing in start ups.
2021-04-29 19:14:07,wallstreetbets,How many OS? Not trying to argue I just genuinely don't know.
2021-04-29 16:55:48,wallstreetbets,You thinks it’s gonna go up?
2021-04-29 17:19:31,wallstreetbets,Lol funny in an expensive way.. yeah thats how i usually like to see it. I havent sold.. its an overreaction and even if it doesnt go back to cost it will at least come back up a little
2021-04-29 17:52:49,wallstreetbets,I meant since close.. at the time of the comment that was true... it has since gone down much farther... much
2021-04-29 19:36:49,wallstreetbets,Never sell GME
2021-04-29 17:55:44,wallstreetbets,most people that are going to get out will have their shares sold by today or tomorrow. i'm thinking next week it'll get kinda stable if not start rising again. could be wrong tho. I know many ppl are cuting their loses and not touching this one again.
2021-04-29 18:28:01,wallstreetbets,"Because they announced this week that they have an automotive lidar sample ready for testing that, if they are to be believed, has fantastic specs. 

It could be that 17 other companies have equally good or better lidar systems, or it could be that MVIS has some patent that gives them a leg up on everyone else. 

Time will tell and I’m perfectly content to let this one ride. I got in <$2."
2021-04-29 18:39:53,wallstreetbets,You say that like people weren't buying that shit up for quick gains
2021-04-29 18:11:25,wallstreetbets,100% gains are significant regardless of amount of capital invested…
2021-04-29 17:29:19,wallstreetbets,What a dumpster fire
2021-04-29 19:27:44,wallstreetbets,Some gains were very real. They just baited everyone else.
2021-04-29 18:47:24,wallstreetbets,Got in at $10 sold at $11 thinking 10% gains were good. Watched it climb 150%
2021-04-29 19:41:30,wallstreetbets,"I skipped this run because I'm 100% diversified into GME, but rode MVIS from $10-19 twice prior and felt like a bad ass doing it."
2021-04-29 17:58:32,wallstreetbets,"Trying to equate MVIS to those two companies is just plain silly.  MVIS is looking to be acquired, no company is going to do that at $100 share price.  Probably $22-25.  The stock will not exceed that long-term.  It's a great stock to wheel."
2021-04-29 18:05:59,wallstreetbets,"I mean comparing MVIS to those is nutz in and of itself but even disregarding that, compare how often this advice tends to work with how often it doesn’t. Plus just cause something might moon after a plummet doesn’t mean you should willingly stick around to ride that plummet down.

Edit: Unless you’re carefully investing in something long. Nothing wrong with that if you trust your DD."
2021-04-29 17:11:31,wallstreetbets,Correct. I bought my puts when it was $25. I bought way OTM but I learned my lesson from GameStop. I’m learning how to play the game.
2021-04-29 17:42:29,wallstreetbets,"Yep, I learned about it last week, got in @11.2 and out @18.81. Not perfect timing, but you can profit quickly if you see the wave building."
2021-04-29 18:51:31,wallstreetbets,"When the gain screen shots start getting posted in the evening, it’s almost over."
2021-04-29 17:12:33,wallstreetbets,Buying a shit ton of FDs if it goes to ~10 again
2021-04-29 18:29:33,wallstreetbets,Lol. I learnt my lesson from GME. And I am still holding my 50 share @$250.
2021-04-29 18:28:24,wallstreetbets,Yes. You did.
2021-04-29 17:07:40,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but when you're just starting out as a young poster from Bulgaria all you see while you hold is opportunity cost.

Took me months to get over the idea that I could make up realised losses with sure bet winning trades. Even now I'll fucken do it again I'm sure."
2021-04-29 19:54:23,wallstreetbets,"This company has existed since the 90's the fuck you talking start up  


Go to yahoo finance click ""max"" on chart and tell me how healthy MVIS is."
2021-04-29 17:23:54,wallstreetbets,I'm officially a long term investor in MVIS now 😎
2021-04-29 18:19:04,wallstreetbets,Lol much further 😬😬
2021-04-29 18:32:46,wallstreetbets,"No company has as good of LiDAR product available at this time as MVIS, if the specifications on the Type A they just announced are not fraudulent. Take whatever value you want out of that"
2021-04-29 18:34:42,wallstreetbets,"Nah, there’s usually a big sell off like this after earnings. I just hope it keeps dumping tomorrow morning"
2021-04-29 18:54:11,wallstreetbets,You made profit. That’s extra $ that you did not have. Fuck YOLO and such. Do you
2021-04-29 19:02:00,wallstreetbets,MVIS w/ LAZRs Market Cap would be around $45. $22-25 is way too low.
2021-04-29 19:21:02,wallstreetbets,"Honestly I want to reply, but I really don't know what you're trying to say here"
2021-04-29 17:36:17,wallstreetbets,That's how you have to take these losses. Expensive lessons. Learn fast.
2021-04-29 18:28:51,wallstreetbets,"I did the same thing and have been getting down voted all week, who's laughing nowemote:free\_emotes\_pack:money\_face"

I still fomo in a little bit but it's just ""I'll toss a hundred bucks at it, why not"". I keep the larger plays less risky unless something seems really early or nice"
2021-04-29 18:20:51,wallstreetbets,If the shorts come out swinging it’s going below $10. I have $8 limit orders ready to go.
2021-04-29 18:39:33,wallstreetbets,Good .. dont sell.
2021-04-29 17:12:03,wallstreetbets,Until you sell for a loss then it goes back up meanwhile youre in another trade that youre also about to sell for a loss... i stick to what i started
2021-04-29 17:27:36,wallstreetbets,When the trade fails.. go long
2021-04-29 18:21:22,wallstreetbets,Lol its a yolo for a reason lol
2021-04-29 19:06:41,wallstreetbets,And this does not even include its other verticals
2021-04-29 19:22:14,wallstreetbets,I am saying that anomalies/exceptions don’t discredit a generally reliable rule. You’ll generally be better than worse off not getting too greedy with your profits .
2021-04-29 17:42:59,wallstreetbets,"I’m still net positive on GameStop after decreasing my cost basis, but my first initial buys were definitely fomo fueled lmao."
2021-04-29 19:43:28,wallstreetbets,Lmao. AH looking spicier and spicier 😂😂😂
2021-04-29 17:31:03,wallstreetbets,It’s not even about risk it’s about following a disciplined game plan. You need to be honest with your money and keep your emotions in check. I was about to buy into MVIS when it was at $14. I decided against it and made a plan to play puts for when it inevitably comes down. Now my puts are in excellent position with 3 weeks left to watch this stock crumble back down to reality.
2021-04-29 17:50:01,wallstreetbets,I see long-term value in MVIS too ... and in RKT ... and in UWM ... oh ... oh god...
2021-04-29 19:24:44,wallstreetbets,So your philosophy to investing is to sell everytime a stock performs well?
2021-04-29 17:44:59,wallstreetbets,Luckily me getting into gme early ($16!!) has allowed me to make a lot of mistakes while still being net positive. A lot of my other plays have been losses lol.
2021-04-29 17:53:13,wallstreetbets,Hes realizing it
2021-04-29 19:26:46,wallstreetbets,"Just cause a stock is doing well doesn’t mean the greed is out of control. 

Holding Google when it’s rising 100 bucks after great earnings isn’t being greedy. Getting in MVIS when it was 10 bucks last week and passing up a 28 dollar price tag in the hopes a buyout rumor knocks it up 100 by week’s end is being greedy."
2021-04-29 17:53:35,wallstreetbets,Hahaha truuuuueeeee. I had a really good play on ASO that has afforded me the same.

2021-04-29 16:48:25,wallstreetbets,All the MVIS dickriders real quiet now huh
2021-04-29 19:15:39,wallstreetbets,"I don't want to hate on CLOV but I do want to run some quick numbers because most of you won't but will buy in anyway.

CLOV's expenses are $6.8M. Their non-OPEX deprecation is around $100k. So their net total taxed expenses is around $6.7M.

They are valued at $1.5B. With $6.7M in expenses that's a pretty good ratio. Let's look at their cash flow, sales and revenue.

CLOV cash flow is -2.2M based on short term debts and selling shares to raise funds. Not great. CLOV currently has $28M in cash from selling shares and debts to pull from. Not terrible, not great.

They have $0 in sales and therefore $0 in revenue. MVIS at least had $500k in sales and that's laughable. At this rate, without issuing more shares and taking on more debt, CLOV can last 4 more years. They are making no money and spending millions. From their balance sheet alone this looks absolutely awful. Good luck everyone. I'm going to repost this tonight so more people can see it."
2021-04-29 16:13:25,wallstreetbets,RIP MVIS hope u didn’t get caught holding da bag.

2021-04-29 17:37:43,wallstreetbets,MVIS should have just lied or made up a metric to make it sound better. The fine is better than saying the revenue number out loud

2021-04-29 17:50:18,wallstreetbets,"Have you noticed that this market is SO overvalued that even companies that slaughter their earnings, like AAPL, go up after hours but down the next day (also NFLX).

The ??? is - is Amazon going to be doing the same thing tomorrow? I bought both AAPL & NFLX ah on the ER. bad move both times. Not doing it for Amazon this time, actually thinking of going short, but probably will do nothing.

Seems like a very good time just to be in cash. I guess I could short TWTR, though, It does not seem to be going anywhere good soon."

2021-04-29 16:53:45,wallstreetbets,"Why is MVIS getting so much disrespect around here?

&#x200B;

Theres an industry wide consensus among EV's and autonomous driving that LIDAR is the most practical way for us to achieve level 5 autonomy. Even skeptics like Tesla who don't use LIDAR sensors agree, Elon recently spoke out to say that he's changed his mind on LIDAR.

MVIS has by far the best in class LIDAR whether looking at lines/second, points/sec, and its one of the cheaper LIDAR sensors as well, with only a couple other products being close to the x<1000 price range. They also are the only company with a currently completed finalized LIDAR product this year(2021)"

2021-04-29 16:21:11,wallstreetbets,"I would say a good summer season stock sector to look at is the auto parts stocks like O'Reilly (ORLY), AutoZone (AZO), NAPA (GPC), etc. 

They are solid growth stocks first of all, but more importantly as COVID situation has been unwinding things like car registration has become reinstated. Also the price of used cars has been mooning in most states. These factors lead to a large increase in customers for these type of companies. 

These companies were resistant during the 2020 crash and have not yet blown up like many other sectors yet. Along with the general rise of prices on all goods this sector is probably one of the most reliable hidden gems to consider especially going in to the summer cycle of the market."

jokes aside anyone remember early 2020 when people were buying puts on national indexes and saying how big a disaster covid would be here, there, etc etc and India always came up. Somehow this place is so right so early. This isn't the only example of this pattern I've noticed. Lots of stuff that was predicted happened way later than anticipated probably because everyone involved was trying their hardest to not let it go that way. but alas"

2021-04-29 18:57:07,wallstreetbets,Sounds insane when you compare it like that. What I don’t get about mvis is the little nuggets of info people pick up and extrapolate to come up with the theory that the company will definitely be bought out
2021-04-29 16:37:09,wallstreetbets,PLTR is going to be like Facebook where everyone isn't high on it at the IPO but every year it will double in price for the next 10 years. People will be kicking themselves.

2021-04-29 16:03:28,wallstreetbets,"Could be worse.

2021-04-29 16:54:55,wallstreetbets,I suggest you read Frankenstein. It will resonate well with you right now. Seeing your own hubris unleash chaos and horror in your life and knowing you are now helpless.

2021-04-29 17:27:16,wallstreetbets,"Lol my tiny ass store does that in a year, I have 2 employees."
2021-04-29 18:56:27,wallstreetbets,"buy MVIS at the top, lose all your money.

Then you'll be forced to work and you won't need to care about what you want."
2021-04-29 18:37:05,wallstreetbets,Nah that would mean MVIS has customers
2021-04-29 17:45:49,wallstreetbets,I bet some people made more money buy and selling shares of MVIS than MVIS makes money doing whatever shit it does.

2021-04-29 16:54:40,wallstreetbets,Imagine making more money from MVIS shares than they made themselves
2021-04-29 17:35:50,wallstreetbets,That is bad revenue for a hamburger stand.
2021-04-29 17:38:22,wallstreetbets,"I'd rather have 0 revenue rather than 500k - at least that way, it would not seem like they actually tried to make money"
2021-04-29 18:04:58,wallstreetbets,"Remember how many people were asking if it was ""too late"" and the ""nahhhhhhh it's just starting you have until Thursday to get out if you're scared"" answers. Now every time it goes up half a percent we're going to be flooded with ''mooning'' and ''the squeeze is starting""."
2021-04-29 19:39:25,wallstreetbets,Still bigger than MVIS revenue
2021-04-29 19:37:10,wallstreetbets,Gotta start somewhere. I started with 10 shares of AMD 2 years ago

2021-04-29 16:21:20,wallstreetbets,"Idk, don't count your chickens until after 5pm.  That's the call that determines where this price goes tomorrow."
2021-04-29 19:19:28,wallstreetbets,It is.
2021-04-29 16:40:02,wallstreetbets,The key is to buy calls 1-2 weeks before earnings and sell the run up
2021-04-29 17:04:19,wallstreetbets,"Don't answer your phone for awhile, you maybe getting some calls."
2021-04-29 18:37:54,wallstreetbets,"Flat or down, Maybe up.

2021-04-29 18:52:23,wallstreetbets,Probably more than MVIS made Q1
2021-04-29 18:42:16,wallstreetbets,I wonder how much $ROPE will go up because of MVIS
2021-04-29 19:40:54,wallstreetbets,"Agree.  If only he married his work, perhaps then it would split."
2021-04-29 16:47:00,wallstreetbets,At least Joe made his way upwards 😆
2021-04-29 16:46:16,wallstreetbets,on a Peloton Treadmill
2021-04-29 17:55:04,wallstreetbets,I'd buy MVIS for $0.27 AT 2:30pm.
2021-04-29 18:36:12,wallstreetbets,"For there to be ""earnings"" you'd kinda need to have a ""product"" that you ""sell"" to ""customers"" ... potentially at a ""profit.""

MVIS has none of this."
2021-04-29 18:39:58,wallstreetbets,My friend bought puts and he's been missing for 4 days.

2021-04-29 16:27:33,wallstreetbets,It's a right of passage. What do you think the percentage of OGs have blown up their account more than once?

2021-04-29 19:08:44,wallstreetbets,The bots were so obvious about it too
2021-04-29 17:18:48,wallstreetbets,It's the CEO
2021-04-29 18:58:32,wallstreetbets,"So crazy how many people were telling others to get in and saying it was “just getting started” when it was around 28, already up over 100 percent in about a week. I don’t get it"
2021-04-29 16:27:19,wallstreetbets,They're sweating bullets but the call is actually gong to be really upbeat.  They overplayed their hand here and it's gonna be at least a small rip tomorrow.  Maybe more.
2021-04-29 16:55:27,wallstreetbets,dont be like me. made huge profit only to lose it all on MVIS. find something else !

2021-04-29 18:02:36,wallstreetbets,"I would hold through open. Most people can't trade after hours and when it opens at 12-13 a LOT of people who bought in that range are going to take profits while people above that position cut losses.

The company is currently priced at 9,000 times revenue (that is not a typo). It has a lot further to go."

2021-04-29 16:57:09,wallstreetbets,Wow. Sure sounds like a fantastic business and product! Can't wait to see their earnings. I'm sure a great company with a great product will exceed expectations and cause the stock to moon. When is it again?
2021-04-29 16:54:51,wallstreetbets,All I read was “I’m bagholding a flaming pile of shit and others should try and grab a falling knife like me”
2021-04-29 16:56:02,wallstreetbets,That’s crazy. MVIS puts printing tho
2021-04-29 17:02:47,wallstreetbets,Elon said on the call that vision is better than radar. Are you making shit up or???
2021-04-29 17:05:04,wallstreetbets,Google ... Does lidar work in the rain?  Then get back to me.

2021-04-29 18:32:03,wallstreetbets,We are a community with shared interests but definitely not a family. I'll sell you super OTM calls all day as long as they expire worthless and I make money.
2021-04-29 18:27:36,wallstreetbets,And some of us want to see you naked while you're in pain. Just like a real family
2021-04-29 18:32:02,wallstreetbets,SEC right here
2021-04-29 18:44:18,wallstreetbets,"It's not even $500k. And they announced on those revenues a $1.2 million employee retention program.

To recap:

1) They have no product for sale currently.
2) They have virtually no revenue
3) As a result of 1 and 2, they have no profit. Imagine that.

Somehow, still a 4 billion market cap.

My son's lemonade stand outperforms these people.

He's asking $2 billion for 12% of his company.

Where are you now Mr. Allegedly Wonderful?????"
2021-04-29 16:13:24,wallstreetbets,They just posted $15 per share vs $9 expected.  They’re forward PE decreased 50%.  I think the 5% holds
2021-04-29 17:04:12,wallstreetbets,"These expiring tomorrow! AMZN gained over 13% in last 30 days excluding the AH spike and you expected another 11% gain in a single trading day? 

Boss I play FDs a lot and still have money to play more FDs but if you continue these kind of plays then you will be out of money soon."

2021-04-29 19:05:39,wallstreetbets,Im gonna wait a while it may be overpriced but im not sure on things like share lockup expiration and the value of some of their subsidiaries either
2021-04-29 19:08:45,wallstreetbets,If you have less than $5k just play options like a madman. It's not like you can't earn it back if you fuck up.
2021-04-29 19:12:58,wallstreetbets,I am poor too!  What a small world.  We should take a hike on Broke-Ass Mountain sometime.

2021-04-29 18:25:21,wallstreetbets,It will spike hard down the road again like it always does once every month lol as well when finally bought out. Only issue is it will keep selling off big in between. I got in at 10.50 before last spike and I won’t be looking to buy back in until it’s at least down to that area again now that earnings call basically had nothing we didn’t already no about.
2021-04-29 18:47:11,wallstreetbets,Why does it look like the next big thing?
2021-04-29 17:26:36,wallstreetbets,Someone is insecure

2021-04-29 19:14:35,wallstreetbets,It had a good quarter and guided for a similar Q2. The stock has taken a beating over the last few months so nothing more to beat out of it. Should be sideways and up from here hopefully.
2021-04-29 19:13:40,wallstreetbets,NIO WILL own China. China does NOT want TSLA. They'll copy the fucking product and do it themselves without the middle man. Happens every single time.

2021-04-29 17:15:52,wallstreetbets,Nice day for you. I have a couple long holds that have actually been climbing despite the markets movements.

2021-04-29 18:44:06,wallstreetbets,I am thinking of buying when it hits $35.

2021-04-29 17:06:51,wallstreetbets,"Typically should increase the number of calls you have (or shorted) and reduce the strike in the same ratio as the split. Uneven splits are screwy though. If you have an options position affected by a split, you can call or email CBOE."

2021-04-29 19:06:28,wallstreetbets,Stop losses are your friend
2021-04-29 19:00:01,wallstreetbets,I fucking hope so.  The longer before a real sell off happens the more volume and buyers dry up and the uglier the eventual dump will be.
2021-04-29 19:20:21,wallstreetbets,"If you zoom out enough everything always goes up.

The problem is that zooming out is increasing the time frame and you're not investing for your great great grandkids.

Do you think it should be valued at 9000 x revenue valuation? Cause that's pretty close to where $14 puts it.

For perspective TESLA is at about 20x revenue, and it's the poster child for crazy valuation. You think there is a basis to value MVIS at a multiple 100 times higher than Tesla?

This should be a penny stock."

2021-04-29 19:21:31,wallstreetbets,Personally I'm thinking it dips under $14 tomorrow as people who only bought in thinking today was going to be a BO announcement sell. I'm at a $15.54 avg since March and would love to bring it down but I'm also going to keep it super long. I made my original investment back in Monday so it's all profit at this point for me
2021-04-29 19:22:43,wallstreetbets,I don't know if I would even bother touching it above a buck...
2021-04-29 19:23:11,wallstreetbets,I think tomorrow is a good time but idk if it's $14

Honestly the earnings call was bullish and they met the objectives they set out to meet on schedule but I don't think most people understood that MVIS doesn't actually make any money and that it is a longer term investment.

I bought at 12.5 and sold at 19 cause I was conservative in my estimate of how high it would go. Then I bought a put ahead of earnings. I'm going to get a pretty good return on this and it was honestly a no-brainer. Just a quick look at the fundamentals told you how over valued it was. I wish people would stop and think and maybe listen to what people are saying instead of all this ""diamond hand hold"" bullshit. That shit is costing people money that they didn't have to lose.  There was an obvious play here and this dumbshit GME meme trading robbed people of it."
2021-04-29 17:33:01,wallstreetbets,hey. this kind of genius isn't really allowed here. you don't belong here.
2021-04-29 17:33:43,wallstreetbets,"I made money on calls on the MVIS runup and now I'm making even more on puts lmfao.

If anyone managed to not make money this week they are truly lost."

2021-04-29 16:20:34,wallstreetbets,"They've raised capital and the pandemic should be their low. 

Once the CDC lowers more restrictions and we have a level of herd immunity, I imagine there's a lot of pent up excitement to see a movie in theater again. 

Just looking at the recent weeks Box Office, it was sizable and the biggest releases have been Godzilla v. KONG & Mortal Kombat.

Even without the squeeze possibility I'm thinking it'll give a good return."

2021-04-29 16:38:51,wallstreetbets,"You must be bad at math... They have 100m a week in expenses JUST to break even, maybe higher now with their dept service. Now check the weekly box office, this is for ALL movie places not just AMC, and half of this goes to the studios. Until we start seeing 500m+ weekly box office sales they are going to be losing money every week. And they are already drowning in debt. They would have to go back to 2019 numbers then add 40% just to make money. Never going to happen with the streaming options becoming so strong now.

2021-04-29 19:13:07,wallstreetbets,They had no choice as the vote was not going in their favor. They'll bring it back up next year after they've burned through the 40m shares left to sell this year and are still running huge deficits.
2021-04-29 19:11:56,wallstreetbets,I've got my AMC puts don't worry! But I play it both ways and try to ride the waves. You can make money with AMC just don't get left holding the bag when it drops to $3.

2021-04-29 16:29:08,wallstreetbets,"**HEY ALL.** **OP here.** First post after the earnings beat. Someone called me the Captain so I'm going to assume that role lol. Congrats for having the balls to hop aboard. Now the question's what we do next.

**I propose we meet back here at 10:30pm Eastern Time. I wanna take time to educate myself on the numbers etc. Also can you upvote this message so it pops to the top?**

Looks like a beat across the board. Still a couple hours left of AH so we'll see where AH ends up. At current levels our calls will be worth something like 1.5x.

**For those holding shares, my opinion (not advice) is that you should hold long term.** I know no other stock with a stronger risk/reward from here and expect it to double in 2-3 years. Very little downside. If it gets broken up by regulators, great it's worth more. If we get a Covid surprise, e-commerce & AWS will benefit.

**For those holding call options, the question's do we sell at opening bell or do we hold**. I'll be spending the next few hours digging into the numbers before I come to a decision for myself. My calls are $4000 June 4 so my initial thought is I needed a bigger beat than we got. Figured going in I'd sell anything <2% and hold anything >4% so of course I get a Goldilocks situation.

**For anyone who is in a similar boat, wanna meet here at 10:30pm Eastern Time tonight?** 

**If you wanna stay connected after all this is over then connect with me on Twitter.** I don't usually trade options tbh. Mostly focused on a long term concentrated portfolio with some swing trading on the side for fun. I'll sometimes share technical set ups and fundamental takes here. [https://twitter.com/WWSubstack](https://twitter.com/WWSubstack)

**Next week we have some interesting micro caps reporting. I'll be watching set ups, could be some good plays.**

See you later tonight and congrats on yer tendies.

As of after-hours they are printing! 

Not sure what time the conference call is, but hope they mention the split. 

They want to be listed in the Dow Average but they would have to split 15:1 or 20:1 ratio to be eligible."

Pissed off with losing so much money due to the stock manipulation and short selling assholes, so I now only go for boomer stocks.

It was further reinforced by ticker SCIR. I put about £20 into this, as it was my very first DD I did so so long ago. it's a shitty penny stock but a decent(ish) energy company in the UK.

Low and behold, for no reason whtsoever, it soared by 60% today. Im convinced parts of the market just pick a random stock to P&D it every day. Its an unregulated joke with pathetic enforcement. 

The amazon rumor is this earnings is going to be fucking nuclear in terms of how well Amazon have done.

I'm glad Bozos is finally leaving too."

2021-04-29 16:21:54,wallstreetbets,"like i said i wasn't counting on a split. The stock looked like a 5 star set up technically and fundamentally it was at least  30% undervalued and - nevermind.

We'll see what happens tomorrow."

2021-04-29 16:21:36,wallstreetbets,😆 Today is Thursday too and Spy and nasdaq hit highs... but i hope I was lucky enough that it doesn’t test that low. I held when it through dropped to 550’s and that didn’t feel too good
2021-04-29 17:05:29,wallstreetbets,Just cause the market reversed when it was at 668 does not mean that’s a resistance

2021-04-29 17:54:51,wallstreetbets,Why is that crazy? 52 shares of Amazon is a LOT more. The share price is meaningless. It could just as easily be $7 or $7000 and still have the same value.

What the fuck is wrong with you people? Take this bullshit to r/investing. THIS IS NOT WHAT WE DO"
2021-04-29 17:02:22,wallstreetbets,I haven't had a good answer on this simple question yet. Only downvotes and the standard 'stonks only go up' answer. It doesn't sound really smart yet.
2021-04-29 16:12:23,wallstreetbets,"SpaceX is not Tesla. 

Tesla won't have longterm growth.

They will hit their ceiling in the next few years I think. 
They should have had their truck on the road and also have small vans for package delivery and businesses. Then they'd be in a way better position.

Auto industry is the most difficult industry to dominate, they will not do that.

Energy market.. they're only losing money on energy market and it's hardly growing. They also won't be the biggest. As opposed to SpaceX, making cars and batteries is not rocket science and the market is big enough that other companies can just buy same R&D that Tesla did in the long term."

2021-04-29 17:02:03,wallstreetbets,If it takes them a few years to hit the ceiling then that ceiling gonna be high as fuck by then. It’s exponential.
2021-04-29 17:22:04,wallstreetbets,"They still can do dojo for growth, license their technology, mining, their rumored forbidden coin(which I can’t mention here) project, FSD (too many opportunities to mention), insurance, App Store, HVAC, potential leaf blower, and more. If tesla finishes with their vehicle goals(which they won’t) in just a few years, they can just focus more on other projects. Just like apple and amazon, they will end up coming up with new business opportunities in order to keep growing. If that doesn’t happen then they’ll do share buybacks or dividends. Wallstreet won’t let retail investors get into a fully developed Tesla for cheap. It’s not their style."

2021-04-29 14:11:21,wallstreetbets,"What in the actual fuck are you talking about? 

Are you talking about the 3 puts on BA I sold? 

If you weren’t a dipshit you would realize that’s a $75,000 play.

You people are hopeless

Edit: 14 Comment karma?? Lmao you know jack shit about options confirmed.

I’m SELLING options which requires HEAVY capital to do. I had to lock up $75,000 until those options expired. Only writing this out cause Ik ur dumbass didn’t know that and probably still doesn’t understand"
2021-04-29 17:10:53,wallstreetbets,As high as Elon at a Joe Rogan podcast
2021-04-29 18:20:44,wallstreetbets,"growing by 1% per year is also exponential. But 4 years of 1% growth isn't going to be groundbreaking.

Also, in the countries here they're exponentially declining."
2021-04-29 18:24:33,wallstreetbets,">  Just like apple and amazon, they will end up coming up with new business opportunities in order to keep growing.

Amazon was super mega focussed on one MAYBE two things, not 20 like Musk. AWS only grew because they used it for themself and then started opening it up for others. I doubt it was their original plan.

It's like someone playing basketball, golf, tennis, baseball and doing pretty well on a national level at one of them and then claiming 'like michael jordan or tiger woods, this guy is going to dominate all of the sports'"

2021-04-29 14:17:17,wallstreetbets,"No it’s not a “$75,000 Play”.  You sold Puts against $74k of stock (give or take) and could do just fine making a few bucks off of a covered positions.  

But don’t act like you YOLO’d $75K buying out of the money BA Puts"
2021-04-29 14:24:01,wallstreetbets,Not everyone has huge capital to buy options fella. Everyone has to start somewhere and just wants to be part of the gang. Calm down

Take this share bullshit to r/investing"
2021-04-29 14:19:25,wallstreetbets,"😑 The point I’m making is I put more money on the line than $35k in shares 

If the trade goes against me I am more fucked than the guy with $35k in shares 

I’m not even trying to argue about this.

My main point was posting shit about shares at WSB is stupid and not what this sub is for. Not anything to do with my own positions, which, bc they’re theta gang, I DO NOT POST IN WSB

Edit: and yes, it is a $75,000 play you idiot. If I get assigned it’s $75,000 that gets dumped into shares and even if it doesn’t $75k gets locked till I buy back or they expire worthless. I only do Cash Secured. Not naked.

It’s as much of a $75k play as this bullshit is a $35k play"
2021-04-29 14:27:20,wallstreetbets,$35k is not enough to buy options?

2021-04-29 14:24:43,wallstreetbets,"Dr. Tucker’s presentation titled, “*Vaxart oral COVID-19 vaccine; hold the ice and the needles*,” 

Next WEEK- in ashington DC- they will tell the world.  This is the  biggest story of the pandemic. To me the title of the presentation says it all:"
2021-04-29 13:26:34,wallstreetbets,"Oh good. Someone else is on this train. They're doing a webinar on Monday. Here's the article I just posted and got auto-modded for. 

The progress the United States has made against COVID-19 is imperiled by the rise of new and highly contagious virus strains. Vaxart and the scientific community are working to respond and T-cells are emerging as one potential answer to the new strain challenge. Vaxart will welcome T-cell expert Mark Davis, Ph.D., Stanford University School of Medicine, to report on the importance of T-cell immunity in COVID-19 vaccines. Dr. Davis will also discuss cross-protection against the new COVID-19 variants and future proofing against new and emerging coronaviruses. Early reports of vaccine efficacy focused on antibody production, but the ability to engage T-cells may be an important factor in determining which vaccines are most effective. Vaxart's management will provide new data comparing the T-cell responses generated from its VXA-CoV2-1 vaccine with those of other vaccines. The Company will also present new mucosal antibody data and review the recent Phase I clinical results that suggest VXA-CoV2-1 is potentially protective against new and emerging COVID-19 strains. To register for the webinar, please click here. Mark Davis, Ph.D. is the Director of the Stanford Institute for Immunology, Transplantation and Infection (ITI), a Professor of Microbiology and Immunology and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator. He received a B.A. from Johns Hopkins University and a Ph.D. from the California Institute of Technology. He later was a postdoctoral fellow and staff fellow at the Laboratory of Immunology at NIH and became a faculty member in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at Stanford University School of Medicine, where he remains today. Dr. Davis is well known for identifying many of the T-cell receptor genes, which are responsible for the ability of these cells to recognize a diverse repertoire of antigens. Other work in his laboratory pioneered studies of the biochemistry, genetics and cell biology of these molecules and T lymphocytes generally, which play a key role in orchestrating immune responses. His current research focuses on obtaining a “systems level” understanding of the human immune system. This has involved the study of the steady state and vaccine responses of old and young subjects, as well as a recent study of twins, which concluded the variation in most immune system parameters is not driven by inherited variation, but rather by environmental factors. About Vaxart Vaxart is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing a range of oral recombinant vaccines based on its proprietary delivery platform. Vaxart vaccines are designed to be administered using tablets that can be stored and shipped without refrigeration and eliminate the risk of needle-stick injury. Vaxart believes that its proprietary tablet vaccine delivery platform is suitable to deliver recombinant vaccines, positioning the Company to develop oral versions of currently marketed vaccines and to design recombinant vaccines for new indications. Its development programs currently include tablet vaccines designed to protect against coronavirus, norovirus, seasonal influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), as well as a therapeutic vaccine for human papillomavirus (HPV), Vaxart’s first immuno-oncology indication. Vaxart has filed broad domestic and international patents covering its proprietary technology and creations for oral vaccination using adenovirus and TLR3 agonists.

2021-04-29 13:17:55,wallstreetbets,In since $5.02. It's important to note if this pill works and goes to market for covid they will likely pivot back to finishing their flu pill and working on using their developments on other vaccines. Unlike other biotechs working right now the science and tech they are developing doesn't stop at covid.
2021-04-29 14:34:14,wallstreetbets,"Bro, this shit rocks. I didn’t exactly yolo into it, but I put a decent amount of money in it!!!"

Also ffs, where's the TLDR strike and expiry.  We snort crayons over here."
2021-04-29 16:27:22,wallstreetbets,"Im mainly just commenting to be able to find this post again when Im at my computer. Thank you for this, I seriously hope this comes to market and passes all the tests, as someone who had severe covid and hasnt fully gotten over it over a year later this is very much of interest. As you've obviously done a lot of reading can I ask, are there any other vaccines that come in tablet form? It seems like if this method was going to pass all the tests we would already be giving kids vaccines disguised as sweets rather than the trauma inducing needle. Seperate note, finnacially, if their key targets are places like Brazil, India etc. then I think they would end up going the ""generic"" route and India would be allowed to produce this themselves and essentially the company would make no money from it except for the R&D grants etc. Perhaps they have a patent on the way of delivering vaccines not just the vaccine itself? hm. Im going to read about this tomorrow."
2021-04-29 17:52:41,wallstreetbets,I looked into this earlier this week. Il buy in tomorrow

This Stock has great long position potential, as stated it is being Largely shorted so I expect the media to try and discourage investing in the stock or undermine the Vaxart oral Vaccine."

2021-04-29 17:51:19,wallstreetbets,"I'm in.   
  

1040 shares LFG squeeze these fucktards who short a vaccine in a pandemic lol"
2021-04-29 19:46:03,wallstreetbets,"Everyone in here seems to love the post or not know wtf is going on so Bear case time: 

They haven't actually published any data yet.  They've only just finished collecting phase 1 trials but results have yet to be released.  [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT04563702](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT04563702)

They're many months if not years away from producing a marketable product. They still have phase 2 and 3 trials coming up.  In that time a lot can happen...

US is on track to be fully vaccinated by June/July of this year.  Many areas already have more supply than demand at this time.  Will the FDA approval be for primary prevention or for boosters as variants develop?  These are 2 very different approvals and will likely require additional testing to get approval for the latter case, which other FDA approved products are already in the works on. 

If the market they are targeting is not US then how are they going to price the product?  The US is already donating doses to close trade partners and allies.  These countries are getting these for free if not at huge discount... Don't think they'll be willing to pay much for alternative agent even if it does have positive results and easier method of distribution.

If this method of administration is so effective and ground breaking why do they have no FDA approved products?  I feel like this is the biggest issue.  There's no track record to prove this will work at all.  A lot of alternative vaccine products have been made in past but they rarely succeed. Flumist is a great example of ""ground breaking"" that got around the needle issue.  But that was discontinued years ago due to disappointing results with different variants.  There's a reason vaccines are all injectables with a few exceptions.  Rotavirus vaccine is only oral agent and it works because of nature of the disease.

Best case scenario is all these issues cause minimal disruption.  The product becomes a go to for annual booster shots and they are able to market it to develop nations who can actually pay them.  Even in this case they wouldn't see any major earnings for at least a year (assuming current vaccines protect individuals only for 1 year).  

not financial advice but if you want to play it, short the inevitable run ups every time they have press release or sell covered calls if you're a long term holder.  Inovio is in similar boat.  Just look at their price movement and press releases."
2021-04-29 14:28:02,wallstreetbets,Let’s go 🚀

2021-04-29 15:23:26,wallstreetbets,Do you think those catalysts got priced in last week? What caused that run up if it wasn't this?
2021-04-29 15:31:32,wallstreetbets,Damn it's already up 9%
2021-04-29 15:45:36,wallstreetbets,"Will there be much of a market for Covid vaccines when it has the potential to launch?  That would be what mid 2022 at the earliest?

2021-04-29 17:24:47,wallstreetbets,FYI...the same technical setup when it hit $25 in Feb. Exact same chart. Stock sold off because investors don't understand the immune system. From what I have read they have something potentially big.
2021-04-29 17:25:35,wallstreetbets,But can they put a 5G chip in an oral vaccine ?

2021-04-29 17:30:38,wallstreetbets,"Good results with flu tablets are great for a long-term value play... but tbh I'm not convinced this'll boom with Covid.

Maybe they'll immediately replicate the same success with JnJ's Covid antigen (Which is hardly guaranteed, oral vaccines are *hard*), but what makes you think this will be widely adopted? Yes, it's better... but factories have been assigned and nation-level contracts signed for Moderna, Pfizer and AZ.

Even if they produced it without any of the key ingredients that are now bottlenecking the EU and Indian vaccine programs, why exactly would governments spend more when they already have a 'good enough' solution in the pipeline that for now is rather likely to arrive earlier? With Warp Speed being done and having produced effective vaccines, it seems rather unlikely they can get through testing at anywhere near the same kind of speeds we saw with the big names.

Oral vaccines are absolutely superior in every way in the long run, but I'm sceptical about their ability to still catch the Covid train."
2021-04-29 18:01:11,wallstreetbets,"I wonder why some OCGN long investor who knows his shit decided to be bearish on this stock. Anyone knows why?

Did some digging, his argument: ' I read the literature after the phase 1 trial of the holy fail, how  anybody is allowing it to go into phase 2 with basically no immunogenicity is mind blowing '

Hmm I wonder how these oral vaccines do honestly also I wonder why this stock months ago was trading at 25 dollars before being dumped on."

2021-04-29 16:39:59,wallstreetbets,"Not sure if this is listed in the comments already; too many to read through... But Cuba has developed the same model for their COVID vaccination program. And they’re planning to export the majority of their production. The only major drawback to the recombinant pills is that it takes much longer to produce the same yield compared to the jabs. The rollout will likely be a bit slower than the other brands. Plus, they still have to do a phase 2 trial for FDA emergency use authorization.
I can see this being a useful product in the fight against the pandemic, but it may not yield short term results. As well, the bulk of sales will likely be from exports as demand for US vaccinations has been declining."

Researchers believe the antibodies play an important role in defending cells against the virus. The company said it is now assessing antibody responses from second doses after antibodies were detected in nasal swab samples of two-dose volunteers.

Sounds like a lot is still unknown about it and it hasn't even completed all trials.

>""The immune response is multifaceted,"" he said, adding that one aspect of the immune response is creating antibodies, in particular neutralizing antibodies. ""While it's great to see that there appears to be a decent T-cell response, the lack of antibodies detected is problematic and may reduce the effectiveness of this as a vaccine."""

2021-04-29 13:20:50,wallstreetbets,If everything goes well with the 3 events happening next week its a conservative bet that it hits $20 by the 6th but im in it for the long haul. It's gone up 50% this week just on the news of what's happening next week when they reveal their data.
2021-04-29 13:49:32,wallstreetbets,I bought back in at $9. The horrifyingly bad press at Phase 1 press release drove it to 24 bucks. Hopefully they do better this time.

2021-04-29 17:39:19,wallstreetbets,"Well...in my opinion, the shots aren't good enough whatsoever. You can still get covid, but it's ""good enough"" because you most likely won't die. What if we could prevent it in the first place? 

CNBC released an article last month on how new vaccines may rush through the clinical trials. Also, India is largely dense. You can't social distance at all. If you can't social distance, but you can still ""get it"", you're just transmitting it to and from, running the risk of the variants adapting over time to the spike proteins. What if we wiped it all out together? I agree its hard, but this is not even first mover territory, we're still in the innovation part of the technology curve."

2021-04-29 15:31:46,wallstreetbets,A big thing missing from peoples DD is the ties to Richetti the lobbyist and his brother in the Biden Administration. They have yet to receive funding and was one of the 8 for OWS studies. I believe with the data coming out we will see funding before July.

2021-04-29 17:21:39,wallstreetbets,It’ll be interesting to see how this all plays out. India’s Serum Institute (which supplies and manufactures 60% of the world’s vaccines) has already announced delays due to increased demand. Combine that with the issue of the AstraZeneca blood clots it makes a perfect storm for other (non vaccine) drugs. This plays out perfectly for companies like MGC pharma too who completed Phase II trials of Artemic with 100% success and have already started phase III.
2021-04-29 14:59:33,wallstreetbets,"Let's be honest here. People only understand antibodies because they are easy. T-cell response is so fucking nuanced. Explaining the fact that their multiple different types of t-cells and multiple subtypes is impossible (trust me I teach a class that included vaccine development). They are trying to do this with the Stanford expert. However, the best thing they can do is show that it is better. For now it is calls and shares for me."

Do you plan on holding your short positions and hoping for the best (Well, worst for the country, best for you), or have you already, or are you at least planning to sell your short positions if things continue to improve for the South African Stock Market and economy?

Also, to other investors, do you think that he has made a huge blunder with his decision, or do you think he should hold as he made a possibly good decision?"

Since Tencent eventually became the most valuable chinese company by market cap, the value of Naspers stake grew larger than the value of the company itself, creating a big problem. They recently sold 2% of their Tencent stock via their holding Prosus for 14.7 bn$, making it the second biggest block trade in history."

Edit:
Also all the mineral rich countries like Botswana (Diamonds), Zimbabwe (Gold, Diamonds, Platinum), Zambia (copper) to the north of South Africa are serviced by companies based in South Africa.

2021-04-29 12:06:50,wallstreetbets,"No, that's Zimbabwe like, 30 years ago. There is a problem with farm murders in South Africa, but it's not race specific. It's just that white farm murders get more attention than black farm murders because whites are a minority in the country, so it looks like it's disproportionately affecting white farmers, whereas it's actually just a problem for farmers overall. Although, even then it's not quite as bad as it's made out to be. A problem yes, but slightly blown out of proportion"

I'm not disagreeing with you per se but the last couple of years I've been learning a bit about modern civil war. It's usually asymmetric and sporadic, drawn out with little flare-ups. Also there are rarely only two sides anymore.

Sometimes entire towns and cities go unaffected while entire regime changing wars are fought.

Through several lenses of understanding it is possible to argue that the United States itself has in fact been in a state of modern civil war for a couple of decades at least, with it nearly boiling over several times in the last couple of years but remaining asymmetric and random for now."

2021-04-29 16:13:56,wallstreetbets,">I despise affirmative action, but support uplifting people based on economic circumstances.

What if your circumstances is that you have grandparents/great-grandparents who are owed several lifetimes worth of back pay on the basis that they were owned as human property and never compensated, and there's a history of discriminatory laws based on making it hard for you to vote, work, buy real estate and hold on to wealth?"
2021-04-29 13:17:58,wallstreetbets,"Oh, no. I'm just not a racist who wants apartheid back.
I have many criticisms of the current government. A lot of them, but, I also understand the problems that South Africa has, as well as the road forward to solve these problems. And having an impoverished majority that's impoverished because they were oppressed by a governmental system that was designed to keep them poor and oppressed, that's not good for a country, so, something needs to be done to uplift that majority after the oppressive government is dismantled"
2021-04-29 17:57:29,wallstreetbets,"But Australia didn't do any better by their indigenous population.

We've just exploited them as much as was possible and have turned now to directly exploiting the land. There's more factors to how much wealth you can squeeze out of a place than what the serfs would or would not be doing without you.

Honestly, if any debt is owed its still towards the indigenous populations of each continent. And that's just in sweat equity. I haven't run the numbers on bloodshed but again there we're the bagholders if we stick around long enough.

Edit: just playing the thought experiment forward. This is not how I personally think about imperialism."
2021-04-29 13:28:51,wallstreetbets,That’s an incredible piece of analysis bud. Especially if you consider that for 125 years of the period you mentioned was spent wasting resources on oppressing the indigenous population rather than uplifting them. We owe settlers fuck all and if anything they owe us because off the gold and other resource they robbed from our beautiful country over the last 150 years.

This motherfucker shot too teenagers to death then went on to teach kids for the rest of the day like it was nothing and a few years later his colleague is telling me the story in Australia like it was *cool*, even at 16 I thought she was fucked in the head.

My sister has kids by another saffa, he's okay just genuinely traumatised from some shit he experienced during the fall of apartheid. Brain damaged and nearly killed during a home invasion when he was just a child. Needless to say he also has some sketchy ideas about race.

Boris just did up his house on tax payers money. The government there Paid £100+ mill to 16 politically connected businesspeople for PPE contracts when Covid started when nothing was ever delivered. To think corruption is a uniquely South African issues is the same as pretending the sky is orange, it’s silly. 

I’m not condoning corruption by any means. Zuma and his cronies need to rot in jail. It’s just typically the argument that gets thrown out there when people want to bash a county. If you thought that, 25 odd years after democracy that SA would be perfect then you’re smoking way too much Durban Poison. It’s going to be a struggle to get on the ideal road for SA but you know what... I’m fucking bullish!"
2021-04-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why I think UWMC will have a pretty good rise next week My first DD-ish post so I apologize in advance.  For transparency I am holding 600 shares @ $8.46.  I'm not good with flashy images and emojis so I'll just do a old fashioned SWOT

&#x200B;

**UWM Holdings Corporation**

**Strengths:**

* Largest mortgage wholesale lender in the US for last 6 years
* Closes loans faster then any competitor
* Year after year loan volume is on huge increase.  $31.9b Q4 19 ->  $54.6b Q4 20
* Year after year income also impressive.  $149m Q4 19 -> $1.37b Q4 20

&#x200B;

**Weaknesses:**

* Low interest rates.  Higher rates are good for the mortgage companies and with JPow speaking yesterday rates are looking to stay at all time lows
* Direct competitor is RKT which has better advertising/word of mouth
* Share dilution - 1.56b outstanding however [CEO owns 94%](https://www.mpamag.com/news/united-wholesale-mortgage-is-going-public-234371.aspx) so technically 90m are available.

&#x200B;

**Opportunities:**

* Interest rates are going to go up, not a if but when, which will lead to higher profits combined with a housing market that is booming in the US
* Possible inclusion in the Russel on May 7th
* Earnings announcement is on May 10th.
* They have a huge cash stash allowing them to get into other mortgage types, like Jumbo loans, which they [started doing in March](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210317005599/en/) that should add more revenue
* Per the National Association of Realtors: ""Existing-home sales are projected to rise by 10% in 2021 to reach 6.2 million in 2021, while the median home price is anticipated to increase by 9% in 2021 to $323,900. "" - UWMC, RKT, and others should all benefit from this.

&#x200B;

**Threats:**

* Interest rates dropping further so less profit for mortgage companies on interest (Note: Some people consider this a opportunity as it might allow more people to borrow/buy houses)
* Shorts have been keeping the price down.  [Shorted about 18%](https://fintel.io/ss/us/uwmc)
* They are facing a potential class action lawsuit due to them giving some lenders a ultimatum saying you can only work with us and not RKT/others at the same time.  UWM says its baseless and will fight it. 

&#x200B;

Summary:  The companies financials look promising and with the housing market at where it is I can't see them missing earnings.  Looking for a nice bump next week before the report.  Also the companies Director  [Verdun Robert](https://finviz.com/insidertrading.ashx?oc=1841894&tc=7)  recently bought 60k shares when it dipped in March which to me usually means they believe in what they are doing and believe the price is low.  The lawsuit may or may not be anything.

Also they pay dividends, about 5%, so they are not only a short term buy in preparation for Russel/Earnings but could be a good long term hold.  Current price target is $11.

&#x200B;

2021-04-29 11:41:14,wallstreetbets,How would a drop in interest rates be a threat? Low interest rates lead to more refinancing which is more business for UWMC.
2021-04-29 13:22:34,wallstreetbets,Doing good today in this red sea. Good sign!
2021-04-29 16:57:22,wallstreetbets,"Dude. They make money on origination and mortgage servicing rights. Mortgage interest rates don’t directly impact their revenue the way you imply. Rising rates will protect mortgage servicing income (by reducing runoff because people won’t refi as much), but reduce origination income (because people won’t refi, and higher rates put downward pressure on housing prices). Lower rates have the inverse effect (more origination, more runoff)."

Since then, the flow of loans coming in has slowed down while I have heard reports that Rocket and many other lenders have be having increased loan flow."

Conventional loans 2019 to 2020 fell from 49m to 42m( thousands).Their refi was up close to 200% from 43m to 119m. I know rates will stay low but I think the rate of refinance will drop.

2021-04-29 17:00:18,wallstreetbets,"Counter argument, UWM lost customers during the battle with Rocket. They also had to lower their rates and margin to hold onto current clients.  The reason their underwriting turn times are just a few hours means they are very over staffed.  Profit margins will be much lower when they are announced."

2021-04-29 16:36:59,wallstreetbets,"Be depressed not.

2021-04-29 11:35:44,wallstreetbets,"That's fair.  I'll try to be more ""Buy it now before its too late!"" with the next one I do."

UWM is interesting. They are aggressive and want to beat Rocket due to a personal fued between the CEOs. They've had a fist-fight, they get in passing contests, and it's just awesome. Curious to see how the stock performs in light of this classic action suit.

EDIT for words"
2021-04-29 15:13:07,wallstreetbets,I'm in roughly the same position.
2021-04-29 15:05:11,wallstreetbets,😑
2021-04-29 17:38:48,wallstreetbets,I think you've got a winner; hard to lose with the 7.5c on this one. This isn't likely to move like crazy (that's why the options are cheap) but the risk is very low. The 9 and 10 strikes are a gamble.
2021-04-29 11:32:21,wallstreetbets,"Only 90 million on the market and half is available to trade, so it has a pretty low float Andy time it gets high volume in a short period of time it spikes straight up."

YES YOU

where the fuck were you with this comment like 3 hours ago... and don't say fucking my girlfriend because she only cheats on me with black guys😛"
2021-04-29 15:35:56,wallstreetbets,"Except that Ishbia went on Mad Money and said on national TV that fewer than 500 of the 12,000 brokers they were partnered with chose to stick with Rocket or Fairway. The reality is, many of them never used Rocket or Fairway anyway. But the point is, the vast majority of their partners stuck with them because they have better rates and 1/2 the time to close a loan than Rocket and 1/3 the time of the rest of the industry. Most of Q1 will be pre-ultimatum so it's really Q2 that will be the litmus test for how it's going."
2021-04-29 14:56:58,wallstreetbets,"Not sure about where you live but two houses in my development sold for 20% over what they bought them for 6 years ago.  Both within 3 days of listing.  There are new developments going up everywhere and lots are sold within weeks.

2021-04-29 17:48:25,wallstreetbets,My company only sent to QL and UWM. We chose QL. They lost about $100 million a month from my tiny little broker alone.
2021-04-29 13:00:27,wallstreetbets,Lol I thought mine was the top
2021-04-29 16:15:36,wallstreetbets,"I don't think it will be a MVIS, personally, but I do think it's going to go up.  There are three potential scenarios I see:

* Buy for a bump before earnings/possible Russel inclusion
* Buy for long term ($11 current target, $18 end of year, + \~5% dividends)
* Buy and hope for a squeeze with the 18% short float

I'm debating between the first two as I don't think it will squeeze although anything is possible if enough of WSB's gets on it."
2021-04-29 14:49:20,wallstreetbets,Maybe i made a couple thousand already before it dropped today for so long then backed out and bought in again around 20 to see if i can get a bit more
2021-04-29 13:57:39,wallstreetbets,Also more rocket emojis if you want to fit into WSB
2021-04-29 12:02:29,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure the margin stays the same, that’s why it’s called a margin.

2021-04-29 11:48:02,wallstreetbets,"Yeah lower interests is not a negative for uwmc it’s a positive, just because it lower doesn’t mean they will accept shitty loans"
2021-04-29 11:45:48,wallstreetbets,I disagree. Higher interest rates mean housing prices go down - fewer mortgages and less profit. And more renters.
2021-04-29 13:21:40,wallstreetbets,I actually have a semi-formed theory that someone or someones are hoarding inventory but we'll see. Not sure pandemic economics explains it.
2021-04-29 15:40:55,wallstreetbets,lol fair but hey maybe it's the hot new squeeze I don't really see it many other places!
2021-04-29 11:52:34,wallstreetbets,Oh ok that sounds better
2021-04-29 11:54:06,wallstreetbets,I've been looking for this but couldn't find anything other then the 1.5 number.  Source so I can add it?
2021-04-29 13:48:28,wallstreetbets,He still has that BDE your girlfriend doesn’t get from you
2021-04-29 15:46:41,wallstreetbets,"If the 500/12000 thing is correct, then we’re is the lead flow? I know many people that work there and they have all said that there is not enough lead flow in the pipeline to match what Mat Ishbia is insinuating. 

I mean at the end of the day, only time will tell if he was correct or not. I personally don’t believe that many brokers stayed on board, especially since the whole point of going with a broker is....CHOICE."
2021-04-29 15:01:17,wallstreetbets,Cool thanks for answering
2021-04-29 12:52:48,wallstreetbets,"Sorry but lost me at ""my"""
2021-04-29 19:50:14,wallstreetbets,But didn't they gain much more if their numbers are correct that 90% brokers chose them?
2021-04-29 14:51:30,wallstreetbets,Nice happy for you on the gains. If I had more money I’d be buying $18-20 calls on MVIS I feel like this drop is temporary but I’m also retarded so 🤷🏻‍♂️
2021-04-29 13:59:27,wallstreetbets,Done!
2021-04-29 15:35:23,wallstreetbets,"It depends on if the loan is being serviced by UWM or sold to a GSE. If Fannie is paying 106 for a coupon, and UWM sells it at 104, then they can sell to Fannie for 2% margin. If UWM services the loan themselves, then they paid 104 out and will get that back over time. When servicing, the interest rate comes into play on profitability. Super simplized version"
2021-04-29 16:43:50,wallstreetbets,"You are correct, OP is not.

Per loan profit margin operates independent of rates. Loans are sold shortly after they are funded, but UWM currently retains the servicing. 

But lower rates means more refi activity."
2021-04-29 12:00:54,wallstreetbets,"I get where you are coming from but I also have bought houses at 2.875, 4.25, and 7.185 (last one hurt...).  If someone wants a house and the interest rates go up 0.5% they are still going to want a house.  I get that it will price some people out but, at least right now, the US economy seems to be steamrolling ahead.  They will pay the extra 0.5% and the mortgage companies are going to have higher profits even on lower volume."
2021-04-29 13:24:04,wallstreetbets,"Pre-pandemic, we were running in a shortage environment. The demographics also show more Fist Time Home Buyers (FTHB) coming into the market in 2021, 2022, and 2023. 

Couple that with a move away from cities due to perceived increase in violence and/or the lack of need to live near your workplace anymore."
2021-04-29 11:54:57,wallstreetbets,CEO owns 94% of the shares
2021-04-29 16:56:28,wallstreetbets,They aren't being exclusive. You can go with any company you want as long as it isn't Rocket/Fairway. They will likely try to steal the customer anyway. Several brokers over on the UWMCshareholders subreddit said they love them and use them all the time.
2021-04-29 19:55:11,wallstreetbets,"Yeah… about those numbers. It’s simply not possible. There’s no proof obviously, we’ll see as time goes on. If that’s true you can expect UWM’s numbers to be fantastic and RKT’s to significantly decrease. Have a feeling that won’t happen so we’ll see"
2021-04-29 14:57:42,wallstreetbets,Thats why im not all the way out... Especially since it was able to hit 29$ after starting at 20$ to make quite a bit of money. But at the same time i think its going to hang around for a bit at this 18-20 area for possibly a couple weeks
2021-04-29 14:07:52,wallstreetbets,I was already in for thousands of shares of hundreds of calls. But this DD with rockets provides me much comfort.
2021-04-29 12:29:22,wallstreetbets,I agree. Im waiting for a better selection of houses to come available to buy regardless of what interest rate it is im still buying a new place i have friends that are realtors and friends looking to buy and none of them are worried about the rates stopping them
2021-04-29 13:47:46,wallstreetbets,How many houses do you have? I guess I should start listening to you but I’m already in @7.12
2021-04-29 17:41:12,wallstreetbets,"I don't disagree, but the paranoid conspiracy theorist in me has a slightly more malevolent explanation that involves all the ""we'll estimate your home and make an offer right now"" sites sitting on inventory they've bought up."

2021-04-29 16:22:30,wallstreetbets,Same tbh
2021-04-29 13:56:58,wallstreetbets,Just one.  The 7% interest was back in the late 90s.
2021-04-29 17:49:00,wallstreetbets,"They definitely could be. But to what end? The homed for sale now are going like crazy with ridiculous stipulations (waived appraisals, waived inspections, leaseback, cash over appraisal offers, non-refundable earnest money, etc.).

&#x200B;

Facebook's collects the users' data so the engagement algo can use it to learn things about you. Then it must determine what you are most likely to engage with, and it tries to show you that. 

This is self reinforcing on the users behavior. So theoretically, so long as human psychology ***never ever changes*** the way we decide to browse click on things, facebook's business model will last forever...

&#x200B;

Their Risks related to product offerings

""*...Substantially all of our revenue is currently generated from third parties advertising on Facebook and Instagram. As is common in the industry, our marketers do not have long-term advertising commitments with us. Many of our marketers spend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us. Marketers will not continue to do business with us, or they will reduce the budgets they are willing to commit to us, if we do not deliver ads in an effective manner, or if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives. We have implemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads, which has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. If we are unable to provide marketers with a suitable return on investment, the pricing of our ads may not increase, or may decline, in which case our revenue and financial results may be harmed. Our advertising revenue can also be adversely affected by a number of other factors, including:*

&#x200B;

* *decreases in user engagement, including time spent on      our products;*
* *our inability to continue to increase user access to      and engagement with our products;*
* *product changes or inventory management decisions we      may make that change the size, format, frequency, or relative prominence      of ads displayed on our products or of other unpaid content shared by      marketers on our products;*
* *our inability to maintain or increase marketer demand,      the pricing of our ads, or both*
* *our inability to maintain or increase the quantity or      quality of ads shown to users;*
* *changes to third-party policies that limit our ability      to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising, including      changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such as Apple and      Google;*
* *adverse government actions or legislative, regulatory,      or other legal developments relating to advertising, including      developments that may impact our ability to deliver, target, or measure      the effectiveness of advertising;*
* *user behavior or product changes that may reduce      traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize, including      as a result of increased usage of the Stories format or our messaging      products;*
* *reductions of advertising by marketers due to our      efforts to implement or enforce advertising policies that protect the      security and integrity of our platform;*
* *the availability, accuracy, utility, and security of      analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third parties that      demonstrate the value of our ads to marketers, or our ability to further      improve such tools;*
* *loss of advertising market share to our competitors,      including if prices to purchase our ads increase or if competitors offer      lower priced, more integrated, or otherwise more effective products;*
* *limitations on our ability to operate material portions      of our business in Europe as a result of European regulators, courts, or      legislative bodies determining that our reliance on SCCs or other legal      bases we rely upon to transfer user data from the European Union to the      United States is invalid;*
* *changes in our marketing and sales or other operations      that we are required to or elect to make as a result of risks related to      complying with foreign laws or regulatory requirements or other government      actions;* 
* *decisions by marketers to reduce their advertising as a      result of adverse media reports or other negative publicity involving us,      our user data practices, our advertising metrics or tools, content on our      products, our efforts to implement or enforce policies relating to content      on our products (including as a result of decisions or recommendations      from the independent Oversight Board), developers with mobile and web      applications that are integrated with our products, or other companies in      our industry;* 
* *reductions of advertising by marketers due to      objectionable content made available on our products by third parties,      questions about our user data practices, concerns about brand safety or      potential legal liability, or uncertainty regarding their own legal and      compliance obligations (for example, a number of marketers announced that      they paused advertising with us in July 2020 due to concerns about content      on our products);* 
* *the effectiveness of our ad targeting or degree to      which users opt out of the use of data for ads, including as a result of      product changes and controls that we have implemented or may implement in      the future in connection with the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, California      Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), other laws, regulations, or regulatory      actions, or otherwise, that impact our ability to use data for advertising      purposes;* 
* *the degree to which users cease or reduce the number of      times they engage with our ads;*

\-FACEBOOK 10K (01/28/21) ITEM II - RISK FACTORS - quote on pages 15-16 - direct quote

&#x200B;

Overall it seems pretty obvious that their are two major risks...

* loss of users or;
* loss of advertisers

&#x200B;

**The Black Swan Event waiting to happen...**

I believe there is an underestimated 3rd risk factor, where user's deliberately inject false data signals in the form of ad engagement specifically to hurt Facebook in protest... **User Rebellion**. One viral trend that could destroy their ability to monetize.

There is no shortage of reasons for people to hate facebook...if you fall to either side of the political spectrum facebook has done something to piss you off.

If you believe in people's right to privacy, or simply don't think one corp should have a monopoly on everyone's private information. **By and large everyone one hates Facebook for one reason or another.**

&#x200B;

**How hard would it be for users to scare off advertisers?**

But as I discussed above facebook can only monetize ***if they can identify useful data signals for targeted ads and posts.*** So

So how long until facebook users collectively flood them with worthless engagement to deliberately destroy their business?

1. someone posts a video clicking every ad on facebook or instagram, with a catchy hashtag like #DownTheAlgo or #GaslitEngagement

2. other people see it, do the same

3. advertisers see a social media trend that will wipe out their ad budget and they take their money off facebook

4. a ""user rebellion"" could cripple their ability to monetize and force them to find new revenue streams

People just have to make it clear ""if you do business with facebook, you won't get your money's worth""

It's my opinion that facebook is a house of cards, just waiting for a light breeze to knock it down to book value.

**Ethics...**

Since this is obviously an activist stance of sorts, I’ll clearly state how I interpret the ethics of this situation, and why it is “fair game”.  People often judge other’s actions either by their motives, the means they used, or the consequence. Consequence can only be determined after the fact, but to be safe I will cover both motive and means. For one, this isn't me doing it. I am stating a possibility, and if others do it, that is the real cause, because my sharing this risk does not guarantee it comes to fruition. 

&#x200B;

The Motives

&#x200B;

1. Engagement algorithms

a. Trying to manipulate people’s behavior without telling them how, I believe to be the equivalent of running a mass psychological experiment with zero informed consent. This goes against so many ethical guidelines, and just because it’s a AI playing with people’s psychology instead of human’s doesn’t make it any better. 

b. To scare off advertisers all you have to do is make them think everyone is clicking. If facebook didn’t want us to engage with every single ad, they shouldn’t have done such a good job designing it for that exact purpose…

&#x200B;

2. Monopolizing private information and internet speech

a. They have no consistency an due process in an industry that really is many people’s only chance to have a voice.

b. if some viral trend gets people to do this, they are effectively voting Facebook out of business with each click. By design, this only works if the users collectively hit back. 

c. They clearly conned everyone into giving up a valuable resource for free(all your data)…we don’t have to give them a permanent monopoly on it. They are tracking you. You can misdirect their trackers… so game on

&#x200B;

The Means

1. Means must stay above board for anyone who engages

a. This isn’t just a legal thing, it’s strategic. Facebook can tell if you use bots to click every ad and they will ban and that gets the person doing it in trouble

b. However their whole site is designed to get people to engage with ads. So average people…they can’t do anything if they choose to click every ad and by nothing

2. It’s democratic

a. I said above this only works if already active users start flooding them with worthless engagement

b. if some viral trend gets people to do this, they are effectively voting Facebook out of business with each click. By design, this only works if the users collectively hit back. 

3. It’s exactly what their whole platform is designed to make you do…engage with ads. If it can't handle exactly what it was manipulating us to do, that's on them.

a. Totally self explanatory

b. Literally the entire platform exists to make users click on ads…so if clicking on ads to much can cause advertisers to lose value and leave, that’s on them…users were just doing what Facebook tried to manipulate them into doing

Now that I've explained why I see both the motive and means as ethical, I see no reason why people won't engage in such a form of protest. It's easy and it make's sense.

&#x200B;

Disclosure - I've been weighing into puts. I'll be shifting positions going into this trade over the next couple days/weeks. For now I'll say I am/we are short FB. and will update my positions when I've finished entering them."
2021-04-29 16:23:29,wallstreetbets,"This would bring down targeted adversitising. FB will quickly lower prices and normal general advertising will continue. A trend like this is unlikely to last more than a week. Its not a viable strategy to cripple FB. The people who participate in this trend can quickly be recognised by FB's machine learning suite and targeted for more general advertising. People who do not participate in this trend will continue to receive targeted advertising. This 'black swan' event does not exist. Apple's new privacy update does severly hurt their targeted ads practices, bet on that."

2021-04-29 16:40:15,wallstreetbets,"If a campaign like this started, wouldn't facebook take measures to prevent this? Honest question, I'm not sure what they would do.

If a hashtag like #DownTheAlgo started getting attention to an extent that might hurt the business, would they take it down and risk getting hammered for censorship or let the movement grow and risk losing revenue?"
2021-04-29 17:43:22,wallstreetbets,"In theory, it's possible, but in reality you need a significant number of people to participate I.e. over 40% of a single country's FB user base to take part.

Also once this happens the easiest solution from FB (which already exists on Google Ads) is to implement a negative hashtag feature to remove irrelevant audiences.

I was running ads once where we spent £50k on spam in the time span of an hour once and we just changed our whole targeting to remove said demographic.  - with this in mind you may need majority participation per country to make it work.

In terms of marketing to people to take action, GDN Google might be able to hit someone for 10p a click and you need 40% of FBs audience to take part, so work out the marketing cost needed for that many clicks for financial viability of that route.

The alternative, is to create a viral organic FB post that gets shared everywhere informing people, which is free, but the post needs to be well written enough to engage people to share (which nowadays is near impossible)."

This would require a effort by a large portion of their actual users...

If they get rid of users, they’re in the same boat as if they left.

Their users are the resource that they extract the data they sell from...they kick too many people off others will leave too

...same thing happens.

I agree whether or not it can be sustained is a fair critique. It would require a snowball effect as wel

But we could easily adapt too. Switch hashtags ect, as long as people know what they’re doing and why, it could keep spreading.

And if they remove too many users, other users leave and it’s the same problem.

**NIO** will report results for the 2021 1st quarter and full year, ending 3/31 with:

* **Revenue between $1.17 - $1.18 Billion**
* Vehicle Revenue between $1.093 – $1.098 Billion
* Subscription and Other Sales between $73.5-$81.23 million
* Per Vehicle Revenue between 54.5-54.75
* ***Adj Diluted EPS: $(0.12) - $(0.08)***
* **Gross Margin: 16% - 17.2%**
* Total Operating Expenses: 28.45%-24.94%
* R&D spending: $127.86k – $121.63k
* SG&A spending: 18%-15% of Revenue

Things to pay attention to during the earnings call:

* Chip and Battery situation (affects production capacity, COGS)
* Infrastructure investments (affects bottom line)
* European expansion and increasing market penetration (affects SG&A)
* BaaS and ADaaS progress with NOMI (affects other sales, R&D)

My position is that the chip and battery situation will normalize after the Q2 crunch; William Li has previously made statements about the stability in battery and chip costs. This will pave the way for margin stability and future expansion leading to continuous EPS improvements. However, it is also important that we determine the trend of R&D and SG&A spending as %-of-Revenue.

My position: 500 shares avg 50.99."

Since January the company has aggressively reduced debt by selling assets — which reduced its interest expense, and cut merger related costs — while its US mortgage insurance business performs very well in this hot real estate environment.

Q1 Earnings will be announced after the close of the market today. I expect that they will blow it out. 

GNW has strong momentum and several trigger events that will lead the stock higher over the next year. 

Notably, its debt will be upgraded. Moodys has put GNW on watch for an upgrade. It will happen. GNW’s balance sheet is much improved and the business is performing. 

GNW is preparing its US mortgage insurance business for a partial IPO. The funds raised will further strengthen GNW’s balance sheet — and US mortgage insurance business can finally be judged stand-alone against peers outside of the GNW holding company - which owns a steady but boring Life insurance business. The multiples for peer mortgage insurance companies are ~3-4X higher than GNW gets credit for.

I noticed this company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and I could invest in this company.

What happens to stock on NYSE after a NASDAQ IPO? Will it continue to be listed on the NYSE?"
2021-04-29 10:57:05,wallstreetbets,"I miss YOKU. 

The only chinese stock I enjoyed owning."

2021-04-29 14:32:10,wallstreetbets,"Should also be noted that they made an announcement on 4/19 that the mortgage business is going to break off and issue an IPO.  Seems that would hurt GNW if you are citing strong mortgage performance as a ""pro"" to this stick."

2021-04-29 12:05:04,wallstreetbets,yeah I'm in the same boat let's ride it out buddy
2021-04-29 15:38:32,wallstreetbets,32 shares here 24% up. I followed the original DD only \~16 hours after the post.

2021-04-29 10:21:53,wallstreetbets,Stop reading charts and learn the story and the financials. GameStop (GME) was range-bound-boring until it wasn’t. GNW isn’t exactly GME but similarly it has massive value to unlock.  They have a plan.
2021-04-29 17:32:14,wallstreetbets,I bought some $5 calls expiring tomorrow and they just beat earnings let’s hope they print
2021-04-29 19:40:52,wallstreetbets,The stock uplift this week came from moving from one index to another. There’s a press release about it.  The earning were really strong. GNW is still massively undervalued on all fundamental multiples.
2021-04-29 11:11:07,wallstreetbets,"It doesn’t matter.  NYSE and NASDAQ share standards. Major exchanges like NASDAQ and NYSE have listing standards that make them more trusted and more attractive — and NASDAQ and the NYSE are the largest and most trusted. For example, the company must submit financials or their stock will be suspended.  Major exchanges are the main source of liquidity for shares trading but there are also dozens of exchanges that your broker may connect with for price discovery and execution. Always use limit orders to get the price that you want — so you don’t get screw on an unreasonable bid/ask spread accidentally.  Your limit price can be the market price or play the volitility and name a price that you like."

2021-04-29 15:46:51,wallstreetbets,up 1% lol I hope it rockets
2021-04-29 17:36:07,wallstreetbets,Before close i YOLOd in some 5 calls. If it hits to a 52 week high tomorrow I can sit on some money. Its a sleeper call.
2021-04-29 11:24:53,wallstreetbets,"Awesome, this is great information, thanks!"
2021-04-29 12:21:05,wallstreetbets,Good bot
2021-04-29 15:59:34,wallstreetbets,"Not going to sell today, so let's see how earning goes and see if it's hold with a loss, or rocket on beyond $5"
2021-04-29 17:39:49,wallstreetbets,I too got mine just before close but I didn’t yolo it my “investment research” consisted of reading this post looking at the cheap options and saying “hey what’s the worst that could possibly happen”
2021-04-29 17:46:44,wallstreetbets,Okay not really a yolo because it wasn't going to destroy my account. I just figured it would be the difference between drinking miller or a bottle of champagne this weekend. Had to have a little fun.
2021-04-29 18:08:23,wallstreetbets,Yeah this is a casino after all so you gotta have a little fun gambling
2021-04-29 18:09:10,wallstreetbets,It's a hell of a lot better than buying up scratch off tickets.
2021-04-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"AMD always tanks right after good earnings, so I waited until Today "
2021-04-29 10:48:13,wallstreetbets,I am long on AMD - been holding since $29 which was like 2 years ago.
2021-04-29 10:29:28,wallstreetbets,"Smart play, I did same"
2021-04-29 10:12:36,wallstreetbets,Great strategy
2021-04-29 13:48:07,wallstreetbets,Waiting for Earnings season to end. AMD has a history of trading sideways for a few days during earnings. rather write a put for a weekly and see how things move first.
2021-04-29 10:58:37,wallstreetbets,I know a guy liquidating his AMD investment to buy real estate.....so that tank may not happen.
2021-04-29 12:38:45,wallstreetbets,I have bought amd july 95c and i am down 20% already. I start to think that 95 was a bit to optimistic lol
2021-04-29 14:21:29,wallstreetbets,"I did the same thing but entered end of day yesterday. Not a huge deal because they were LEAPS that i plan to sell calls against but if we can get another red day tomorrow im grabbing more. Super bullish on them especially with how Intel has been consistently dropping the ball the past 2 years.  


Show me that 1 more red day tomorrow so i can go all in!!"
2021-04-29 15:34:45,wallstreetbets,buy high sell low. You've learned well.
2021-04-29 10:38:38,wallstreetbets,Also LOGI
2021-04-29 19:12:30,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the money op
2021-04-29 17:40:34,wallstreetbets,Great call. Added more of the 7/16 85c today. Going to add more tomorrow to take advantage of the ~20000 4/30 85c expiring. Hoping the price will bounce a bit next week as a result!
2021-04-29 17:47:31,wallstreetbets,Not bad. Yeah some people like to cash out after earnings.
2021-04-29 14:39:37,wallstreetbets,How is that a good idea? They don't pay dividends. Why wouldn't you just reposition on the peaks and dips? They are pretty obvious by now.
2021-04-29 13:57:20,wallstreetbets,Got in at 6.45 just now ... let's moon together
2021-04-29 10:30:23,wallstreetbets,"IV crush + drop in price on a double in data center revenue was a no brainer.  


There's like 20% Short interest. People just don't want to accept AMD is trouncing intel and it's not going to stop."
2021-04-29 12:54:29,wallstreetbets,"Bruh they've been in the same price range since last August, you're a wild one lmaoo"
2021-04-29 14:58:15,wallstreetbets,"just piling on the with the other guy, this is a bad take. that is all"
2021-04-29 14:47:02,wallstreetbets,"What a bad reply, go gamble it up L337Fool mr crystal ball.. 214% gain for this guy is solid in 2 years and theres zero reason to take on extra risk trying to reposition on ""peaks and dips"". I'm assuming you have not traded very long in the markets to grasp how many macro conditions are out of a business or your control. Keep doing what your doing u/AxGryndr, good job on the 214% in 2 years."
2021-04-29 14:22:24,wallstreetbets,I personally view Intel market share as just unassigned AMD and NVIDIA market share XD. They are running themselves into the ground.
2021-04-29 16:02:47,wallstreetbets,"Yup, all the boomers always ignore the end product as well on these stocks as well, amd products are just completely demolishing intels product line in price and performance. Intel is going to take years to catch up to what amd is currently offering"
2021-04-29 19:10:57,wallstreetbets,Check out /r/amd_stock for more amd dd
2021-04-29 13:19:14,wallstreetbets,I thought its possible they could heavy momentum because of ghe good results/earnings
2021-04-29 15:13:08,wallstreetbets,That's fine but AMD has has a pretty clear trading pattern. The big boys have come out and clearly stated the companys performance over intel is baked into the current price range so you get this beautifully predictable hype bubble baked with the earnings release. I've been riding this stock on and off all the way back since the merger with ATI. I know what the catalyst are for them to really take off past this point too (overtaking Nvidia). This guy's bet in staying long is a good one but  there really isn't much of a reason not to cash in on the current circumstances with this stock. To each there own I guess.
2021-04-29 16:59:05,wallstreetbets,"Check his post history, he’s just butt hurt it didn’t hit 100"
2021-04-29 18:41:57,wallstreetbets,Not to mention holding for 1yr+ means you're already ahead quite substantially in money saved that would otherwise go to tax AND you don't have the risk/stress of trading.
2021-04-29 14:52:07,wallstreetbets,LOL OK Mr. unrealized gains I'll just keep cashing in on your folly. NP!
2021-04-29 18:03:06,wallstreetbets,Yeah I'm holding out for alder lake. If intel doesn't hit big its game over.
2021-04-29 13:34:43,wallstreetbets,Yeah can't blame ya there. I've personally given up on them at this point. They get good news: they go down. They beat earnings: they go down. Entire market is rallying: they go down. Pretty sure not even God himself can make this stock go up lmao
2021-04-29 18:48:17,wallstreetbets,"Patience my man. Buy shares, sit back and relax :)"

2021-04-29 15:59:59,wallstreetbets,How is it that when I zoom out to 5 yrs there is no volume with price increase however recently there are huge volumes and the price barely makes it close to the ATH? Looking at CLOV for example but there are lots of stocks like this.
2021-04-29 16:16:17,wallstreetbets,Jumped feet first on the morning dip.. this is a long hold anyway but wish I had waited for EOD

2021-04-29 18:29:03,wallstreetbets,CLOV will provide.  It will shake the ones that bought in at lows but will build over the next few weeks up to earnings.  I’m betting on exploding earnings!

2021-04-29 12:26:34,wallstreetbets,"Are you willing to travel the long way 'round?

(note: the ""smart"" people who write things and say things on TV say there a resistance line at $11.50 (which we've bounced off of twice now) and another around $13.80. AFACT that means if we can just bust $11.50 we might have legs to go to almost $14, but if you want a real rocket ride in the near future you're going to have to hope for a mention of CLOV by somebody in power that's going to give them lots of money. (and I'm not sure that betting on Republicans congress rolling over and lowering the Medicare buy-in age to 60 is something to YOLO).

my personal math is if price is $9.99 on 5/21 close, then 100 shares = -0.01% (-$10), 1 call = -100% (-$140)"

2021-04-29 14:35:54,wallstreetbets,"If you’re trying to force a short squeeze there needs to be no liquidity of shares, so yes you need shares.

If you want to force what we saw with AMC or GME in January you’re looking for a gamma squeeze.

Basically when you buy a call MM have to buy shares to delta hedge if they are not hedged properly. Low liquidity + extremely high & unusual volume of calls ATM means they get caught with their pants down. Gamma squeeze happens at a rapid rate, short squeezes are slow. GME experienced two gamma squeezes

They don’t need to hedge for Far OTM calls as the risk there is near zero. 

If a large upward movement in price is coupled with a large volume of ATM calls and a reduction in liquidity you get a gamma squeeze. As more calls that were not hedged against become ITM, you get the mother of all ass ripping bull runs for a day"

For example, a us company thinking inflation is hitting 4% in 2021. They are gna hedge this risk by getting some futures on commodity. In addition, companies that use iron ore is thinking about other company hedging with commodities to counter inflation will also get the futures on commodity. 
It is a self fulfilling prophecy and the price of commodity will go up regardless who buy from who."

2021-04-29 11:00:49,wallstreetbets,"The only time I hear about options is when cold day traders who are no longer sure of themselves try to leverage there position. So when there right they make 2000 instead of 4000 but if there wrong lose 1000 so it's a 2:1 profit to loss ratio for example. But if you're not quick can actually turn out worse than 2000

Just buy stocks. Unless you want to lose your shirt, pants, shoes, car, house etc. Find a strategy stick to it be happy."

Just like a regular share you can sell anytime in the red, it's up to you to determine how much of a loss you're willing to take. My opinion, as this is not financial advice, but for someone still new to this like I am, I'm never buying a contract that expires the same day....ever. Hell I'm hesitant to buy weekly contracts and have only secured a few in a month, Jul and Aug respectively."

2021-04-29 15:20:24,wallstreetbets,"Ok I’m not gonna lie, this happened to me yesterday but I actually have no idea why. (am retard) 

I bought a call for TXN 2 weeks ago, earnings came out yesterday. Stock is slowly increasing up until the earning date, I’m $500 up on a $400 call. Earnings come out, TXN beat their earnings!!! Sweet I’m going to be rich tomorrow!—Nope, the stock proceeds to drop $10 in 5 minutes, after hours. My call crashes 99% at opening the next day, and now I’m sitting here down $200 still holding my call, looking around like a confused ape. 

Can anyone explain to me wtf I just witnessed? Would an experienced options trader have seen this coming? My only guess is that buying any option around earning is just a complete gamble. But I’m trying to avoid any future “Guh” moments like I had yesterday."

2021-04-29 13:28:34,wallstreetbets,We were at a shopping mall in Austin when I was little. My big brother pushed me into a fountain pool like right after we got there. My mom was like “idc we’re not leaving. I have some shopping to do”. So I walked around for a couple hours soaking wet sobbing the whole time. My brother got his ass whipped when my dad got home. So we were even.

2021-04-29 15:36:19,wallstreetbets,Small price to pay for a good meme
2021-04-29 08:29:23,wallstreetbets,Sorry for your loss bro.
2021-04-29 10:00:34,wallstreetbets,You can place a stop loss on options too
2021-04-29 11:01:38,wallstreetbets,How? You only lose price paid for the option if you let it expire out of the money.
2021-04-29 08:41:02,wallstreetbets,"Easy:
   
Stock goes up: option goes down.
   
Stock goes down: option goes down."
2021-04-29 10:33:51,wallstreetbets,"Well Calls are if you think the share price will go up, while Puts are if you think the price will go down. Each contract is for 100 shares and gives you the option not the obligation to sell or exercise the contract. You pay a premium to purchase those 100 shares which is a fraction of the share price. The dollar amount you see is called a strike price usually seen on reddit as ""$10C"" 10 dollar Call which is the amount you think the share price will hit or fingers crossed well above. 

Now as mentioned you have 2 options, sell or exercise. Selling a contract is just like selling shares, you just ""offload"" it and take your gains. If you exercise the contract you are choosing to buy those 100 shares at the strike price of the contract instead of the current share price (money out of pocket because you're now buying 100 shares). So if you think the stock will continue to moon and you have the funds, you can buy the 100 shares and hold. 

Ex. $5C (strike price) @ $0.50 (premium paid) 5/21exp (expires 5/21). Your out of pocket expense for this 1 contract is 0.50x100 = $50. Total amount you can ever lose will only be the amount paid for the contract. If you exercise the contract that's $5 (strike price) X 100 = $500. Depending on the situation and your finances will determine whether you sell or exercise. 

Lastly, you can sell your contracts at any time regardless of how far out your expiration date is. Let's say you got one that expires in 2022, but the stock moons today and you want to take profits. You sell the contract and count your tendies.

Now that is about as basic of an explanation for contracts when just looking at them on a trading platform. There's gobs more regarding intrinsic/extrinsic value, Greeks, rate or decay etc etc. I'd suggest Investopedia and read up."
2021-04-29 09:05:49,wallstreetbets,"In my experience, trying to actually learn the ins and outs of option did fuck all other than confuse me. I keep it simple, I don’t look at numbers, Greeks, I don’t look at shit to do with options. I ask myself, “should this go up”. If I think it should I buy options. So far I’m 4/6 on my option plays. Probably just luck idk I have a whole crayola box in my ass."
2021-04-29 08:55:20,wallstreetbets,"Watching some videos on youtube helped me out a ton, and after that dipping my toes in the water with really cheap ones to get a feel for them was even better. Obviously only go in with $$$ you're okay with losing lmao."

Stock options were created as a tool to limit losses amd maximize gains

You literally have to be retarded to lose money when investing in options IN THE LONG TERM"

2021-04-29 15:26:44,wallstreetbets,you should be terrified of them. so am i even though ive been trading them for years. I try to avoid them as much as possible. Look at DFV for example: he makes just one trade and makes millions. Because he knows the more you trade the more you lose.

2021-04-29 14:11:29,wallstreetbets,"I tend to only take an option position if the max profit is 4X at a minimum. 

They are usually debit spreads on LEAPS for high conviction assets. 

Some fail and go to zero, but debit spreads limit losses. Enough have been winning to be better than stonks alone. 

That said, I hold stonk as well to make sure my portfolio doesn't yeet to zero. Diversification and risk management is the way."

2021-04-29 12:05:53,wallstreetbets,"Actually options are REALLY hard to understand in useful detail, principally because of all the specific jargon and complex statistical analysis.

I agree, the concept of options is in fact painfully simple, but once you try to get into actually trading them, it goes all super geek all of a sudden and there's no plain english.

I'm learning every day since I started a month ago or so and I'm just barely beginning to internalize the trade structures and profit/loss implications.

One thing I did yesterday is to simplify my TOS window dramatically, once I figured out that I could do so. I can work better when I see just the info I need, and not all of the super-day-trader flood of minute to minute trading minutia on all seven thousand variations of any given trade at any given moment.  


As of today, I'm about 15% down across the board on my options trading, but I'm okay that it accounts a fair bit of learning. Times when I should have locked in a nice little 15% profit and then held for a 50% loss, or options I traded on very reasonable assumptions, and then the market went full blown toddler tantrum 100% irrationally the opposite, like, the very next day."

2021-04-29 17:35:48,wallstreetbets,"Not a dumb question. Though you should absolutely know what your financial situation is before you dabble and especially before a contract expires when you're thinking about exercising a contract. 

So if it's ITM either sell or exercise, do not wait for it to expire. That simple."
2021-04-29 19:09:32,wallstreetbets,Can you elaborate a little more on that with regard to leaps?
2021-04-29 18:20:05,wallstreetbets,"Delta is just the rate of change of option price with respect to the underlying. Then gamma is the second derivative blah blah blah.

2021-04-29 17:08:45,wallstreetbets,"They're not better or worse. They just offer different ways to make bets on underlying assets. 

You don't have to buy calls with next week expiry like degenerates here do.

You can arrange a strategy that makes good returns on a stock that goes straight sideways.

You can make good returns on a stock that goes either straight up or straight down, direction doesn't matter.

If you're just generally long on a stock over an extended period, you can buy LEAPs for a fraction of the capital to buy actual shares, but get the same returns. If your LEAP goes to zero and you think you got in too early, you can still buy in for less than what it costs to buy stock.

That all said, I still have a 401k that is 90% of my portfolio. I probably wouldn't ever let options exceed 20% unless I think I have killer plays."

With American options, when you exercise you will actually need the shares or will end up buying the shares... is this correct?"

Is it that because it's x100 it's cheaper?  And if you were to buy the ask at 34 with a strike price at 15 how does that differ from a ask at 14 strike price 35. There just inverted.

2021-04-29 13:48:00,wallstreetbets,"No. You just have infinite risk of losses if the stock goes to infinity or GME. Most brokers require some amount of cash for you to take that risk. 

You can also hedge it with a bought call at a higher price to cap losses at a trade for gains.

Example

Sell a call at a $5 strike

Buy a call at a $10 strike

Max loss is $500. So all you need is $500 in your account to take that position."
2021-04-29 12:46:40,wallstreetbets,"Yes, You must own at least 100 shares.

Edit: I sell covered calls so in my case, yes you have to own them. I don't have the balls to sell naked calls."
2021-04-29 12:05:25,wallstreetbets,It’s easier to sell cash secured puts instead. My account does require you to have capital in case it gets assigned but with larger accounts or with margin that changes...although I would recommend against it if you don’t know what you’re doing.
2021-04-29 19:14:34,wallstreetbets,"People forget to mention the PMCC. You can buy a deep ITM LEAP (you want a delta of 0.85+), and then sell short dated OTM call options on it without owning the shares. However you have to be careful to sell your calls to at least cover your cost basis if they get called away"
2021-04-29 12:55:17,wallstreetbets,If your calls become itm and you want to hold the underlying shares just roll into a higher call before the shares are assigned. The premiums will be a wash so you won't make any money but you keep your shares.

2021-04-29 18:29:24,wallstreetbets,"Oh for sure, I agree with that. Stocks so long as they're not a flimsy company will almost always net a positive return as long as you play the long game. That's exactly how some retirement plans/portfolios work. You either have aggressive  or ""safe"" routes and your funds go into numerous stocks/etf's and what'ya know? Over decades along with maxing out any contributions plus what your employer may add, you've got...well hopefully enough to retire haha."
2021-04-29 16:49:23,wallstreetbets,"Selling to close a contract that you bought just brings you back to neutral, you’re out of the trade, nothing can happen.  You either have more or less cash than you started with.  

If you sell a contract to open, you are then short the contract (it would show as -1 in your broker app).  If you own 100 shares, the worst that can happen is that the stock moons and you are forced to sell your shares.  Otherwise, ideally you either let the contract expire worthless and keep all the money that you got when you sold it, or you can buy it back and get back to neutral.

If you don’t own the 100 shares and you sell a call, you could be on the hook for infinite losses, but with most brokers you need a pretty high level of options approval to sell naked options."
2021-04-29 14:56:39,wallstreetbets,"Just head to Investopedia and read up on Options Contracts. That's a good start. If you still have questions don't be afraid to ask the community, and I'm certain someone will answer."
2021-04-29 18:42:37,wallstreetbets,"I don't think anyone especially your broker will ""cover the cost."" 

As far as what actually happens on expiration day I don't know because 1) I'm still learning 2) I haven't experienced it yet. If you're ITM (have unrealized gains ie you're up) then don't wait for the expiration date. Just sell the contract and take gains. If after a review of your finances and you can buy 100 shares at your strike price and want to hold, then yes exercise the contract and get those 100 shares."
2021-04-29 18:31:47,wallstreetbets,"I cannot answer anything regarding Euro trading. In the US if you exercise you need to have the funds to purchase 100 shares at your strike price. So ya, you end up buying them."

2021-04-29 15:13:56,wallstreetbets,"Avoiding anything mentioned in WSB. If it's mentioned here nowadays, I assume it's near a peak and someone's just trying to FOMO their way to some tendies."
2021-04-29 16:30:53,wallstreetbets,"I bought in 

* Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc NYSE: HII, @195, is basically the only contractor for building ships for the Navy which is due for major overhaul;

* Leidos Holdings Inc NYSE: LDOS, @90, is a defense contractor but also makes equipment for TSA which is being upgraded; 

* Textron Inc NYSE: TXT, @54 is another defense contractor and is my long bet to win army contract for new rifle

There are others that I have on watchlist should I get over some money issues, I felt these had some more room for growth compared to some others that are also good such as Raytheon (which has already grown considerably, but would also be a good pick).  Another good one is Lockheed Martin, great dividend payments expensive, but solid stock even though pretty high priced.

These are stocks that as long as you don't think America will fail these will continue to do well overall, they mix well with the likes of Coke, Apple, or perhaps Tesla.  Personally before health issues I was looking into some energy/construction/mining stuff a few months back after picking the above ones up (along with HOL/VACQ).  There seemed some solid american steel, as well as some american/canadian mining companies that had low p/e that had good growth potential for the future.

I'm a complete noob around here and get information where I can find it, including people I know IRL, but if you are willing to get into the data and research for yourself you can make decisions best for you and even if you succeed typically you can live with it.  For example everyone on WSB was oringally betting for the company that was against Rocket Mortgages, I went and looked up the history and financials for RKT (Quicken Loans/Rock financial) and found them to be a solid company and had they dropped down to the price I wanted at the time (21.50) I would have got in on them, but instead Textron had a sudden drop back to $54 and I doubled my shares with them and that has worked even better."
2021-04-29 18:00:29,wallstreetbets,"So ""writing"" a contract is high risk? And not having those shares in stock is even higher risk.

My level 2 trading on Robinhood should have my worst case scenario being losing all the money I put into the call, but never really owing anything?"
2021-04-29 19:48:53,wallstreetbets,"Is it worth it to just sell the contracts though? I mean, if you're not a day trader and are limited to 3 trades per week it doesn't seem that profitable.

Edit: European contracts are cash settled so you never actually need to hold the stock upon exercising. I guess that's where the confusion came from since I'm an American but living in Poland."

2021-04-29 14:16:37,wallstreetbets,I have not been doing this long but right now I sell covered calls on my GME shares on Mondays for expiration on Friday of that week. I try to keep the strike price far enough otm so the premium on each call is 4 to 5 hundred dollars per contract . This week because of the rapid price movement early in the week I had to roll some of my calls so they would not get assigned.
2021-04-29 18:40:24,wallstreetbets,"Writing a call is low risk if you own 100 shares.  So (if the market were open) I could go and buy 100 shares of AAPL for around $13,350.  Then I could sell a 135C expiring on 5/7 for around $140.  That money I get to keep.  If AAPL finishes the week below $135 then the call I sold expires worthless, I keep my shares, and I can sell another call for the following week.  If it ends the week at $135.01 or higher I’ll get assigned and my shares will get sold, so I’ll get $13,500.  So I’ll end up making $13,500 + $140 with a cost basis of $13,350 for a net of $290.

Now, if AAPL moons and ends the week at say $150, I won’t get any extra gains.  I could always buy my call back but if the stock goes up the call will be worth more so it would be a wash.  What I could do is “roll” my call or buy to close and simultaneously sell another call, usually with a further expiration and higher strike.  Right now the 137C expiring on 5/14 is priced pretty similarly to the 135C expiring next week.

If AAPL tanks then my call becomes worthless pretty quickly so it becomes easy to buy back, and so I could sell the stock to cut my losses.  But a strategy like this (and its extension, the wheel), is best done with stocks that you want to own, so in that case I would probably hold the shares and sell more calls, or maybe wait for the stock to bounce back before selling more calls.

I don’t know how robinhood does it’s options approval (get a real broker tho).  With Schwab, anyone can write covered calls or cash secured puts, the next level up is buying calls and puts, which yes, limit your loss to the premium you paid for the contract.  Selling naked calls (along with various kinds of spreads) require higher approval which I don’t have currently, and those are where you hear of the people incurring massive losses."
2021-04-29 19:55:53,wallstreetbets,"That's something you'll have to answer/figure out for yourself. Whether you want to hold shares because you belive in the company and think the value will continue to increase, or are you looking to take gains and sell."

2021-04-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Lumber DD Week II: $WY [DD from a week ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/muspbl/lumber_industry_dd/?ref=share&ref_source=link) seemed to work out pretty well if you invested in UFPI or LPX at any point last week. Here I am again for part II because lumber has been good.

**Weyerhaeuser**

Weyerhaeuser (WY) is the largest single owner of timberlands across the United States and Canada. They are a real estate investment trust officially, but this is purely for tax reasons. They have a real estate sector of the company, but also run their own logging/forestry and wood products sectors. They stand to benefit significantly from the increase in the price of lumber over the past few months. The same thesis stands here as it did in the previous DD: Wood prices have shot up as people are seeking to build homes out the ass because there are so many buyers across the country. Lumber futures are the best indicator for this, [as we are rapidly approaching double the price as 3 months ago]( https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/lumber-and-pulp/random-length-lumber.html). Lumber futures have risen 10% in six days since I posted my previous DD, but the most relevant thing is that **the futures price of lumber does not even matter**. The fact is we are looking at Q1 earnings reports from these companies and they have shot it out of the park so far: DHI last week posted a ~20% earnings beat, UFPI posted a 90% beat and has shot up in the interim. Weyerhaeuser, as the largest owner of timberlands in the US and Canada, ought to post something in between those two estimates. In addition, the options are cheap as and the IV is relatively low for a company that is about to have earnings this week.

Weyerhaeuser has also reduced its debt to the [lowest point in the last five years]( https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/wy/financials/balance-sheet) which is great and further reinforces the idea that they are on the up and up which is always nice to believe in the company you have invested in, even if short term.

This means buy options, buy stock, buy whatever you want I’m not your dad. If you want to have a fun, low risk earnings play, stock is the best choice. In the long term, you are also investing in commodities which are everyone’s favorite inflation resistant equities, a great buy when everyone is shitting their pants about the money printer recently.

**Positions:**

$LPX 5/21 $70C x1

$WY 5/7 40C x2

25 Shares WY @ 39.72

I’ll be adding more if it dips during this week, likely 5/7Calls and some stock because I am a coward.

TL;DR – It’s two paragraphs just read it"
2021-04-29 10:30:35,wallstreetbets,"I bought in. I believe in this shit. My buddy built the smallest section of fence for $850.00

2021-04-29 07:17:36,wallstreetbets,"Comments from the last thread for some more confirmation bias if anyone is interested:

""UFPI, LPX, WFG, all are going to have an incredible year this year because the futures market is starting to indicate 1400$ lumber this summer and 1000$ lumber for the rest of the year, possibly i to 2022 as it seems the housing demand is more than willing to tolerate 1000$ lumber. Anyone that knows how to do the math can see how insanely undervalued these companies STILL are even after their rally the last year."" - /u/Ding123456

""Buy low, sell high?"" - /u/CyberDyne-SystemsT2k

""Framing contractor here. Lumber has changed how the entire industry operates. The Texas freeze shut down major plants the make the resin used in manufactured engineered products which are used in every modern home. Go try to buy a sheet of OSB. Some are over $100/sheet. Between covid, mills being burned down, trade wars, the hot real estate market, there’s no end in sight to the prices we’re seeing. All that said, people are still buying and building like crazy."" - /u/MaddogMuhn"
2021-04-29 07:23:01,wallstreetbets,From experience trading WY.  It maybe a good company with good management but the stock trades like absolute dog shit.  Never acted right for me.  Go with UFPI. It trades right.

Sold 3 of the 4 calls this week as they were doubling. Still holding the last one up over 100%.

I think there is a real chance we jump to 50 tomorrow.

The lumber ""crack"" spread is historic right now. Wood is incredibly expensive but tree stumpage fees are still at lows.  WY has the mills and the trees. They get to capitalize on that entire spread.

Maybe I missed that news but I havent seen one thing about analysts and/or just the general consensus saying NOK is now about to take over from 5G. I mean 5Gs been out for a little while now and no its not full force working at its full potential but, Apple, Qualcomm, Verizon, and shit even ATT are all better suited to have any meaninful results from the 5G rollout. Just my opinion of course and thats really worth shit soo fuck it.

2021-04-29 11:41:35,wallstreetbets,So you're saying put all of my money into January 2022 call options? Done.
2021-04-29 13:26:30,wallstreetbets,"The stock won’t have exponential growth for one massive reason, and that’s the massive amount of shares in the float. 

I’m long on Nokia and have been selling covered calls to lower my cost basis. But if you’re hoping for 10x gains, this is not the stock."

Nothing to see here."
2021-04-29 07:12:45,wallstreetbets,We recognized it a year ago and it didn't move.
2021-04-29 07:32:46,wallstreetbets,Nokia stock is inversely correlated with news! Good news = stock tanks. Nokia really needs to announce bad news like ‘ceased all operations’ or ‘corruption allegations’ etc. and watch the stock fly!
2021-04-29 07:22:28,wallstreetbets,"Can not find the original post fom WSB wher some Nostradamus said that NOK is long term GME, with detail description what nok is. Meanwhile holding to my GME to the zeeero, or end of the 🌎."

2021-04-29 10:17:33,wallstreetbets,NOK is a waste of y’all’s money imo. Company hasn’t been on the move stock price wise for a long time. Originally back in April wallstreet bots told everyone to buy NOK bc it was cheap and retail can’t move a price with a market cap that high. And for streaming nobody really needs 5G speeds 1gb+/sec. u can still stream in HD at like 10mb/sec. NOK and 5G are great for a plan on the moon bc of the vast distance. But I don’t think the company will really do much for at least a few more months. If it gains traction over the next few weeks than maybe it is a good pick. Not financial advice.
2021-04-29 09:33:37,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, i am super bullish on nokia. I honestly think it has the best shot at doing a gamestops climb but with even more real world right now profits to drive it even higher than that.

Everyone wants gamestop to be the company nokia currently is, and i think a lot of people are going to miss this opportunity to buy them for under 10 bucks."

2021-04-29 09:10:26,wallstreetbets,"News like this is always expected and planned for. As you can see, a 15-20% appreciation in the pre-market is suspect. Could be a manipulation to help old money dump. Or it could be a short covering? Or it could be a re-evaluation. In any event, more weeks and months may pass before we see a stabilization somewhere....the baton is in the hands of this **management team**....and it's on them to run with it. If they twiddle their thumbs or jack off in the lab going forward,  the stock will fall.......and today will be a much ado about nothing."

I did read a while back that they're going to do some buybacks (I believe 600M shares or smth like that) but idk if it has been approved by the board yet. Having in mind that Nokia took some bad hits in the past now I believe its recovery comes to an end and they have the biggest 5G cover I believe. Also they're gonna put some antennas on the moon for us to post on reddit once we land (facts).

I kept the nokia for some reason. Maybe as a reminder to not buy things I don't understand and don't know the value.

I paid 4.70 for 500 shares and finally im breakng even. Plus I've got a nice long position that I don't have to micromanage.

Yeah, it shouldn't be at 4 euro per share in fair value. It's why i'm so bullush on it. I mean, Nokia paid 15.6 billion for Alcatel-Lucent in 2016. Nokia is now valued at 23 billion. While their cash postion is worth 2 billion alone. 

It's crazy cheap right now because of a few years of increased r&d spending and a wrong bet on fpgas. That bet on fpgas is now corrected, and their r&d is still enourmous, but their margins are now targeted at 7-10%, on >20 B in sales. With a company worth 23B euros. It's a great value stock."

2021-04-29 10:09:20,wallstreetbets,"So nokia is the only company that got the infrastructure ready *right now*? Thats a reply i can work with, thanks a lot :)"

Tesla is at $674.

Therefore, Tesla as a company is better than Apple."

2021-04-29 16:53:13,wallstreetbets,I think the new generation has come my old friend. The day has finally come that people are *actually* taking advice seriously from wsb.
2021-04-29 10:42:27,wallstreetbets,"This is true, but offering an end-to-end solution also makes it much easier for carriers / 5g service providers to buy in and roll it out much faster. Everything is already tested & integrated, it's just a matter of starting to put it in place which is a big deal. If you have a massive infrastructure already (e.g. Verizon), then it probably makes sense to do it in a more custom / piecemeal approach. However, if you have a smaller infrastructure or you want to be everyone else to wide-scale deployment, NOK might make better sense."
2021-04-29 13:44:24,wallstreetbets,"Uh huh, you realize you can't support anything your are saying with facts so you tell me to go fish. It's ok to trade on word of mouth people do it all the time. Don't get mad."

2021-04-29 07:40:18,wallstreetbets,Nokia also 4.20 as of close yesterday.... I'm 69% sure that's a good sign.

2021-04-29 15:24:09,wallstreetbets,"Too bad it isn't reflected in the stock price. 

The CEO needs to go. He always has the tendency to put his own foot in his mouth especially during earnings calls and whenever good news of Nokia comes out."
2021-04-29 16:54:49,wallstreetbets,They can’t monetise their patents see all their ongoing lawsuits...

2021-04-29 15:15:52,wallstreetbets,LOL RH canceled my Calls on these the day of the original GME squeeze. They were in the money and I wasn't able to exercise because they took the symbol off the exchange. I'm quite cheesed  🧀
2021-04-29 15:40:30,wallstreetbets,Too bad I bought LEAPS that are still down 85%.  Guess it's better than the 90% they were down yesterday.
2021-04-29 15:56:08,wallstreetbets,Does that help them make money? I try and skip the NOK part on my TDA acct. Depressing AF. 🦍

It was very nice seeing the notification that NOK was up to $4.88 pre-market so I knew it was time to take profits and those calls sold immediately.

I needed a good hit to start to make up for my horrendous call losses over the last 5 weeks."

2021-04-29 07:03:33,wallstreetbets,I’d really be ok if WSB doesn’t mention this stock again and just lets it slowly grow back. It’s up 17% pre-market though so I don’t know if that will happen.
2021-04-29 07:34:53,wallstreetbets,Reading all the post today in WSB I think the negative sentiment is changing fast!!

2021-04-29 14:31:57,wallstreetbets,"I really think this sentiment is wrong. 

A common trend on every social media stock tracker I’ve seen is that mentions follow by hours or days after price movement. 

Generally theres a reason a stock drops with mentions and its because the stock already went up or had prominent news already affect the price.

2021-04-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UPDATE: $HGEN (Humanigen) - Short term COVID play w/ great long term potential in CAR-T cancer therapy (and more!). 5x+ potential ROI  

**TL;DR: Short term COVID play with great long term potential in CAR-T therapy (and more). Lenzilumab's recent P3 results cements it as the #1 current therapeutic in hospitalized COVID patients. Application submission for emergency use authorization (EUA) will come any day now (maybe today!) and cause a greater spike than when it went from $14->$29 following P3 topline data release. >5x ROI based on potential COVID sales and CAR-T implications is very possible. Great entry point currently at $18.60 (1bil market cap).**

You may or may not have seen my original post on Mar. 25 (copy and pasted below) talking about Humanigen's variant agnostic COVID drug Lenzilumab, which is primed to have a significant role in hospitalized COVID patients, CAR-T (cancer therapy), and more! Since my post, there has been plenty of positive catalysts:

1. Humanigen released positive topline data in it's [phase 3 clinical trial](https://s27.q4cdn.com/938944131/files/doc_presentations/Lenzilumab-Phase-3-Results-v8-RXMD-032921-0555h.pdf) studying Lenzilumab in hospitalized COVID patients. Lenzilumab met the studies primary endpoint (ventilator free survival through day 28) with a **54% relative improvement** in VFS over and above current standard of care (remdesevir and/or steroids). Tocilizumab, a significantly inferior (but similar - works downstream of GM-CSF) immunomodulator is currently used often in hospitalized COVID patients. It only produced a **18%** relative improvement in VFS, and yet has made Roche a [boatload of money](https://www.fiercepharma.com/manufacturing/novartis-inks-third-covid-19-production-pact-time-for-roche-s-arthritis-med-actemra) and continues to be produced for COVID treatment. The drug generated 2.9bil in sales, which is a 32% increase from last year, and that increase is largely due to COVID. Simply put, this study has shown that Lenzilumab is currently the **best therapeutic for hospitalized COVID patients.** Next step is to file for EUA application, which will c**ome any day now**. For reference, the last COVID therapeutic (Eli lilly's baricitinib) took just over a month from topline P3 data release to EUA submission. Also, Merck's (now discontinued) COVID therapeutic was given the stop sign by the FDA approx. 20 days after P3 data release saying that they needed more data before submission. Basically, if there was an issue w/ Lenzilumab, I expect we would've heard by now. **I expect successful application submission and eventual approval**
2. Humanigen reported positive phase 1b) results w/ Lenzilumab in it's CAR-T study [Zuma-19](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210419005250/en/Humanigen-Reports-Positive-Data-With-Lenzilumab-in-the-ZUMA-19-CAR-T-Phase-1b-Study-in-DLBCL-and-Plans-to-Initiate-a-Potential-Registrational-Study). One big issue with CAR-T is its side effects - cytokine release syndrome and severe neurotoxicity. Lenzilumab prevents this, and the results of this study showed that. All 6 patients had an objective response rate (4 of them being complete), and no patients had severe CRS or NT at the recommended phase 2 dose. Given the promising results, $HGEN terminated their collaboration with KITE and plans to initiate a phase 2 study with **all commercially available** CD19 CAR-T therapies in diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
3. Following the Zuma news, Humanigen brought on [Dr. Adrian Kilcoyne](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210421005213/en/Humanigen-Appoints-Dr.-Adrian-Kilcoyne-to-the-role-of-Chief-Medical-Officer) to be their CMO. Dr. Kilcoyne has a long history with big pharma (and was previously working for AstraZeneca), and has had extensive experience in CAR-T. Interestingly, he worked for Celgene corporation when they were acquired by Bristol-Myer Squibb. He oversaw the development of a DLBCL drug and was the US lymphoma CAR-T lead supporting the clinical development and launch preparation of Breyzani. Extremely bullish move for an expert in CAR-T to leave his cushy big pharma job and join Humanigen (his first small biotech company venture) following promising CAR-T clinical trial results imo.
4. More CAR-T news: [Recent Abstract](https://imgur.com/a/8ZiAr74) released (both CEO and CSO are authors) showing CAR-T cells w/ GM-CSF knock out ameliorates CAR-T cell early activation, reduces activation-induced cell death, and enhances antitumor activity. This is good. Another article [(published in nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41421-021-00255-4)) shows that GM-CSF knockout in CAR-T cells significantly improves side effects and maintains good efficacy: 0/3 patients exhibited neurotoxicity, and no CRS was observed in 2 patients (the third had grade 2 CRS). All 3 patients had complete responses. As I mentioned, Humanigen has a massive IP portfolio in GM-CSF neutralization, including GM-CSF knock out cells ([exclusive license w/ Mayo Clinic](https://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/globenewswire/7673719.htm)). ARK investments believes the cellular therapy TAM is [absolutely massive](https://twitter.com/TrumanFalkner/status/1382747618913046528)
5. Eversana, one of Humanigen's partners, is [actively recruiting](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/amypeek_greatopportunity-groundfloor-hiringnow-activity-6788889650296590336-8OqE) for account manager positions across the United States for commercialization of Lenzilumab
6. [Milestone payment](https://twitter.com/humanigen/status/1380556227302854660?s=20) from KPM Tech and Telcon RF Pharma (HGEN's Phillipines/Korean partner) for their successful P3 results
7. [NIH ACTIV-5 trial](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04583969) has added recruitment sites since release of P3 data
8. Humanigen also announced [positive phase 1 results](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210409005083/en/Humanigen-Announces-Positive-Results-From-Phase-1-Study-of-Ifabotuzumab-in-Glioblastoma-Multiforme) for their solid tumor targeting drug (different drug!) Ifabotuzumab in glioblastoma. Additional studies are planned to evaluate ifabotuzumab as an antibody-drug conjugate in solid tumor patients.
9. [8.5mil shares short as of April 15](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/hgen/short-interest). About 25% of the float and approx. 6 days to cover given the low volume trading. Given the illiquidity, there is a bit of a short squeeze potential.
10. The [average price target](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/HGEN/research-ratings) of analysts for $HGEN is $34.29 ($21-$43)

After P3 results were released Mar. 29, HGEN shot up to $29 dollars and eventually settled around $22 dollars. HGEN then had a 5m share offering at $18.50 to increase funds for manufacturing. This dilution, along with a rough downtrend for the biotech market and the susceptibility to shorting given it's low volume, HGEN fell to around $13 dollars (admittedly, I was very wrong about the response to P3 data release in my original post). It has since rebounded and is still at a **great entry point** at $18.60 (anything sub-20 is a steal imo), close to it's recent offering. As mentioned in my original post, Humanigen has consistently stated the goal to produce 100k doses in the next year with an approximate $1bil revenue. This doesn't include stockpiling or potential ex-US partnerships. With a current market cap of about $1bil, Humanigen **can absolutely 5x their current value** based on COVID sales alone, and CAR-T implications massively increases $HGEN's ceiling as a long term hold. Humanigen is also a prime buyout target and their CEO Dr. Durrant specializes in these turnarounds. Given the market response to the P3 release, I expect the successful filing of EUA application to cause an even greater spike in the **$40ish+ range.**

[u/weentown](https://www.reddit.com/u/weentown/) also posted some great DD yesterday about $HGEN: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsOGs/comments/n0hhzn/hgen\_humanigen\_due\_diligence/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsOGs/comments/n0hhzn/hgen_humanigen_due_diligence/)

Other catalysts to watch out for: News regarding government orders of Lenzilumab, full release of P3 data in a peer-reviewed journal, ACTIV-5 updates, CAR-T updates.

Originally posted Mar. 25 on [r/stocks](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks):

Humanigen ($HGEN), led by CEO Cameron Durant and CSO Dale Chappell, is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company currently trading at $13.76 (market cap approx $740 million) that most notably makes the Anti-GM-CSF drug \*\*Lenzilumab. It's phase 3 study for severe COVID has been completed and results will be out by end of march. With a successful phase 3 trial, Humanigen will apply and likely be granted Emergency Use authorization (EUA) for production and use of Lenzilumab

**What is it?**

Lenzilumab is a proprietary ( +100 Patents in GM-CSF, CAR-T, CRS, GvHD) Humaneered® anti-human granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) monoclonal antibody that is designed to prevent and treat an immune hyper-response called cytokine storm, a complication considered to be a leading cause of COVID-19 death. Lenzilumab targets severe COVID – patients hospitalized w/ COVID and O2 saturation <94% on room air (90% of hospitalized patients).

**How does it work?**

GM-CSF is an inflammatory signaling protein that causes a multitude of downstream effects. Blah blah blah, the details don’t matter, but what does matter is that this shit kills people with COVID. Here’s a recent bombshell article from [Science Immunology](https://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/6/57/eabg9873) that shows the distinct role of GM-CSF in severe COVID-19. What’s also very important is that this is produced by OUR BODIES. Not the virus. Lenzilumab doesn’t target the virus – it is not susceptible to resistance from mutant strains (\\#variantagnostic)

From the article: “GM-CSF is elevated early, scaled with severity, and is central to the inflammatory response in COVID-19.”… “Our findings support therapeutic targeting of GM-CSF, as previously suggested on theoretical grounds”

Here’s another recent study that further implicated GM-CSF in COVID: [Journal of Leukocyte Biology](https://jlb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/JLB.3COVCRA0920-628RR)

From the article: ""Our findings fully support the emerging notion that GM‐CSF might be a key feature of SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced cytokine storm in COVID‐19 patients""

**Does it work?**

We will find out soon. The company consistently stated Phase 3 results will be released by end of March. 60 days from last date of patient enrollment will be Mar. 29, and with some secondary endpoints being at the 60 day mark, I would not be surprised if data is released on the Monday. Until that day comes, there has been a lot of evidence suggesting that it will be successful. I’ve already talked about GM-CSF and studies implicating it's involvement and role in severe COVID lung pathology, and here's more

1. [Open-label study published by the Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(20)30989-7/fulltext) \--> Study showed Clinical Improvement (defined as improvement of at least 2 points on the 8-point ordinal clinical endpoints scale) in 11 of 12 (91.7%) patients treated with lenzilumab and 22 of 27 (81.5%) untreated patients. The time to clinical improvement was significantly shorter for the lenzilumab-treated group compared with the untreated cohort with a median of 5 days versus 11 days (*P*=.006)
2. An interim analysis of HGEN’s Phase 3 RCT ([NCT04351152](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04351152)) showed promising results – with a 37% increase in recovery rate at Day 28 vs. Standard of care treatment. Study size (small sizes being an issue w/ many COVID therapeutics thus far) was increased to help maintain power of the study at 90% based on these results. [Source](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/humanigen-announces-positive-interim-phase-3-data-of-lenzilumab-in-patients-hospitalized-with-covid-19/).
3. Otilimab – a drug from $GSK that also targets GM-CSF – recently failed their Phase 3 study. How is that good? Well, despite it being severely underdosed (single 90mg dose w/ shorter half life vs. 1800mg total dose of lenzilumab w/ longer half life) and including patients already on mechanical ventilation (further in disease course), they STILL proved statistical significance in their age 70+ group of patients. Lenzliumab has approx.. 45% of their patients age 65+ (which have a 35-80x risk of hospitalization and 1100-7900x risk of death compared to adolescents as per CDC) as per their interim phase 3 report as compared to 22% in the otilimab trial. The increased dose, greater drug half-life, and better patient population bodes very well for Lenzilumab’s chance of success
4. Here’s a recent bullish letter to the editor from \[[Mayo Clinic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7833532/?fbclid=IwAR3RqXf3i6T9xPnFja_mb5b6p86rLF51SyOXOGimPD5Kgoij0QpBJW87tBs)\]: “Aware of the good safety profile of lenzilumab in this current study and previous analysis, the treatment is feasible and safe and the ongoing randomized phase III trial will extensively confirm the lymphocyte recovery in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact of the drug on coronavirus disease 2019 clinical improvement”
5. ACTIV-5 / Big Effect Trial (BET-B) for the Treatment of COVID (NCT04583969)

Funded and selected by the NIH – this studies Lenzilumab combined with Remdesvir for the treatment of COVID. Not hard evidence of lenzilumab’s efficacy, but evidence that Lenzilumab has showed enough promise to warrant being chosen for such a trial

**Competition**

\- There is none right now. All COVID therapeutics that target severe COVID have been dropping like flies. It’s all for the taking if this phase 3 study succeeds and Emergency Use approval Is granted

**COVID – getting worse**

As many of you might’ve heard, COVID isn’t going away. In fact, there are multiple new variants that are more infectious, more deadly, and more resistant to current vaccinations. Across the globe, COVID cases are rising again and certain areas are being hit especially hard. [CTV news article re: India w/ it’s new double mutant variant](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/india-detects-double-mutant-coronavirus-variant-1.5360271), [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/19/europe/coronavirus-europe-third-wave-intl/index.html) re: Europe dealing with a surge in cases, and [global news](https://globalnews.ca/news/7720211/brazil-record-cases-covid-19/) re: Brazil hitting record number COVID cases, to name a few. New COVID cases in the US remain pretty low, but between lax restriction and the rise of variant strains [as this nature article shows](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00564-4), we could be seeing another wave in the US as well.

How deadly are these new strains? Still much to be learned, but it’s looking like current vaccines leave a lot to be desired. [Here’s a study from the New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2100362), which studied viral neutralization of some new variants w/ our current vaccines (refer to Table 1). $PFE has decreased (in vitro) efficacy by 2x, 6.7x, <6.5x vs. B117, P1, 501YV2 variants. $MRNA vaccine has decreased efficacy by 1.8x, 4.5x, <8.6x

Google cases worldwide and you will see the # of new COVID cases/day have started to rise after hitting a trough in mid-Feb. Between COVID fatigue and places easing restrictions and the new variants mentioned above, COVID is here to stay and will be for years to come. [Here’s an article from nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00396-2), which talks about COVID being a endemic virus that we will be dealing with on a year to year basis. Unfortunately, the market is huge for #lenzilumab

**Partnerships**

1. Humanigen was the only micro cap company chosen for **Operation Warp Speed** (an initiative to facilitate and accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics) -> [Source](https://ir.humanigen.com/news/news-details/2020/Humanigen-Announces-Cooperative-Research-and-Development-Agreement-with-the-US-government-to-Develop-Lenzilumab-for-COVID-19/default.aspx). Humanigen in collaboration with BARDA to increase manufacturing capacity
2. License agreement with KPM Tech/Telcon RF Pharamceutical company for Lenzilumab production in South Korea and the Phillipines. \[[Source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201103005167/en/Humanigen-Executes-Licensing-Agreement-for-Lenzilumab%E2%84%A2-in-COVID-19-with-KPM-TechTelcon-RF-Pharmaceutical-for-South-Korea-and-the-Philippines)\]

6. Not a partnership, but $HGEN recently announced an $80million loan w/ Hercules Capital on Mar. 10 to support manufacturing and commercialization. Bullish move close to P3 data release imo. \[[Source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210310005879/en/Humanigen-Announces-80-Million-Loan-Facility-from-Hercules-Capital)\]

**TL;DR - lots of partnerships and agreements in place for manufacturing if EUA approval granted**

**The Market**

Here’s a PDF PowerPoint of $HGEN corporate presentation: [Humanigen](https://ir.humanigen.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx). The whole presentation gives a great overview of the company and I recommend a look through, but skip to slide 18 and you can get a rough sense of the market potential. There are 3 sources of incomes:

1. Stockpiling – US and ex-US
2. US market
3. Outside the US market

US market: Conservative estimates from the company believes there will be 1,000,000+ hospitalizations in the US this year, with approximately 100,000 patients as a market for Lenzilumab treatment. At 10k per dose, an approximate 1bil of revenue is up for the taking

Outside the US market:

1. The market is there with cases numbers rising across the globe
2. Humanigen has been in discussion with ex-US governments already about production of lenzilumab (skip to 24:00 on the [Mar 16 fireside chat webcast](https://ir.humanigen.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx))

**Price forecasting:**

Conservative estimates from the company project 100k doses for the US alone in 2021 if given EUA approval. This gives approximate revenue of 1bil. This doesn’t include any non-US sales or stockpiling.

With positive phase 3 trial data, I see the price share easily shooting up to 50-60+. The next step would be applying for Emergency Use Approval, with acceptance likely if P3 study is successful. If granted, and going by the very conservative estimate of $1billion in revenue, I think $HGEN’s market cap will easily be $5bil+, giving it a PPS of roughly $100+.

**BONUS -> HIGH SHORT INTEREST**

$HGEN short interest has almost doubled from Feb 26->Mar 15!!!. Yahoo finance estimates a 26% short interest as of Mar 15 w/ a Short ratio of 4.12 given the stock’s low trading volume. With the recent drop in price the past couple days, I would not be surprised if this number was higher. TL;DR -> more fuel for the rocket ships

**BONUS BONUS – CAR-T implications and more**

Lenzilumab is a cytokine storm drug, not a COVID drug. It is also in a phase 1b/2 study (ZUMA-19) where it is paired w/ a CAR-T drug Yescarta (by $GILD) for the treatment of relapsed/refractory Large B-Cell lymphoma. Car-T therapy is basically genetically engineered T-cells that can target a specific protein, or cancer. The main issue with CAR-T therapy is that it has significant side effects via cytokine storm and neurologic toxicity. Early studies have already shown that Lenzilumab significantly reduces cytokine storm side effects in CAR-T and actually IMPROVES overall efficacy. The readout for this study is planned for this year and there is precedent for CAR-T FDA approval based on phase 2 studies. I don’t have the energy to go into detail so I will leave it at that, but this has HUGE long term possibilities and gives $HGEN significant long term value outside of COVID

\*\*Edit to expand on CAR-T a bit more: I don’t want to downplay this, I think it’s very promising and I’m very bullish on it, but I’m admittedly not as researched on the minutia and writing up covid stuff tired me out XD. There’s 3 main players in the Car-T space and Lenzilumab (which has the patent for preventing Cytokine storm and neurotoxicity related to T cell therapy) could be the missing piece to make this therapy safer. $GILD had dropped another anti-GM-CSF drug from $KNSA and decided to go ahead with just lenzilumab, as well.

Lenzilumab also is in a phase 2/3 study for preventing/treating acute GvHD and also CMML phase 2.

$HGEN also has ifabotuzumab, a drug for treating solid tumors, which is currently in phase 1

**TL;DR: Short term covid play w/ ++high upside (potential 5-10x ROI) and high short-interest w/ long term CAR-T potential.**

Imo, $HGEN is a very appealing short term, high risk phase 3 COVID trial play with extremely high reward. With successful P3 studies, I see the PPS skyrocketing to 60+ and w/ EUA to 100+ (5bil+ market cap) as a conservative estimate. With stockpiling and ex-USA partnerships, the PPS will soar past 100 and w/ CAR-T the potential is even greater. Of course, the downside is a failed trial and price plummets to around $6 I think. Given the stocks low float and low trading volume, it is very volatile and subject to easy price manipulation. It has dropped approx. 25% the past month down to $13.76 and is extremely appealing at this price range. There is downside, but the upside is much much greater.

2021-04-29 14:00:05,wallstreetbets,"Nice DD. You’ve even solidified my conviction.
FYI
I’m holding 500shares @$ 12:80"
2021-04-29 14:34:41,wallstreetbets,Surprised this isn’t getting more traction. Undervalued AF. I agree that a buyout seems more likely than unlikely. This can be viewed as a short term scalp and/or a long-term hold.
2021-04-29 09:47:55,wallstreetbets,Looks good

2021-04-29 09:48:25,wallstreetbets,I’m confused at what the word “soaring” means. Can some one explain what it means ?
2021-04-29 06:38:26,wallstreetbets,This is only the start. They redid there entire strategy in January and it’s been doing really well. I see a complete different stronger company emerging and this q1 is the proof of it. The company has had win after win these last months and all the news is culminating into today’s win.
2021-04-29 06:31:20,wallstreetbets,Maybe we should bring It back to da moon

2021-04-29 07:46:45,wallstreetbets,Nokia has an absolutely ridiculous float. I don't think we'll see a squeeze here unless they invent a phone that cures cancer.
2021-04-29 07:18:55,wallstreetbets,its a huge value share and most ETF's are now rotating from tech growth to stocks like these for larger returns in light of yields and inflation rising. Basically its time has come imo
2021-04-29 08:16:09,wallstreetbets,They already had the vote approving the buyback plan last month. It was approved. That’s what put it back up above $4 up to $4.20.
2021-04-29 06:40:24,wallstreetbets,What “squeeze”?
2021-04-29 06:37:49,wallstreetbets,You think there is a chance?
2021-04-29 07:12:27,wallstreetbets,that's based on parallels from January peak not just BS. I trade a lot! Obvs that's my opinion

2021-04-29 08:12:23,wallstreetbets,This shit is getting fucking annoying everyone calling everything a squeeze.

Let's say I'm going to boost the futures and when real sellers come in they are going to knock it down which is going to create a negative view ... I would encourage anyone who's in the hedgefund business to do it because it's legal, it's a very quick way to make money and it's very satisfying."" - Jim ""Not going to say it on tv"" Cramer"

2021-04-29 10:15:29,wallstreetbets,"If you reconcile the numbers from Paysafe's SEC-filed investor and analyst presentations, you can see that prior to a stagnant 2020 due to Covid, they reported a strong 27% CAGR which is on par with high profile competitors:

2017: $864 million rev
2018 : $1.14 billion rev (+32%)
2019 : $1.418 billion rev (+24%).
2020 : $1.426 billion. (+0.5%)

Unlike many fintechs, Paysafe has heavy exposure in brick-and-mortar retail and live sporting events, both of which were absolutely crushed in 2020 due to Covid. During this market dislocation, they pivoted, “exited low value referral channels” and made up revenue by expanding in the digital wallets and e-commmerce spaces, positioning themselves better going forward.

Looking at other brick-and-mortar payment processors hard-hit during the same period, like Visa and Mastercard, Paysafe performed very well by comparison:

—Visa: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%)
— Mastercard: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%)

Not claiming that Paysafe should be valued according to these two traditional payment processors but, given their commensurate slow down during Covid, it is interesting to note that their their averaged EV/Revenue multiples would put Paysafe at $46, which is very much in line with valuation comps from fintech sector peers."

2021-04-29 15:20:52,wallstreetbets,"AMZN will likely have blowout earnings. Given that it hasn’t moved as much as other mega caps this year, I don’t think it’ll sell off. Its chart looks bullish and ready for a big move upwards. 

If it announces a split, that’s even better. Kind of strange that that was rumored yet AMZN only went up like 4% on the news. Makes me think MMs know it’s gonna happen and are trying to keep people from buying calls. 

tl;dr AMZN calls if you’re a true degenerate. Spy fd calls if you’re a sensible degenerate"

GOEV crossed an important resistance line at the end of yesterday, and higher forecasts posted.  The lawsuit is bullshit.  

If SAVA hits the mid 48.50 with momentum, it will fly.  Same price as the offering (over two months ago).  $58 is my first PT.  

Keep a close eye on the 10 year yield.  If it stay down, we could have a monster day trading Thursday.  Good luck everyone!"

2021-04-29 13:27:35,wallstreetbets,"SPY going up, but my entire portfolio is not"
2021-04-29 13:28:17,wallstreetbets,I guess it kind of makes sense that SPY could never go down in a country that inflation is skyrocketing and the value of the dollar is going down.  The market has to keep up with how weak the dollar is getting and the only way to keep up with inflation is to have money invested because sitting cash or pulling out despite dire economic conditions would mean inflation surges through your wealth and you end up poor af. Economic decline of a country is a horrendous death spiral with no way out.

I'm all about shit-talking. But the I told you so shit is getting lame.

&#x200B;

Edit: I am still holding 100 shares of MVIS I bought a long time ago after selling most at a profit. You don't want to be on your death bed and wonder what if. And unlike ""I Told You So"" Gang, losing a few hundred bucks doesn't send me into crippling debt or depression."

2021-04-29 13:05:37,wallstreetbets,"The strategy that seems to work:

When a stock first starts getting hyped on WSB, and I mean in the first day or so, buy and hold for a day or 2 and sell for 5% - 15% profit. By the time the stock goes up 5% - 10% it's too late to buy in. Don't be greedy, I learned that the hard way. Take your modest profits and dip. Ignore all ""it's gonna squeeze!!!"" and ""only paper handed bitches sell"" posts.

It seems HFs are actively hyping stocks only to pull the rug after millions buy in. Either that or they see which stocks are gaining momentum and use it to their advantage knowing many found WSB after all the publicity and have no trading experience."

2021-04-29 08:55:20,wallstreetbets,"The GME playbook:

1. Run a declining business.
2. Take a ton of debt to pay massive compensation to leadership, while mistreating low-level employees.
3. Take money from current shareholders by diluting their shares to pay off said debt, while they cheer you for it.
4. Rinse & repeat."

2021-04-29 15:23:20,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-04-29 15:22:27,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-04-29 09:22:14,wallstreetbets,Really... it doesn't even show up on the chart for TD outside the 1-day... random jump from $4.20 to $4.90
2021-04-29 12:16:56,wallstreetbets,I agree. Opened at 4.86 and now it’s down to 4.56... not sure why there is an attempt to keep the stock under $5... most other companies have an ER like NOK and they’d be up $5 on the day easy...
2021-04-29 11:16:47,wallstreetbets,lol I dont think you understand why gme is gme
2021-04-29 11:16:33,wallstreetbets,It really can’t.  There are way too many shares available to allow for a squeeze.  It is undervalued IMO however.
2021-04-29 14:05:14,wallstreetbets,Good luck with that.
2021-04-29 06:51:16,wallstreetbets,Let me guess. You think they are all hedge fund bots to distract us from GME?
2021-04-29 12:45:07,wallstreetbets,There is no squeeze with NOK.  Look at the outstanding shares.  It’s not GME.  Everything isn’t GME.
2021-04-29 07:19:30,wallstreetbets,Dude it had an amazing q1. Your crazy if you think this is gonna retreat when the US market isn’t even open yet.
2021-04-29 07:24:09,wallstreetbets,Then I'll sell before open! Ha! I win you lose!
2021-04-29 07:25:33,wallstreetbets,Buy the rumor sell the news...

2021-04-29 12:50:58,wallstreetbets,You and I might just be fine tomorrow.

2021-04-29 17:09:55,wallstreetbets,"No, their mobile phones manufacturing business was sold as HMD Global to Microsoft.
HMD Global uses the Nokia branding by a licensing agreement.

Nokia itself is out of the consumer mobile phone manufacturing business and is not owned by Microsoft."
2021-04-29 08:27:23,wallstreetbets,"Jesus do you retards even understand market cap? NOK can't moon like other stocks. Look at how many shares NOK has. Mooning for NOK is .50 to 1.00

You ever wonder why Ford is $12 and GM is 55? Do you think GM is 4x the company Ford is? No its about market cap. 

I dont know why im bothering explaining this. Only reason 80% of you bought NOK is bEcAuSe iTs cHeAp bRo."
2021-04-29 12:28:48,wallstreetbets,Dude NOK is major 5G and indestructible phone is strong stock. Paper ✋ :( do some research on it

2021-04-29 11:13:10,wallstreetbets,I’m thinking a pile of bag holders cashed in this morning.
2021-04-29 10:10:49,wallstreetbets,I saw the promise. Bought some calls. We'll see what happens! If it can break 5-10 bucks we'll see lots of these calls exercised. There was a buying frenzy for call options at open for sure.
2021-04-29 10:01:41,wallstreetbets,"Fuck them, I'm still holding."
2021-04-29 12:20:38,wallstreetbets,I'm retarded. Can you explain this to me like I'm a slow 5th grader?

2021-04-29 10:20:13,wallstreetbets,How is that going to generate revenue and profit?
2021-04-29 07:48:24,wallstreetbets,The fact that they are sitting on that much R&D and struggling to dominate their market should tell you the company has leadership problems.
2021-04-29 15:33:15,wallstreetbets,"hope so, bought at 4.8 and lost a lot today"
2021-04-29 07:16:12,wallstreetbets,This is so played out

2021-04-29 06:50:08,wallstreetbets,What are you talking about? I have 1000 of NOK at $4.2 and now it is almost $5. I didn't think it would hit $5 till next year.
2021-04-29 07:13:13,wallstreetbets,NOK is up .76 (over 18%) in pre-market on a stellar earnings beat. You don’t realize anyone can verify this with Google or Yahoo or literally anything right?
2021-04-29 07:05:27,wallstreetbets,Why are you assuming she is lying?
2021-04-29 09:22:46,wallstreetbets,Pathetic trolling attempt

2021-04-29 12:49:07,wallstreetbets,"So treat money like it's my shit and fling it at the walls like an ape? I can do that!

But then what do I do with my shit?"
2021-04-29 11:54:28,wallstreetbets,Idk what that means
2021-04-29 09:15:43,wallstreetbets,"It's market cap isn't that high, like what 26b with sales of 21b, 8b cash, yearly earnings of probably 0.4/share, P/E around 15, with new generation of network growth and expansion of Enterprise customers into developing their own network to sopport IOT. Not necessarily a growth stock, but a PE of 15 in this market is very conservative."
2021-04-29 12:31:00,wallstreetbets,I didn’t paper hand I removed my support because of the layoffs. The second I read about them I decided I’d prefer to make/lose money elsewhere and it took a long time for the stock to come back to where I can break even.
2021-04-29 09:52:18,wallstreetbets,"I'm just a poor boy, i bought long calls you see"
2021-04-29 19:00:18,wallstreetbets,If you went in for a short gain yeah. Long term this is a great stock to hold
2021-04-29 14:25:51,wallstreetbets,I fomo'd @ $4.7 thinking it was a dip lol
2021-04-29 18:22:32,wallstreetbets,6.66 for me. 😅
2021-04-29 19:47:28,wallstreetbets,"Fret not, I got in at 6.76"
2021-04-29 18:43:32,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-04-29 17:55:45,wallstreetbets,🙈
2021-04-29 11:16:51,wallstreetbets,Nok is a day trading stock it's never going to be higher than 9$ ever. It didn't 10 years ago when there phones were top sellers on the market. They definitely wont now.
2021-04-29 14:43:56,wallstreetbets,I did too. I took my initial investment of the table this morning. I'm letting the house money ride.
2021-04-29 12:23:50,wallstreetbets,A leap is an option that expires more than a year from now. You can buy (or could earlier) a contract with an expiration of 01/20/23 and a strike of $4.50 for $100 (or $1 per share). It’s a very affordable gamble to pay. if NOK hits $5.50 and stays there the next 1.75 years you break even.
2021-04-29 15:51:10,wallstreetbets,thats after. i have like 38 calls. $17 07/16
2021-04-29 08:15:34,wallstreetbets,I'm in the 2023 Leaps as well..they are going to pay big!

2021-04-29 17:37:08,wallstreetbets,it's a nascent market
2021-04-29 18:10:48,wallstreetbets,Do not panic sell... this was just the initial bump from good earnings. Next week will tell you more about which way the stock will continue to trend which has to be up. Q1 earnings this good are heavy indication of a wild next three Qs this stock is gonna wrap up the year around $8-9
2021-04-29 10:24:23,wallstreetbets,"So is your mum, but we all still visit her."

2021-04-29 13:06:09,wallstreetbets,Compost for steady gains
2021-04-29 11:58:20,wallstreetbets,"Second comment from someone saying this today lol.  
It means no one knows at all if it’s too late to buy everything is speculation. You could buy now and it moons or it could lose half its value. All through history people have tried to figure out financial systems and at the end of the day no one knows 100% the method to ensure complete success and endless profit. Unless your the government where you can just print money at your hearts desire."
2021-04-29 09:56:55,wallstreetbets,"Because I'm easy buy, easy hold"
2021-04-29 15:09:11,wallstreetbets,I did too and then I kept buying and got my cost basis pretty low. Feeling galaxy brain rn
2021-04-29 11:55:36,wallstreetbets,"A dollar is worth half as much as it was 10 years ago due to QE.  It can hit $18, easy."
2021-04-29 14:39:05,wallstreetbets,NOK is not selling phones but mobile phone infrastructure
2021-04-29 10:32:29,wallstreetbets,Makes sense
2021-04-29 19:38:51,wallstreetbets,"I agree, but look at NOK R&D budget since 2013, they spend a metric fuckton, for lame ass results. They might have sweet tech, but their ability to leverage it for cash flow has been awful."
2021-04-29 11:41:39,wallstreetbets,Nah she's played out too

These weed companies will need time to get profitable and claim market, COVID isn't helping. Other shorter term opportunities going on.

If you wanna hold long ok, but I don't see any short/mid term profits on those anymore"

Tilray and aphria even after the merger don’t stand a chance in the US. And no they are not operating in the US. Their “foot in the door”, is a beverage company and they have no access to state licensing. Be very careful of this."

2021-04-29 05:03:16,wallstreetbets,I like me some Broken Coast but Tilray and the rest of Aphria are pretty much the epitome of bad legal cannabis products in Canada.

2021-04-29 04:43:29,wallstreetbets,"I think sweetwater was one aquisition to get into the US market and there are more to come. This comes at a price in exchange for lower net income, but the LPs have another focus than the MSO. The merger takes time to restructure things. They will be the biggest global company and that is what investors are betting on. Sometimes it is not the concept or profit which decides success alone, see tesla, sometimes it is just the market share and size."

2021-04-29 06:54:09,wallstreetbets,I think it's gonna be less than 2 years. The tax money saved and received is too much. Look at what happened with NJ legalizing and NY following very fast because they saw the missed tax revenue.
2021-04-29 05:42:18,wallstreetbets,How did you do this?
2021-04-29 10:19:18,wallstreetbets,What is happening rn
2021-04-29 17:27:04,wallstreetbets,"I agree 100% with you but until that happens I don't see weed stocks getting huge gains like we see with ocgn, mvis, mindmed etc 

That's why I don't think people should be immobilizing $$ in weed now, foregoing other possible gains 

Waiting 6-12 Months for something to moon is too much, unless it has 1000% potential 
Lots of short term 20-50% opportunities lately 

What do I know though if they legalize tomorrow it might moon
Just my way of thinking hehe"
2021-04-29 06:46:14,wallstreetbets,Yeah... with aphria you come out with an extra .15-.20 per share after the conversion.

2021-04-29 12:01:17,wallstreetbets,They have a “foot” in the door through a beverage company? Where are there state licenses gonna come from? They have zero access at the moment.

2021-04-29 04:25:16,wallstreetbets,"Worldwide? Cannabis is still illegal in almost every country in the world, so worldwide is a bit of a stretch"
2021-04-29 10:07:18,wallstreetbets,Against already established companies in the US already distributing weed? I don’t understand why people think Canadian companies will profit so quickly off US legalizing. Like they just going to walk in and have all proper permits to distribute immediately. Weeds highly regulated and these Canadian companies won’t just waltz in so easily. Sweet water is a beer company. Completely different than weed laws and regulations. But who knows I could be wrong being pessimistic.

ANYONE reading this...just do yourself a favor and google Curaleaf's branding. Honestly, compared to other legal companies, it looks like hot dog shit on a summer day. absolutely horrible. 

Same goes with Trulieve. ""Sunshine cannabis"" and ""Binske."" Both are absolute dumpster fires.  Neither company has a brand worth distributing nationally or internationally. Dumpster fire companies being propped up by restrictive laws."
2021-04-29 06:14:17,wallstreetbets,"You fucking idiot. 

So people can invest in dumpster fires like Trulieve who just spent $60,000,000 on THREE FUCKING RETAIL STORES. Fucktards like you couldn't see the future of cannabis if it was right in front of your face.

FUCK OFF WITH YOUR PURE IGNORANCE and take your bullshit back to the home of the ignorant: r/cannabisMSOs."
2021-04-29 09:40:02,wallstreetbets,lol being able to sell alcohol and weed are two completely different licenses. Which weed ones are already sold to US companies that are already turning a profit. This means nothing besides alcohol sales

2021-04-29 05:26:25,wallstreetbets,You hear this rubbish all the time just like you hear people still trying to pretend legal weed is terrible. Aphrias weed has won numerous awards. Go check out other Subreddits like OCS etc and you'll see plenty of reviews.

However, if you believe or are invested in Cannabis with the idea that decriminalization is going to occur, then you would realize that the state licenses model will likely have to change at that point.....so any advantage would likely be null.

It is likely that once the Tilphria merger is complete that they will continue to pursue US options. Tilray has a history of conducting beneficial mergers."

They run circles around LPs on their financials and will only continue to do so. It’s just facts. Once MSOs can uplist we’ll see a shift in the balance of multiples and true separation, but I do agree there is a short-term opportunity on LPs due to a misunderstanding of the market by the general population."
2021-04-29 12:56:45,wallstreetbets,That’s a fair point. I’m just tired of seeing people act like it’s going to moon because it may become legal in the US. People just assume it’s going to be easy for them to waltz on over already established US companies distributing in the US already.

100% exactly. Even if the legal landscape changes, the MSO's are firmly entrenched and rooted in both the business and political/lobbying world of the US. They ain't goin' *anywhere,* and they will protect their turf. Leave Canadian LP's in 2018 where they belong; MSO's for the future!"
2021-04-29 10:20:56,wallstreetbets,Not the cannabis market lmao just the over saturated craft beer market. Do you understand how legalization is even going to work? I’m willing to bet you have no clue.
2021-04-29 18:17:07,wallstreetbets,"RIGHT......

The beer has derivatives of Cannabis....so......there is that. 

You can already buy it at a gas station, so channels of distribution......check.

I'M SO TIRED OF THIS BS ""NO EXPOSURE"" ARGUMENT.

SOMEONE PLEASE LIST A CANNABIS COMPANY OTHER THAN TILRAY THAT ALREADY SELLS ANY PRODUCT IN GAS STATIONS.........NONE RIGHT? 

IM SERIOUS........ CAPS SO THIS IS READ, IF THERE IS ONE, I'D LIKE TO INVEST IN THEM TOO."
2021-04-29 18:31:39,wallstreetbets,It just doesn’t make sense  though. A lot of the states that have legalized require the MSOs to cultivate product within the state. There is a big misunderstanding with people on what legalization means. It’s basically the federal government getting out of the way of the states for the states to make the decisions on how they want to operate. The laws are going to vary from state to state and the MSOs are already profitable under a very difficult tax structure. While LPs are not in a country where it’s legal.
2021-04-29 06:33:34,wallstreetbets,"I think we can all agree there's good and bad legal weed just like there's good and bad illegal weed. So statements like ""legal weed is shit"" never need to be said."

The future of cannabis is in branded CPG products, just like a Coke or Corona. MSOs are falsely propped up by the markets they operate and monopolize.

2021-04-29 19:48:43,wallstreetbets,"Right....I hear you man. People should consider the concept of Amazon and how it destroyed many brick and mortar companies, because in the long run........brick and mortar buildings aka dispensaries are expensive. 

They have a lot of overhead. Once you decriminalize, the cost of Cannabis will drop significantly, those with the highest overhead will suffer the most as their margin will take massive hits....aka.....dispensaries with their employees, rent/mortgage, real estate taxes etc.....

Why is it so difficult for people to think that if it's decriminalized, you might just buy your flower, oil, edibles, etc online.

Anyone awake out there?"

You are a try hard. You're emotionally attached to Tilray. It's obvious.

2021-04-29 12:00:24,wallstreetbets,You’re confusion is what’s making you look dumb. And your inability to form a coherent sentence is a big tell on that too.  You have to be licensed to sell these products and Tilray and Apha hold zero US cannabis Licenses combined. But hey keep doing those mental gymnastics on here and further prove my point that you know nothing about the legalization process in the states and think that your company will cash in. How you looking today or the last 3 weeks…..lol

2021-04-29 07:32:16,wallstreetbets,"you should read up on some things before doing options. start with iv & theta. mainly iv crush & theta decay.

your good with your options. until you got it all figured out, you shouldn’t go too far otm. 
I would doubt that it will make a big difference unless you actually know what you’re doing & the underlying does make really big moves in a short timeframe. 

I personally wouldn’t roll up until I’m at least 2 strikes ITM & super bullish. so roll 10 strike to 14, if it’s safe at 12.5 & your optimistic for at least 15-16."

2021-04-29 07:41:36,wallstreetbets,Thank you so much!  I stuck with paper trading until now.  I usually read and watch but I am really risk averse.  Someone explaining why options lower your risk gave me the courage and interest to try.  But I’m not one for infinite gain or loss.  Thank you again!  I appreciate so much information in the answer!
2021-04-29 07:50:24,wallstreetbets,I’d just like to see you back up your name!
2021-04-29 16:52:37,wallstreetbets,admin
2021-04-29 08:21:53,wallstreetbets,But infinite gains and loss are the best part
2021-04-29 11:36:02,wallstreetbets,Anyone telling you that options lower your risk is probably the same person who's selling them to you above the ask lmao. Options are inherently more risky than shares by nature of being derivatives with *expiration dates*
2021-04-29 11:45:00,wallstreetbets,See for a long time I only sold covered calls on things I wanted to sell eventually.  Yeah.  That cautious.  This was a big break out for me.  Little little ape.
2021-04-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Reddit called it right - Nokia hype is real - Q1 results You guys were right - Nokia is the share to look out for on its way to the skies!

I spent 10 years with the company, now off and not under any NDA or limit to trading, so I’m now happy to throw some money at the share.

Nokia results this morning show good growth and strong pick up in profitability! Beating the estimates with a comfortable margin. With the house cleaned from bad leadership and product transformation well on its way, I think there are a few benchmarks that support price doubling.

Base business alone supports 50% up: Look at Ericsson: Although Nokia’s business is broader (I come to this why the real gem is there), at the heart is a business similar to Ericsson: 5G Networks. Ericsson trades at double the valuation. This should not be as customers, Operators, want to keep their vendors balanced to avoid paying massively more for their equipment and SW. This valuation gap will close as the roadmap gap has now been closed. Nokia is well ahead on future technologies such as Open RAN and Cloud RAN. 

In addition to Ericsson, Nokia has a better licensing and patenting business being a stronger brand and getting all the patents from Alcatel-Lucent as well. Also in terms of 5G patents, the long term money maker, Nokia is well ahead. This business is basically revenue=profit, thus its key to keep in mind.

Then there is the gem of the business: IP and Optical Networks. This is the crown jewel here, this part is always forgotten by analysts and investors. These guys are brilliant, top engineers and researchers sitting in Mountain View and Belgium, and as shown by the Q1 results, in a growth area. They make incredible products. Go and have a look at the valuation of Cisco (200B company), Juniper. Back? Good, these guys absolutely smoke both companies when it comes to technology alone. Have a look at Arista. Now Network Infrastructure division also provides similar dc networking equipment to the webscale companies like Apple and Microsoft. Arista alone is worth as much as whole Nokia, so there is massive upside here. The worst case is that this part is sold to a Private Equity investor, I know some are after it. This means maybe 10-15B valuation for it. Great, but I think this has potential for so much more. 

Why it has underperformed: Bad management and badly managed merger with Alcatel lucent. Nokia was held back for years by really incompetent management - that management has now been cleaned out. How incompetent? Think hiring senior people based on private life matters…Think throwing half of your R&D budget on a single customers request… New CEO, new Business Group presidents, transformation well under way (since 2,5 years in 5G), and potential in the share to double when executed right. And way beyond that thanks to that nice IP and Optical business. Think Cisco scale. 


Excited to see how the market takes to this today. The fundamentals are solid, and engineering competence is there, the results are coming in!!"
2021-04-29 03:47:14,wallstreetbets,Nice ! Now i can nearly break even. It is nearly back to the level it reached on the first GME hype.
2021-04-29 11:23:23,wallstreetbets,Yes. Now I’m watching it fall from the sky.
2021-04-29 02:58:30,wallstreetbets,"As much as I agree with you, the did not annouce a buy back of shares thus we still have 5b floating stocks"

2021-04-29 03:17:51,wallstreetbets,"I read in an article somewhere that their operating cost are high and thus unable to compete with other 5G providers.  So they got the boot in the China market because they couldn't complete in terms of cost.  The local companies and Ericsson does it cheaper than them.  I don't know the stock doesn't seem to ever trade outside the 4 - 4:20 range.  Been like that for a long time, except when it became a meme stock during that crazy January rally."

Groundbreaking! It's a rip!"

2021-04-29 08:24:46,wallstreetbets,"Yeah? Well I can’t wait to buy XX,XXX shares of NOK from the massive profits I’m gonna make from my GME position. Don’t hate on me when I’m contributing to your cause🤟"

So now I'm gonna hold on to it for far longer maybe. Idk if it'll moon, but I'm hoping it does see some growth. Or at least until I can sell some shares and get my investment back, but still have the majority of shares I bought."

2021-04-29 03:23:50,wallstreetbets,And????? It’s a massive beat on all metrics f the float brah it’s fn simple math
2021-04-29 03:45:38,wallstreetbets,"But share price is 4$. What does it matter if there is 5b floating stocks?  You want to buy in 10k usd? That is 2500shares. If you want to buy 10k Amazon shares you can buy 4 for that amount. It is low interest in the market to invest significant amount of money in NOK  not the number of shares, as I see it."
2021-04-29 15:17:04,wallstreetbets,"Same, I sold mine. But I love money more than I hate any stock, might have to hope back on the train."
2021-04-29 03:54:24,wallstreetbets,"The Chinese market is a honey trap. Government decides which market share is given to each vendor, there is no real bid process there. Furthermore, in order to sell there, you have to open up your technology, in other words, set up as joint company owned 50% by locals. Which is to say, any innovation you have going into the market, Huawei and ZTE get to copy. So why do it? China volume was massive, they built more than rest of the world combined so it drives your volume up and cost down. But in the long run, you really get beaten up there. Hence I’m actually glad that Chinese market is such a fractional part of Nokia."
2021-04-29 03:56:21,wallstreetbets,How are they winning contracts in all markets then?
2021-04-29 03:23:09,wallstreetbets,"I have to agree here, currently NOK is shaky at best. I buy some whenever it's bellow 3.50 cause it goes back up to around 4.15/20, but that's all the action there seem to be ahead. Even any of promising news they had since start of the year barely got them to move up."
2021-04-29 03:26:44,wallstreetbets,I think the stock is testing the upper limits right now.
2021-04-29 08:18:46,wallstreetbets,how's it doing today? Look into open RAN and Nokia Bell labs plus the EU hexa project for 6g
2021-04-29 07:05:38,wallstreetbets,Nokia has 5.6 Billion ... that's with a B ... outstanding shares. It is mathematically impossible for this stock to go anywhere because of this.
2021-04-29 04:31:09,wallstreetbets,"I know this is not yet massive, but I’m just saying the fundaments are there to drive this share up for the next year or years. It’s really a value play"
2021-04-29 08:57:02,wallstreetbets,There cannot be a squeeze on NOK due to the billions of shares they issued. No need to hide your share purchase. Of course im just a Melvin intern spreading FUD

2021-04-29 09:28:47,wallstreetbets,"It means the potential stock price isn’t going to be very high like $10-$15 tops,"
2021-04-29 03:58:28,wallstreetbets,Good points.
2021-04-29 03:59:56,wallstreetbets,Well Huawei and ZTE are under sanctions and pretty much shut out from everywhere.  Leaves Ericsson and pretty much nok.  I don't think Ericsson can handle all the contracts.  Not saying nok isn't good but the sanctions are definately helping them win some.
2021-04-29 08:51:36,wallstreetbets,You will go blue in the face explaining that to these idiots. They only bought NOK because it was $4~ and they could buy 100 shares and feel like big boy investors. These same people think stock price is low but don't look at how many shares they have compared to market cap.
2021-04-29 06:06:16,wallstreetbets,"Only on WSB, does a ~14% short-term gain disappoint people :D"
2021-04-29 03:50:12,wallstreetbets,Got it and true it should only get better from here!
2021-04-29 06:43:04,wallstreetbets,"hey, employee of sister company of Nokia here, Ericsson buys a lot of the accessories from us - kinda funny that even if Ericsson builds it up, the money flows back to Nok"
2021-04-29 07:56:14,wallstreetbets,"And the sanctions will not go away as huawei is an arm of the Chinese army and ZTE is similarly compromised. It's about national security of cellular networks, it will never change unless China changes."

2021-04-29 08:39:41,wallstreetbets,"NOK stock movements are a bit baffling because eof the number of shares out there. A .50 share price move is a 3 billion market cap change. It should be obvious on a sub based around options plays, really."
2021-04-29 10:05:24,wallstreetbets,"There's buying 0dte calls retarded(this sub) and then there is misinformed retarded(you). Sorry about your NOK, don't take it out on me"
2021-04-29 09:32:47,wallstreetbets,No it's not do some research. A company whose share price is $5 vs a company whose share price is $10. The $5 company could be worth a ton more due to its market cap. Share price at face value tells you nothing about a companies worth
2021-04-29 08:54:47,wallstreetbets,Yea nobody can grasp that NOK has billions of shares it will not moon in the same way other stocks moon. They only bought NOK because they are poor and shares are only $4!!1!1

2021-04-29 12:47:48,wallstreetbets,"Yea I think you are misunderstanding the argument. If company ""A"" has 100,000 shares and company ""B"" has 100,000,000,000. It will take ALOT of volume to move the stock of company B and the movements wont be parabolic. It's very simple really.

2021-04-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Analyzing the chart! $CLOV mods are 🌈 🐻

how to read:  ***light green & yellow squiggles are just there to help guide you,*** and see the patterns that I am seeing. Obviously it can go against all these indicators, so they serve as a historical reference here to show a pattern. I believe we are in the best position to load up here at all time lows.. so lets fuckin go!

Above, you can see each *red base was followed by an incredible run* on the short-sellers.

* Today we BUSTED through that center regression line at 10.50$ , and have now broken above the 200-day moving average (purple line) - **BULLISH**
* TRIPLE BOTTOM in April - **SUPER BULLISH REVERSAL**
* MACD shows we have completely Reversed!  We are trending up against all resistance, and the TTM squeeze is showing momentum with the increasing blue bars!  the Buy Signal arrows also support reversal - **BULLISH**
* Heikin Ashi candles are **GREEN** meaning positive upward trend!
* dream setup from a technical perspective, and fundamentals back it up...  just makes sense.

\*\*\*my position is 4,000 shares @ 9.50 + 100 contracts of the 5/21 30$ Call

2021-04-29 02:17:57,wallstreetbets,"Let’s take into consideration that the company is far more undervalued when it is being compared with other archaic  medical insurance companies with stock price ranging from 100 dollars up to 400 dollars per stock.

With its revolutionary technology (AI) used in the insurance sector, this stock can EASILY 10x in a matter of months . It’s getting approved in more and more states and counties .

Chamath especially loves this company because it uses artificial intelligence technology to analyze customers’ data. Think about how Tesla went from 5 dollars to 500 dollars a share in just a few months . If I see CLOV hitting 20 by the end of this week , I would not be surprised . The company is currently undervalued because of those fucking shorters who hate new startups with disruptive technology .

CLOV is the Tesla of the healthcare insurance sector. With Democrats’ control of the house , Medicare will expand significant in the next few months .

If you missed MVIS, RKT, Tesla , or even SKT. This is your chance . Bottom line, I will see you on the moon apes 🦍🚀💎"

2021-04-29 08:58:04,wallstreetbets,"This stock is dope because the downside risk is minimum and the upside potential is high yield. It' currently hovering around 11, it's not going to tank much lower than that. But on the flipside it's likely to see 15+ within the next 9 weeks. I feel it's a good buy."

2021-04-29 08:18:23,wallstreetbets,"Most of the shorts are in at 15 or lower, so we likely wouldn't short squeeze at 15. Would probably take 20.

Delta on 10C is only 0.62, so could see a gamma if price has a strong bullish movement. 200k OI between 10 and 20."
2021-04-29 02:41:40,wallstreetbets,Yeah 12$~ is the next area we need to hold but then after that 15$ should be easy w/ momentum - those are just standard deviation channels that show the 14$ area

If that margin improves by 5%, it takes them out of low cash, and could make the stock blow up, since they are expanding.

Tech doesn't matter if companies run out of money, hence why May earnings are important."

This is almost lining up to be deflation before earnings, and I'm not really sure why that would mean ""moon"" after earnings...  


Edit:   


I need to clarify something retarded I thought... not the good kind of retarded.  


For some reason Schwab worded things in a way that made me think earnings was this coming Monday, which was really the foundation for my worry here.  


I think we've got plenty of time to ride up now. I'm not surprised at all that we just experienced a mini p&d simply on the excitement of people getting in. I don't really think we're looking at the rise to earnings yet."

2021-04-29 07:53:42,wallstreetbets,"I delved into their financial report and it seems they report their earnings in several ways:

> Nokia presents financial information on a reported, comparable (until the fourth quarter of 2020 non-IFRS) and constant currency basis. Comparable measures presented in this document exclude intangible asset amortization and other purchase price fair value adjustments, goodwill impairments, restructuring related charges and certain other items affecting comparability. In order to allow full visibility on determining comparable results, information on items affecting comparability is presented separately for each of the components of profit or loss. Constant currency reporting provides additional information on change in financial measures on a constant currency basis in order to better reflect the underlying business performance. Therefore, change in financial measures at constant currency excludes the impact of changes in exchange rates in comparison to euro, our reporting currency. 

TL;DR the 551m net income number is on comparable basis. Their net reported result is 431m in profit, leading to 0.076 EPS.

2021-04-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"FUTU looks promising  

FUTU recently got an upgrade from BofA with a price target of $195. I use the FUTU's moomoo desktop app and I can tell it is a good-looking full-fledged trading platform. It has options trading but the only drawback compared to Robinhood is it does not allow spreads yet, however you can sell naked puts or calls. Also, it has a nice option chain way better than Robinhood. I never had any issue with executing any trades. I feel like they will attract a lot of people from Robinhood if they offer coin trading and options spreads in the future.

Although the stock looks expensive,  FUTU is still growing really fast both in China and in the USA, I think it has a good chance of outperforming in the short term. Most analysts have a buy rating on this stock with an average price target of $196.83.

I considered this when I reached my conclusion. I currently have about 25-35 pages written in DDs after completing this one.

I was considering writing a grand DD that combines them and takes a forward look at the overall economy with historical context in mind. It would be a 3-5 max character post report. 

In it, I ultimately argue and speculate that Tesla will be America's #1 company valued beyond 4 trillion dollar market cap, dethroning Apple's position as the US leading company and SPYs rise to 600 by 2024."

2021-04-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Upcoming Catalysts for GOEV. Short interest update and truck preorders. $GOEV🚀🚀🚀🚀 Edit: Im putting these two sources here To exemplify GOEVs squeeze potential, because aside from me actually liking what they are creating, smoothbrained apes might want to see how Canoo is 30% short with a 30% borrow rate. That's to say for every $9 stock borrowed they're paying A $3 premium. You do the math. Especially when there's only 100,000 shares available out of 90 million. 

https://fintel.io/shortSqueeze

https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GOEV


Alright Canootards,

EVs are out of fashion these days, which is all the more reason to Go EV bargain hunting. GOEV may have just been used and tossed out like a cheap SPAhhhC h\*\*ker, but we can transform her into our own Pretty Woman Julia Roberts. There’s countless amounts of DD on the groundbreaking tech GOEV engineers as well as the cat calls they receive from the likes of Hyundai and allegedly Apple, so I won’t go into their actual product, because if you know you know. Aside from mentioning that GOEV titillates my inner teenager that spent years bluntsliding paint off of municipal curbs, with their “Skateboard” design that allows for unlimited interchangeability. This is to say, normal car production can take 3+ years, but with GOEVs design they’ll be able to just swap out shells and have new designs in one year. Heels are out? No worries. GOEV will be able to keep up with the trends. Gas is out. Electric is in.

These are the upcoming catalysts for GOEV.

Short interest is at 30%. 90 million share float in which 30 million shares are short; according to NASDAQ and Market Watch. I know ya’lls favorite word is squeeze...especially when you can hold positions in a promising company.

&#x200B;

[short interest](https://preview.redd.it/1mw87ccvh1w61.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f61c6f750bc32a35715f2a434040aac8f45f13d4)

&#x200B;

Goev truck pre orders coming out very soon, Q2 of 2021. This will be a catalyst in itself. Estimated starting price is $32,000. Affordability creates huge market share as we've seen with the Model 3.

On whale wisdom, GOEVs Put/Call ratio is only .58. That’s an extremely bullish sign, as Nio is 1.06, AAPL is 1.05. This means there is roughly 2x as many calls as there are puts. With this amount of bullishness on GOEV I think it imprudent to be shorting Canoo.

&#x200B;

[put\/call ratio](https://preview.redd.it/2ob9lqbuh1w61.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=682027750e3415e0bc55d223853af58790ee5216)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They were projected to burn through 14 cents a share last quarter but their burnrate was only 8 cents a share. Not a good thing, as they don’t have production yet, but they are being more frugal than analysts thought.

**Potential Drawbacks** CEO Ulrich Kranz just stepped down and was replaced by Tony Aquila. Although Aquila has quite the impressive resume, and was personally involved with the design of their truck, I was enthused by Ulrich’s extensive experience with BMW. BUUUT remember that Martin Eberhard was also CEO of TESLA before Musk. Also, John Sculley when he douched Steve Jobs. Also, Aquila said he would forego compensation and be paid in Stock. I love when management stands behind their work.

Also, Canoo is under litigation due to spreading rumors that they would be working with Hyundai. Aquila said that they were just rumors. No doubt Canoo benefited from these rumors at the expense of their investors. I still like the product but I will admit that this was a real nutslapper.

2021-04-29 03:57:49,wallstreetbets,"Full disclosure:
Started with 25@16.67. Currently in with 500@10.75.
No options yet.

I really don’t see Canoo as a short term play. They are currently being shorted because in their current state, they are smoke and mirrors. They came with a very innovative design, an innovative business model and strong partnerships. But now, the strong partnership is history, the business model drastically change, and they haven’t produced a single consumer level car.

So why am I still in? I like the cars and I would be losing if I sold. So I intend to keep buying the dips and maybe some calls... that way, 2-3 years down the road, assuming they haven’t gone to crap, I will hope their shit goes to the moon...

2021-04-29 14:39:47,wallstreetbets,"Smoke and mirrors indicates they have been tying to hype up something like Nikola. Canoo has real technology, patents, and a world-class engineering team. They also never hyped anything. They aren’t going out on CNBC or blasting commercials; they’re getting the groundwork done behind the scenes and not throwing out no-deposit preorders or potential partnerships. They are the real deal; it’s just a matter of when people find out."
2021-04-29 14:37:46,wallstreetbets,Yes. Their MPDV numbers should be out within the next month or two. Indications are strong demand both from consumers and fleets.
2021-04-29 00:47:09,wallstreetbets,"I was disappointed at the Hyundai hype, and Canoo surely benefitted from the rumors. I'll edit this in. Thanks."
2021-04-29 14:34:30,wallstreetbets,"It’s not the same. Canoo’s platform integrates a reinforced base and houses the majority of the required class 1 crash testing, an HVAC system, and has leaf springs without the struts of these other players. It also has steer- and brake-by-wire so the steering wheel can be placed anywhere in the vehicle (think UK vs. US driving). Their vehicles are also set up for level 2.5 autonomous driving with upgradable ability as technology increases."

2021-04-29 14:52:10,wallstreetbets,More context?
2021-04-29 18:17:46,wallstreetbets,"If I didn’t like their engineering, I wouldn’t have bought shares. Fundamentally, I love their cars but they are in a tough spot. They over-promised and under-delivered and that is why a lot of short-sellers are targeting the stock.
Prior to earnings call, Canoo business was supposed to be heavily reliant on a subscription based approach. Something unheard of in the automotive industry. They had promised to start making money in late 2021, through the partnership with Hyundai. After earnings call those 2 things were no longer true. While the changes to the subscription base approach reduced my bullishness to the stock, I wasn’t completely turned off. The Hyundai partnership, if what they said is true, I am ok with getting out of it. However that changes when they are expected to have income, pushing further back the payoff.
Am I saying this to turn people off? Not really. I like the stock and people should buy. But keep in mind that this is not a quick payday, this is a longer term investment. And while a squeeze could happen at some point in the future, right now the value of Canoo is not being underestimated. 
So what I am doing is: buy the dips, hold for long, at some point buy options for 2023-2024, and ride those to the moon."
2021-04-29 17:36:54,wallstreetbets,"Everything you just said is marketing like I said. The ""skateboard"" is just a chassis or frame. Most of the crash safety features are typically designed to be part of the frame. The steer and brake by wire is nerve raking as hell for a gain that really isn't much compared to current manufacturing of driving positions. Edit: now that I think of it brake by wire is already used is some hybrids. The ability to upgrade autonomous driving is cool though."
2021-04-29 17:57:56,wallstreetbets,"which of course only matters if the shorts are in the red. Like if someone shorted at the peak, they are happy right now."
2021-04-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Summer + Stimulus + Chlorine Shortage = LESL going up This is my first DD and I'll keep it short because I know you apes can't read.

Leslie's (LESL) is in the consumer pool business. They sell shit you need for your pool (like chlorine and that dye that changes colors when you piss yourself). 

Their entire business model is based on reoccurring business and take a wild guess as to when their busy season is (hint: it ain't black Friday). 

They also have this mom & pop friendly neighborhood strip mall thing going on all across American suburbia despite being a national chain. Suburban types are into that sort of vibe.

There's also a chlorine shortage (of course there is) due to the pandemic. It's driven the price of chlorine up 60%, but you wouldn't know that from the looks of Leslie's website.

My pool is a nasty piece of shit. Not only will I be using products from Leslie's when I actually clean it (still too fucking cold in the Midwest), I might just get a new one from the gains I make this summer from owning shares of LESL. (Ok, that last part might be bullshit, but I do own a pool and it is fucking filthy right now.)

Now let's see how fast this post gets deleted on a technicality.

Edit: I meant to tie the stimulus into this, but it's kinda just a bullshit hunch that middle class people who kept their jobs and keep getting gobs of government money thrown at them, like myself, have all of this extra disposable and unbudgeted cash sitting around and I speculate they might buy pools, but that's not my main argument."

2021-04-29 07:18:19,wallstreetbets,The problem with Cramer is that he recommends to buy every stock that he talks about basically. Then a week later the stock goes down. He is definitely right about AMD though.

He is 62 but can't retire until 65  because he won't have insurance until Medicare kicks in.  That's just how it is,  but has put in his time to retire and could have earlier if he had access to Medicare earlier.  His pension doesn't grow any more so he is just working to work even though he doesn't want to."

2021-04-29 07:32:08,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but remember that Bldg material is fucked because 2017 punitive tariffs pushed steel (China) and lumber (Canada) yards to work down their stock reserves, then COVID limits wiped out what was left of on-the-ground stock and reduced port throughput. It’s effectively the same for semiconductors - though you can throw in a side helping of natural disaster to fuck stock levels. 

Low interest and lots of upper-mid class with cushy wfh jobs and no entertainment/travel spending is just flooding the building market with cash/demand - its gasoline on the building fire. Let all these bitches back on planes to buy their Vuitton in person and it will reduce the need for the second kitchen remodel in 8 months. Make their Chad husbands go back to the office and they won't need the dedicated office wing so the 3 whiney kids don't bother them while they ~~surf porn all day~~ are on conference calls.

2021-04-29 13:20:11,wallstreetbets,"I think putting all of the building materials rise on upper middle class because of wfh jobs is pretty simplistic. Demand for houses has increased, not just renovating existing houses. The stimulus and savings from pandemic has created a generation of buyers that now have some money for a down payment. New builds have a lottery system in place for some areas. The inventory of houses for sale is also the lowest it’s been in a long time. It’s a combination of multiple issues. Renovation, lack of investment during pandemic lows, supply chain issues, increasing demand and more."

2021-04-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"KMI - Kinder Morgan, The Silent Sleeper Kinder Morgan

Alright ladies and gentlemen. I want to let you in on a little secret stock I stumbled upon. The stock is Kinder Morgan.

**What is Kinder Morgan?**

Kinder Morgan is an energy infrastructure company. The company operates through Natural Gas Pipelines, Products Pipelines, Terminals, and CO2 segments. The Natural Gas Pipelines segment owns and operates interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline, and underground storage systems; natural gas gathering systems and natural gas processing and treating facilities; natural gas liquids fractionation facilities and transportation systems; and liquefied natural gas liquefaction and storage facilities. 


**Why is this stock a buy?**


KMI will begin trading ex-dividend on April 29, 2021. A cash dividend payment of $0.27 per share is scheduled to be paid on May 17, 2021. Not only does this stock pay dividends, but it pays more than most stocks. 

So, it’s very likely we will see a dip on the 29th and be a good entry point for many. 

Energy infrastructure provider Kinder Morgan posted first-quarter 2021 adjusted earnings per share of 60 cents, handsomely beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 23 cents. The strong quarterly earnings were aided by higher contribution from Texas intrastate systems and the Tennessee Gas Pipeline during the winter storm in February. Moreover, favorable conditions in the CO2 segment boosted the results.

The company announced a hike of 3% in first-quarter 2021 dividend from the fourth-quarter 2020 level, as previously planned. The latest dividend of 27 cents per share translates to $1.08 on an annualized basis. The dividend is expected to be paid on May 17 to Kinder Morgan’s shareholders of record as of Apr 30.

Notably, Kinder Morgan significantly raised its 2021 net income expectation to the range of $2.7-$2.9 billion. The company projects DCF for this year within $5.1-$5.3 billion. In 2021, the leading North American energy infrastructure company expects $900 million to be used in sustaining capital expenditures. The company further informed that its Louisiana Pipeline’s Acadiana expansion plan is expected to come online by first-quarter 2022. (Kinder Morgan Q1 Earnings Beat on Texas Winter Storm)


**Crazy Inexpensive Options**


Personally, I’m not much of a shareholder. I like to trade with options. So, with this stock it’s options are ridiculously cheap. 

The prices of some 2023 leaps go for less than 1.00 premiums. Crazy cheap! **The June 18 calls are running at about 0.06-0.07 premiums for $20 strikes.**


**What’s my position?**


Currently, I am holding 150 Jan 21, 2022 calls as well as 75 Jun 18, 2021 calls. All at $20 strikes. 

**Conclusion**
Personally this stock looks really good for a long term hold, as well as a mid length hold. Leaps look like it could make some decent cash, as well as the June calls. 

If you have anything you want to add, feel free to put it in the comments.

**TLDR**
KMI calls are cheap and stock likes to go up. 6/18 $20 looks tasty. Yum."
2021-04-29 00:02:56,wallstreetbets,KMI is a solid stock. I also like energy transfer.
2021-04-28 23:41:12,wallstreetbets,"I hear yum, I buy."
2021-04-29 00:08:34,wallstreetbets,Hmm do we also get a ‘kinder’ surprise?
2021-04-29 03:09:59,wallstreetbets,"As a Finance student in an Oil and Gas based region. The industry is literally studied as undervalued, I mean, multi-billion dollar per year revenue companies with significant Dividends have a similar stock price to non-fda approved bio stocks, its crazy. Long terms plays are 100% oil and gas, their dividends are massive across the board"
2021-04-28 23:50:31,wallstreetbets,35 Jan 21 2022 calls here at $20 + shares. EZ money.
2021-04-29 01:10:55,wallstreetbets,"Kinder Morgan is a very stable stock.

It is up and down but not much.

PS: I am long 300 shares."
2021-04-29 02:11:15,wallstreetbets,2023 12C is already breaking even lol
2021-04-29 07:39:47,wallstreetbets,"I love KMI, bought it for the dividend months ago and it made also almost 20% value gain."
2021-04-28 23:36:16,wallstreetbets,I just helped build a 7 billion dollar plant (it’s still being built one of three largeeeee liabilities currently)
2021-04-29 00:29:49,wallstreetbets,"Pretty decent DD, If the stocks dips tomorrow I’ll buy some 6/18 options. Hopefully Biden will keep focusing the coming months in handling the pandemic vaccinations, civil rights, gun control and maybe even electric cars. While he didn’t specifically said anything tonight about clean energies, apart from rejoining the Paris Agreement, I don’t expect anything too big on the topic until Next Spring/Summer. Those leaps print for sure. Don’t get me wrong, but objectively speaking Shalanda Baker has her hands tied this year."
2021-04-29 10:23:59,wallstreetbets,"Reasons to like the stock:

1). Throughout the Southeast, coal-fired power plants have been replaced with combined cycle natural gas plants.  This trend will continue in the near term because we cannot build renewables fast enough and they aren’t reliable enough to warrant de-commissioning natural gas plants which can start/stop quickly to meet demand.

2). Kinder Morgan also operates ports and most ports have a limited number of tenants with loading/unloading capability.  The owner/operator of the port is literally printing money while a ship is being loaded/unloaded.  This is a fantastic play on trade."
2021-04-29 10:59:39,wallstreetbets,"Midstream MLPs are not secret stocks, they're not even really stocks tbh. They are in basically every boomer's portfolio and Richard Kinder basically walked on water in the early to mid 2000s. There has been a lot of pain for KMI since they cut their distribution (\*not a dividend) a few years back, but things do seem to be shaping up nicely in the space. I prefer EPD, to KMI but both are nice.

Edit: what the hell, probably gonna buy some KMI calls shortly."
2021-04-28 23:58:20,wallstreetbets,This is a stock for old farts.
2021-04-28 23:46:31,wallstreetbets,"If u like KMI, look at PAGP... has more upside in my humble opinion.  And a very nice dividend as well."
2021-04-29 00:12:04,wallstreetbets,"While you are looking at Kinder Morgan, check out Shell Midstream Partners, Enterprise Products Partners, Enbridge, Phillips 66 Partners and Williams Company (Sumit Sharma used to work for Williams, as an aside). These all pay PHAT dividends and offer massive upside as they are STILL around 40-50% off their pre-COVID levels - and have been growing fast since mid last year. Good luck have fun 😎"
2021-04-29 00:35:01,wallstreetbets,Excuse my ignorance but I want to tread carefully here. Am I allowed to comment if I work for a company being discussed?
2021-04-29 00:06:08,wallstreetbets,I was told by our local energy person that they are cutting down on Natural Gas under the Biden administration- I’d almost buy PUTS instead lol
2021-04-28 23:42:32,wallstreetbets,I’m going to learn how to do these calls - what platform do you use for them? I’m nom New Zealand - I signed up for tiger but not sure how easy it is to use...
2021-04-28 23:59:15,wallstreetbets,Bought some options this morning! 😋
2021-04-29 00:07:55,wallstreetbets,For 7 bucks ill test it
2021-04-29 00:21:25,wallstreetbets,$7 why the hell not.
2021-04-29 03:53:14,wallstreetbets,Just be aware it’s a PTP so you get k-1s at the end of the year which can be a pain
2021-04-29 10:54:23,wallstreetbets,Cheap cheap calls. Let’s go!!
2021-04-29 12:28:31,wallstreetbets,I am backing my truck up right now to load it up.. thx  bb
2021-04-29 12:40:21,wallstreetbets,"Do we buy calls now or wait for a red day?

Also, if I was throwing a couple hundred at it, what calls should I nab? June, Sept, Jan 2023?"
2021-04-29 16:36:55,wallstreetbets,This is a Fool favorite.
2021-04-29 18:23:37,wallstreetbets,"Many stonks have been kind to us, but this one will be Kinder. 

Been eying it for a month or so waiting for a bit of a drop. Don't think I should wait longer."
2021-04-29 18:32:33,wallstreetbets,KMI is great but .60 eps was only related to tax storm so don’t expect further beats till next Texas winter storms
2021-04-29 00:30:40,wallstreetbets,Screw the dirty oil fossil fuqers
2021-04-29 01:13:39,wallstreetbets,"ET has been a winner for me, divvies + solid gains over the last few months."
2021-04-29 18:31:44,wallstreetbets,"Real $$$ flow companies are important GME has shown that 

CLF UWM also trade at P/E rations that make no sense 

Yet crap like clov and mvis will shoot up but will never even post a positive EPS"
2021-04-29 00:14:01,wallstreetbets,"No arguments there, but my midstreams have paid tens of grand in divvies while doubling in value over the course of 6 months That's growth stock returns from old fart stonk. I'll take it, every time!"
2021-04-29 00:25:53,wallstreetbets,Now is the time to rotate into the old fart boring stocks because those make massive amounts of money when an economy booms like it is now.
2021-04-29 01:31:56,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Please talk. Be a chattie Chathy. No one will be going after you, this will never be a gme stonk. Talk about your every minute at work. Go."
2021-04-29 01:08:26,wallstreetbets,"As long as you don’t talk about information that isn’t public you should be fine. So after getting that out of the way, what are your insights?"
2021-04-29 00:24:44,wallstreetbets,What's a local energy person? This can't be a real job title...
2021-04-28 23:47:48,wallstreetbets,I use TD Ameritrade and RH so I’m not sure if they available in NZ.
2021-04-29 00:10:38,wallstreetbets,"Bro I am Kiwi too. You want Tiger Trade, it is excellent, very low cost, and super fast execution times. Drawback? it is Chinese. SO WHAT so is my phone, my computer, my headphones (Huawei) and my neighbour (Mr Zhang). Love them all, love Tiger too. Go for it.

Check out Tiger Trade training vids on YouTube, there is a Singaporean dude who does some good ones to get you going."
2021-04-29 00:18:45,wallstreetbets,"Trust me, I own a couple dozen of these ""boring-as-fuck"" stocks....and to be honest, I forget I even have them sometimes. The divvy is nice, but I prefer to put capital into high-beta. Accelerated higher ROC are what keep me in this."
2021-04-29 01:41:13,wallstreetbets,"Lol no, I completely agree with that part. This is by far a dividend stock. And in my experience with KMI, it hasn’t seen the $20 range consistently in some time. Literally years. When it grows, it grows slow. Even if KMI transports more natural gas than pretty much anyone, and they are working on getting into moving hydrocarbons...I still don’t see it going much higher. But, I could be wrong. If crude goes to 70-80/bbl the profits will be significant. Just my two cents. But like I said, the dividend is not going anywhere and increasing over time."
2021-04-29 00:31:38,wallstreetbets,The person who controls our electrical grid discussed with me the changing of meters since they use the analog one. This led to my tankless water heater which then led to the discussion of natural gas initiatives
2021-04-29 03:58:57,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure they are. Are they easy to use or do I need a degree?!
2021-04-29 03:59:51,wallstreetbets,"That is awesome, thanks for that. I’ll fire it up and do a couple of simple calls for low cost to figure it out. Exciting!"
2021-04-29 06:52:55,wallstreetbets,Mind to share a few names? I’d like to follow your strategy
2021-04-29 03:19:04,wallstreetbets,It was $20 same month pandemic started. That dividend actually seems too high which could be a good thing...if they lower the divvy that would cause the stock price to go up. I like this play
2021-04-29 00:34:42,wallstreetbets,In what state do you live? If it’s okay to ask.
2021-04-29 15:08:04,wallstreetbets,"All the best mate, go m! ake some serious cash"
2021-04-29 08:53:34,wallstreetbets,You want to know the boring ones?
2021-04-29 12:46:30,wallstreetbets,"Idk man. I know it was $20 pre covid. But if they lower the div at all, I see this tanking. Look what happened to GE. As soon as they lowered their div, people jumped ship."
2021-04-29 00:43:05,wallstreetbets,WA
2021-04-29 16:43:05,wallstreetbets,That would be nice - renovating at the moment. If I had used the Reno money to buy more  i  would be half way to the moon 🤩
2021-04-29 08:54:37,wallstreetbets,I’d love to try your play
2021-04-29 01:34:35,wallstreetbets,"WA sure. But you are and i am as well in WA, a lefty hippie state. Not texas, KMI made tons of that winter storm in TX. In the market, you have to play global and local. Globally, prices will stay up. China isn’t in the Paris Accord. China will keep prices stable for a while."
2021-04-29 10:17:50,wallstreetbets,"I own T & VZ, XOM, INTC, WFC, UAL, kinder of course. Altria and IBM I sold off most of my positions. Much of these and others are Buffett recommendations, not *MY* play tbh"

2021-04-29 14:16:13,wallstreetbets,"I've been holding VIAC since a year ago when I bought in for \~$13.50. Kicking myself for not dumping it at $100/share, but when it dropped back down to <$40 I bought more and averaged up to $18.99."

2021-04-28 22:39:42,wallstreetbets,"On March 10, they mentioned guidance. The current price probably reflects that as the stock is on a 3 month skid.  

AMERITRADE states earning to be released May 6, 2021.  They have been known to be wrong sometimes but that is what they currently show.  My point is when a stock is heavily shorted, you can get in after earnings are out and still make a killing if the earnings release is good."

daily average volume is 1.9m shares, and the total float is 20.5m shares.

when this does squeeze, because current volume is so low relative to float, this can get very ugly.

2021-04-29 00:27:43,wallstreetbets,"No guh yet. My cost basis on this was actually only around 25k as I bought some 175 calls on Monday morning and they printed, so logically I coverted them all to OTM 180 calls. Going from that, break even is around 182 or so.

But I'm not in it for the break even. You can bet your ass if this thing goes to 200 I'm rolling these puppies into 250 calls.

Don't do what I do. If you're in a situation like me and it goes up just take your profits and go.

2021-04-29 08:26:46,wallstreetbets,"I thought it was more a reference to the 🌈🐻 who were selling those calls.  Because it's basically free $96K in a couple days to whoever is on the other end of those calls.  It's a 4% gain in a few days with effectively zero upside risk.

Even if they do get assigned, either owned those shares are going to be making a ton of money anyway."

2021-04-28 21:45:26,wallstreetbets,the 15 strike is ambitious but if the patents are sold for 3 bill we could see a pretty big move.  I like it.  Sort of like the June 10 strike calls more but whatever.
2021-04-29 00:08:03,wallstreetbets,I'm in BB too but not sure it will reach $15 by June...what make you think it will move that high by then.
2021-04-28 23:12:16,wallstreetbets,"Good luck, the stock is stuck in no man's land. It doesn't move even with good news."

2021-04-28 21:49:33,wallstreetbets,I think the strike is way too high and based on how much you have lost so far I am probably correct. Roll down strikes and out a month maybe fewer contracts with a higher likelihood of winning.

I held onto it , next day worth $20 , and then day before expire I tried to sell it for $1 . No one bought it and I lost my $5 .

2021-04-29 19:56:20,wallstreetbets,Not even possible.  No retail trader has the buying power alone.  That’s the point of the community.   Be good to each other.   Why would he be exercise $980 calls with the stock trading at $160 ?   Not even sure a front end would  even allow that Order
2021-04-29 18:21:19,wallstreetbets,Until your short calls into earnings and your stuck paying the dividend!!    How many are you short?  Lol.   That $’s coming out of your account and it’s way more than the little premium you collected.  Rookie move!

No ones buying at $400 a share I hope.  That’s  short covering."

2021-04-28 20:37:08,wallstreetbets,"fine if does,
I just dont understand the idea of buying a stagnant stock at highest price....
Wait untill its lower, then buy, sell high,
repeat.
There are no hedgefunds holding puts on gme anymore.
0.
that already stopped in februari.
No hedgefund in the world has low puts on gme now.
Sqeeze alread happened.

If anything, hedges would just buy low calls now. Just like normal people.
when will be the day, holders undertand how much money they can make every day, buy buying low, selling high, repeating."

2021-04-28 22:09:54,wallstreetbets,"The money goes to whoever sold the contract, not a short seller.

Sure, that person *could* have sold short, but it's much more likely that it's a MM or theta gang. And when MM's do short, it's typically to hedge a different position, so no net change."
2021-04-28 21:24:26,wallstreetbets,Yeah these kinds of plays need to be made during a price jump up not as something you sit on.
2021-04-28 23:00:20,wallstreetbets,Honestly theres a better chance it went to dfv
2021-04-28 23:51:30,wallstreetbets,"Trades like this propped your price up for two months. He gave his wallet so you fuckwit cultists could pretend that GME had short squeeze potential. If you want to attack someone, bash your face in the mirror first and leave the OP fuckwit alone."

2021-04-28 22:45:23,wallstreetbets,Yeah but buying and holding is still a better strategy with everything thats going on.
2021-04-29 00:47:31,wallstreetbets,But when shitadel is the mm it is a little different.
2021-04-29 16:12:27,wallstreetbets,"No, somewhere somebody is holding the short position."

2021-04-29 16:42:17,wallstreetbets,"Which is not a short seller. Selling covered calls, for example, is not short selling (or even a net short position at all, since with CCs you still have a positive delta)"
2021-04-28 23:53:56,wallstreetbets,"I think hes been doing it for quite some time, but didnt wanna deal with the downvotes. I posted this comment earlier today and of course that comment is now hidden via downvotes"
2021-04-29 17:34:06,wallstreetbets,Yes that high IV!  Killing it.

2021-04-29 16:12:58,wallstreetbets,I think Len Bias already won that one
2021-04-28 23:58:22,wallstreetbets,Anyone that likes money will do the same.  Can't blame him.   I don't understand why people would down vote.  It's very likely anyone that has blocks of 100 shares would sell CCs.
2021-04-29 04:08:59,wallstreetbets,"Unless the cash balance shown isn't everything, then he hasn't sold any covered calls. I've tracked his cash balance since his first YOLO and it has gone up in $200-$300 between some updates at most, probably some regular deposit. Otherwise he's also deliberately missing out on selling calls during the periods with the highest IV."
2021-04-29 01:30:20,wallstreetbets,"Ohhhhhh, got it"
2021-04-29 01:03:15,wallstreetbets,At this IV only an absolute clown would not be selling calls against their shares
2021-04-29 08:27:29,wallstreetbets,I've wondered if he sold some of his initial shares since those are locked in with long term capital gains and is riding the newer stuff out.  Wouldn't blame anyone for doing that and then selling the CCs on them
2021-04-29 00:02:49,wallstreetbets,"Agreed 100%. I mean his cost basis is soooo low, the premium is in-fucking-sane, his timing is perfection for the end of his yolo updates, and the guy is not some idiot that bought a lotto ticket and won. Clearly he knows fd's."
2021-04-29 07:07:11,wallstreetbets,"Premium is paid right away, then transfered to different account. Im sorry but he is way too smart not to have an actual portfolio outside of his gme one with your standard disversification setup...."
2021-04-29 17:37:22,wallstreetbets,He’s not going to sell covered calls and cap his upside.  Rookie move
2021-04-29 17:36:04,wallstreetbets,"He’s  not selling  on the call side 
Into earnings unless
He’s nuts and he’s not because he’s a professional"
2021-04-29 10:17:58,wallstreetbets,"As the man himself said:
>Perhaps, but that’s not how you maximize returns over the long-term."
2021-04-29 18:11:31,wallstreetbets,"The vast majority of his shares are less than one year. He only hit 10,000 shares total in January.

His play was mostly calls but apes try to ignore that fact."
2021-04-29 07:10:58,wallstreetbets,"Why go through all that trouble instead of hoarding cash to purchase more gme when it was at lower prices, or to show off more gain porn in the process? If he was retarded enough to buy 50k shares at 155, surely he would have considered buying even more with the premium he’s earning from selling calls all this time to show off a bigger yolo update? Your reasoning is too convoluted lol"
2021-04-29 16:14:50,wallstreetbets,Isn't that return means loss in his vocabulary?
2021-04-29 14:26:52,wallstreetbets,"He knew if he showed himself doubling down then a whole pack of apes would keep buying, keep discussing, keep raising the price. His autistic superpower allowed him to control the masses so he could escape with all of his gains."
2021-04-29 07:13:28,wallstreetbets,"Dont want to argue, im not saying im right and your wrong, just what i strongly believe."
2021-04-29 07:21:52,wallstreetbets,"I got no issue with that, and if I were in his shoes I’ll be selling the 300c weeklies too because that’s what I’m doing with my shares. I just don’t think he sold calls at all based on his updates. Not all of them occurred on a Friday, meaning he would have to buy to close them and forfeit free money during price drops and post earnings just to boast to wsb which would be even more irrational. The only instances where he could have plausibly removed cash was during the sale of his calls since we don’t know the exact prices at which he sold them."

2021-04-28 20:51:47,wallstreetbets,What does this have to do with GME?
2021-04-28 21:02:17,wallstreetbets,"They stated they expect 50% down for q2 due to chip shortage. Wish i had more for csp's.

Truck ppl are diehard brand loyal. Someone whoes been buying ford for years isnt gonna swap to chevy. This is based on shortage of product, not wainimg interest in their product. Im from the pnw, nothing but farmers. These dudes atick to the same brand when it comes to equipment and vehicles no matter what. They just wont buy anything till next year or whenever the supply picks back up. Short term bearish, long term bullish for sure"
2021-04-28 21:45:38,wallstreetbets,They were right.
2021-04-29 00:15:44,wallstreetbets,That would be Ford

2021-04-28 21:11:19,wallstreetbets,Easy. I got you fam. Buy the farthest out of the money calls you can that are expiring in the shortest time. It's called a YOLO. If it doesn't print call rh and ask for a refund.
2021-04-28 20:51:19,wallstreetbets,"Well, pretty much calls are a way for you to maximize leverage and make mad tendies. Now there is a small chance you might loose money, but don’t worry about that.

2021-04-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"[Goldman Sachs] ViacomCBS Inc. (VIAC, Buy): The most underappreciated streaming stock TL;DR - GS PT $75, Citi PT $56, Current Price $41, 70-80% Discount to NFLX and DIS.

VIAC #TOTHEMOON **🚀🚀** **🚀** 

[VIAC valued at a 70-80&#37; discount to NFLX and DIS](https://preview.redd.it/51icosx6szv61.png?width=1104&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf942e8850729a640579a767119e98fd826553a7)

 

**We see several potential catalysts over the coming weeks and months for VIAC:**

*Paramount+ launch:* After a robust marketing campaign with advertisements on the Super Bowl, The Grammy Awards and NCAA March Madness, we expect Paramount+ to have meaningfully broadened consumer awareness. As a result, we expect strong SVOD subscriber net adds in 1Q21. On a total reported basis (i.e., including Showtime OTT and other DTC services), we estimate VIAC will add 4mn+ global SVOD subscribers in 1Q21 vs. an implied average of 2-3mn per quarter during 2020.

*June pricing change:* In early June, VIAC will debut a $4.99 pricing tier for Paramount+, which will also remove the linear station feeds from the service. At this point, management has indicated they will be able to explore further bundling and distribution agreements, which we view as a potential catalyst to 2021 subscriber growth.

*Improving original content slate:* As production returns across VIAC's studios, we expect the original content slate for both film and television to improve for the company's DTC services, namely Paramount+, and the company's linear networks.

*Improving advertising trends:* As the economy reopens, we believe demand for advertising will continue to recover. With the expanded reach from Pluto TV and Paramount+, we believe VIAC presents advertisers a more holistic offering and the ability to reach all age demos.

**We maintain our Buy rating and 12-month price target of $75 for VIAC.**

VIAC #TOTHEMOON **🚀🚀** **🚀** 

Note also that Paramount+ only launched in the quarter on March 3, and has the below % share of new subscribers. Note how they beat Disney+, Hulu and Netflix! Who cares about $DISC here if it is only 60% of what Paramount+ has.

2021-04-29 07:35:23,wallstreetbets,"Gotta be a smart bot.

I do think that Youtube or Twitch are operating very differently from NFLX or VIAC. The fact that both business models exist proves the point that the society is diversified, and we need diversified content.

It would be difficult for individual content creators to create TV series or movies. Collaboration on the corporate level is important, and that is why this world has been operating in corporations.

Decentralization could be the future. But it might be a long way to go.

2021-04-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"My $ZM DD was on point and you can still profit from it! Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwvu0d/zoom_puts_are_free_money_dd_inside/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

In this call that I made back on January 17th, 2021, I offered a play that would have profited you over 50% value in the course of 4 months. 

My call was “buy Zoom (ZM) shares in anticipatory run of earnings, sell afterwards, then buy puts with the profit.” Had you followed this play 1:1, here would have been the results:

Buy shares on January 19th for roughly $390. Sell on March 2nd for $439. This is a 12% increase in under 2 months. 

Then, you would have bought $ZM puts. $220p August 20th 2021 and $160p January 21st, 2022.

At the time of posting, $ZM is at roughly $330, or about 75% of the value it was back when I suggested you buy the puts. Both of these puts are DEEP otm, but as the pandemic begins to wane in the USA, the largest market for $ZM, and has doctors, medical practitioners, and therapists begin using HIPAA Conforming Telehealth tools, I see ZM finally resting at around $120-150 by the end of January 2022. 

Keep in mind, this prediction of ZM’s stock value is still 2-3x the price it was back in January 2020, pre (worldwide) pandemic. This takes into account the fact that ZM has now become the near universal video chatting tool and will be used in years to come, while not being the absolute monster of a stock it is now.

Thoughts?

Oh, also shoutout to the guy who told me that I’d be ruining my own life if I took up my own play :)

Note: It’s come to my attention that Zoom is now HIPAA compliant. At the time of my original post, it was NOT. I was not aware of this new information.

My guidance is still largely the same. I have connections in the psychology/therapy field and I know that 95% of therapists are using “Theranest” instead of Zoom and many doctors adopted other platforms prior to Zoom becoming HIPAA compliant, and I expect little turnover."
2021-04-28 23:17:25,wallstreetbets,"Zoom is not going down that much imo. There are still a lot of other industries that will continue using beyond the pandemic. It is far cheaper to hop on a Zoom vs. flying to a business meeting across the country or world. It may continue losing some steam to competitors but innovation is still ongoing. It lost record prices for the same reason many organizations did. I could list them all day long but FLGT, LMND, APPN, NIO, PLUG are all down from records in February. We shall see, but I am long on ZM. Not playing options on it but day trading shares has been great. It goes down to $310 or so then bounces back up close to $340 regularly. I am waiting for a steeper discount to get in again. Your play has been solid so far but $160? Zoom is the household name. Everyone says Zoom call even when using another service."
2021-04-29 16:26:17,wallstreetbets,"I'm with you. I think this stock is purely hype at this price point. I have 200 - 250 Nov bear put spread.

Thinking in summer everything reopens and people forget about zoom. I think I will add somemore bear put spreads to a later time horizon."
2021-04-29 18:59:55,wallstreetbets,Apparently you dont have to be missing your lower ribs to suck yourself off.
2021-04-28 21:25:37,wallstreetbets,"I believe Zoom is HIPPA compliant my dude. https://zoom.us/healthcare

Other than that, I agree it’s overvalued."
2021-04-28 20:15:57,wallstreetbets,Well first of all it's HIPAA.
2021-04-28 21:41:01,wallstreetbets,Why can’t it be both?
2021-04-28 23:43:47,wallstreetbets,"That’s true but it’s share price isn’t forward looking, imo. It sees “uh oh, Covid cases are going up in (some state)!” and goes up. “Woah, look the USA is vaccinating 3 million people a day” and goes down. 

Once the mask mandate is lifted and life returns to overall normalcy, Zoom will still be used more than it was pre-pandemic. However, a $330 share price is grossly overvalued for what the future of the company will be.

My final prediction is a share price of $120-155 by January 2022, which is still 2-3x value that it was in January 2020. I think that this is a very fair and sound PT. Surely Zoom will be used, but we’re going to see a massive boom of people wanting to do anything BUT get on a zoom call."
2021-04-29 16:28:27,wallstreetbets,"What % of users do you see dropping out of zoom? I guess more importantly what % of paying institutions. Right now, it is priced for substantially more growth. Can they increase profits if I think it is likely they will lose at least 25% of paying customers?"
2021-04-29 19:45:04,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-04-28 21:40:23,wallstreetbets,"This must be new (relative to when I made the original post). HIPPA (not hippo lol) compliance is what led to popularity of other virtual platforms (like Theranest for therapists, for example)"
2021-04-28 20:30:19,wallstreetbets,"Lol

[Muphry's law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muphry%27s_law)"
2021-04-28 22:33:34,wallstreetbets,"Doesn't matter. Doctors don't have time to switch to a new system if the current one works. And the more specialized telehealth platforms have much better features because they're designed for it.

$ZM is going down, good DD"
2021-04-28 23:45:18,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I agree. I have a lot of connection in the psychological and therapeutic industries and about 95% of therapists are using Theranest. Zoom wasn’t HIPAA compliant for a while which has built a lot of mistrust toward the company from clients and therapists alike, even though they are now HIPAA compliant."
2021-04-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,I heard you like GME July 800 calls? $366K ought to do it... 
2021-04-28 20:42:51,wallstreetbets,"Bro, i've also seen your 900k+ play on 4/16 800 Calls, somehow it hurts to watch somehow it amazes me since this is literally WallStreetBETS. 

But to plow that much money on GME Calls, my balls are too small for that, can't deny.

However I'm with you on this journey, YOLOed my entire life savings into GME, but all with shares with a 66$ average.
Gamestop is doing well so far with the shift to digital and shorts must cover at some point, but fuck, they have much power and prolong it for even a lot more time.

Anyways good luck with your 800C, if these print in time Congrats and see you in andromeda! 🚀"
2021-04-28 20:07:03,wallstreetbets,Get your fucking umbrellas boys to avoid getting covered in Theta Gang's explosive cum volcanos
2021-04-29 02:45:43,wallstreetbets,"As someone who is new to Calls/Puts *please* tell me if my analysis is actually OP's intention on future tendies.

OP paid ~$366,000 for 377 *contracts* which allows the *purchase* of 37,700(377 contracts) shares of GME if the price goes over $800 by July 16th.

Let's say the stock actually hits $801 on July 15th(1 day before expiration) making the contract valid. For this example let's say OP wants to excercise the call on that day, the 15th. 37,000 shares are bought @$800 equalling $30,160,000(assuming OP has $30,160,000 on hand, ready for the exchange). Hooray! now OP has owns 37,700 shares actually worth $30,197,700 giving an initial profit of $37,700. Now we minus the initial premium of $366,000 and OP has officially lost $328,300 even though the stock went over and the contract is valid. But if the stock was at $799 or lower on July 16th, OP would lose the contracts and total loss would be $366,000 **Insane risk.**

On a very extreme extreme example, if GME hits $1500, these contracts are worth $56,550,000(again assuming OP has $30,160,000 to buy them) giving a total profit of $26,390,000- $366,000 initial investment(premium).

Now I look at just straight buy. $366,000 buys 2,440 shares @ $150. If the stock reaches $800, your stock is worth $1,952,000($1,586,000 profit). **Nearly zero risk, can sell the stock at any time.**

Then there is the ability to **sell** the contracts, but at this time I can't visualize it. Can OP make serious profit if GME hits $600 around July 1st? This is also assuming enough people are available to buy these I am trying to see the worth in these contracts. Basically, OP is so YOLO that GME will rocket, it not only will reach $800, it will reach $1k, $2K, even $4k? So much so they would just throw $366k on that bet?

(side note I bought an $11 AMC **put** contract for $54 expiring the 30th. As of today it is $10.89. I expected to get $1000 from it to fill my tub with ranch, set the ovens at 400 and have a tendy orgy because I risked losing 100% of my investment and who the fuck would pay $54 to make $5??!? Even if it dropped to $10 I would only double my money. It is 3x the risk for *maybe* double the money(in such a short window). Now I see this is the worst thing ever to gamble with. Unless you have insider info, these extreme options are a dumpster fire.)

Unless someone can give me an example of a good option???? My fucking head right now.

Also, if you don't have the capital to buy the stock at the time of expiration and you havent sold it already, what happens?

edit: had to take a 0 off of each amount -_-"

2021-04-28 20:06:04,wallstreetbets,"Simple. If he expect gme to rise let's say to 500 at may 16th. Those calls are gonna be worth more and he can sell them for profit.

There's like so many ways to appreciate your capital in other stocks or plays, or at least buy fucking shares of GME

🤡🤡🤡"
2021-04-29 08:20:19,wallstreetbets,An obvious question but if you think it is going up 500% in the next 6 weeks why not just buy the stock? at least then time is on your side

2021-04-28 22:19:29,wallstreetbets,I was just walking by and noticed this. Isn’t it comical that you guys are trying to destroy companies like Melvin but end up buying ridiculously expensive calls from those same companies and making them rich?
2021-04-28 20:10:59,wallstreetbets,"you could get 1,446 april 30th 200/205 vertical calls for that, if GME goes to 205 by Friday you get 6,709,440.

I dunno, it would be over faster."

2021-04-28 20:49:28,wallstreetbets,"Seriously. My dude you need to take that last milly and start a contest.

10k each.

6 months of trading. At the end, all positions remaining must be liquidated.

Top 3 finishers keep 100%.

Winning sub gets... something.

All other proceeds are due back to you.

Would be the most epic, most legendary, most autistic possible move. You’d probably come out way ahead of where you’re about to end up (due to the most autistic diversification ever) and the sweet, sweet yolo updates and gain and loss porns stretched out over those unforgettable months in the middle of 2021 would live fucking forever."

I paid off the car 18 months early and got rid of the credit card debt. Other than that, just working on building the pile bigger into some real ""fuck you"" money. 

You get up two and a half million dollars, any asshole in the world knows what to do: you get a house with a 25 year roof, an indestructible Jap-economy shitbox, you put the rest into the system at three to five percent to pay your taxes and that's your base, get me?

2021-04-29 00:27:00,wallstreetbets,This is too retarded even for a retard.
2021-04-29 00:30:46,wallstreetbets,"So you’re down to 1.2m?



I have a friend who followed a similar part but obviously in a much smaller scale. Convinced him to get into GME shares at 14, when GME hit 150 the first time we sold and his account went from 12k to 50k

He started that account with 15k and was down to 12k when I convinced him. Now at 50k all he knew was GME, every single pick he had made before ended poorly and so I watched him burn 25k in the subsequent months by FOMOing into GME at the peak always 

He now sits at 25k but has learned his lesson I think


this may not necessarily be your case but you could get to your 8m in a different, much safer and not so slow way"
2021-04-29 00:35:31,wallstreetbets,Dude 400 would have been more in the money.

2021-04-29 00:48:34,wallstreetbets,"Rather than throw $300k+ away, you could have gave it to me and I would thrown it away for you by tipping every bartender and waitress in my town generously, as I bought rounds for the entire bar.

2021-04-29 03:26:16,wallstreetbets,I feel like shares would've been the more prudent move... 🤦‍♂️
2021-04-29 03:27:53,wallstreetbets,"im just learning about how to read options so bear with me, but how do i calculate the cost (total average) on right of the screen.

so far i know 800 is the strike price. i get it expires on 7/16. i see he bought 377 coptions which is 37700 shares.  the price for each share is 5.625 which makes sense as 37700 x 5.625 = position dollar value 212,062.50. thats about as far as i got.

what is the p&l at the end? i get that position dollar value + p&l = total cost but what does that mean? 

i thought p&l profit loss and had to do with graphing. why is it a sum being charged to him?

id like to know how much he had to pay and what the breakdown was and what the price has to reach for him to make any money. 

and as a bonus how much money would he make at 800? 850? 900? 1000?"

2021-04-29 04:36:21,wallstreetbets,"Guess the squeeze is never happening if people keep donating money to the hedge funds like this... Worst part is you pay upfront, so even if the squeeze were to happen before July, if enough people buy these calls the hedges will be able to postpone it past July.

These calls are literally the opposite of a self-fulfilling prophecy..."

As a beginner, what I would do is a nice, calm, comfortable weekly SPY put on Monday. It’s been crazy strong for weeks. Maybe grab some 410 strikes. Just a ballpark example, not financial advice... check the current prices for yourself. Spy typically has nice volatility and the contracts are really inexpensive."

2021-04-28 22:26:12,wallstreetbets,"Either OP expects the price to sky rocket, or at the very least, for votility to increase so as to sell the options at a higher price than he bought them.   His last Apr 800 calls he said he rode all the way down to zero, so I'm assuming he's not just looking to grab a bit of extra premium from a n IV increase."
2021-04-28 22:35:39,wallstreetbets,"A call is an option to purchase stock at a certain price, in this case, $800.  You pay a premium up front for this option.  An option contract though is for 100 shares, so for each contract he has, he is basically paying *for the right* to buy 100 shares at $800 each.

If he doesn't sell the option contract along the way and the stock doesn't sky rocket, he loses the premium that he paid for that option contract.

I just looked at the July 800 calls are going for $5.63.  One option contract is $5.63 x 100, so he paid $563 premium up front for each of the calls.  And he has thousands of them."

2021-04-28 20:07:34,wallstreetbets,he would lose $366k if it hits $800 by July 16
2021-04-28 21:46:53,wallstreetbets,Impossible to say. All depends on how the IV and delta move (and obviously the stock). Once delta hits 100 it trades tick for tick as the stock price would and IV fluctuates constantly. Like there's a very big difference if the stock were to hit 800 tomorrow vs by expiration. And if for example the stock drops to 30 then comes back to the price where OP bought them originally he'd be down a significant amount because of time decay and of course IV. Basically he needs the stock to move soon and not drop 20+% before he starts drinking heavily.
2021-04-28 20:03:07,wallstreetbets,"What if GME hits over $800 in August
Lmao

Shares!"

Explain all that and then I think a conversation can be had, so long as it isn’t speculative drivel."
2021-04-29 12:51:34,wallstreetbets,Can you explain how GME has >100% institutional ownership when shorts have all covered? This is literal proof that the number of shorts is greater than the number of retail longs.
2021-04-29 03:01:16,wallstreetbets,Because? If you cant explain and gonna link random DD made by FanFiction writer dont bother.

I mean look at Archegos saga. Billions willed into existence and went poof in less than a week.

I give props to ppl like OP tho. Sometimes I'm tempted to toss half a mil into a ""sure bet"" OTM play but I just can't. So thanks to bros like him I can live thru the ups and downs thru them (mostly downs)."

10k each.

6 months of trading. At the end, all positions remaining must be liquidated.

Top 3 finishers keep 100%.

Winning sub gets... something.

All other proceeds are due back to my dude.

Would be the most epic, most legendary, most autistic possible move. My dude would probably come out way ahead of where he’s about to end up, and the sweet, sweet yolo updates and gain and loss porns stretched out over those unforgettable months in the middle of 2021 would live fucking forever."

2021-04-28 22:17:03,wallstreetbets,agreed. If the price and volatility action return to mid March levels ($340 sp and 350% IV) these calls would be worth $70ish vs the $10 I paid. That’s 7x on a +90% price move.

2021-04-29 03:01:17,wallstreetbets,"I don't know anything about Russel 2000. Maybe you could explain some things to me and I will understand that through some complicated scenario gamestop is somehow being shorted.

I generally don't buy into anonymous reddit posters making conspiratorial claims. It's theoretically possible marketing companies were hiring redditors to ""be bearish"" whatever that means, but I would need evidence to believe such a claim. If you need me to explain why anonymous reddit sources pushing conspiracies related to a highly controversial topic with an incredible amount of blind support is questionable I doubt we could have a reasonable conversation. But I'm open to learning about whatever happened to the Russel 2000.

I was just asking if there was any evidence that could theoretically be presented to you that would make you think shorts were covered already. For me it was some combination of the shorts claiming they got out, followed by doing the math and confirming that their reported losses only made sense if they had indeed gotten out, followed by independent agencies reporting that most of the shorts had gotten out, followed by finra short reports continuously suggesting that the shorts have either gotten out or been lying to finra for months and are subject to massive fines on a bi-weekly basis plus potential additional consequences."

2021-04-28 20:22:50,wallstreetbets,"The other responses aren't explanatory, so I will try to be.

OP bought the option to buy 100 shares at $800 per share by July. OP paid a premium for this right, say $100 per option ($1 per share).

OP can now do one of two things. First, he can exercise, which means he buys his shares at $800 per share from the person who sold him the contract. This normally doesn't happen.

The more common outcome is that OP sells his contracts to someone else for a higher price than he paid (perhaps back to the original seller of the contract, thus ""settling"" the contract).

This is great, but the thing to keep in mind is that the contract eventually becomes worthless (it's only valid until July). The earlier you buy, the more you pay for the contract. The more time that passes, the less likely you are to profit at all.

When people are saying ""the stock has to reach 800"", they're really talking about the day of expiry. On that day the option is roughly as valuable as the difference in strike price (800) and stock price. He really just has to beat the *time* variable (theta) with a jump in the stock. Otherwise, he wasted his money."
2021-04-28 20:03:53,wallstreetbets,"He bought 377 contracts, each representing 100 shares.  So 37,700 shares total at a strike price of $800.

If the stock never hits $800 before the expiration, they become worthless.  But if it crosses $800, he's golden."
2021-04-28 20:11:15,wallstreetbets,People like OP really don't deserve money tbh. I wouldn't trust him with a car

2021-04-29 04:41:05,wallstreetbets,Kind of. You'd be either giving money to shareholders (obviously not the people short selling) or people who aren't holding shares who are writing these calls but have the money to buy them if their calls go against them (hedges)
2021-04-29 02:34:31,wallstreetbets,Adjustment penalties exist.

2021-04-29 00:52:58,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-04-29 13:04:50,wallstreetbets,Ok but you're talking about options with delta/gamma of literally 0.0001 from here to $400. A doubling of the price in 2 months probably wouldn't make these more valuable.
2021-04-29 11:41:54,wallstreetbets,really?  wow.
2021-04-29 00:31:35,wallstreetbets,My friend kept betting on 33 black and after losing 3 times in a row the dealer (or whatever the person running the table is called?) laughed and said he'd never get it and he stopped betting. What do you think the next spin was? We almost died laughing at him.
2021-04-29 02:23:16,wallstreetbets,"Funny story. I went to Vegas a couple years ago with some friends, blew all my money the first 2 days, so the last 2 days were mostly going to miserable. Last day, homeboy lends me like $20, turn it into $50 at blackjack and yolo it all on 00 in roulette. I end up hitting 00 4 fucking times in a row, but only put in like $25 - $50 on it everytime. I did the math, the odds of that's happening is like 1/35million or something like that. 

I think about day very frequently to this day haha"
2021-04-29 05:29:12,wallstreetbets,Would that have anything to do with a rose?

2021-04-28 22:38:05,wallstreetbets,Let’s see if there is any profit to pay taxes on at 12/31...
2021-04-28 21:36:14,wallstreetbets,You won’t pay any gain taxes if you end up losing it all!!

2021-04-28 21:23:22,wallstreetbets,LOL.
2021-04-29 03:14:25,wallstreetbets,More like 200% short of the float. May 17th... 13F disclosure day.
2021-04-29 17:05:46,wallstreetbets,highly probable. 98%

2021-04-28 20:29:49,wallstreetbets,ok
2021-04-28 21:08:54,wallstreetbets,Lol🤣
2021-04-29 10:03:29,wallstreetbets,Yet in January they self reported 141% SI and THAT was trustworthy.  Even tho apparently they've had the tools to hide that number the entire time but just didn't?
2021-04-29 03:10:17,wallstreetbets,Right? Lmao
2021-04-29 06:51:34,wallstreetbets,But he is right. This GME shit is turning into a Q cult.
2021-04-29 03:11:52,wallstreetbets,"I'm sorry I came off that way. I just wanted to pop back in and check if this was still a conspiracy sub.

Usually the way you check if somebody is willing to acknowledge reality is to ask if there is evidence that could theoretically exist that could change their mind. If they cannot possibly conceive of how their mind could be changed, it can't be changed, and at that point you're interacting with a person that doesn't acknowledge reality.

I try to avoid those people generally."
2021-04-29 17:42:04,wallstreetbets,"Touché. 

What the fuck? How is that even possible?"
2021-04-29 05:58:20,wallstreetbets,Sure but those 800$ calls for the 16th of april were pretty retarded and super risky. they couldn't exercise them and gave the shorters more ammo. buying shares or at least not such risky calls would be better for retail. there can't be a gamma squeeze when the price is 180 and the majority of options are at 800. who do you think sells those options? obviously the hedgefunds
2021-04-29 01:38:38,wallstreetbets,510? Username checks in

2021-04-29 02:02:50,wallstreetbets,Yeah see mine? It goes to 11...
2021-04-29 02:47:37,wallstreetbets,How do you affect buy sell spreads by dealing contracts? Can you do that?
2021-04-28 22:00:43,wallstreetbets,"Ok fine, BLOODY MARY 🩸🩸🩸"
2021-04-28 22:14:39,wallstreetbets,There is no doubt about it.

2021-04-28 22:04:17,wallstreetbets,"Paid about $9.70 per contract share, so $366,000 ish invested."
2021-04-28 20:42:23,wallstreetbets,If it hits 1600 he could sell half to excercise half... Etc...
2021-04-28 20:18:27,wallstreetbets,You have to subtract 800 and whatever premium was in the contract from the actual share cost. Slightly above $800 is breakeven. But $1000 per share is worth millions.
2021-04-28 21:08:42,wallstreetbets,Or if the stock has a crazy fast run up from 150.00 per share to 250.00 in a few hours he can prob find a buyer and resell those contracts at a higher price then he paid.  Only reason to buy an over valued meme stock option contract at 800.00.
2021-04-28 22:32:19,wallstreetbets,it has to hit 809.70 on expiry for it to even start to make any money
2021-04-29 03:12:57,wallstreetbets,You're legit awesome. And retarded. But like awesome retarded
2021-04-29 07:26:35,wallstreetbets,Legend
2021-04-28 21:40:38,wallstreetbets,What? No. Do you really think GME is going to hit **$800** a share by that time?! Holy fuck.

2021-04-28 21:23:32,wallstreetbets,Sell covered calls at 800.

2021-04-29 17:18:22,wallstreetbets,"The only reason DFV ended up ""not nuts"" is because he developed a following of people dumber than him"

Glad i found a proof of you being real."
2021-04-28 22:45:24,wallstreetbets,I stand by my comment. If this thing does get to $809.7 at expiration then the extrinsic value of delta and IV will definitely at some point during the rise make up for the theta loss. Unless whoever commented on this thinks it will go from red to $809.7 at 15:59:99 at the day of expiry.
2021-04-28 21:53:06,wallstreetbets,So 800 is negligable. Id rather 2 calls at 800 over one at 5 anyday

2021-04-29 04:19:55,wallstreetbets,"maker makers do not need to immediately match all sellers to buyers to net out their position (implied = realizing profit from the spread).  

they have liquidity to warehouse outstanding contracts - they simply hedge with the shares to neutralize their risk.  

if there are no other 'natural' sellers at 800c, doesnt mean theres noone for market makers to facilitate the sell of contract to OP.  just means the MM uses their in-house models to price and sell the 800c.  it could very well be that all 800c open interest are short on dealer side, and long on investor sides  (rather than short on investors side who are selling covered or naked calls)"

2021-04-28 21:47:28,wallstreetbets,Yea he is betting on that or that his options will increase in value as GameStop approaches that amount and then he might sell them for a profit because he doesn’t really expect them to reach that value by expiration
2021-04-28 22:24:47,wallstreetbets,"Seriously... *are you new?* because you have a lot of catching up to do. Try to get familiar with the GME situation and gamma squeeze/short squeeze.

It's like putting all your money on one number at a roulette table, it hitting, and instead of appreciating the fact you're instantly in the 1% you bet all of it on the next ball flying out of the wheel and landing in someone's cup. Just impossibly stupid. 

But you bring up a good point - maybe he's already stupid rich so $3.5m is gambling money to him. Either way fuck him, you're just writing checks to the people selling these options. What a waste of resources."

I still say he may not be giving money to market makers and just from people profiting from high volatility. This contracts have the squeezed priced in. That's why it's so hard to make it happen now and so profitable to sell the ""lottery tickets"".

Look at Tesla. We are still waiting for the squeeze and most contracts with ridiculous premiums are being sold by retail investors or funds, but they are covered."

Because there was no selling pressure to justify the price drop. And now they have no point to report the actual SI. They got fined by Finra 140k for 500k violations.

as for your idea that for some reason hes justified to waste all his gains just because it worked once, that is so fundamentally flawed and it shows you don't have a lot of experience in the stock market. It was a good play then because the dd and fundamentals were spot on. things are completely different now. op already knows he has 0 chance of success and he has even stated that because its fucking obvious to anyone who knows anything about the market.  you are assuming that GameStop originally had comparable chances of success back in November when he bought it when that is completely false."

You can look at other symbols with extremely thinly traded options, or when ""new"" strikes/expirys open.  There are no volume, and yet there are quotes for all contracts.  That's because the MM priced it and are willing to be counterparty -- without a real, 'natural' counterparty to complete the transaction or inform the pricing.

Much of tech is blowing out expectations, but Amazon isn't just tech, it's everything, from retail goods to cloud services to aerospace. The problem for most traders, and why the stock has traded sideways for a long time, is the price. Tomorrow it's likely that rumors of a split will be dispelled (if there is a split forthcoming, I think most people would agree the stock would run). I'm interested to hear why people think the stock will spike or plummet. What has the street overlooked if they beat, what have they been bullish on with estimates that will miss?

* The consensus EPS Estimate is $9.62 (+92.0% Y/Y) and the consensus Revenue Estimate is $104.65B (+38.6% Y/Y).

* The company guided Q1 revenue to $100.0B to $106.0B and operating income to $3.0B to $6.5B in Q4 earnings report.

* Over the last 2 years, AMZN has beaten EPS estimates 75% of the time and has beaten revenue estimates 75% of the time.

* Over the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 15 upward revisions and 10 downward.

Ref:  [https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/what-happens-to-options-when-stock-splits/](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/what-happens-to-options-when-stock-splits/)

>The ""being made whole"" calculation is relatively straightforward for  options. Each option contract typically controls 100 shares of an  underlying security at a predetermined [strike price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp).  The new share ownership is generated by taking the split ratio and  multiplying by 100 while the new strike price is generated by taking the  old strike price and dividing by the split ratio.   
>  
>For example, if you buy a call option that controls 100 shares of XYZ  with a strike price of $75. If XYZ announces a 2:1 stock split, the  contract would now control 200 shares with a strike price of $37.50. On  the other hand, if the stock split is 3 for 2, the option would  control 150 shares with a strike price of $50. "

1 - 'Silicon Valley' scaling costs: Doordash doesn't really need infrastructure so expansion is extremely cheap, this is seen as market potential

2 - Customers don't really care about the quality and will order anyway (you as an example here still use the service despite complaints and you're certainly not alone)

3 - Shitloads of money looking for any speculative investment they can find landed here, DD may be trash but they're not even the worst company with a ridiculous valuation right now.

The big mystery to me is there's almost no 'lock-in' potential for DD and this drives a lot of the silicon valley type valuations. A facebook competitor will likely fail because facebook already exists, even if the new one is better everyone's already on FB. Yeah there's an opening (we all remember myspace) but myspace was never as mature a business. But Doordash? There's already grubhub, postmates, ubereats, etc and none of them look primed to take over the market."
2021-04-28 21:52:21,wallstreetbets,We are using one local delivery service and that’s it. There’s also a nationwide restaurant staffing issue. Which is another reason restaurants aren’t using delivery services. They cannot keep up with the output that having delivery service demands.

Can’t blame anyone in the restaurant industry for continuing to stay out of work, a lot of focus goes to front of the house workers, but as someone who was a prep cook/line cook/ sous chef in a past life the pay was always ass.

2021-04-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Elon Musk and Tesla 'bearish' case Okay this might sound a bit weird but I've been thinking about how important Elon Musk is to Tesla or in particular to Tesla's investors and I was wondering if you could actually make money by betting on 'something' happening to Elon Musk. 

Now imagine Elon Musk dying tomorrow. I genuinely hope we will not have to see that in the news any time soon... but just imagine. How much would Tesla's stock drop? Probably more than 50% right?

Okay so what if someone were to buy deep OTM Tesla puts every month? Let's do some math.

Currently Tesla trades around 700. Since Tesla is expected to fall more than 50% if something happens to Elon Musk, let's look at 350 puts.
350 puts expiring May 28th are currently trading at 0.37. (https://imgur.com/gallery/uBJEIC8)

If someone buys 1 Tesla put with strike price 50% away from underlying every month, the costs the first year would be 1 * 37 * 12 = $444
The older people become, the higher chance of dying. Now let's say this someone buys 1 more put per month the second year, and one more the third year, and so on, then the yearly costs will increase by $444 every year. 

Musk is 49 years old. The average life expectancy in the United States is 78 years. Assuming Elon lives an average life, he has 29 years left. https://imgur.com/gallery/8diuHNx

Increasing the amount of monthly puts by 1 every year will make the total costs in the next 29 years:
15 * 29 * 37 * 12 = $193140

If Elon Musk were to die exactly at average life expectancy in the United States, then those 29 puts would need to make $193140 in profit to have gains overall. 
193140/29 = 6660 -> Every put would need to make $6660 profit. This means (simplified) that the price of the underlying needs to go 66 points below the strike price, which is 50% below underlying at the beginning of the month.

Using todays stock price, that would mean that Tesla needs to fall to about (350-66) 284 following Elon Musk's hypothetical death.

I'm actually surprised to see that this could be a working strategy. First I looked at a fixed amount of puts every month but that would make it harder to turn a profit and also doesn't make sense since someone at age 49 does not have the same chance of dying as a 70 year old.

This is mostly a joke, I'm not actually going to do this (I think) but I was interested in the actual math so I said why not post it in WSB. 

Also if Elon invents some fucking pill or some shit that makes him immortal in the next X years, then you can just throw this whole strategy away."
2021-04-28 20:05:29,wallstreetbets,"opportunity costs you forgot, also increase in price not calculated. it doesnt work. You probably better of betting that he becomes immortal something like a Musk AI super SIRI"

2021-04-29 00:11:45,wallstreetbets,"I've thought about this. If you wanna step up your brain wrinkle game, you'll wanna pull up some actuarial tables to calculate Elon Musk's life expectancy in a more granular fashion based on what we know about him. For example, rich people live longer. You can quantify that and factor it into your model.

Then, after computing the probability of Elon dying, you'll wanna use the Kelly Criterion to place bets.

You are, in effect, buying life insurance for Elon Musk with you as the beneficiary but under the assumption that the insurance broker (the market) has not properly priced in the probability of Elon Musk's death.

The trouble is TSLA IV is so high it has probably already priced in much worse than the death of Elon Musk. But I'm not certain, just a hunch. You'll have to run the numbers (and even then, you'll need to make some assumptions which may or may not bear out)."

2021-04-29 11:52:15,wallstreetbets,"I really don't think Elon needs to die for this strategy.  It seems to me that Elon is using his wealth to pursue his vision of the greatest good he can accomplish in his lifetime.  He believes in Tesla being good for the environment and clean energy but also, he is mainly using Tesla and Starlink and all of his other endeavors to accumulate wealth to put towards his true mission.  Colonizing Mars.  Some billionaires spend on charities, some focus on the third world and some are concerned with the environment etc...  Musk has only one goal and that is Mars colonization.  When the time comes he will cash out of other businesses if they do not further his goal of Mars.  He knows he is running out of time to see it in his lifetime and i expect that much more of his focus and resources will pour into mars development.  IF HE LEAVES TESLA TO FOCUS ON MARS imagine how many shares he will be selling as well as Musk fanboys.  You don't need to run the numbers for his death, just when he reallocates his resources.  If Elon is reading this, I hope you make it to Mars someday.  I believe your mission is a noble one and you will have ultimate success.

**Why It’s Important:** When a sweep order occurs, it indicates the trader wanted to get into a position quickly and is anticipating an imminent large move in stock price. A sweeper pays market price for the call option instead of placing a bid, which sweeps the order book of multiple exchanges to fill the order immediately.

These types of call option orders are usually made by institutions, and retail investors can find watching for sweepers useful because it indicates “smart money” has entered into a position.

**CLOV Price Action:** Shares of Clover Health closed up 13.6% at $10.50.

Everywhere else (including SEC forms) put implied shares outstanding at ~406m and float shares at ~107m. The issue here is that when a lot of people say short interest, they're talking short interest as % of float (sometimes called short float). The short interest as % of float is around 36% based on the data Finra collected on 4/15, so that's the number people are referring to. In terms of institutional investment, nasdaq puts it at 12.42% of shares outstanding (class A) https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/clov/institutional-holdings which is very different than what fintel has"

2021-04-29 18:07:29,wallstreetbets,"I remember having an argument with an american who was against socialised healthcare on another website. 

I asked him how much his insurance was per month. I then looked up the figures for an average earner in the UK and how much tax was paid and of that tax how much went on healthcare.

I don't remember the exact figures but after converting the currency it worked out at something like a person in the UK pays less in a year than someone in the US pays in a month for the average health insurance.

And that's before taking in to consideration any excess/deductible. It was compared only to the monthly insurance payment.


I also remember a meme where a guy calculated that he could:
Fly to Spain, get a hip replacement, go running with the bulls, get trampled by the bulls, get hip replaced AGAIN, live in Spain for 2 years and it was STILL cheaper than getting a hip replacement in the US.

I looked up the meme after writing the above paragraph and the costs (bear in mind this meme is many years old now) were $7k for the hip replacement in Spain and $40k in the US.


I genuinely do not understand any americans who are against socialised healthcare."

2021-04-29 19:44:32,wallstreetbets,"It’s the word “socialised” healthcare. The Cold War and red scare was weaponized for years by Republicans and it lingers in today’s rhetoric. Most Americans don’t know the true meaning of the word. They think of it as meaning death to America. Also the healthcare industry is horribly corrupt and inflated. The people in power profit off of the current system through lobbyists.

It could easily work though. I lost my insurance due to losing my job because of Covid. I got a vaccine quickly and for free, no questions asked."
2021-04-29 00:27:37,wallstreetbets,"Actually buying call options will move the price more. 

The majority of options are sold by market makers who hedge to remain market neutral by buying shares. They buy shares according to a contract’s delta value: .2 delta = 20 shares, 1.0 = 100 shares, etc. 

So using $100 you could buy 10 shares, or you could force MM’s to buy ~50 shares (if u loaded up on $22.5 5/21 calls at the price at close)

This delta hedging is what can leads to gamma squeezes like what was seen during the initial GME spike."

2021-04-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Vaccine Hesitancy and How to Profit from it: Vaxart Not everyone is going to get vaccinated. This will cause problems for society, and opportunities for us.

Most of the mainstream media is pushing the vaccine. Whether this is appropriate is irrelevant to the investor; what matters is that critical alternatives/complements to vaccines have been getting little attention. Experts realize that alternatives are needed [ASAP](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/the-next-generation-of-covid-19-vaccines-could-be-a-pill#What-we-know-about-the-next-generation-of-COVID-19-vaccines-so-far):

The alternatives are:

**Do nothing**: Meh. You can't make money doing that.

**Nasal Spray:**

This sounds cool; but I have trouble with **Atossa** (not mentioning ticker here because it's a microcap). Company just boomed, perhaps because of the above-linked article calling some attention to the nasal spray idea. But having watched Atossa (and lost money on it) for a while now, I've found the CEO to be a bit unfocused - he tweets a lot about how Covid was obviously made in a lab. Whether that's true doesn't matter to me - I just wish he and the company would spend more time focusing on development and less tilting at windmills. Pass. I don't know much about **Auris**, but I'm staying away from big gambles and microcaps right now.

Position: sold 2000 shares of Atossa at a loss in early April.

**Monoclonal antibody treatment**:

Care for the unvaccinated, and those who contract Covid anyway, is necessary. I'm bullish on both monoclonal antibody companies. **REGN** has Emergency Use Authorization (""EUA"") to administer a combo of casirivimab and imdevimab to reduce hospitalization and emergency room visits. It's a key part of the fight against Covid, and REGN is a solid stock. That said, the EUA has been on the market since November; also, REGN is too expensive for me to play options. Good stock, but pass.

**Humanigen** is my play here. It's been a volatile ticker as it bounces around from good news (high volume big spikes) to no news (low volume melt downwards) around lenzilumab, its Monoclonal antibody. Lenzilumab differs from the REGN cocktail in that it is meant to treat patients once they are *already* hospitalized. In other words, it's a heavy hitter. Bears point out that the cost of lenzilumab could be extremely high; bulls point out that if it's actually effective, it'll be a hell of a lot cheaper than extended hospital stays.

If it receives an EUA, expect a significant pump, and possibly even an acquisition, sometime in the next year.

Position: I've been selling and closing CSP's on this to profit from the volatility. Currently, I have CSP's open @ $17.5 strike, exp 5/21. Hoping to get assigned.

**Oral Vaccine**:

Vaxart is in position to be first to market with an oral vax. Here are all the companies currently in the [race](https://covid-19tracker.milkeninstitute.org/#vaccines_intro):

Vaxart's pill showed positive results in February, [generating an autoimmune response](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/vaxart-oral-vaccine-candidate/) against SARS-COV-2 antigens.

A study released [yesterday](https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/vaccines/vaxart-covid-19-oral-vaccine) shows Vaxart is advancing S-only vaccine candidates targeted specifically against variant strains, including targeting the famed **South African viral strain**. These new candidates are expected to generate strong mucosal and serum antibody responses and complement the potent T-cell inducer VXA-CoV2-1. Vaxart has previously shown that a bivalent oral vaccine using its platform can induce immune responses without interference.

Vaxart's internal polling shows that 19 million Americans who would decline the jab [would be fine taking an oral vaccine](https://investors.vaxart.com/news-releases/news-release-details/poll-oral-covid-19-vaccine-pill-offers-way-overcome-vaccine). Hell, if I'd had the option between pills or the Pfizer, I would've gone pill all the way. Fear of needles is real.

Casino-wise, I noticed something nuts today: there is massive volume on [short-dated Vaxart calls](https://www.barchart.com/options/open-interest-change/increase), strike of $9. Does someone know something? Couldn't be! Insider trading is like, illegal. LOL 👮‍♂️👨‍⚖️

There are a few puts sprinkled in there, probably as hedges. But it looks like whales are bullish on the immediate short-term prospects for Vaxart. For those who like to play against the shorts, Ortex is showing Vaxart with a significant amount of shares on loan, comprising 28% of the float. If this comes close to 9, market makers will have to buy up shares to satisfy all those calls. This could absolutely gamma squeeze, and soon. 🚀

**Position**: 100 shares @ $8.30; several 4/30 calls @ $8.5 and $9 (purchased today); a few $8 puts expiring next week to hedge. Considering rolling some out tomorrow to enjoy more theta. Looking to convert options to equity if it moons and play this longterm. None of this is financial advice, I am a complete moron who spends most of his time inserting skittles into various orifices.

Good luck everyone and stay safe!

tl;dr

Not everyone will submit to the jab; USA needs a plan to deal with vaccine hesitancy; need pills and oral vaccines; nasal sprays meh.

Vaxart 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 with insane options activity.

Note: Both my positions are in companies *just below* $1B market cap; Humanigen nudged over the line with today's price movement, and Vaxart is at $999m.  Wanted to provide this info while they're both on the doorstep.  This is why, admins permitting, you'll have to look up the tickers on your own!"
2021-04-28 22:14:09,wallstreetbets,"Well written, but I’ll pass.  The people whom are highest risk of hospitalization got the vaccine.  The remaining people that are un-vaccinated don’t care about alternatives and are unlikely to end up in hospitals. 

If you want to speculate on COVID, speculate on which vaccine will be used in developing countries."

The reality of it is for the degree of lockup we're talking about, major players would have an exceptionally hard time finding the other end of a short play at any real value."

2021-04-28 22:49:22,wallstreetbets,"TY. And yeah, the longer expiry is way less retarded. Could probably close for around breakeven when I'm wrong come Monday"
2021-04-29 00:44:37,wallstreetbets,"API, BYND, FUBO, this very stock on 2 occasions?

There really isn't a ""priced in"" here. No one's really aware how many insiders are going to sell, then or later. It's ""priced in"" to an extent, to the existing stock price at IPO time. The movement isn't a change in value in the underlying, it's a (in theory, in a healthy stock) temporary pressure on the sell end.

Plus, in the vast majority of cases, the company isn't an outright fraud. That changes the dynamic more than a bit. The only excuse investors have for holding long-term is the idea that the stock may jump when the EV truck is announced. I'm not exactly sure they'll get to that point and even if they do they have absolutely no edge in the marketplace. Stupid thing is just cobbled together off-the-shelf parts with a sticker on it."
2021-04-29 02:44:45,wallstreetbets,"yes, PLTR for example. On its way back up now though."
2021-04-29 00:39:37,wallstreetbets,"Not sure why you'd say that if you have a firm timeline for an unusual decline vs just pessimistic about the stock in general. Borrowing fees for NKLA are very high, in the 20% region. Call volume can be exceptionally difficult and you'd at least have to be prepared to exit both legs independently. Both things come at a cost and lack the leverage of puts."

2021-04-29 00:33:57,wallstreetbets,"It's not illegal per se; there's no statute enforcing IPO lockups and it's a tort matter. Generally speaking it'll be accounted for in the IPO agreement that no hedging, shorting, etc is allowable."

2021-04-29 01:33:06,wallstreetbets,"The put only pays if it goes down greater than premium paid by expiration.  Trade sideways then you lose to time decay.  If it goes down less than premium it’s a loss.  

Selling calls in a bearish play you collect for both sideways and downwards movement.

Edit: for selling short, I wouldn’t recommend it as an extended play. OP mentioned lockup expiration day, so it would be something to do the day prior or even ride the negative momentum the day of assuming that’s what happens."
2021-04-28 22:40:16,wallstreetbets,"it was extended through April 30th, aka it probably slumping Friday on anticipation and shorts who will buy back from insiders on Monday, and then hopefully tanking Monday to the center of the planet"
2021-04-29 01:02:11,wallstreetbets,"Especially here. There's nothing technical floating the stock higher lately, nor optimism surrounding their bullshit vaporware. Best I've seen, the recent uptick was just:

* They announced a ""partnership"" the mirror image of last lockup expiry...no firm financial committment, no clear way of meeting their end, and a credulous risk-free partner wanting to boost their own image
* This was paired with the chairman pitching the stock on CNBC with some...interestingly creative claims. It's been paired with pumps in a handful of generic pumping shops. 
* There was a fairly large-sized swell this past week and a half in EVs and alternative energy. Other fraud/vaporware companies (I'm looking at you, PLUG, BLNK, QS) have also been trending up for no reason I can discern other than a bullish sector on TSLA earnings + infrastructure.
* I don't even know enough about the markets, but this stock has ended up pumped to varying degrees in premarket every. single. day. It would not shock me if some folks are swapping shares overnight at an elevated price to gain some buzz."

2021-04-29 01:39:26,wallstreetbets,"I'm familiar with basic options strategies. That doesn't make a theta-neutral play ""better"" if one's convinced of a short-term, indeterminate fall in the underlying. I'm 20x more heavily leveraged with ATM puts than I would be with a naked short with none of the 4x loss risk, and I don't have the wait-to-exit, liquidity, and bracketing issues one has with CCS. 

Your recommendations are good generic bearish strategies to not get burned. This is a YOLO with a clear timeline, and a thought-out one. Puts. I could give 2 shits about a week's theta on a heavy play."

If he is successful and Americans buy American products, then America’s gdp would be high af. It could all be achieved with little to no inflation, a baller ass stock market, and a $15-17 nationwide minimum wage. Think about the Clinton days. Now create a modern version of the Clinton days and you have Biden-economics. If people have high end manufacturing jobs that pay well and layered with government incentives, everyone wins.

They are extremely caught up in the pride of being right, not examining the issues.  I don't see America surviving very well in the near term.  We've already proven democracy doesn't really matter when outlets like Time admit to collusion because it was worth cheating to keep the other guy out.  The underpinning of American society has the same integrity as its network of bridges, and websites like this are prime examples as to why that's true."

You’re complaining about manipulation when it doesn’t serve the guy you voted for, right? Did you complain about the 2016 election and Russian involvement? I’m not even trying to talk politics, just compare it to a specific time frame(seeing as Bush hit a bear market and Trump took down just as many investors as he created). Before you claim that I am for one side of politics vs the other, I voted for trump the first time and voted for Biden the 2nd time because I didn’t appreciate how much of a joke Trump turned America into, and because bigots felt more empowered to act like a bunch of idiots since Trump became president(runs for both political parties)."
2021-04-28 23:50:42,wallstreetbets,"I have a conspiracy I made up, but I'm pretty proud of it. I think the 15 dollar federal minimum wage is secretly being pushed by corporations in order to push small business and new competitors  out of the market. corporations take a small hit by having to pay more, but on the upside potential rivals are hit hard and competition especially in low margin businesses get stomped. the rich get richer, and the poor cut the rope that holds the guillotine over their own heads."
2021-04-28 22:31:51,wallstreetbets,"Lol you think raising minimum wage will increase the cost of your food that much? You’d be surprised by the profit margin in food. I would try to explain it to you, but you likely have no business sense and no understanding of what profit margin is.        

It’s okay if McDonalds replaces everyone. If everyone is able to get a high paying manufacturing job, what will it matter who works fast food? I remember in the Clinton days people used to get contract bonuses for working at fast food restaurants."

2021-04-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why is big money holding $AMRN shares down? I think I know Primer Amarin($AMRN) makes the drug Vascepa. Which helps to reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke and certain types of heart issues.

Too many positives have happened for $AMRN this year, and big money has kept swatting it down. Why?

China included in its updated Guidelines for Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Diseases [Link](https://investor.amarincorp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/icosapent-ethyl-included-chinese-society-cardiology-csc-updated): swatted down

EU approveal [Link](https://investor.amarincorp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amarin-receives-european-commission-ec-approval-vazkepa-reduce): swatted down

UK marketing authorization [Link](https://investor.amarincorp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amarin-receives-great-britain-marketing-authorization-vazkepa): swatted down

There are many many other instances this year this has happened, and I couldn't put my finger as to why. At first I thought it may be because of a lawsuit they have over infringement, but that only deals with 10% of sales, **and only in the US!**

**Down the rabbit hole:**

So then I started digging deeper, and I believe big money is holding this down cause of a Clinical Trial called PREPARE-IT [Link](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04460651) .It's supposed to show that  Amarin's drug Vascepa could help treat COVID. The study is already being finalized and should be coming out later this year. **This could be the next Moderna in my opnion.** I believe that's the main reason why they want to hold it down, until the release of trail to gobble up as many shares as they can. Could I be wrong? Yeah, but the manipulation is so blatenly obivous that I think otherwise. We will find out later this year.  GL to my fellow apes. ✌️💎💎✌️"
2021-04-28 23:18:02,wallstreetbets,"My wife is in the medical field and says that the drug they’re testing is basically fish oil, but without the DHA.

They also only need to improve their premium to claims margin by 5%, to double their runway for expansion. Pretty doable now that we are emerging from covid.

Beyond that, there's a small squeeze chance at earnings. 5/21 option chain had low delta when most of the calls were purchased, with 200k call OI for 5/21 that was out of the money. 60k of these moved ITM today. Delta is still low at 0.62 on the 10C. Shorts are mostly in at $15 or under a share, with probably 30% SI still.

If there's a strong move on earnings, the options chain will force the price up likely over $20. At that point, shorts may start covering."

2021-04-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Maxed out my line of Credit + and my life savings into $MNMD ​🌝 or ​👉​👌 It's easy,

I currently rent a basement in a house with 4 roommates upstairs, rent is cheap, so I can save up for a down payment. Here's the kicker, I live in Toronto, Canada. If you want a detached house that's not a meth den, you need to either : be making 6 figures, be a mega-frugal buzz-kill for years, have rich parents, or have a very successful only fans. But here's where my superpower kicks in: im cripplingly retarded, im so retarded that i should be sterilized so i never re-produce. I took the roughly 50k that I had saved up from living at home with my parents until I was 27 like some dirty man-child goblin feeding off of Cheez-Its crumbs and Frozen Pizzas, and, I took another ~30k from my Line of Credit to YOLO $MNMD, an at the time an OTC Schedule 1 drug company. This was all the DD I did:

* googled shroom stock companies, $MNMD was one of the biggest with by far the most pipelines for FDA approval,** lizard brain activated** more chances for success i guess or some shit
* I've done every drug below the Injectable tier, MDMA, Shrooms, LSD etc
Logo and website cool **ape brain engaged**
* i wish i was kidding but thats it, there is no more bullet points, it took about 35 minutes of googling to YOLO $80k, every penny i had to my name.
I bought in last December and on multiple occasions I've had the ability to sell and finally buy my own place and start building equity, but then i'll just be house poor for 25 years. I always knew this was going to be a long hold. If you've ever done shrooms or molly, you know what it's like, you shouldn't need convincing to invest.

**that should be your DD**

then i found the mindmed subreddit where i met mere Gods amongst mortals posting price targets, DD's, Quality Memes. Things i look at and pretend i know what they mean. I knew i found my home, and all the posts further reinforced my conviction in this company. I just hid there lurking since before 1000 members. i've been up hugely, i've been down hugely as well.

The one intangible thing i can't shake is the gut feeling that somehow my Autism will prevail, i may have finally weaponized it.

**The way i look at it is this is my lifes lottery, this is my DFV moment, one attempt to gap up my social class or relegate to being lower middle class for the rest of my life ""Get Rich or $ROPE trying "" - 50 cent**

If i do lose it all, well at least i was invested in something where the goal is the betterment of individuals like me, fellow retards. And i'll be able to sleep at night knowing that. Also my loss porn will fuel my masturbatory sessions for years to come.

if i had this money in literally any other stock a 10% dip and I'd paperhand and $ROPE but for some reason with $MNMD, it just feels like for once im very very early to something, i always look at shit like $SHOP $TSLA $WEED and go , if only i would have bought x amount back in y ,

If you make the spreads expire for in a month then you double your money as long as S&P 500 is up on the month (it probably will be).  If you double it 4 times you make 32x on you money
2021-04-29 01:32:28,wallstreetbets,"A lot of retards might disagree with me but I am saving your life right now.

Bro. Take at least SOME profits when you are in the money. Why?

MNMD does not and will not have SALES for probably a couple of years!! Without sales a stock price never stays up and it always falls eventually. ALWAYS. I’ve seen this too many times before. Don’t lose all your money investing in a company without sales. Once the hype dies down this will fall significantly.

And the other part of my DD is my strong personal belief that if I could have had the opportunity to take these substances 10 years ago in a controlled environment, under the guide of professional, without having to risk going to some shady dudes house and potentially ending up with something fake, I wouldn’t struggle nearly as much with bipolar, if at all."

2021-04-29 06:50:10,wallstreetbets,Made an order to close my call positions as soon as they hit $1000. The second the order closed the stock price dropped over a dollar in less than a minute and I just sat there feeling incredibly sad for whoever bought those options.

2021-04-28 20:04:51,wallstreetbets,"Not sure why, they are going to announce further decreased revenue, hense why they pushed it forward."
2021-04-29 11:57:58,wallstreetbets,"Same, currently down 7k or so 😂"
2021-04-28 20:40:59,wallstreetbets,"Hell yeah. At the end of the day, set a happy target and then ignore the stock after you cash out lol"
2021-04-29 00:52:02,wallstreetbets,good for you.

2021-04-28 21:01:52,wallstreetbets,Why would they push it forward for bad news? Usually if an earnings report is pushed up it’s usually a good sign. But I could be wrong. I don’t hold MVIS but just watching the rollercoaster.
2021-04-29 08:28:28,wallstreetbets,I’d be cool with that too

2021-04-29 15:36:10,wallstreetbets,"If you wanted to buy at the lower price you could have sold outs instead, collect the high premium and also potentially get the stock at a discount (if assigned). Or just buy more with the premium if not. Assuming of course you want/can afford 100 shares."
2021-04-28 21:06:07,wallstreetbets,"Yes, there are people here saying that. Most of them are just repeating whats been said to them on reddit. Thats the problem with getting investing knowledge from reddit, you get tricked into thinking people here know what they are talking about. 

We will see who’s right tomorrow, I bet it’ll be me. I looked through their financial filings this year and all i see is them doubling down on R&D. Big money probably feels the same way since its likely mostly retail holding now after buying above 20$.

E: called it. Suck it downvoters"

2021-04-29 18:01:11,wallstreetbets,Yeah weve been talking about it in another thread... looks like im long on MVIS now
2021-04-28 20:08:58,wallstreetbets,I’m with you💎🙌
2021-04-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Do financial websites just make up reasons why stocks go up or down after the fact? I swear every “financial news” site headline says things like “Tesla’s stock falls after crash” though I doubt the price change had anything to do with the crash and the stock price is actually going up by the time the article comes out. 

It seems to me they make shit up to try to connect why the price is moving when it actually has zero to do with it. Shouldn’t they be noticing something happening and making a calculated guess where the price is going?

I’ve only been following the market since January so maybe I’m wrong but I completely feel like redditors have more insight into stock prices than any of these journalists. 

I don’t listen to any of these articles I just needed a venting session."
2021-04-28 20:43:56,wallstreetbets,"During the peak of the pandemic, CNN was doing realtime coverage coverage of the stock market every day. As each day got more out of touch with reality, you could tell the writers were just giving up trying to rationalize the price action. Was a wonderful read. 


A little off topic, but I encourage you to read Anna Coulling's VPA. explains really well the life cycle of stocks going up and down and news being the main tool for manipulation. JP Morgan initiates a PT of XYZ at $20? They loaded up at $3 and will be dumping on you at $16."
2021-04-28 21:17:08,wallstreetbets,"***""Stock Market Did A Thing Today, No One Really Can Be Sure Why""*** might be a more truthful headline, but it's hard to keep getting clicks if you just repeat that every day."

Long answer: YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSS"
2021-04-28 21:29:34,wallstreetbets,"It's meant to keep people misinformed about the market so they don't participate. Why do you think 90% of people don't know what a ""stock"" is? They take one look at the news and say fuck this im going back to my 9-5, and blame their poorness on ""the system"" and our education pipeline from school to factory. Ain't shit changed in 60 years"
2021-04-29 01:42:10,wallstreetbets,"No, but sometimes yes.

It is easier to determine the causation of a stocks movement after the fact. In some cases there are specific catalysts that trigger the price movement. Examples: Sharp rise in yields, geopolitical shock, disappointing earnings, financial fraud investigation announced, etc... 

Most of the time the financial websites are making stuff up is while it’s happening, not after it’s happened, they have no idea what’s going to happen next. Nobody does."
2021-04-28 20:07:50,wallstreetbets,THIS is the way.
2021-04-28 20:18:00,wallstreetbets,"They have a copy/paste boilerplate article they insert everytime a stock is red or green for the day.

2021-04-28 20:31:18,wallstreetbets,No one knows wtf they're doing.  The only difference is capital.

2021-04-28 21:35:32,wallstreetbets,It’s known that companies release good news about their company then when people buy the stock the major shareholders sell then buy again once the price goes back down after the normal traders get out.
2021-04-28 21:49:50,wallstreetbets,Does the weather channel report the shit after it happens?? You bet your left nut they do
2021-04-28 21:51:29,wallstreetbets,Yes.
2021-04-28 21:53:37,wallstreetbets,Most sites retrospectively edit their articles to make it looks like they predicted the ups and downs of a stock.   Financial news sites are just as clueless as most of us are about the movement of the stocks.
2021-04-28 22:01:39,wallstreetbets,Coorelation is not causation.

2021-04-28 23:15:50,wallstreetbets,"yes. this is media in general. most times after an event, stuff gets floated out there until a concensus is built on what the narrative will be"
2021-04-28 23:25:56,wallstreetbets,"I have worked with some very smart analysts. They would do all the research you could ever imagine and find some great looking stocks. Earnings come out, hit all targets, price drops. Articles come out with one reason or another on why the price fell. All these analysts could do is shrug when you ask them why the price didn't move upwards. 

Sometimes the price of a stock just moves in a way that seems to make no sense at all and often flies in the face of all the facts. The wise reaction is to shrug and admit that there are some things you just can't explain. But unfortunately news sites need to publish something. So they just grab an idea out of the air and publish it no matter how silly it is."
2021-04-28 23:49:16,wallstreetbets,"Most stonk articles are total nonsense. If the authors knew why stonks go up and down all the time, they wouldn't be writing articles, they'd be buying islands."

2021-04-29 00:26:10,wallstreetbets,It’s hilarious.  On yahoo’s front page it’s usually a day behind or so and the articles are declaring the opposite of the current reality and it is hilarious and infuriating.  It’s all 100% garbage.
2021-04-29 00:33:22,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Honestly they're guessing they could be right, wrong, or partially both."
2021-04-29 00:54:33,wallstreetbets,"There are so many variables on why people buy and sell stocks that without perfect information you can never know with certainty the overall reason. It isn’t really making stuff up per se, I am sure *someone* sold or bought for the reasons they attribute to it, which is why you can’t go after them for lying usually as it isn’t technically lying.

Tl;dr: financial news is mostly garbage."
2021-04-29 01:38:21,wallstreetbets,That is why you need critical thinking when reading those news. It is obvious they are trying to manipulate people thought.

2021-04-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$ROOT is an extremely undervalued disruptive growth stock currently at a good entry point (DD) Alright boys, disruptive tech has been hit hard, so buy the fucking dip and either go broke or get rich with me (thanks be to Jpow). I think ROOT is a solid disruptive tech play that will hit so hard it may even make the fact that people buy 10-year treasury bills at these yields in the face of inflation make sense.

ROOT is an insurance tech (or insurtech) company, which is considered the ""next big opportunity after FinTech,"" as the insurance industry is considered to be at a ""key inflection point"" in a pivot to insurance tech companies ([source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200701005415/en/Global-Insurtech-Market-2020-to-2025---Growth-Trends-and-Forecast---ResearchAndMarkets.com)). The insurance tech market worldwide was valued at $2.72 billion in 2020, and that valuation is expected to grow with an insane CAGR of 48.8% from 2021 to 2028 ([source](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/insurtech-market)). ROOT primarily provides car insurance, though it is expanding its home insurance business.

ROOT uses something called ""telematics"" to offer extremely low car insurance rates to good drivers. Telematics is basically using all sorts of technology to monitor cars. The algorithms applied to and data derived from ROOT telematics are 10x more predictive of driving risk and accidents than typical predictors used by normal insurance companies ([source, pages 114-115](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001788882/000162828020014828/roots-1a3.htm)). This allows ROOT to tailor insurance pricing to driving risk with 10x more accuracy than other companies, saving both ROOT and their customers a ton of money at the same time. In addition, ROOT does not insure bad drivers--because 30% of drivers cause nearly 45% of accident costs--resulting in substantially better margins for ROOT. ROOT's app (used to collect data) is pretty, can do everything related to the insurance (e.g., filing a claim), and most importantly, is quite good at picking important stuff out. For example, it can determine whether you're the passenger or driver in a car, or if you're biking, taking a bus, or taking a train ([source](https://www.joinroot.com/blog/how-root-knows-driver-or-passenger/)), so it accurately determines driving risk. Their setup also circumvents issues related to turning off one's phone etc. in that if your phone goes off or the app is closed/blocked during the trial period, the two-week trial period that determines your quote is disrupted and starts over ([source](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/05/new-kind-of-auto-insurance-can-be-cheaper-but-tracks-your-every-move.html)). Once the trial period is over, the data they collect is used to further refine their AI and sold to interested parties. ROOT does not sell personally identifiable data, but they *do* sell nonidentifiable data. These data are quite valuable to everyone working in the self-driving car industry as well as other insurance companies. This is another source of revenue for ROOT. In short, ROOT uses tech to make sure they don't insure bad drivers and to provide the lowest rates possible to their customers.

I had to pay a fuckton of money for insurance when I first started driving because of my demographics, even though all of my friends routinely told me I drove like a grandma. I fucking hated paying as much as I had to for insurance given how good of a driver I am, and ROOT appeals to people like me hard.

ROOT is still in the early phase of its growth stage. They are currently licensed in 30 states but have recently acquired a shell company with licenses in all 50 states, which will allow them to expand into all states. I'm not sure of their exact timeline for doing so, but according to [one article](https://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/news/2020/12/03/root-insurance-bullish-on-2021-analysts-divided.html), they plan to aggressively and methodically expand nationwide during 2021--hiring managers with experience in each state they're expanding into.

Here's why I think ROOT is a good play.

# ROOT is absurdly undervalued for a growth company

I first found ROOT by looking through a screener for undervalued growth stocks, judging by the price/sales/growth (PSG) ratio. The PSG ratio is similar to the PEG ratio, except it works really well to measure the value of growth stocks rather than stocks of mature companies (which are typically better assessed via PEG). A stock's PSG ratio is calculated as its price/sales ratio divided by its 3-year or 5-year sales growth, expressed as a percent. Prior work published on a site I can't link (I can't link the site that seeks alpha, right?) found that stocks with PSG values between 0.00 and 0.20 consistently beat the market, whereas negative or higher PSG ratios than 0.20 underperformed.

ROOT's PSG ratio is 0.06 (3-year growth) or 0.11 (5-year growth) depending upon whether 3- or 5-year growth is used as the denominator. How does that compare to other growth companies?

||P/S/G 3-year|P/S/G 5-year|Sales 5-year Growth|Cash Flow 5-year Growth|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|RKT|0.01|0.01|54.8%|\-17.0%|
|ROOT|0.06|0.11|51.6%|39.2%|
|ASO|0.08|0.14|3.5%|21.9%|
|AMZN|0.15|0.15|29.3%|46.1%|
|SQ|0.19|0.24|49.6%|14.3%|
|ZG|0.21|0.24|39.0%|\-6.4%|
|TSLA|0.48|0.37|50.8%|45.5%|
|COIN|0.50|0.89|19.5%|92.1%|
|SHOP|0.75|0.68|70.2%|102.1%|
|LMND|0.76|1.39|33.2%|18.0%|

As you can see, ROOT's PSG is absurdly low: lower than AMZN's and many other popular growth stocks—though not as low as RKT's, which is stupid low, but its declines in cash flow hamper enthusiasm for its sales growth. In addition, its growth is matched by huge increases in cash flow. In every backtest I've done or seen, a PSG this low is very likely to outperform the market over the next year.

# ROOT is extremely undervalued compared to its only publicly traded peer

ROOT's primary publicly traded peer is LMND. They're different companies, in that LMND offers homeowner's/renter's/pet insurance but not car insurance, whereas ROOT primarily focuses on car insurance but has been expanding homeowner's/renter's insurance. But they're both insurtech companies in their growth phase and can be compared somewhat. ROOT's 5-year revenue growth is almost twice that of LMND's, and ROOT's cash flow growth rate is over twice LMND's. Additionally, ROOT's price/sales ratio is 5.85 and LMND's is a whopping 46.34. Accordingly, ROOT's PSG ratio is about 1/12th the size of LMND's (remember, smaller is better). If ROOT was valued at LMND's P/S ratio, it would be trading at $86 per share. If ROOT was valued at LMND's 5-year PSG ratio, it would be trading at $134 per share. These are a bit extreme (LMND is overvalued by any metric), but this further illustrates that ROOT is extremely undervalued.

# Analyst consensus points to 77% upside for ROOT

Usually I don't give a shit about analysts because their recommendations are awful at forecasting stock prices. I know some people like analyst consensus, though, so I figured I'd mention it. Out of 13 analysts, 4 give a buy recommendation, 8 hold, and 1 sell. The consensus price target for those analysts is $19.23, which equates to a bit over 77% upside over the current share price.

# Insider purchases of ROOT are very bullish

Over the last six months, insiders have bought a combined $12.5 million shares of ROOT and sold $2.8 million. Looking at those sales on Fidelity, many of them were automatic sales. Insiders sell stock for all sorts of reasons, but they only buy for one reason: they think that the stock will go up. And insiders have put a net $10 million of their own money on that over the last six months.

# ROOT has a number of high-profile institutional tech investors

I probably don't care as much about institutional investors as I should, but I know some people care about them a lot. ROOT's institutional investor list includes the high-profile tech investment firms of Silver Lake, Dragoneer, Coatue, Hillhouse, Tiger Global, Whale Rock, Durable Capital, DST Global, Redpoint Ventures, and Ribbit Capital, among others.

# ROOT is a founder-led company

ROOT's CEO is its (co-)founder, and a Harvard Business Review study found that stock prices of founder-led companies in the S&P 500 outperform stock prices in other companies in the S&P 500 that are not founder-led by a factor of 3.1x ([source](https://hbr.org/2016/03/founder-led-companies-outperform-the-rest-heres-why])). Impressively, those data were published before TSLA had any sort of a rise (data analyzed went to 2014). This outperformance could be because founder-led companies tend to be more innovative ([source](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/365106)). Whatever the reason, the fact that ROOT is led by its founder is a good sign for its stock long-term.

# ROOT is highly shorted

ROOT's price is currently suppressed because of short selling. According to the official FINRA data, ROOT is the most shorted stock on the market, with 54.33% of its float shorted (see [here](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest)). Now, often that would drive me away from the stock (though not GME; I have been long GME since November). Most often, highly shorted stocks are highly shorted for good reason: they might go bankrupt. But ROOT isn't about to go bankrupt. It's a growth stock with extremely high YoY growth and strong increases in cash flow. Our good friend Andrew Left of Shitron finally figured out how to work his webcam, but more importantly for this DD, published a [report](https://twitter.com/CitronResearch/status/1375201205941633031) on ROOT, saying that it is a ""misunderstood short"" and that it should be trading at least at its IPO price ($27)--if not substantially higher. In my absolute stupidity, I consider shorts on a company that isn't going bankrupt to be longs that just haven't bought yet. Literally can't go tits up?

# ROOT has a strong moat

ROOT's moat is not primarily in their app (which I personally really like). ROOT's moat is mainly in their enormous amount of collected data and, even more so, machine learning algorithms trained on those data to predict accidents. They have [patented their tech for tracking and analyzing device behavior, aka their telematics](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10880691B1/en). They have also received two trademarks. [According to their S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1788882/000162828020014305/roots-1.htm),  they have also filed for other patents related to other parts of their  IP. They also are choosing not to file patents for certain parts of  their IP as doing so requires them to disclose that IP and it can thus  be copied in concept but not design (see pages 36-37 of their S-1 linked  above). These pieces of intellectual property are quite strong, and they allow ROOT to profit from selling nonidentifiable data to interested parties, in addition to ensuring that any other company that wanted to do what they do would need to collect data for years in order to achieve the same level of accident predictiveness that ROOT has.

# Technicals on ROOT indicate a good entry point

I fucking hate crayons but I know some of you kids like them. ROOT recently had a bullish breakout of a descending wedge that it had been stuck in since December. See below.

https://preview.redd.it/2jvsu7up5zv61.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=344b2e70ad14ed27d6e416a2c55752a7a6729cf8

# Potential downsides and bear cases

ROOT is embroiled in some legal battles related to alleged misrepresentations of the company at its IPO. These misrepresentations supposedly include misrepresentations of customer acquisition costs and the relative advantage of ROOT relative to other insurance peers in telematics data and data engagement. The lawsuit also states that an analyst has alleged that ROOT will not be cash flow positive until 2027 and will require, in the analyst's opinion, significant cash infusions. There are three main responses to this issue that matter as far as new investors are concerned. First, it's likely that this suit was filed because a law firm wants to make a name for itself; [suing new tech IPOs is trendy](https://fortune.com/2019/08/27/uber-lyft-ipo-aftermath-lawsuits/) for law firms because it has low risk and high potential reward if they win. Basically all new IPOs that drop get hit with a lawsuit. In support of the idea that this lawsuit won't hold water, the firm to file this suit doesn't actually have a plaintiff and [is advertising to try to find one](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pomerantz-law-firm-announces-the-filing-of-a-class-action-against-root-inc-and-certain-officers--root-301252367.html).  Second, these issues have all been heavily priced in at this point; there is not a place you can go to look at ROOT stock that you don't see a reminder of these lawsuits. Moreover, growth forecasts have already been adjusted downwards with all of this information, and ROOT is *still* as undervalued as I described above--those numbers for growth forecasts and price/sales are current. Second, prior to ROOT going public, the early institutional investors in ROOT had access to all of this information and chose to invest at the equivalent of roughly $27/share. There hasn't been any institutional or insider selling since this lawsuit has surfaced, so insiders/institutions are not jumping ship. And importantly for anyone thinking of getting in now, this has already been priced in and ROOT is still massively undervalued.

The second bear case for ROOT is that any other insurance company could roll out some similar thing. However, other insurance agencies can't suddenly drop all of their dangerous drivers without trashing their reputation and potentially facing legal action, whereas ROOT can choose not to insure bad drivers from the get-go without hurting their reputation. That alone gives ROOT an edge in the sense of not having to pay for more accidents. More importantly, no other insurance company is close to having refined their algorithms nearly as much as ROOT. ROOT has years worth of data and has improved their algorithms' predictive abilities substantially since beginning. Software is always at risk of competition, but ROOT's is a landslide best for the time being, and an early edge is a big one in disruptive tech.

The third bear case is that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) receives complaints about ROOT at a higher rate than most companies, though ROOT did improve on this in 2020 (82 complaints received) relative to 2019 (122 complaints received). In 2020, the NAIC assigned ROOT a Complaint Index score of 1.84, which means that the NAIC received 1.84x more complaints against ROOT than would be expected for the number of drivers they insure. Searching insurance subs for ROOT, it seems that most of the complaints against ROOT are related to rate increases--which they do if someone drives riskier than previously, or if the value of cars around them increases.

The fourth potential downside for ROOT is the same one facing all of disruptive tech: Yellen hates America and Powell is racist. But in seriousness, rising interest rates due to runaway inflation would hamper expected future returns of ROOT and any other disruptive growth stock.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TLDR**: ROOT is a deeply undervalued, rapidly expanding company in a rapidly growing industry. It has all the qualities it needs to succeed long term and is at an excellent entry point.

2021-04-28 22:37:09,wallstreetbets,"I installed root last year and tried to get insured through them. I drive a lot like all day often, they said they couldn't insure me. That's bullish.

I used some other fintech insurance stuff currently. Will pick up a hundred shares or sto some csps"
2021-04-28 21:14:54,wallstreetbets,In since November 😬 Averaged down to $15 now but I'll continue to average down and hold I still like it.
2021-04-28 23:40:22,wallstreetbets,Down 20% since your gamma squeeze prediction. Wheres the loss porn from that?
2021-04-29 01:43:36,wallstreetbets,Their tech doesn’t help the. Make any money. Their loss ratio was 78% in 2020.
2021-04-28 23:00:05,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the thorough DD and for not just listing the bull cases!

I have a few follow up questions for you. Where are you seeing that their algorithms are 10x better at predicting accident occurrence? What peers is that comparing to? If this fact were true then their direct loss ratios should be significantly better than the industry average. However, even with the pandemic last year, their “stable” states had a direct loss ratio of 78%. The industry average is 40-60%. Additionally, most of the major insurance carriers take losses on auto insurance and make up for it in other lines of business. Since Root currently only sells auto insurance, it will be difficult for them to beat other insurers in price because they don’t have the means to make up the difference in other ways. I heard that they are exploring renters insurance, but I’m not sure where they are at with rolling it out.

That said, I do think this stock is a high risk, high reward bet. If they show significant improvement on their direct loss ratios at their next earnings call, that could be a catalyst to cause the stock to 2-3x over a short period of time. I would love to see root succeed because I think insurance is in dire need of disruption."
2021-04-28 23:56:15,wallstreetbets,"Root's PSG is 6.84 not 5.85 (346.8 million sales and 2.731 cap - both numbers from the 10K) but their PSG ratio is still excellent if they can reach those growth goals.

However, the thing that really bothers me about the company is that their revenues have decreased substantially in the past 2 quarters, from just under 250 million in the first 2 quarters to about 100 million in the most recent 2 quarters. Why did this happen and is this going to be an ongoing problem?"
2021-04-29 00:26:14,wallstreetbets,"So what prevents someone from changing their driving habits during the trial phase, or even leaving their phone at home?

And what about if your phone dies?"
2021-04-29 01:09:11,wallstreetbets,"Didn't the share lockup expire?

Analysts estimate they will burn through all of their cash in the next 2 years.  I'll pass.

I have had telematics on my insurance app for 2 years, pretty sure my insurance company is screening for the same risk factors when their black box spits out my annual discount.  Not sure their tech is the game changer they claim it to be.

Also, would probably never buy their insurance because you have to download their app, then wait 2 weeks for a quote.  I make a couple of calls around renewal time to get quotes, then pay my annual premium and forget about it for a year."

2021-04-29 16:30:44,wallstreetbets,Is the the UW Loss Ratio or the combined?
2021-04-29 19:20:27,wallstreetbets,"Posting from my phone so excuse the brevity. I'm not sure about the direct loss ratios compared to the industry average, but my guess is that those 10x better data (if I remember right) come from their most recent version of their algorithm, which wasn't implemented until recently. I know it says in their 10-K that an independent firm evaluated the performance of their algorithm vs. standard methods and found the 10x predictiveness, and they give the firm if anyone wants to follow up. The bear cave didn't take issue with this in their bear case on ROOT, so my guess is at least they contacted the firm and found the predictiveness claim to be true. Time will tell on that.

ROOT does sell house insurance, it's just a much newer part of their business and not available in all states."
2021-04-29 19:23:27,wallstreetbets,"Huh, you're right. I wonder what numbers Fidelity is using? Usually they're super accurate. All the numbers I used are from Fidelity, so whatever discrepancy exists between those numbers and what ROOT obtained in revs should be present in the other companies too.

The last two quarters their revs decreased substantially because of their reinsurance program, which they've tabled for the time being to focus on profitability rather than growth. Direct premiums increased YoY and QoQ just as quick as ever in each of the last two quarters, they just had less actual revs because of the reinsurance stuff.

Posting from my phone, but I can get you sources if you want."

2021-04-29 19:28:59,wallstreetbets,"Their share lockup expired, yeah. None of the insiders have sold except from a trust with a 105b1 plan, which was before the lockup expiration. I would be surprised if any of their institutional investors sell below what they bought in at, which was the IPO price.

I thought the trial period was just fine. They offered me temp insurance if I needed it during the trial, but I had a plan already. I really like them, and I like not needing an agent. 

Other companies are doing similar stuff, but their telematics are still in the learning/infancy stage. ROOT's edge is in their lead in timing, coupled with some patented and some undisclosed IP."

The data would be standard vehicle telemetry, a model driver could be trained with a variety of people paid fifty bucks to drive my car around the city. Add in machine vision and you've got data on a driver's lane positioning skills and how they react to orange and red lights.

Like whatever, I don't need to know the details cuz I could hypothetically delegate a lot while learning from my team. And I'm also not trying to flex, my point was that as interesting as this tech is (as the rest of my posts in this thread show,) the critical factor is industry integration, because tech wise a competitor could pop out of nowhere.

ML is useless without data and actually dangerous with incomplete or misleading data. Where do you get it from?"
2021-04-29 02:18:30,wallstreetbets,"Well collecting data on ""well behaved driving"" is fairly trivial, once you've got the first prototype rig set up. You just go drive around like an incredibly well behaved citizen.

Collecting data on unsafe driving is again an area I might have a personal edge in since I know people who drive their track cars on the street anyway. Hit em up thru a mutual, plausible deniability etc etc.

That would get us data for various extremes, but we would need to decide on a complete model of relevant driving behaviour.

Take red light running as an example, that would have to be carefully tested since it would be pretty fkn irresponsible to send someone out to do something that stupid. Luckily in my city there's a place where learners get to drive off the roads in a simulated environment. I could probably use that. Or I could go out to a rural space with the crew and set up checkpoints with CB radios and just run some lights, run some oranges, run some reds, etc. Do it at various times of the day in different places. You know, think laterally.

Remember we're not talking about self driving cars, we're talking about patterns of inattentiveness while driving or patterns of dangerous and reckless driving. We're not driving the car here, we're just categorising driver behaviour.

Sorry for thinking like a CEO out loud, like I've said repeatedly I have no interest in this as a personal project and my earning potential makes it reckless for me to go try start up a company.

I'm reckless enough on wallstreet."

It sounded like a thousand clowns laughing at me and I felt like I was in the center of the arena where they Gnarfle the Garthok in coneheads. I ran my vomit covered hands through my hair as I realized I puked, only to slather myself in vomit to the chortles of the crowd. Healthy chunks, we all just had Wendy's.

I washed off my face and cleaned up and what do you know, everybody lined up to try it out after seeing what it did to me. We smoked the hell out of it. One of the kids had a full on seizure like a dying goat.

2021-04-29 00:09:06,wallstreetbets,"What is the move tomorrow? **I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THE MOVE IS TOMORROW.**

Tomorrow is set up to live in infamy. **I'm talking about the huge move likely for AMZN when they report earnings after the bell.** You have one more day to load up before blast off.

**Last time it consolidated for 8 months it took a massive 100% leg up.**

**I've watched the stock closely for years and** **I'm telling you it is set up to break out to 4000+ and it could happen within a few days.** We're sitting at ATH's now and there's no resistance left.

**An earnings beat sends it & a split supercharges it.** A 10 to 1 split makes AMZN a $400 stock which both means retail investors finally buy it in drove AND it gets added to the Dow both give it tailwinds.

All analyst Price Targets are already 30% higher than current price (4000-5000) and an earnings beat means all next week analyst after analyst will be tripping over themselves raising targets to 5000+.

**Powell meeting today was the final thing that needed to fall into place.** He reassured markets and now yields are calming back down, which means rising yield expectations won't stand in its way.

**The risk / reward over the next 1-2 months is insane. Maybe 10:1.** If you're buying shares think of it this way - downside is what, -2%? Upside is MASSIVE.

I'm buying calls. See you on the 🌙. **Call 4000 strike June 4 for me.**

It advertised a weekend retreat at the Princeton Theological Seminary “to explore the Gospel’s power to transform who we are and what we have been called to do in this industry.” The highlight was a dinner on a Saturday with three of the ministry’s advisers: Cathie Wood, whose ARK Investments was then a startup money manager; Paul Gojkovich, a former director at Merrill Lynch; and Hwang.

For a while, Wood and Hwang shared a similar trajectory. As Archegos piled up winning trades outside the public eye, she became an investing sensation. Wood’s flagship exchange-traded fund, a technology-heavy portfolio open to any retail investor, wowed the market with a 148% return in 2020. Hwang is also one of Wood’s investors, and, according to one of his former employees, Archegos and ARK collaborated on industry research. ARK declined to comment."

There are bad times, tough and challenging times, stressful times, sorrowful times but also happy and unbelievably joyous times. You never know what life is going to hit you with, but the whole point is that this is what life is about. You roll with whatever comes at you. Enjoy the good times, savor them. Learn and grow from the bad ones. Each moment is just that, a moment that passes. Our minds have a tendency to think that whatever moment we’re in will last forever, but that’s wrong. All things pass. One day, you will look back at this hard time nostalgically, as I do my first break up. With all these different moments, life is beautiful and fleeting, so take it in stride and remember to keep moving forward. During the darkest times of the pandemic, with all of patients dying around me, no matter what I did, I used this way of thinking to move forward. As long as you are trying your best to be a good person and not short changing yourself and your loved ones, then you are living life optimally. Best wishes kid."

If you answered yes, do that.  If not, GTFO and find something else that you'd feel more comfortable sinking that kind of money into.

Also, IMO any correction at this point will cause a 10+% dip, probably only if capital tax increment is confirmed or that interest rates will go up again. Bond buy back programmes will only cease when unemployment rates return to pre covid levels, we been seeing a lot of jobs reopening though they pay minimum wage ( which is a separate issue that will take decades to fix)

Best of luck to whatever direction you're picking 💯🍀"

2021-04-28 21:06:49,wallstreetbets,"As requested and to correct FUD ( and put in plain language ): Proper post-op vaginal construction is difficult as the scrotal skin is re-purposed. If too much follicle-killing chemical is used, the scrotal/vagina interior can become necrotic. Too little treatment and the pubic hair continues to grow internally. The latter, while problematic, is not harmful, while the former can be fatal. Always finger first if this sort of thing concerns you, or think of it as a condom with the ribs and nubs on the inside.

2021-04-29 00:38:49,wallstreetbets,"25,000 OI on the Jul $800C !!!!!!!!!!!!! WTF"
2021-04-29 01:04:34,wallstreetbets,Fake
2021-04-29 01:08:58,wallstreetbets,The IV on GME right now is stupid high. I can't see you making any money from this to be honest. The hype/short squeeze has passed. I'm getting second hand anxiety just looking at this. The t-value decay alone is going to make you regret this purchase within a week.
2021-04-29 01:20:11,wallstreetbets,You're fucked
2021-04-29 01:21:29,wallstreetbets,"Wow. Well done, thanks for sharing. I wish everyone shared their investment positions (particularly with life savings for dramatic effect)."
2021-04-29 01:28:51,wallstreetbets,Dude... you have to buy and hold SHARES...
2021-04-29 01:34:06,wallstreetbets,HOly shit this might be one of the most blatantly retarded things I've ever seen
2021-04-29 01:34:50,wallstreetbets,All I gotta say is.. you're going to be a rich mother fker at the end of this. No doubt in my mind lol
2021-04-29 01:37:38,wallstreetbets,You're betting out the price will be $800? You're an idiot
2021-04-29 01:52:47,wallstreetbets,Remember how people laughed at DFV before like how people now laugh at this guy?
2021-04-29 01:53:31,wallstreetbets,"I don't necessarily think this is a great idea, but for those people saying that it has to hit 800 to pay off need to learn a bit more about options... the premiums are always changing, so if gme breaks over 200 in the next couple weeks, the premium will go up for all the calls and they can be sold for a profit. If he held them to expiration then it would have to be over 800 or they expire worthless."
2021-04-29 02:00:53,wallstreetbets,"I am at a loss for words....lol seriously?  
WTF man there are better plays out there broski......"
2021-04-29 02:25:54,wallstreetbets,$800 by July? How high are we?
2021-04-29 02:28:41,wallstreetbets,"Damn you're a fucking idiot.

Hope it works out for you though."
2021-04-29 02:34:40,wallstreetbets,I'm sorry bro. I genuinely hope things turn out for the best for you but this move was stupid as fuck if that really is your live savings.
2021-04-29 03:02:04,wallstreetbets,"You people are so dumb, i love you"
2021-04-29 04:32:03,wallstreetbets,"This is dumb as fuck.

I really hope this isn't your actual life savings, but if gme suddenly rockets in the next month or 2, the IV might just make you a profit regardless of the price.

Even puts briefly became profitable when it went to 100 for the second time because of IV. Never seen anything like that. I hope you make a killing off of this of course. But this is still insanely retarded."
2021-04-29 05:21:43,wallstreetbets,Fake.
2021-04-29 05:29:10,wallstreetbets,You're a fucking idiot

2021-04-29 07:36:34,wallstreetbets,How’s GME even still going? Wtf
2021-04-29 07:38:37,wallstreetbets,"I did the same BUT I spread my calls out 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years.  Also keep $1000 so I can buy waayyyyyy OTM calls that expire the week of so when it rips I can see the weeklies first. MY FINANCIAL ADVISOR SAID THATS THE SMARTEST DUMB THING YOU EVER DID."
2021-04-29 08:22:11,wallstreetbets,$800 calls? Damn..
2021-04-29 08:59:50,wallstreetbets,"I hate to even ask, but as a 12 share shareholder since mid-January... How are we predicting this $800+ thing happening by July? Any DD? 

I'm just a little worried because homeboy DFV posted his ""final update"" a week or so ago, leading me to believe the cigar has had it's last puff, and he's sold it for an incredible profit."
2021-04-29 09:01:28,wallstreetbets,"Yep, you're retarded"
2021-04-29 10:45:03,wallstreetbets,But we didn’t even hit 200 or better yet 300 🤦🏻‍♂️ we still working with $171.. well more power to you bulls make it happen to the moon

2021-04-28 21:39:41,wallstreetbets,I’d say a big mistake but who am I to judge.
2021-04-28 21:43:22,wallstreetbets,It’s all about timing. Why don’t you just time the next dip and buy in? You could’ve bought 116 shares at $167 earlier today and made over $3k from a scalp. I will never get why some of you people hold for so long. Scalp it and take your fuckin money before you get burned.
2021-04-29 11:21:27,wallstreetbets,We should all buy into GME so this guy doesn’t have to watch his life savings vanish instantly.
2021-04-29 00:11:38,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, this trade makes no sense. You want to go all in on one trade... so be it.  But paying that much for 800 strike only 2 months out.  That’s just stupid.  Those are worth 30 cents, at best.  Do yourself a favor and dump those.  The spread sucks so you’ll take a bath, but at least you won’t have to watch a slow bleed of premium.   If this stock doubled to tomorrow your contracts would only go up maybe 20%, not a good return."
2021-04-29 12:32:08,wallstreetbets,wow you’re a fucking idiot
2021-04-29 16:54:42,wallstreetbets,Lol I cant believe you retards are still on this.
2021-04-28 20:27:19,wallstreetbets,"you guys really think GME is gonna climb back up? i diamond handed through both $300+ spikes which was just a straight up bad idea, but if there’s a real chance for it to get up there again i’m willing to buy back in."

2021-04-28 20:37:03,wallstreetbets,At that strike price I'm surprised the underwriter even took it since they're always has to be the opposite trade to even out the market makers Delta. And trying to sell it also requires liquidity so if the open interest is near zero good luck with that

2021-04-28 21:04:46,wallstreetbets,is there any advantage to buying a deep otm call like that or with a longer expiry (say november or beyond) ( both of which have high af premiums) as opposed to buying calls that expire that week/next week over and over again?
2021-04-28 21:09:10,wallstreetbets,"Why not 700/800 spreads? Verticals at this level are selling for about $100 a pop, imo it’s the better play because you’re basically 50-100x your bet depending on when it hits, getting about 5x more contracts than base calls. If it’s gonna squeeze it’s a given $1k+ a share, but I’m not one of the retards who actually thinks it’s gonna break 5k a share.

I mean that’s what I did, feel free to convince me otherwise."

2021-04-28 21:10:18,wallstreetbets,Can someone explain to a smooth brain exactly how this costs someone. If you put a call doesn’t that allow you to exercise the choice to not purchase?  And how do you choose 800. And if you know it’s going to 800 why is this better than just buying stocks. I really want to grasp the depth of the stupidity but I’m too stupid to do that.
2021-04-28 21:14:38,wallstreetbets,Glad you have stocks too.. no doubt millionaire even if the calls expire worthless 🚀 no dates but July would be nice 👍
2021-04-29 00:17:11,wallstreetbets,"i agree with the strike price for low cost, as well with the expiry date since GME holds shareholders meeting in june. perhaps there will be a clear indication if GME squeezes by that time. And with low IV rn those calls doesn't have to be ITM to be profitable.

however, with that amount of money i would have gone 80 to 90% shares and the rest are call option. so whatever happens in the next couple of months you'll be somewhat ""safe"".

i guess you made those bets believing GME will squeeze within few months. Best of Luck!"
2021-04-29 00:51:31,wallstreetbets,Y do this? Why not just buy and hold? You're practically guaranteed a multi bagger if you just wait. With the money you've got the gains would be tremendous.

Ponder this...if there was a 9,200 strike call that could be bought for 0.005, would the morons at WSB buy them?

Of course!  Because I would sell them to them.

If I could sell naked calls I would sell an 800 call to them.  I think we have enough evidence now that there is nothing GME can do where the price will go to 800.  It might go to 300 or 400, but the trick is out of the bag now."
2021-04-28 23:56:38,wallstreetbets,This is not true if the IV is low and you buy them cheap enough. It can be a total volatility play. I bought a 4/16 800c on the morning of Feb 24th for $85 (.85 per share) right before it took off. At one point it was worth roughly $8000 in the March run up right before they flash crashed it. Kicking myself for not selling but I didn't know it would be flash crashed right that minute. I was too greedy and should have sold.
2021-04-28 23:40:18,wallstreetbets,"Exactly $800? They lose the $34k. It would have to hit $806 for them to profit.

Of course, he could sell his contracts before then, but the value will rapidly decline with his calls being so far out of the money and so close to expiry, so much so that his contracts might as well be worthless"

Sorry im drunk. Its actually 58 × ~$6 × 100. Each option contract is 100 shares. The premium is already priced in the ~$6 and its actually ""greek"" to me how they compute it but basically they take into consideration the expiration date and volitility of the stock."
2021-04-28 21:49:56,wallstreetbets,"58 x $6.00 per share = 58 x 6 x 100 = $34,800"
2021-04-28 21:37:34,wallstreetbets,"He spent $34,000 on the calls. If he waits until expiration and chooses not to exercise, he’s out $34,000.

If the price spikes in the very near future, he might be able to get out for a profit. In the meantime, the value of those options will be decaying significantly every day until they’re worth nothing.

You choose 800 because you’re part of a dumbass cult that says things like “10k is not a meme!” and then write huge “DD” posts explaining why it’s definitely going to happen this week. 800 is the highest strike on my broker so maybe that’s why people pick it? Being so far out of the money, it’s also the cheapest option to buy (still costs $570) so that makes it appealing to people who don’t understand how options work. 

If you think it’s going to 800, it’s better than buying shares because it costs less to buy in. 100 shares of GameStop would cost you $17,800 right now. This option lets you get in on similar action for $570. If the price goes over 800, it’s basically the same as owning 100 shares of the stock. If you sell the contract early instead of exercising, you never even have to shell out the $800 per share but you make the same profit plus a little extra depending on how much time is left. So if you’re right, it can pay off nicely. 

This guys options will almost certainly not pay off nicely. If he’s smart, he’ll sell them now, take the smaller loss as the price of education, and spend that money on something less stupid. GME shares would be less stupid."

Sell more puts  on down days and sell calls on up days (if the shares aren't already covered). I get about $400 per day from theta decay."
2021-04-29 00:53:16,wallstreetbets,you dont remember when GME was going wild early on and 2% delta puts yielded like 20% return
2021-04-29 01:55:21,wallstreetbets,I know trading GME is full of surprises but at this stage issuing $800 july calls sounds like easy money.
2021-04-29 01:07:11,wallstreetbets,This means you used the time value to your favor buy selling options that expired on friday of that GME week?
2021-04-29 03:06:40,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-28 21:24:51,wallstreetbets,More time to get ITM. You pay for that extra time though with a higher premium.
2021-04-29 02:12:22,wallstreetbets,"I'm of the opinion that this is either fake, or posted by somebody with a ton of shares of GME ""fishing"" gullible people into buying contracts that are simply unattainable. Ie a hedgy."

2021-04-28 21:11:14,wallstreetbets,"Buying calls like this is just pure gambling, that's why it's bad. But this is also WSB, soooo let's go OP!!!"
2021-04-29 04:38:33,wallstreetbets,"It depends on the level. At its highest level definitely it won't last long. But the highest level in this case might be much higher than 800. It has been already at around 170 for 2 months, which many consider as squeezed non market value."
2021-04-28 20:19:40,wallstreetbets,I say end of May is when the squeeze hits because several key DTCC rules goes into effect. The other DTCC members don't want to play russian roulette for years. The goal is just to hold out until then.
2021-04-28 21:39:35,wallstreetbets,Really depends if and when and how high it squeezes. If the meme of 6/7 figures is true then we will all be millionaires and billionaires while this ape becomes the world first trillionaire potentially.
2021-04-29 05:23:43,wallstreetbets,"If it goes into the thousands he makes more, if it goes to 600 he makes less. Extra risk, extra reward. I just think his price target is stupid/has a really low probability of hitting, which he's being overcharged for due to ape hype."
2021-04-29 05:25:24,wallstreetbets,You're assuming the ape hypothesis is as strong as Burry's hypothesis. They could genuinely just be taking advantage of ape hype. They are getting away with charging this much. MMs made a ton of money on all those worthless contracts last month.
2021-04-28 21:48:50,wallstreetbets,"Oh yea, they would be amazing as short legs tbh."

2021-04-28 21:36:42,wallstreetbets,"Each contract is 100 shares, so you multiply that number by 100"

2021-04-28 23:51:08,wallstreetbets,Thanks. Commenting from the sidelines with only an effectively 5 year old's understanding.
2021-04-28 22:13:40,wallstreetbets,"All options are 100 by default. Yes its very risky on the other end as well. They dont even have to hold the 5800 shares so they would be in deep debt. Something like that happened to the kid who took his life last year  (RIP). 

For the buyer, if the stock goes down they would just let the option expire and lose the 34k. 

Thats not the end of the story, though. There are tricks to limit your loses such as rolling over or taking both sides of the spread. Options are complex beasts."
2021-04-28 21:58:03,wallstreetbets,"The call option is for control of 100 shares. The price is $5.78 per share. $5.78 per share * 100 shares = $578. So one contact costs $578. 

It’s kinda weird that they list the prices that way, but it makes the math a little bit simpler when you’re hedging with options."

2021-04-29 00:30:18,wallstreetbets,"I've got short puts and they fucking print, but each time I try and sell covered calls and it pops 20% I shit myself I am going to miss the moon by preselling my tickets for a few $100 so I can't hold onto them without getting nervous.

That said, I 100% want to be on the short side of options earning that theta than paying that INSANE IV and crush.

I wasn't 100% sure I still believed in the GME moonshot UNTIL I had my shares on the line and there was a chance I was going to lose them to a call getting exercised, then I knew in my heart it is still on."
2021-04-29 08:27:54,wallstreetbets,"Most brokerages won't let you sell naked calls. So in order to just sell a call, you'll need to own 100 shares of GME.  So let's say July calls are selling for $6. At the current price of GME, 175, you have to invest $17,500 in capital to make $600. This is a stock that swings 10% daily."
2021-04-29 03:09:50,wallstreetbets,Doesn’t have to be to your favor. You can theta gang at the wrong time. I did make a small profit but I left like 35K USD on the table by selling a call to buy 100 shares at a FUCKING $90 strike price FML.
2021-04-28 21:47:59,wallstreetbets,Ok I checked the options chain it's 60$ premium for highest strike price avalible (430 $) expiry next Friday so to get to jul 16th you'd have to buy 11 of em so 660$ (1700$ to reach Nov) as opposed to 800c for 568$ expiry Jul 16(1100Nov). Based on this then wouldn't it be better to buy more distant otms and pay the large premium upfront instead of the initially smaller but eventually greater premiums  of FDs? I guess now I don't see how OP is more if a retard for doing this instead of fds like the other poster suggested. I have to be retarded & missing somthing right?
2021-04-29 00:44:55,wallstreetbets,"What is an ""FD""? What does it mean?"
2021-04-29 00:35:08,wallstreetbets,"To me $800 covered calls is a risky option to sell. You don't make that much compared to a $400 option. And I am pretty sure if it gets to $400 in a week, then $800 is a distinct possibility shortly after, and if it makes it to $800, then it's just as likely to go to $80,000 and you've lost a lot of upside."
2021-04-28 23:46:32,wallstreetbets,The risk is also unlimited if it shoots up
2021-04-28 22:02:59,wallstreetbets,tire houses for all the boys

2021-04-28 22:13:09,wallstreetbets,"Options aren’t binary. You can exit pre-expiry. Say the stock moves up 60, from 180. That’s a 33% ROI on the stock. His YOLO on 800Calls would be 100% ROI, if this occurs in the next 2-3 weeks."

2021-04-28 23:39:50,wallstreetbets,"Well you could own 100 shares per short call but that's not necessary. If the delta of these is like 0.05 then you'd only need 5 shares per option to hedge (delta neutral). And then you'd have to buy more shares as it runs up. Alternatively you can sell a call option with an even higher strike. It's really not necessary to downvote me for giving you information, but suit yourself."
2021-04-29 01:20:16,wallstreetbets,What I’m trying to figure out is how the hell did he even buy calls that high? Tos won’t even let me sell them at $800 because it knows it’s super retarded

2021-04-28 21:12:52,wallstreetbets,all that means it's there are 25k open contacts. these could all be people selling to open hoping some poor sap actually buys them.  it doesn't indicate which are buying and which are seeking which is also why most don't use that number other then a reference.  other factors line common sense in this situation should play a role.  I'll go buy shares right now for anyone interested in opening an 800 call on July 15th.  who else wants to gives me some premium money?

2021-04-28 22:17:08,wallstreetbets,"The people selling the options are probably market makers and probably already have the shares which they probably bought at $150 or less, so they’re still going to make lots of money if it goes over $800. Worrying about missed gains is pretty dumb when you already made $65,000 per contract plus the $578 premium. If the price tanks, they’ll probably be the first ones to sell for a small loss and just be naked on the calls which is not super risky when the price is tanking.

And that’s only if it moons before July which is incredibly unlikely. What’s much more likely to happen is that they keep selling these ridiculous calls and keep raking in massive amounts of premium."

2021-04-29 11:52:49,wallstreetbets,"To write covered calls, you have to own the stock. GME is probably one of the riskiest stocks you can own right now. Once more, if you sell a covered call, you're locked into the position until the option expires, or you buy it back.  


You can hedge with puts....but that's going to cut into your profit and...guess what, premiums are expensive.

2021-04-29 07:54:18,wallstreetbets,"No I didn’t buy any options (well for AMC I did but I’m assuming you’re still talking about GME). I just bought 100 shares of GME at like $80 a share, which was market price at the time, then I sold a ‘$90 strike price end of week call option’ to some random guy to pay me around 1K for the ‘option’ to buy my 100 shares for $90 per share at the end of the week. So when GME went to like $400 or whatever I was stuck in my contract to sell that hundred shares for 9K instead of the new way higher market value (around 40K). So I still profited like 2K but I left like 30-40K on the table, whoever bought my call option and paid me that 1K premium at the beginning of the week took that home."

2021-04-28 22:14:30,wallstreetbets,"LOL my friend a lot has changed since then. this is an ""amazon? they only sell books"" moment."
2021-04-28 21:49:33,wallstreetbets,Yeah but the window for that happening is really really narrow (like within the next couple days) before theta decay kills it.
2021-04-28 22:17:07,wallstreetbets,"There's no chance OP would sell for a small profit though. Remember, we're talking about someone who spent their life savings on July $800 Calls.     

If GME gets a surprise rally then OP has confirmation bias and holds even harder. 

If GME stays flat or goes down then OP falls for the sunk-cost fallacy as the options bleed and holds on even harder waiting for a miracle that will never come. 

Expiry day comes and OP watches as the clock ticks closer to 4:00. ""The squeeze will come and save me"" they whisper with desperation.

This guy's gonna lose it all."
2021-04-29 00:17:26,wallstreetbets,"Hah, you're right. $800 is literally the highest strike you can get in July. 

You're also right that buying shares could make you a bag holder. But you've got negative delta from being short the call option, so it balances out with the shares' positive delta. Meaning they will fluctuate in lock step, but with changing gamma, causing you to rebalance the delta as you go to stay delta neutral."
2021-04-28 20:19:23,wallstreetbets,"I just looked it up, and he could make 12 million in premiums just for selling $600 June CC’s. Insane"
2021-04-28 21:49:24,wallstreetbets,You know he has 200k shares how?  Because he posted an update two weeks ago and you’re dumb enough to think he’s just gonna stick around?
2021-04-28 21:04:09,wallstreetbets,480 was not a price available to US retail traders.

2021-04-28 22:15:05,wallstreetbets,lol.  I don't know enough about options to be dangerous but you're comment did make need laugh thanks.  I wish the guy the best of luck.  he could still make some money if he can get out when it spikes and I hope it does.  personally I am in amc and don't buy calls.  I buy the stock.
2021-04-28 21:43:45,wallstreetbets,Who?
2021-04-28 21:20:43,wallstreetbets,"No, you don't have to do ""the stupid thing"". Risky plays are fine, but this is beyond risky that is unlikely to even break even, let alone print. If he was making an IV play, there are better ways to structure it that expose you to the same potential profit with way less risk. If he actually thinks the stock will moon above 800, he's still better off going less OTM considering the absurd premium he paid for these."
2021-04-28 21:44:21,wallstreetbets,Wouldn’t it be better to just buy the shares? Like how much higher than 800 can gme possibly go?...

2021-04-28 20:47:49,wallstreetbets,It is down. But for 800c's on an underlying trading at <$200..that's pretty fucking high.

2021-04-29 07:12:21,wallstreetbets,I think YOU MEAN sell puts. I’m talking about covered calls.
2021-04-29 01:53:44,wallstreetbets,You sell covered calls and the stock shoots up way beyond your strike price. You’d either have to close for a major loss or it gets exercised. In the long run you have to play it smart
2021-04-29 05:50:26,wallstreetbets,"Yea I wouldn’t sell calls on any meme stocks, you just never know when they are going to fly. I’ll never do CC’s on WSB favs again, I underestimated the power of the ape."

boy is you retarded?"

lol have you been asleep for the past 3 months or are you that ignorant that you don't believe the change that is happening in front of your eyes. they have put it in writing that they're transitioning to ecommerce and you're stuck in the past saying they're only a physical media store. wake up buddy, it's 2021."
2021-04-28 22:29:29,wallstreetbets,Yea ik.  My brain reads iv as intrinsic value first  because I deal with it more often 🤦‍♂️
2021-04-28 20:50:19,wallstreetbets,"the goal of the 800c is **not to hit 800**, but to capture the incoming volatility in the event of a big price spike. while the reward is not as high as fds, it is a pretty relaxing way to play gme while having more leverage than shares.

the prior options history for 7/16 800c shows

•	⁠on 3/23 gme was 200 which resulted in the option being worth 21.5 (2.15k) at its highest, a low of 17.06 (1.7k) and an open of 20.
•	⁠on 3/10 gme peaked at 350 which resulted in a high price of 122.09 (12.2k), a low of 42 (4.2k) and an open of 67.93 (6.8k)

while the 800c looks super degenerate, it surprisingly holds a good amount of extrinsic value and follows the price swings of the underlying even when it is in the $150 range

check tos and look at the option history to see for yourself how the option moves"
2021-04-28 20:20:40,wallstreetbets,"That’s a fair point. When I first started out trading in earnest, I definitely had a problem with taking profits. Saw +100% gains on some options and let them ride until they were worthless... I wouldn’t be surprised if OP did the same thing."
2021-04-28 21:51:10,wallstreetbets,r/wendys
2021-04-28 21:55:47,wallstreetbets,Fascinating.
2021-04-29 01:05:44,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, fair point. I originally looked at options as a way to trade in stocks that I otherwise couldn’t afford, but I’ve had better luck with OTC stocks so I kinda left the option game behind."
2021-04-29 10:11:15,wallstreetbets,"You are missing the point, jackass. How you structure your bet matters."
2021-04-28 20:59:46,wallstreetbets,"A contract is for 100 shares. When the contract price is 6 dollars you pay 600 for it. If the contract price is 6 cents , you only pay 6 dollars each for them. Gme is so volatile that even crazy out of the money options cost a lot. 

For a comparison, when pltr was at 22 a share, I bought 400 contracts betting it would go past 25 a share before may 14. That isn't a huge jump,  but I was able to buy an absolute massive amount of contracts because the stock isn't that volatile. Now if pltr ends up at 30 before may 14th ill make 200 thousand dollars"
2021-04-28 21:16:38,wallstreetbets,"well, at least you've found the right place."
2021-04-28 22:03:22,wallstreetbets,"It’s funny to see loaded folks lose money, but I have a suspicion you’d bet everything on a gamble you don’t even understand. Whether or not GME can go “tits up” has no bearing with options. You can literally lose 100% of your money."
2021-04-29 07:14:23,wallstreetbets,"I think you are deeply confused or I'm retarded. 

Why would I sell ITM covered calls?"
2021-04-29 07:23:48,wallstreetbets,So if i bought 100 shares at 50$ dollars and sell covered calls for july with a premium of 600 per contract. Thats a 10%+ return and literally no risk. I dont know what you are talking about.
2021-04-29 07:28:16,wallstreetbets,Selling covered calls at itm prices is legit retarded.
2021-04-29 01:57:04,wallstreetbets,You said I'd get wiped out though. How?
2021-04-29 01:57:58,wallstreetbets,"It would be an accounting loss, but no actual loss occurs."
2021-04-29 02:06:18,wallstreetbets,"You're thinking of naked calls, which most people can't even sell. Big difference."
2021-04-29 09:42:57,wallstreetbets,That’s what stopped me selling cc’s on amc. Too much unpredictable movement and I didn’t want to loose my shares
2021-04-29 11:18:32,wallstreetbets,You should take it up with the board of directors.

2021-04-28 20:40:11,wallstreetbets,Most exchanges will automatically sell ITM options if there aren’t funds to cover the exercising of options.
2021-04-28 22:51:37,wallstreetbets,"I'm all for quality DDs or YOLO about GME, but fuck off with that idiotic I like the stock spam. Also it's ""are you retarded"", but can't expect retarded to know grammar lmao"
2021-04-29 07:07:46,wallstreetbets,It's one thing to say another to actually do
2021-04-28 21:12:25,wallstreetbets,"I understand all that.  But, to capture that you need a few things.  One, you need significant movement as the delta is very low, or a significant rise in volatility to capture vega, amd relatively cheap contracts.  As you said, IV is dropping.  GME has been trading flattish for several weeks.  And these are way over priced for what they are  It's a dumb play.  Plain and simple.  It's buying dogshit with gold bricks. 

In February, it was a solid play.  800c were trading for a few cents.  IV was back down from January spike.  The rise in volatility made the 800c briefly profitable in a big way.  This isn't February.  These aren't cheap lottos any more."
2021-04-28 20:00:19,wallstreetbets,"There may be some potential reasons to think GME will spike like that again at some point but that's not exactly a concrete endorsement or timeframe, don't listen to people being mean. :)"

2021-04-28 22:00:48,wallstreetbets,"Depends how you define partnership, I’m sure they had to make some type of agreement with Tesla before modifying their cars with a revel design and using then for ride sharing in NYC…. I would be surprised if there was not some type of partnership agreement in place…. And taking into account their history dominating the electric moped market in a highly regulated and restricted environment in NYC they are likely to succeed in growth and expansion with this new endeavor. Uber and Lyft are going to see a new player in town taking a chunk out of their market as Revel’s fleet grows, and Tesla would be wise to fund and assist for the exposure alone."

2021-04-29 16:58:24,wallstreetbets,"I'm no expert. 

Right now it's about 4.30.

Hype is cooling off so that price may go lower in a week or two.

Set some limit orders at progressively lower prices or just pick 3.50 and hope for a sell off.

This is a long term play so you've got time. Just take it in nibbles. Wait for a down day and buy a few more."

2021-04-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"AMD: This is why it's down after earnings but will eventually rocket See my previous AMD DDs: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkljmv/amd\_increasing\_production\_by\_20\_in\_q2\_buy\_before/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkljmv/amd_increasing_production_by_20_in_q2_buy_before/)  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mdwvby/the\_amd\_boom\_is\_still\_coming\_heres\_why/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mdwvby/the_amd_boom_is_still_coming_heres_why/)

Everything there came true, except the stock is down today. Why? Well take a look at the short interest. AMD is the most heavily shorted stock in the semi industry. The latest there shows 82.7M shares sold short on 4/15 with price at $85.21. That means they need to keep the stock under $85 to make their precious profit. They also want to keep the stock down in order to get a good buy-in for the Xilinx deal. Which means it seems they're trying to keep the stock down for the entire year until the Xilinx deal closes, that's a long time to keep up negative pressure. Meanwhile, AMD is going to continue to get upgrades and price target increases.

I know everyone hates Jim Cramer but this is what he said in regards to AMD on the AAP call this morning:  
""This is just a buy. I mean, you gotta buy it very aggressively here. Because if it weren't for the Xilinx arbitrage, it would probably be up. But remember, it has to be shorted if you want to buy Xilinx and that's what's killing them. Because people just keep shorting it all day. There's 51M shares traded, which is rather remarkable.""

One could speculate that Intel is coming in to steal AMD's thunder but in yesterday's earnings call, AMD put that to rest. Intel's datacenter sales were down 20% YoY which Intel last week said was NOT due to competition but due to customers ""digesting"" existing purchases and that this is a slow time of year for data center sales. AMD's Dr. Lisa Su shows 100% growth in datacenter sales YoY saying customer demand is strong and accelerating, basically calling Intel liars and that AMD is taking all that market share with no slow down in sight.

One could speculate that Nvidia is going to challenge AMD in the datacenter but Su Bae dismissed it in the earnings call saying customers are not asking for ARM chips, and AMD would build them if they were. Basically saying that building an ARM processor for the datacenter would be like building a solution to a problem no one has, and no one is asking for, there's no money in it.

One could speculate that the ""chip shortage"" will negatively impact AMD. But the good doctor put that to rest yesterday as well confirming rumors that AMD is increasing production by 20% in Q2 which reflected in them raising guidance for 50% growth in 2021! By contrast, Intel is expecting 0% growth this year.

All of this positive growth and lack of industry competition means AMD is going to continue killing in quarter after quarter which will push analysts to keep upgrading the stock and price targets which will make it harder and harder for hedge funds to keep up the negative pressure throughout the year.

With AMD, there's no need for individual investors to try to turn it around on the short sells, it's going to happen naturally due to continued analyst upgrades, we don't have to do anything. I recommend getting on board now and being patient, because when it pops and the short sellers give up/move on, when the negative pressure cannot contain the buying from institutions and individual investors on analyst upgrades, it's going to explode.

AMD Positions: 550 shares, various call options with expirations from June 2021 to June 2022.

UPDATE: BoA upgraded AMD price target from $100 to $110 and named AMD their #1 pick in all of computing. Rosenblatt has a $135 price target. It's only a matter of time before upward pressure overcomes downward pressure and this thing explodes."
2021-04-28 22:02:41,wallstreetbets,"AMD is a long term play. When Intel Xeon based servers in these Datacenters become EOL it'll be replaced with AMD's EPYC processors simply because of price/performance ratio.

I work in IT and the last Intel based servers purchase was 4 years ago. Our last two newest ones are with AMD EPYC processers.

Also I think this stock should be higher. Makes no sense it's in the $80 range. The turning point was with their zen architecture."
2021-04-28 22:31:48,wallstreetbets,Just look at AMD since Lisa Su their CEO took over.  It has been consistent healthy growth because of a well run company.  She does things smart and she does things right which shows in a company to improve and take market share from competitors.

2021-04-29 05:01:59,wallstreetbets,"ARM has its place - and for the workloads you are talking about, it makes sense for x86 based architecture. But for the most part - you are accounting for the ""compute"" nodes in your datacenter running x86. There is a very high chance, that all of your switching, routing, firewalls, cooling, HVAC, Power Management, is running ARM - and has been for years. 

I would also guess, a lot of companies running their own tin in their own datacenter is already adopting cloud services shifting workloads to the hyper-scaler public cloud providers. Within that market - where there is massive growth, we see AWS developing their on silicon (Graviton) based on ARM Architecture. 

You also have the big-boi supercomputers shifting to ARM like the Fujitsu A64FX based CPU's inside Fugaku.  

The reality is the current demand exceeds the supply - as you point out legacy systems have a dependency on legacy CPU architecture, and in some cases, its more cost effective to buy hardware than to re-develop systems. 

The chip shortage we see today, could not have come at a worse time for AMD. They finally after 10 years have top tier tech inside the datacenter, desktop, laptop, and GPU SKU's leaving intel for dead - and trading blows with nVidia. But they simply cannot produce enough product to sell to a market that will meet their demand. Its extremely depressing, because you like you - I like the stock :("

I'm myself long term investor in AMD starting in early 2017."
2021-04-29 04:32:15,wallstreetbets,"ARM takes over server space, pushing out x86, so both Intel and AMD.

But even in worst case this won't realistically happen for several more years."
2021-04-29 05:35:42,wallstreetbets,I found the answer to this. Part of the deal is that amd will pay xilinx 1.75 amd shares fot every share of xilinx
2021-04-28 20:41:03,wallstreetbets,"Learn how to cut your losses first. Always live to fight another day so to say. Earnings plays can always go sideways, I like straddles during earnings. You don’t make a ton of money but you get something. Also target more realistic strikes with dates that makes sense. You’re not going to get to 100 in a few days. Options are expensive lessons sometimes. Good luck and may the force be with you."
2021-04-29 00:27:57,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer is also recommending to buy GME and AMC now...
2021-04-29 06:22:48,wallstreetbets,I just want a 5000 series AMD cpu chip
2021-04-28 20:33:36,wallstreetbets,"Marketing needs to be different and more targeted. Trade shows, white papers, case studies. Funding and supporting software vendors to ensure their software runs optimally on your hardware, then advertising it."
2021-04-28 22:11:11,wallstreetbets,Institutional advertising worked for Intel back in the day. Remember all those commercials about Intel inside? And those stupid stickers?
2021-04-29 01:23:11,wallstreetbets,"Very much. Otherwise people will just buy Intel. 

Nobody got fired for buying an IBM, I mean Intel."
2021-04-29 15:46:45,wallstreetbets,"Sure, they know who AMD is, but do they know that they are a serious competitor to Intel now and not just an ""Option B"" that their VAR throws out?"
2021-04-29 06:11:58,wallstreetbets,Intel has been known to pull off dirty stuff against AMD.
2021-04-28 20:17:02,wallstreetbets,"I had 2000 at $3.98 in summer 2014, sold them two weeks later at $4.19 for a $420 profit. I literally memed myself out of $160k."
2021-04-29 11:51:22,wallstreetbets,"For a semi stock, thats huge..."
2021-04-29 15:23:07,wallstreetbets,"It's now 10% short, there's a lot of money going into keeping this down so hedge funds can buy Xilinx in arbitrage. Also Xilinx has earnings next week."
2021-04-29 02:29:08,wallstreetbets,"Ya im sitting on 22k shares, been years and I haven't sold a single one. No chance I'm bailing now."
2021-04-29 06:45:20,wallstreetbets,"They are still green by 30%, I managed to grab them when the share price was 78. But yeah this isn't looking good lol"
2021-04-29 12:23:04,wallstreetbets,great decision
2021-04-29 03:35:05,wallstreetbets,Cheers
2021-04-29 01:10:40,wallstreetbets,I don't see this happening. If China tries then so many countries would anally assault them before they had feet on the ground.
2021-04-29 19:16:59,wallstreetbets,You know AMD has made ARM server chips before right?
2021-04-29 02:05:55,wallstreetbets,"Am retarded, makes sense."
2021-04-29 07:49:20,wallstreetbets,"Not technically ""uncle"" but still related: NVIDIA's Jensen Huang.

2021-04-29 06:46:05,wallstreetbets,Indeed. And Dell have been right with them the whole way.
2021-04-28 20:35:50,wallstreetbets,No one ever lost money taking a profit

2021-04-29 09:29:58,wallstreetbets,This stock is worth over 100 EASILY. You would be insane to sell now.
2021-04-28 20:40:10,wallstreetbets,"AMD is really kinda boring compared to some others. They're competing against established competitors in established markets, and product development cycles are very long. It's been a slow, predictable 5 year progression which isn't great meme fuel."
2021-04-29 02:15:04,wallstreetbets,"""They"" can make more money by taking advantage of the obvious (amd does good stock should go up) and making it do the opposite. They can sell tons of high priced itm calls and make the stock fall so those calls expire worthless. 

""They"" can sell massive amounts of shares back and forth between each other at lower and lower prices to simulate a selloff. If people actually sell seeing the price fall, then they're helping the hedges achieve their goal.

""They"" can also sell puts and make sure it doesn't dip below, also making money in both directions. 

""They"" are theta, with the power to fuck you in either direction if they choose."
2021-04-29 00:33:56,wallstreetbets,If you think that big players in the market with the weight to influence it don’t use that ability to their advantage... well I have a bridge to sell you.
2021-04-29 02:51:42,wallstreetbets,"What if Intel wanted to keep AMD suppressed, and hedge funds offered this as a service that Intel could pay for.  How would they do it?  Dark pool trades count for 40% of the market, but the price does not react to those trades. Dark pool trades circumvent price discovery.  So what happens when a hedge fund places large buy orders for AMD on the dark pool, and turns around and places large sell orders for those same shares on the open market?  The market sees nothing but a bunch of selling."
2021-04-29 14:49:32,wallstreetbets,Dump now and just roll it all into a leveraged share ETF?
2021-04-29 02:44:23,wallstreetbets,"I think you vastly overestimate international response. Just look at the shit Russia has been getting away with.

Most of the world is also dependent on imports from China."
2021-04-29 10:58:22,wallstreetbets,"And to add to that, AMD Epyc processors have more PCIe lanes than Intel Xeon CPU's, so you can fit more Nvidia datacenter GPU's to a single server.

This gives a large competiotional advantage over Intel, and will make sure that most of Nvidia's growth will also pour money into AMD's bucket."
2021-04-29 00:29:09,wallstreetbets,You have to look at it for the respective sector..
2021-04-28 20:33:31,wallstreetbets,"Agreed and it could be a little both. Like Cramer said in his leaked interview, the mechanics of the market matter more than fundamentals. If day traders and hedge funds aren't touching AMD, shorts are going to keep pinning AMD down."
2021-04-29 14:51:20,wallstreetbets,The PE has dropped so low because of something to do with short term tax benefits I believe
2021-04-29 04:44:22,wallstreetbets,I like that
2021-04-28 21:10:51,wallstreetbets,No one ever hit it big taking a $0.21 (5%) profit.

2021-04-29 00:37:40,wallstreetbets,You didn't read my comment
2021-04-29 03:36:54,wallstreetbets,I think Russia and China have very different targets. The world is so dependent on TSMCs chips that I don't see the world letting China just take over. I could be very wrong however and this is just my opinion.
2021-04-29 09:35:25,wallstreetbets,You think the tech sector is less than 7% shorted?
2021-04-29 16:22:36,wallstreetbets,"IIRC that's not that significant compared to their annual earnings. *Edit* I did not recall correctly, it was a significant impact. 

Did not factor into Q1 results, though, which showed very healthy profitability and expansion of market share without that tax benefit."
2021-04-29 15:39:39,wallstreetbets,"Well the question you seem to be asking is why the hedge funds would work against the current when they could make more money with, and the answer is that going with the current means you get to equilibrium faster, at which point the stock price stabilizes and there isn’t as much money to be made. If they work against the current, then they can make money through some manipulation, and then make money on the rebound, rinse and repeat. If they don’t manipulate, there’s no rebound and nothing to make money off of."
2021-04-29 01:22:38,wallstreetbets,"I mean, they do make infinite money...."
2021-04-29 03:45:19,wallstreetbets,"Nah, they have alternatives - Intel with it's own fabs and Nvidia with Samsung. Trying to secure one semiconductor manufacturer at the risk of an all out war with China doesn't make any sense."
2021-04-29 18:06:22,wallstreetbets,"Not at all, AMD only designs the chips, they have  0 production of their own"
2021-04-28 20:08:22,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but can't compare Xilinx to Altera"
2021-04-28 21:09:27,wallstreetbets,AMD is miles ahead in GPU as well as having the edge in the server space.
2021-04-29 03:50:19,wallstreetbets,It's a tense situation for sure.
2021-04-29 19:15:42,wallstreetbets,I disagree I think Taiwan is perfect place to start WW3. And it won’t end well for China

2021-04-28 20:34:02,wallstreetbets,"If EPS didn't ring a bell, I'm not sure he's got enough wrinkles to know what free cash flow even means...

Wait... 

If the cash is flowing freely, can I have some?"
2021-04-29 19:17:12,wallstreetbets,"It wouldn't end well for fucking half of the world, so let's please fucking not."
2021-04-29 02:34:12,wallstreetbets,Xilinx is two levels over the rest.
2021-04-28 21:42:51,wallstreetbets,"Yes, you just have to but calls to get them."
2021-04-29 19:19:39,wallstreetbets,"Actually I disagree with that stamens also. China has been responsible for the low pay global environment. Producing products at fraction of the prices as other countries. I think the best thing for the world is WW3 and China getting taken out. Let alone the environmental impact China has had on the oceans and global warming with pollution. Also genicide and destruction of many groups, personal freedoms...  also China can’t afford a war once the EMP goes off and all the power is out in China those cameras aren’t working that country will have a revolution over night ask the people of hong Kong 80% supported being independent. China is the same way people absolutely hate the CCP but know they can’t talk about it. One day China will be a republic."
2021-04-29 19:27:12,wallstreetbets,"And they would peacefully surrender after the rest of the world denounces them.

They have millions of soldiers, who have only taken in Chinese propaganda all their lives. They would literally commit war crimes and die for their country AND they would think it's the right way to do because they've been programmed for decades to think this way. I know the 'murican way is to bring peace to other nations by force but how about no, I don't want a shithole to be left in the place where most Asian countries are today.

Edit: you seem to think everyone in China hates CCP. You're absolutely wrong. If I had to guess, majority of the people support it because of the propaganda."
2021-04-29 19:36:37,wallstreetbets,All I’m saying is we can have peace and business they can run their national socialist communist totalitarian neodystopian all they want if they go for Taiwan it’s war time baby. What your saying is like in the 1940s yea so hitler has great business yea he’s murdering people but business is good let’s not risk a war. Fuck that. They go for Taiwan and it on like donkey Kong. It will be the whole world against China. Honestly it’s long time coming.
2021-04-29 19:40:45,wallstreetbets,No one wants a war. Except for assholes. My question is why does the CCP care about Taiwan so much. Taiwan doesn’t want to be controlled by the CCP. They are an independent nation. That should be the end of the discussion. It is China that want to invade them!!!!!
2021-04-29 19:39:15,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, how the whole world came to help Poland in 1939? Don't be fucking naive please.

I don't like what China is doing but war is not a solution."
2021-04-29 19:51:14,wallstreetbets,"CCP for a very long time already claimed that Taiwan is part of China. Look up ""one China policy"". To the point that if anybody with Chinese audience mentions Taiwan as separate entity - they're constantly being attacked by Chinese internet community. It's not a joke, those people SERIOUSLY believe in this. Internationally no country dares to claim that Taiwan is a separate country. Yes, US also claims it's a part of China. If you think they're suddenly gonna change their mind and go to war over it - you're naive.

Similar situation with Russia and Ukraine, but they're not as bold in propaganda."
2021-04-29 19:42:07,wallstreetbets,Why didn’t the world help Hong Kong in 2019???
2021-04-29 19:44:10,wallstreetbets,I agree war is not unless they start it. Listen dude China is gonna start the war if a war is to happen. They’ll prob blow up some plane or ship and claim it was the Taiwanese. Then start with missile attacks and securing the South China Sea then it’s on.
2021-04-29 19:53:40,wallstreetbets,Why should it matter if a huge percentage of the population doesn’t want to be part of China that should be the end of the discussion. China is forcing its will on them! And now everyone else I say fuck that!
2021-04-29 19:43:25,wallstreetbets,Same reason. They don't want a war.
2021-04-29 19:56:23,wallstreetbets,"You're overestimating the sentiment against CCP in mainland China. Propaganda is a powerful thing. I can assure you that 90% of people under the age of 25 are hardcore supporters of CCP, and those people matter the most."
2021-04-29 19:46:59,wallstreetbets,I think China wants a war. It certainly acts like it does. I have a question for you why doesn’t the CCP just say oh Taiwan doesn’t want to join us and be like ok your an independent country and everything’s great. No war. Just peace and business??
2021-04-29 19:58:26,wallstreetbets,"So your saying let China take over the world? Let them take Hong Kong yesterday, Taiwan tmr, Thailand the next day, Cambodia, Laos, they already claim the South China Sea. When does it end??"
2021-04-29 19:59:32,wallstreetbets,I think your underestimating our resolve.
2021-04-29 19:53:34,wallstreetbets,"Because they want to claim Taiwan. They don't want an all out war, and they're betting nobody else wants it either, so they're gonna push the boundary and check the waters."
2021-04-29 19:55:25,wallstreetbets,You can’t just claim a place where the people don’t want to be apart of you what century do you think this is? The age of colonialism is long since over.

There are a lot of shorts in a dangerous position, so today they will force the share price down very low so that they can cover. That is your buying opportunity today.  The earnings report was moved up a week, so we are having it today instead of the first week of May. They don't move them without reason. Yesterday they have us a lidar update, I think as a helping hand to shareholders. Today I think they give us a great update that sends out shares catapulting upward. This is why the shorts are returning shares."
2021-04-28 20:18:21,wallstreetbets,Well...we were expecting they moved the ER up a week to tell us the lidar was finished but they dropped that news this morning...what other reason would they have to move the ER up if not to share good news?

Regardless, this bull market made a bunch of new money; I'm interested to see what happens when inflation rolls in and the bubble pops. I wonder how many geniuses are left bragging about their patented strategies when we trade sideways and down for a decade. No offense to you, do what works, but no one is fucking around on reddit if they have a surefire way to consistently and overwhelmingly beat the market. Chucking all my money in 3x leveraged etfs made a killing on the way back up from the covid dip, but I'm not dumb enough to say that it was because of some genius investing strategy. The market is about psychology, and humans are innately irrational. I say this fully understanding the irony of the first commenter in this thread referring to someone smarter than himself as an ape. WSB is an excellent example of why technical/fundamental analysis can be completely crushed by retard strength.

2021-04-29 08:56:06,wallstreetbets,"Lol stopped reading at “the market will trend down for the next decade”  - yes, you are retarded, guess that’s why you’re on WSB. The market is forward looking and while individual shitty meme stocks will drop hard and never recover, the market will keep chugging along. Mark my words, SPY will be at 480 by end of year if not higher. 

Additionally, it may be all crayons to you, but day trading is just that. It’s reading the crayons that others are looking at, and trading within support and resistance lines. I make $ every single day. You’ve been led to believe that you can’t day trade.... I can show you my P/L live if you wish. 

Last year was the easiest year to day trade with big size, as you can see my trades are north of $30k size and used to swing it. Now, I keep them at 5-10k size and cut profitable trades within 10-30 mins. Adapt to the market and you will make money daily. Don’t, and it will take it all. 

Also, you put your money in 3x ETF’s? There’s shitty value in those as slippage is high. I shoved 500k in TSLA, TDOC and SHOP (especially when it crashed to ~$400). I don’t have to tell you where I’m sitting at now. 

Follow me on Instagram if you actually want to see a real person trade and not some “let me teach you my methods and you’ll make $12,000 a day”. 

Nope, just clearing 40%+ daily DAY TRADING. Leodb1 - I’m not your avg retard."

2021-04-29 11:13:56,wallstreetbets,"Well, I didn't say the next decade. I'm still bullish in the short term, but the speculative bubble is massive (valuations are insane right now) and looming inflation is ever-present. The speculation can for sure fuel another decade long bull run, but speculation ends with a long bear market, just look at the dot com bubble. The market is cyclical, it's the one certainty we cling to in the stock market. What goes up must come down and vice versa. The treasury bailing equities out every time something bad happens isn't sustainable.

And money velocity is only increasing with the recovery of the jobs market and the economy. Inflation is a real threat that causes risk off, and speculative stocks will fall very far. I'm not so presumptive as to try to time the fall, I'm just saying that a lot of new traders have never lived through this so it just seems like an abstract concept to them, like this gentleman that I was initially responding to. I've properly hedged, but I'm still here aren't I?"
2021-04-29 10:58:14,wallstreetbets,"Again, you want to act superior but clearly have no idea what you're talking about. Stop typing on wsb if you have an ego, you're clearly a new trader. But go get that clout my dude. But why do you need followers if you're such an investing wiz? Why not just shut the fuck up because no one here wants to follow you?

You've also clearly never even heard of a bear market because stocks only go up. I never said it would happen this year, your reading comprehension skills are as lacking as your fundamental knowledge. You've only solidified the fact that when a bear market hits you're beyond clueless. As I said, new money.

No shit it was the easiest year, I already explained that was my fucking point. God you're dense.

Ugh, its so tiresome when you hear shit that someone else clearly heard about from other traders but never backtested themselves. Just looking at the charts from the covid dip TECL is up 500%+ while QQQ isn't even up 100%. But yeah, very bad value, I'm sure you rigorously research all your trades. 

I never said I don't day trade. I said that I don't think I'm a genius for trading of any sort in a bull market.

Also, if you stopped reading how are you responding to everything that I wrote? You're a special brand of retard my friend. No one wants your shitty Instagram, even if you're not just some fuckwit searching for clout you are in the wrong place to try to build a following. Didn’t wanna trash the hustle, but the superiority complex is just so antithetical to the sub. If you're consistently doing 40% per day with an account stop posting here. Go buy an island if your not a poser instead of arguing ineffectively at some internet stranger."
2021-04-29 17:50:15,wallstreetbets,Look at the info at the sidebar. Basically this strategy builds on the assumption that the stock is bullish(hence  why get bluechips) and it will eventually shoot through the resistance.

2021-04-28 20:26:35,wallstreetbets,"**Win rate of 75%?**

**Win ranges from 20-100%?**

**Stop loss between 10-15%?**

Let's do a little math genius! Let's pick the number in your favor. Let's say you lock profit for every single of your trade at only 20% and cut your loses at 20% as well. Now your winning rate is 75% that means if you make 100 trades on average you win 75 of them with at least and lose the rest 25. Now lets say you only make 1 trade in a week and you start with $2000 only and made a total of 50 trades in the whole year, of which you win 37 and lose 13. These 37 successful trades with 20% profit will make you 1.7 mil and if you lose the rest 13 at 20% rate then after a year you will have a net of 93.5K which is like 1770% gain a year. Do that 3 years then you will have 204 million, do that for 4 years you got 9.5 Billions. Do a year or two more, congrats you can buy every single companies on earth!

Now you might say well, I am not going to go all in in every single trades! I mean why not? don't you have confidence in your consistent 75% winning rate?

**Nobody in this universe could maintain a constant 75% winning rate! I mean no one at all. If anyone can then he could be the worlds richest person within 5-6 years, starting with only $2000, making a single trade in a week with locking only 20% in each trade.**

Got it buddy?"
2021-04-28 20:31:37,wallstreetbets,Where did you get this >50% success rate? TA works 0% times.

That still doesn't clear it up."
2021-04-28 22:12:19,wallstreetbets,You do realize that nowhere have I mentioned anything about being confident that this strat has a 75% win rate. Im telling you the amount of times (as an estimate) that this strategy has netted in the green rather than in the red for *me*.
2021-04-28 23:52:14,wallstreetbets,"Wow, why do you have to be so combative. He sounds pretty coherent and clear about his methodology. it’s working for him. You have no idea or any proof that he is lying. He is following pretty standard scalping methodology, some people do hit 80% win rates."
2021-04-29 02:41:34,wallstreetbets,"1. I'm in agreement with you w.r.t. the price NOT being the only predictor. Even if you were using only the price, derivative indicators would be a much better place to start.
2. I'm in agreement with you that predicting exact prices and levels is NOT possible with TA. 
3. \#1 and #2 being said, gauging the snapshot sentiment regarding a price trend (going up? down? sideways) is absolutely possible with TA in a short timeframe.

If you treat TA indicators like tea-leaves or tarot cards, you're going to end up with results that mimic idiocy (and not the good kind). By their very nature, they are TRAILING indicators. Past performance is not a good indicator of future returns. But what the past performance and behavior indicates is patterns of thinking about a particular stock. 

The reason I picked triple tops out of the bag, for example, is because they are indicating something very specific - a run on a stock price that gets to a sell wall, again and again until the buying pressure is exhausted. Once buying pressure (whatever the initial catalyst was that triggered the run) is exhausted, there will be a reversal. There is absolutely 0% astrology here - entirely supply and demand."

""**My win rate is about 75% with that exact strategy**"" and 

""**I trade hundreds of times a month so the sample size is pretty decent, it's not like ive done this 5 times**"" 

So you trade hundreds of times a month and 75% of the times you netted in the green with 20-100% profit but you are NOT confident! 

Now I have you call your bluff! I neither think make hundreds of trades a month nor your success rate is 75%. Show us a screenshot of your trades with date or it did not happen."

If that's not clear then let me make a claim

""**I can walk in space defying gravity**""

Now is it my burden to provide sufficient evidence to prove my claim if someone challenges me? Or will it be his burden to disprove me?

Edit: And what kind of claim is this ""**some people do hit 80% win rates**"" without giving a single reference. Who are these some people? Do you know any of them? Did you see their trade record? Any publication? With 80% success rate I would hire him, I will give him initial investment of 10K. He will just make 2-3 trades a day for 2-3 months. 95% of the profit will be his and I will take the rest 5%. Can you introduce me one of those people? It's like saying ""A team of Harvard Scientist found a way to stop aging"" bullshit. Give reference or ..... do not claim such wired things."
2021-04-29 11:32:00,wallstreetbets,"You didn't say anything about the timeframe and frequency of the chart! If you see a triple tops on a monthly pattern with daily frequency you will not see that triple top on a weekly pattern or vice versa! You might see triple tops in a 5 years chart or a yearly chart that will never agrees with TA predictions! There is no standard rules anywhere for choosing the timeframe and frequency, each TA trader determines his own. Now, if picking these two important parameters that basically determine the shape of a chart is that vague and random then you might hit some success which is not due to the rules of TA but due to the nature of random variable."
2021-04-29 05:46:12,wallstreetbets,"It's all backwards looking, your telling me you can see this triple top in real time and your rule holds, that's false"
2021-04-29 11:22:36,wallstreetbets,"Okay, then explain it. I'm so eager to learn. Because all you're saying is that you've never experienced a bear market and you're posturing like one isn't inevitable. Saying that there will be a correction EVENTUALLY is one of the few constants we have. I literally never even implied it would be next decade along with my reasoning as to why. I gave you the benefit of the doubt that you're not completely retarded, but if I take what you said at face value you just don't know how the market works and genuinely believe stocks only go up."
2021-04-28 23:26:23,wallstreetbets,"Jesus dude. I appreciate your attempt at unwraveling my logic, but its kind of sad.

I NEVER SAID I TRADE THIS STRATEGY HUNDREDS OF TIMES A MONTH. I said i TRADE hundreds of times a month. Is splunk red on red spy days hundreds of times a month? NO! This exact strategy I don't know how many times ive done. Im telling you at least a couple of dozen. You're making so many assumptions it's insane. Also not sure why you're trying to be so cocky with it."
2021-04-29 06:57:38,wallstreetbets,"...it absolutely holds, long enough to buy puts :) I mean once you see the 3rd top and volume starts falling off without breaching the resistance level, the probability of the stock price falling - trend reversal - is far higher than 50%. I'm not sure why anyone would argue that it isn't...

I should edit to add: there's a number of day-traders that make a lot of money from trading these patterns. I would further venture that it's not about playing the prediction game, it's about playing a ""complete the pattern"" puzzle.

Human beings have a unique ability to classify patterns accurately, and there's scientific studies (supernova hunts, exoplanet hunts) where humans are far better at it than machines *given that you don't have a massive amount of time/resources to train a machine*. But as all other such complex systems, spotting the pattern and classifying it correctly are two different knacks, and the successful pattern traders are the ones that have both knacks. It's like that Australian guy that has spotted more supernovas than any other person or machine or algo in history and most of them have been naked-eye observations (or small telescope, I think). ""There's a pattern to when and when you should look"", he said in an interview. Even with the most rudimentary stock app you have more information about stock prices and catalysts than this guy has about stellar evolution of every single naked-eye visible star. Just sayin'"
2021-04-29 12:21:43,wallstreetbets,What I’m saying is you make gun signs with your right hand and animal balloons with your left hand.
2021-04-28 23:42:22,wallstreetbets,"Dude really? 

""**This exact strategy I don't know how many times ive done**"" 

Then how do you claim your win rate with that exact strategy is 75%? How did you calculate the percentage when you do not know the total number? 

That commenter asked you ""**How many times have you lost money on this play?**"" 

Then you said you trade hundreds of times a month so the sample size is pretty decent. Which sample size? your total number of trades per month but not with that strategy? Then why did you use that sample size to justify your strategy? I mean those hundreds of trades are completely irreverent, don't you think? 

Are you talking about logic here? Do you see any logic in your comments? Give it up or show us your trades in a screenshot. Can you please do that?"
2021-04-29 13:10:38,wallstreetbets,"I wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt because you seemed alright, so I wanted you to explain because I thought that I must have missed your point. But it's very clear that you are just confused. It's fine that you don't get it, which is why I provided my reasoning so people like you could understand."
2021-04-29 13:27:46,wallstreetbets,"You don’t take a hint well do you? You’ve contradicted yourself multiples times during this exchange alone. You are pretending to be omniscient but you don’t know dogshit, and you’re bad at pretending like you do. Nobody cares about your reasoning. Good luck with your future investments, it seems like you’ll need it."
2021-04-29 13:44:46,wallstreetbets,"Nope, you're just stupid. Literally never even implied what you're saying that I did and have no idea how it went that far over your head. I guess I was too nice about it, I didn't want to assume that you were an absolute retard but I guess it was a safe bet. 

There will be a bear market at some point, we are in a point of the highest and most rapidly growing valuations, I'm hedged against inflation, interest rates can't always go down. These are all facts, I don't know how you could possibly be so dense. God, people don't get the difference between pretending to be retarded on this sub and actually being retarded. If you don't get it that's fine, but I don't know why you're trying to come at me when you're obviously so mentally deficient. 

And your reasoning is absolute dogshit lol, ""Biden is gonna tax real estate"" like that means the market is going to go up forever. Holy shit you're stupid, it just baffles me how you could project so much in a few exchanges lol. You give the weakest and most asinine fucking bull case by ""pretending to be omniscient"", say I contradict myself when I'm stating facts, and then act superior. It's crazy the amount of shit you can get just by saying that the market has downside like that's not a given. For fucks sake, how old are you even? It blows my mind that people don't understand basic fundamental concepts. I literally never did any of the stuff you claim, you completely missed my point and then blamed me like its my fault. Go read a book for fuck's sake, your reading comprehension is abysmal."
2021-04-29 13:51:37,wallstreetbets,"“There will be a bear market at some point.”
Good gourd he’s a clairvoyant ladies and gentleman."
2021-04-29 13:55:01,wallstreetbets,"God you're fucking stupid. Risk off and risk on, read a single fucking book. You intentionally read nothing I typed because the cognitive dissonance of you realizing that you are so unbearably stupid would be too much for you. I said that people are going to panic during the next bear market, what is so fucking hard to grasp? Seriously, how old are you? I was half sure you were trolling at first with your lack of basic understanding but you're such a good actor that it makes more sense for you to just be the densest mother fucker on the dumbest subreddit."
2021-04-29 13:59:58,wallstreetbets,"“I said that people are going to panic during the next bear market.” More clairvoyance from Warren Buffet’s shitty, K-Mart version doppelgänger, Barren Wuffet. You’ve deviated from your original assertions but that’s what people do when they are back-pedaling. Again, I wish you all the luck you can get Mr. Wuffet. I’m now certain you’ll need every ounce of it."
2021-04-29 14:05:33,wallstreetbets,"Never deviated and never back-pedaled, you have the reading comprehension skills of a toddler. I have no way to clarify any further, you're just going to be ignorant forever. I just really hope you never have to read or understand what another human has to say, because its going to be a very lengthy and unproductive conversation that just makes you look increasingly dim-witted the longer it goes on. Seriously, how old are you? I feel like you're a teen just getting into this, I asked because I didn't want to bully you if you are just young and stupid. I tried to give you a chance if you were just some retard kid with no clue whats going on, but I guess that was a mistake."
2021-04-29 14:40:45,wallstreetbets,Hasn’t your boss asked you to come back from lunch break yet? Those BK burgers ain’t gonna grill themselves.
2021-04-29 14:47:07,wallstreetbets,"Again with the projecting. It's okay to be dumb, no one blames you for being born or raised that way. You should've just told me you were some retard kid and I wouldn't have had to hurt your feelings. I'm sorry I didn't break down my words enough for you. I hope next time I can do better 👍"
2021-04-29 14:56:16,wallstreetbets,I apologize for insulting you by calling you a burger flipper at BK. That was wrong of me. You are obviously very good with money so you must be the cashier. Either way you should probably get back to your shift.

2021-04-29 14:13:58,wallstreetbets,"I am a developer. No offense, but you are either an idiot or are incredibly ignorant about what this company does. We (developers) all know what Palantir is. They actually have a LOT of trouble recruiting top talent from universities. It's not because their pay or current talent is bad (it is quite good), but because they are an evil fucking company. Do you have any idea what their products are used for? Well, I'll tell you. They are used to help police terrorize neighborhoods, used to help ICE with ""mission critical"" software to help with deportations, and if that doesn't bother you, they are working on essentially an AI killbot drone from a Pentagon contract that Google walked away from. Ask yourself what the greater evil is to work on between that and ""harvesting data for profit."" What a joke"
2021-04-29 17:04:45,wallstreetbets,I exited today at the low :(. I had 20k worth of 5/14c $25 which went up to 38k at the high and back down to 22k when i exited. Big Yikes... but at least i didn't lose money. 2k in a week off of 20k isn't that bad - but definitely some regret here about my greed. lol.
2021-04-29 01:45:50,wallstreetbets,"Ah wait, you're saying the IV is too high?"
2021-04-29 08:34:16,wallstreetbets,Thanks friend.
2021-04-28 23:51:36,wallstreetbets,800 @ 30.84 🙃🙃
2021-04-28 22:41:33,wallstreetbets,"I'm holding till it hits 100, at least."
2021-04-29 12:47:50,wallstreetbets,"Not saying to do this but as an example. Sell 53 (fifty three) May 21 covered calls at the 27 strike for .38, current bid as I write this. That’s around 2k credit minus fees. That would take your cost basis of approx 143,100 (5300 shares @ 27) down to around 141,100 effectively bringing down your cost basis from 27 per share to 26.62. If the underlying rises past the strike price of your calls that’s ok, you’ll still be profitable but you’re capping your gains and your shares would then get called away. You could then sell puts if you wanted to stay in this position further reducing your cost basis. If the underlying stays below the strike of your calls at expiration you pocket the credit and have effectively reduced your cost basis. Rinse and repeat. This strategy is also known as “The Wheel”. You could also do nothing, that’s ok too if you have conviction in the stock long term."
2021-04-28 22:28:11,wallstreetbets,Something to do when we rally then give the gains back...
2021-04-29 18:53:48,wallstreetbets,I’m buying more tomorrow
2021-04-29 14:26:33,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately, this is happening in all countries from around the world. An unfortunate part of war and arms races is that you need your country to be the best in that area or you will quickly be the one terrorized by such technology. If you are a US citizen it is your unfortunate duty make sure your country comes out on top. Not saying the US military is ethical or perfect, but you do not want China / Russia taking the lead in this space. So although, yes your technology that you are developing is aiding in death and destruction - that's life. Imagine if the best and the brightest didn't want to work on the manhattan project because they found it against their morals to bomb and kill 100,000. The world may have ended. SO i do believe that staying at the forefront of modern technology is in the best interest of the country and it is more valuable than figuring out how to get karen to buy more face cream."

That's not the case. 2) You should be smart enough to realize that FDA approval for these drugs may be a stepping stone in the longer route to legalization for recreational use. The government, after decades of a war against drugs, is not going to just say ""Okay, you're right, we're making it legal. Go have fun."" 3) Anyone invested in this company for gains does not want legalization right away. If you are a shareholder in this company but you are arguing for legalization then you're either a hypocrite or purely in it for profit."

2021-04-29 09:40:00,wallstreetbets,"1. Who cares, alcohol is abused and kills an estimated 95,000 americans per year. Let people make their own decisions.
2. Weed isn't FDA approved but it's now available in most states. Shrooms are already decriminalized in Denver, Oakland, Santa Cruz, Cambridge, and Oregon. So decrim and legalization can definitely happen faster than FDA approval which will take atleast 5 years.
3. Of course shareholders don't want legalization. This would make psilocybin much more affordable to the public because companies wouldn't have exclusivity. I won't invest because the valuation makes no sense for how much dilution they are going to need to do over the next 5 years.. Average FDA approval process costs $1 Billion"

2021-04-29 10:27:12,wallstreetbets,thank u smart man
2021-04-29 04:21:59,wallstreetbets,I wasn't talking about anyone in particular though.
2021-04-29 09:48:13,wallstreetbets,"The guy said support psychedelic medicine so I told him not to support this company :) 

Then you came in calling my comment dumb because you believe people should only have access to medical shrooms, which I completely disagree with, and here we are."
2021-04-28 20:24:05,wallstreetbets,"I know, but what is going to stop any other company from making a pharmaceutical product out of it? I have no doubt that the therapy is helpful but the only major players in the psych market are the big pharma companies like Johnson and Johnson (ketamine spray). These small psychedelic companies don't have the money to run multi year clinical trials for multiple indications. They would need billions of dollars in cash to do so."
2021-04-28 21:54:53,wallstreetbets,"""You can't really patent something that grows on the ground, can you""... someone should let Monsanto know..."
2021-04-29 09:50:50,wallstreetbets,"It's not just shrooms. Do some research for fucks sake. 18-MC is non hallucinogenic. There's discovery of new synthetic compounds plus LSD, MDMA, etc."
2021-04-28 20:30:02,wallstreetbets,"Doesnt matter. These companies have been working on this for a while, they're ahead, and the market is made of hype. At worst big pharma buys the company and it still pop the fuck off.  not financial advice, am an ape"
2021-04-28 21:03:32,wallstreetbets,"There is a small company making a ketamine patch.... since penny stock not sure I can name them, but also Canadian.  If they can get that to market....geesh.."
2021-04-29 02:24:46,wallstreetbets,"You keep saying this but it’s actually contrary to what is really happening. These are essentially biopharmaceutical companies that are competing against each other since the ones that develop the intellectual property to synthesize the molecules to help treat disorders will get the golden egg. The “psychedelics” - mushrooms, ecstasy, lsd etc etc are merely the compounds they are working with to develop their own drugs from and patent."
2021-04-29 11:27:00,wallstreetbets,OK that's completely irrelevant to what we were talking about
2021-04-28 22:49:08,wallstreetbets,"I guess I'm trying to say that what you just described is the limit for these companies. I don't think it's ever naturally going to 50 bucks. Now we know anything can happen like with GME but I wouldn't rely on it. They have nothing proprietary that a drug company couldn't rapidly develop. Heck we already know what the compounds are, the only real patentable aspect is the delivery mechanism."
2021-04-29 11:17:50,wallstreetbets,"Really? What clinical trials are Mindmed currently undertaking? What product have they developed?

All I see is a single stage 2a clinical trial about microdosing LSD for ADHD. And they didn't even start it, they acquired or from someone else who did. Which leads me to believe it wasn't really going well."
2021-04-29 00:05:24,wallstreetbets,50 no fucking way only retarded apes truly believe that. but the upside is still gigantic. easy multibagging opportunity.
2021-04-29 13:55:23,wallstreetbets,"That isn't really a response to what i said. I was talking about what these companies are ultimately aiming for: patented compounds - now you're changing the narrative to what they've accomplished? Who to go with and why, or to invest at all, is entirely your own decision - just pointing out that they are all in a race to likely synthesize their own drugs from ""psychedelics""  that big pharma can't just take from them. We all know that this is the very beginning stage of the sector, and some of us want try to capitalize. Asking ""what product have they developed"" is getting way ahead of the game, sort of like asking what cannabis product did GW Pharmaceuticals have 2 years before  Epidiolex."
2021-04-29 11:21:01,wallstreetbets,Oh there's multiple posts that I've seen here of people saying that lmao.
2021-04-29 14:17:54,wallstreetbets,"I'm trying to say, what pharmaceuticals are they patenting? Clinical trials are part of the pathway to get patented compounds released to the market. Something that Mindmed has shown minimal ability in doing.

They're being valued as a multi billion dollar company and they don't even have a product in the pipeline.

GW pharma was valued at 7.2 billion when it was bought and it had an actual licenced product associated with it. Right now the market cap of MMED alone is almost 2 billion. With no indication of them producing anything or even in the process of it. That's the point I'm trying to make.

Also using cannabis as an example is horrible because this is realistically the only pharmaceutical that ever came out of dozens of these RandD companies. I'm biased because I work in pharma but I know how ruthless they are. They still have the vast majority of market share, good luck competing with them as a company with a few dozen employees."
2021-04-29 15:33:08,wallstreetbets,"I’m not interested in going back and forth - don’t believe it, don’t buy in. There’s a ton of biotech companies in the cannabis game, and they’ll likely be a lot in the psychedelics game. You’re still saying “what pharmaceuticals are they patenting” ffs the company is a year old. Do you think companies ipo with patented end product in hand? Do you think they list with billions of dollars for r & d? They form a team with an agenda and philosophy, they raise money to list and begin building, they do offerings or borrow money to continue to develop, do research, do clinical trials - it’s goes on and on. If you believe in the studies that have been done, and believe there’s a future in the sector, you invest. Alternatively you sit on the sidelines and wait for a clear winner to emerge and then invest, thirdly you don’t believe and move on."
2021-04-29 15:36:27,wallstreetbets,"You're right, the company is a year old. So why is it being valued at nearly 2 billion dollars? That's the problem I have. I'd be having a whole different conversation if it was one quarter of that.

Companies don't IPO with a finished product in hand but at the very minimum they have multiple ongoing clinical trials and not just some random trial that they acquired from another company or institution. Furthermore, even if the trial has any success they still don't have a patentable product since it's LSD, something that has existed since the 70s. Any drug company could run the exact same trial and trample all over them by selling it in patch form or a slow release tablet."

AAPL’s barely traded over $135 in the past month (and lol since late January before that). IV’s been super low lately too so that didn’t prop you up either. 

I’d love some help understanding how you made money barely touching your strike “a couple of days” before expiration on Apple?"
2021-04-28 23:53:21,wallstreetbets,just for you it'll print 🙂
2021-04-29 15:10:15,wallstreetbets,This was fucking bullshit. It’ll probably hit 140 next week or the week following. It’ll get their when *they* want it

2021-04-29 14:47:51,wallstreetbets,"I think you're relatively safe. I can't see the sustain drop below $134 and see more potential for it to end up $135 or higher. But it really sucks that market conspires against you compounded by the rising 10 years yields. Apple earning blew well past anyone's expectation and yet the next day, the house manipulate the market so they can buy it at a lower price to cover their calls. They will collect a ton from all those call that expired OTM."
2021-04-29 16:16:32,wallstreetbets,"Well I live in Hawaii and woke up at noon ET, expecting some green, and realized how AAPL fucked me. I'm holding 10 4/30 130C and 8 5/7 134C."

2021-04-29 10:18:26,wallstreetbets,"just paying close attention to the price as i wanted to make a play on its run up to earnings. either when the anti-trust started gaining traction or when biden's tax hike made the news, the underlying dropped to from ~$135 to $132. IV spikes momentarily during those sudden movements, and i was lucky to get my order just in time to get filled.

apparently, my positions were $138c and not $135c (which is what i intended to buy) so i suspect i saw a bigger drop on the former with enough OI to give me confidence to go in.

2021-04-29 14:51:05,wallstreetbets,"Very true. They’re really good at collecting premiums. Knowing that is also why I didn’t sell at the lows. Should easily be 135.5-136 by expiry. Now on the other hand it’s risky bc if Amazon is beaten down things could get bloody tomorrow. 

Disclosure: holding an ITM AMZN 3420c (cost $100)"
2021-04-29 16:38:01,wallstreetbets,130c should hit 4.50-5 tomorrow hopefully. If your cost isn’t too high should be breakeven
2021-04-29 14:37:05,wallstreetbets,This is why you buy ITM. I’m flat rn. No gain but no loss so far.
2021-04-29 10:17:23,wallstreetbets,Only half of the value was intrinsic bud. The other half was premium.
2021-04-29 17:00:56,wallstreetbets,Could have sold the $140's against the position at open this morning. Would've more than doubled your money. I expected this outcome. I very much doubt it even stays above $155 this year.
2021-04-29 17:37:11,wallstreetbets,What’s your next move? So I can inverse it and profit. You’re down like $50k this week lol

2021-04-28 21:30:48,wallstreetbets,What do you believe is going to happen Friday?  Other than a price drop as Friday is always a sell day.
2021-04-28 21:37:18,wallstreetbets,">Friday is always a sell day.

Not true as far a MVIS goes historically. You will need to do some TA if you don't believe me

>What do you believe is going to happen Friday?

That's the million dollar question. They have an earnings call they moved a week forward happening tomorrow (Thursday) after hours. Because of the timing of this call there are a lot of potential theories in the works ranging from partnership announcements, royalty numbers from MSFT on the IVAS vertical, potential demo partners from the Sample A, etc. 

Friday, then, would be the day we see these potential catalysts manifest in price action, being that the EC is after hours Thursday. If the catalysts have enough power, they will compound an effect already in place by a massive short position and extremely high borrow fees. More covering = higher PPS. 

In reality the LiDAR PR today was entirely unexpected by a lot of MVIS longs, myself included. The possibilities for tomorrow's earnings calls are pretty up there right now."
2021-04-28 21:45:22,wallstreetbets,I like the sound of this!!!!🚀
2021-04-29 09:48:46,wallstreetbets,Tell me again how you are sure about MVIS 🤣🤣you guys will never ever learn will you.  Tanking!!
2021-04-29 09:49:23,wallstreetbets,Like I said.  I don’t buy JUNK
2021-04-29 09:55:38,wallstreetbets,"Also your OUST stock has exactly the same TA pattern as MVIS and LAZR right now, you are just not very bright.

Whole market is tanking, even blue chips. Surely you aren't that obtuse to pick up on that subtle hint, are you?"
2021-04-29 10:03:46,wallstreetbets,"Not at all.  I am up 4% today. I have chip stocks, Apple and big position QCOM.  I am flying 🚀 I don’t buy junk"
2021-04-29 10:04:47,wallstreetbets,Maybe Friday you will get your wish 🤣🤣Friday means nothing
2021-04-29 10:06:59,wallstreetbets,"You are free to like and invest in OUST. And I won't even smack talk the stock because I know nothing about it. 

Food for thought though: If MVIS posted their LiDAR stats yesterday (which they did), and OUST is better, why haven't institutions invested in OUST and brought it's share price up to match that sentiment? Hmm.

Try not to get too judgemental of competitors or attached to your own product. Gonna hurt in the end."
2021-04-29 10:09:35,wallstreetbets,Guess we'll find out. I fully expect this stock to be well worth it (more so than the 59% I am already up) by the end of May.
2021-04-29 17:49:21,wallstreetbets,I hope you sold.  Get out
2021-04-28 20:54:00,wallstreetbets,Tf am i looking it. You promised porn
2021-04-28 21:38:10,wallstreetbets,Well this isn't porn at all.
2021-04-28 21:54:07,wallstreetbets,You do you do m8
2021-04-28 20:32:06,wallstreetbets,"First off, you buried the lead:

You're balls deep in MVIS.

I'm guessing that's why the CAPS diarrhea? I'd be shaking too after what happened today. Plummeted -nearly 20% from the day high and AH gains keep eroding?  That's one rough ride brother so i feel you, but don't take it out on me!

**""WERE YOU HIGH??""**

Maybe.

**""DRUNK??""** 

Yes.

**""I mean HOLY SHIT your first sell off was in the middle of the trading day with nothing but green lighting the way!!! ""**

lol i literally did the same fucking thing today and it paid off perfectly. I sold at 25 today, right before the backslide.  Last week it didn't work, and I got fucked.  Today it did, and you got fucked.   You could've locked in 20% gains.  

**""You saw one little drop of 0.72 and you freaked out.. you sold shortly after when it was on the rise again.. Thats why your second sell of $13 was slightly higher than the first.**

That's how Schwab executed the order. I put it in as one market order, they broke it into two purchases. Happens all the time.   

**AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE FUCK THAT BUY AND THEN SELL OFF ON THE 23rd WAS ALL ABOUT---**   

You can go find my other comment on that, about the guys weekend I was on.  I was going to dive back in but realized I'd ruin the next 3 days with my friends by hovering 24/7 over the ticker so I flipped my trade a minute later and just went and played guitar all weekend.  btw from an old-timer, NEVER be afraid to backtrack on a trade after it executes.  Takes brass balls but has saved my ass a few times. 

**BUT THEN AFTER a $9 LOSS and CRAZY ASS VOLITILITY you BECOME BRAVE ALL OF THE SUDDEN and make a $50k deposit, TO COVER WHAT BTW??** 

The two things had nothing to do with each other.  The 50K check was from work. Guys weekend took place in the town I work in, so I swung by the office and picked up the first paycheck  ( a partnership, we pay ourselves 2-3 times a year).  The deposit had nothing to do with MVIS or any other trading and I had more than enough in that account to cover what I wanted to do with MVIS without the 50k.  

**YOU didnt even buy back in with half your deposit and ONLY 4k more than your recent play... MAKES NO FUCKING SENSE.**

Does it now? Explained above. 

**AND TO POUR SALT INTO THE WOUNDS, YOU FUCKING SOLD ALL OF IT!!!**

Into your wounds maybe.   

Just remember two things: 

I bought in at 11, and skimmed $1700.

I sold at 25, and skimmed $1300. 

Those were some seriously amazing entry and exit points, and made the trades profitable.  I surfed the shit out of that stock even though I wobbled on the board a few times, in the end I brought it home.  Not bad for my first intentional day-trade in 20 years.  Those 2 moves will have me smiling in my dreams tonight, and for me, more than make up for the idiocy in between.  I can buy back in right now if I truly believe it's gonna take off.  I might, first thing in the morning.  But tonight, I'll sleep on a pillow of 3k."
2021-04-29 00:03:06,wallstreetbets,How am I supposed to get hard off $3000?!
2021-04-28 20:57:26,wallstreetbets,"It’s still hard emotionally but I remind myself of how far we have come. And I have a strong belief they will be very successful! I kept buying the dips in order to feel less helpless and to try and look at it as an opportunity to get more shares! Bought a lot more since December. I didn’t really time them perfectly because I just wanted the shares when I had fresh cash to invest. I hope it goes well for you! Hope we never see 10-13 or even 15, 19 again. 🤞"
2021-04-29 14:45:42,wallstreetbets,"WELL IN THAT CASE!!!

2021-04-28 21:58:41,wallstreetbets,"Think 20$ is fair after demo, converting that into sales / pre-orders is what I’m hoping to hear tomo."
2021-04-28 20:26:27,wallstreetbets,"Don't worry, it'll be back. Selling now at a loss would be a bad idea since the fundamentals are good and it's pretty safely sitting above the 19-20 area with institutional interest. Downside small, upside big.

To be honest I did drop it all at 24.6 as soon as momentum started to wane and picked it up again at 21, but it's just people doing this sort of thing which are messing with it short term. Long term is still very solid."
2021-04-29 04:40:26,wallstreetbets,"27 for me. Ugh. Should’ve bought less and a put, then it would’ve gone sideways for you lol"

2021-04-29 00:15:35,wallstreetbets,What trading apps can canadians use to trade this stock? Wealth simple seems to be pretty poop at finding any to the moon stonks..
2021-04-29 00:43:38,wallstreetbets,I'm in 👩🏼‍🚀🚀
2021-04-29 01:05:56,wallstreetbets,Woah I've been in Mind Med since October with 1.5K shares and I really didn't think uplisting to the NASDAQ was going to bring this much attention especially from the APEs

2021-04-29 09:02:14,wallstreetbets,This is one of those times where I like the company more than I do the analysis lines. If I'm to be honest I don't see the stock doing anything much to the upside any time soon and usually I don't mess with any stock that doesn't seem like it will make a strong move within the next 90 days. In this one case though I feel strongly about the company and eventually these shares will probably be worth a lot more than they are today. It's just a matter of A) how long will it take and B) will they face political sabotage.
2021-04-28 20:22:58,wallstreetbets,All of their pipeline looked to be in early phase 2 which means years away from putting anything on the market.  I know most fucktards on here have to chant diamond hands to hold longer than a month.  I think it’s a good long hold but if it goes up any higher in the near term it will be hype not profitability.
2021-04-28 20:59:08,wallstreetbets,I got it for quick profits but I know boomers and I know how it can change your perception of appreciation and direction.  It meshes and enhances the senses to make this possible.  Making connections/bridges in the brain that aren't normally made.  Speeds up thought and in turn seems to slow time and increase eye/hand coordination as a result.

2021-04-29 03:53:52,wallstreetbets,This guy fuks
2021-04-29 05:43:50,wallstreetbets,"guys, those who says FDA will never approve LSD drugs so I found that Compass Pathways is running an FDA-approved clinical trial on psilocybin! so how is that ?"
2021-04-29 09:43:37,wallstreetbets,I'm here for it
2021-04-29 10:55:07,wallstreetbets,"

2021-04-28 22:17:41,wallstreetbets,"I was really impressed with the CEO, he wasn't some deuche bag gelled back hair over tanned snake looking salesman. 

He was real, honest, and straight up grateful to be where they are. 

As much as most CEOs suck and are not deserving of their insane compensation (and he still has a lot to prove of course) he seems like a good guy."
2021-04-29 04:52:41,wallstreetbets,"Personally, I really hope their LSD microdose clinical trial for adult ADHD works out. As an adult diagnosed with ADHD since I was 12, I really wish there was a less dangerous alternative than stimulants to reduce my symptoms."

2021-04-29 09:54:04,wallstreetbets,That's exactly what I read out of that speech🤣
2021-04-28 22:18:21,wallstreetbets,Charismatic guy like that with a vision?  It can make people under them do insane things and achieve shit that otherwise would have been impossible for them.
2021-04-28 23:21:52,wallstreetbets,Guess we all start somewhere. I also have around a 100

2021-04-28 22:11:55,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, had to snap up a few shares for my boomer account for this reason.  It speaks to my ape heart pure and simple.

Idgaf about most companies I trade but this really can change the world in a meaningful way.  Not just make our lives a little more convenient, give us entertainment, whatever, but like REALLY WAY turn down the shittiness many people have to experience."
2021-04-28 21:00:21,wallstreetbets,Well said. Well said.
2021-04-28 22:06:23,wallstreetbets,Kratom. Pure. From Indonesia. Smoke shops sell dirt. Don't eat dirt. Eat Pure. Live Long Life. Happy. *I sell one Tendy me have 15 kilo pure.* Me happy. Me Live Long.
2021-04-28 21:56:33,wallstreetbets,Loved that.  But he forgot to mention those of us who just want quality shrooms to be more legally accessible so we can trip balls on them and not get paranoid if we see a cop

2021-04-28 20:22:54,wallstreetbets,That's crazy!... so crazy *it just might work*.
2021-04-28 20:18:35,wallstreetbets,Lordy. Can you imagine 9 million apes on 🍄?
2021-04-28 22:00:11,wallstreetbets,Haha what are you? Poor???? I'm buying four stocks
2021-04-28 20:34:39,wallstreetbets,doubled market cap today.
2021-04-28 20:20:09,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough. Just wondering what the play is, are we hoping they make Brain Candy and see stock this moon, or do they just chug along as a fairweather stock."
2021-04-28 20:47:26,wallstreetbets,"Not that long ago, the stock was 30cents and two dollars was a dream.."
2021-04-29 00:58:54,wallstreetbets,Or buying on US OTC market like I did with Fidelity.
2021-04-29 10:22:20,wallstreetbets,We are the short bus kind of special
2021-04-29 01:29:53,wallstreetbets,Your mom calls me special
2021-04-28 22:13:48,wallstreetbets,Shhhhhhhh why mention it and piss off boomer investors
2021-04-29 02:48:02,wallstreetbets,"I don't know tbh. There's good research showing that psychedelics used as therapeutics have a more lasting positive impact on depression than traditional SSRIs. If you are working on addressing mental health problems, these aren't going to be medicines you'd be snorting through your nose after 8 shots of Fireball at your friend's kegger. The goal isn't to trip balls with prescription psychedelics, it's to benefit from the increase in neuroplasticity so you can break free from bad thought patterns. Part of the research by MindMed consists of reducing the psychoactive effect to make it less harmful if abused. I hope to have a trained therapist guide me through a trip so I face my demons with a trained professional. Hopefully it works, but I don't know. Everyone is different. Worst case scenario, I see some vivid colors and get facinated with the patters on a carpet."
2021-04-28 22:14:16,wallstreetbets,Are options a play for this?  I initially thought it should be bc most seem to only need 5 days of Nasdaq listing but others say it's not?
2021-04-28 21:03:03,wallstreetbets,"With so many trials going on each positive result will gain more support. 17 in the next 3 yrs. 
A strong long holding base to keep each shelf up. So moon."
2021-04-28 21:03:37,wallstreetbets,I always find these things after theyve 10x so I'm not surprised

2021-04-28 22:34:12,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure, but options aren't a play *yet*. I don't doubt they will be though. I'm just trying to play the volatility in ThetaGang style, I really do like the stonk"
2021-04-28 21:37:42,wallstreetbets,"Mushrooms increase neural plasticity, Neural plasticity makes you smart, Only makes sense to invest in a company that LITERALLY will make people smarter."
2021-04-28 22:29:20,wallstreetbets,That definitely answers my question but now I have another. Could you give some more info on OTC transactions?
2021-04-29 19:35:53,wallstreetbets,I was going to give this a like but noticed you already have 69... thanks for being kind and sharing info bro.
2021-04-29 00:55:09,wallstreetbets,5 strip
2021-04-28 21:43:20,wallstreetbets,"Also neural plasticity makes you not depressed.. Just tiny amounts of whatever drug they develop will completely cure depression, anxiety, motivation, these facts about these drugs has been known for years, this will be extremely profitable, but also good for society.. Although if Elons neural net develops the way it sounds we may have a cure for most mental illness and the ultimate way to play videogames in a couple of decades"
2021-04-28 20:23:05,wallstreetbets,"Thank you so much, I really appreciate this.  A huge trigger for me is work related stress so it's so hard to try distracting myself since so much of my day is spent, well, working...I think sticking to a schedule will be huge for me.  Part of my problem is, I will over-dose myself on tough days when I feel lots of stress, and then on the weekends I'll cut back to less than my prescribed dose.

&#x200B;

If I can just discipline myself enough to stay on the exact same dose every day, that'll be a huge first step.  Really appreciate your encouragement and just might take you up on messaging you when I start."
2021-04-28 20:12:48,wallstreetbets,You’re beautiful. Thank you.
2021-04-28 23:13:02,wallstreetbets,Would you buy at current price too?
2021-04-28 20:33:47,wallstreetbets,"You might be manufacturing stress by throwing your dose up and down, just a thought. I dunno, the half-life is long but it's not long enough to carry you thru ups and downs like that. Look forward to hearing your progress"
2021-04-29 00:56:54,wallstreetbets,I did! Not sure if that was the right call but here we go🤞
2021-04-29 05:15:53,wallstreetbets,Probably...but I wouldn't spend all my money bc I would want some for the possible dip.

2021-04-28 23:58:32,wallstreetbets,How about a product shake up
2021-04-28 20:05:13,wallstreetbets,BB stock price is impervious to good news. I bought in at $18.77 🙄 and it immediately dived to $9ish and stayed there. I'm sure all I have to do is sell and cement the loss and it'll go back up again.

2021-04-29 02:09:18,wallstreetbets,"It doesn't have to do any of this monopolistic shit you're talking about to reach 30$, You can't just look at share price without thinking about market cap. You're comparing blackberry to top10 biggest companies in the world when it doesn't have to be one - they don't need to be used by guy selling soap in Wisconsin like Facebook does to be relevant. But it's very hard to have a discussion where you once again post same marketplace as proof that BB is doomed without actually comparing those 1000s of apps/solutions."
2021-04-29 09:51:30,wallstreetbets,Hope enough folks actually are buying the stock rather than options because unless its close to being ITM they more than likely haven't hedged for it so your option adds 0 buying pressure to the stock and if OTM you just gave the hedges free money.
2021-04-29 06:52:45,wallstreetbets,Why didn't you put the money in stocks. Life savings on call options is ballsy

So much FUD for seemingly no reason when amc has never been this bullish as it is right now. You'll be fine imo, $25 is very reachable. I think it's more so the timeframe, who knows what's gonna happen whenever it does. days/weeks/months."

You guys are so stupid for thinking this I am actually rooting for the short sellers now"
2021-04-28 20:32:37,wallstreetbets,"Just curious, why do you think the shorts can't hold out? Unless their entire account is in AMC they can hold forever and just pay the interest. There is only a margin call if you don't have the funds to cover.

Regarding the movies, that is one point I like about AMC. With WW84 bombing with the streaming release all the blockbusters will go to theaters. But, I think a lot of that is baked in already.

Don't forget the debt and the fact they have only made money 2 of the last 5 years and those years were only 100m versus 300 to 400m losses."
2021-04-28 20:44:40,wallstreetbets,"To your deleted comment:

None of that will happen. If Melvin and all it's clones barely slowed down with GME nothing will happen with AMC this time.

How many of these synthetic shares do you think there are in AMC?

Next time you are going to buy something this stupid let me know so I can write the contracts and we can cut out the middle man."
2021-04-28 20:49:10,wallstreetbets,I am going to just let you do this but you bet your life savings on a short squeeze. Do some research and see how many squeezes there have been. The chance this happens and nobody sells is infinitly small.

3) Two or three days of real yolos by FOMOs (this is when the stock goes up 25%)

4) Two or three days of ""we're going to the moon"" posts. (Lots of yacht memes attached.)

5) Dump day. (This is when the stock dumps 50% lower than where it was pre-Step 1.)

6) Two or three days of bagholders saying it's coming back up.

7) Real loss porn.

8) Two or three days of ""Where my CLOV buddies at?"" These are the long-term bagholders trying to figure out why the casino they're in is now empty.

However, if you do your DD, you will know that this is not just a squeeze . This is not just a meme stock . The company is far more undervalued when it is being compared with other archaic  medical insurance companies . Chamath especially loves this company because it uses artificial intelligence technology to analyze customers’ data. Think about how Tesla went from 5 dollars to 500 dollars a share in just a few months . If I see CLOV hitting 20 by the end of this week , I would not be surprised . The company is currently undervalued because of those fucking shorters who hate new startups with disruptive technology .

CLOV is the Tesla of the healthcare insurance sector. With Democrats’ control of the house , Medicare will expand significant in the next few months .

I made a 20 buck gain on OCGN and other stocks and went my version of YOLO (1k) on MVIS and walked away with a cool little profit. I’m mainly investing with money I was going to keep tucked away in a savings account so if I can make these small moves and get some small gains I’m happy. My ROI right now is better than my savings account and my 401k so I’m happy.

2021-04-28 22:16:04,wallstreetbets,"The biggest problem with LiDAR is critical-angles causing complete reflections of objects.  
i.e. Puddles are bad and anything horizontal that reflects is catastrophic. Reflecting the sun is bad but detectable because nothing else is that bright. You can largely ignore stuff in the air so the direct LoS to the sun doesn't matter.  
That's why this problem requires ""data fusion"" to solve.  
  
I presume their LiDAR is 3D (field of scan-lines not a single line).  
The number of autonomous vehicle companies using useless, neigh recklessly dangerous, 2D radars is stunning.

2021-04-28 21:21:37,wallstreetbets,"Do YOU need lidar to drive, or do you see and drive fine with just your eyes? Vision is all you need for FSD long term which means lidar is both a waste of resources and a crutch which would slow down vision training. Tesla is the only manufacturer actually focused long term. Will a lot of manufacturers use Lidar short and mid term? Yes, but years later cameras are all that will be needed. Lidar just slows down that progress."
2021-04-28 21:58:12,wallstreetbets,Lidar is not useless but understanding whether it will be used on millions of cars in the future or not...seems like something valid to point out to someone investing in lidar.
2021-04-28 21:06:42,wallstreetbets,Based on what I am reading it sounds like more of the impressive part is the software and algorithm and not so much the hardware? I would suspect that hardware is more difficult to copy due to patent law but I could be wrong. If that’s the case this seems less impressive than I was hoping for but would love your thoughts as an engineer since I am a simpleton ape with an tiny doctorate degree in medicine and very distant undergraduate engineering classes.
2021-04-29 14:38:43,wallstreetbets,It looks like how GME first started
2021-04-29 09:45:58,wallstreetbets,I really think most people don't get that this company doesn't make money.  They barely have revenue.  Most people don't do their homework.  You are buying this company for a potential big tech buyout (which personally I do not think is happening) but it will probably crash on earnings because no one understands what this company does.
2021-04-28 22:13:20,wallstreetbets,I wasn’t aware that Musk was the authority on every car in the world. Or even a majority of them. LiDAR may or may not be used in millions of cars in the future. Only time will tell. :)
2021-04-28 22:28:54,wallstreetbets,$TRSH
2021-04-28 21:14:54,wallstreetbets,"Personally, I think the MEMS hardware they're using to create images from a single sensor is more impressive than the algorithm, but software is actually patentable now, so there's plenty of novelty to go around. Whatever their algorithm is, it's got to be pretty impressive for the level of secrecy they've maintained about it, since they haven't published so much as a single paper about their progress, which indicates to me that they're doing something really novel that hasn't been done before, and they feel like publishing would be detrimental. The fact that they haven't tried patenting their algorithm either kind of supports this theory, since patent filings are public and they're keeping everything remarkably secret, given the amount of public attention on them."
2021-04-28 22:22:08,wallstreetbets,Not musk. Simple derivation off of physics. Cameras provide more data and fidelity than lidar. If you can make it work with just vision lidar has no use case in cars in the future. When is really the question. That may be 5 years away or 50.
2021-04-28 21:21:29,wallstreetbets,Interesting. So it’s either revolutionarily new algorithm with some impressive hardware that may be opening the door for a more effective algorithm so they are being incredibly secretive so much so that they wouldn’t risk a patent and are instead shopping it to buyers by spec only or potentially this is all a shroud to cover that it can’t be done. Have to keep my skepticism hat on haha but I feel more comfortable holding knowing an expert thinks there might be something there
2021-04-28 22:31:31,wallstreetbets,Seems odd for there to be a lot of companies spending millions exploring the use of LiDAR if it flies in the face of simple physics. Best of luck to ya! :)
2021-04-28 23:05:24,wallstreetbets,"camera is not suitable for autonomous driving unless it is used with lidar. autonomous driving requires accurate ranges, and that cannot be acquired by cameras. there never be full autonomous with just cameras as you can see there many accidents caused by tesla autonomous driving."
2021-04-28 21:23:21,wallstreetbets,"I'm not an expert, I just have experience with using LIDAR in robotics. That said, I think you're dead on the money with them shopping their algo out by spec, given the buyout rumors we've heard."
2021-04-29 08:03:29,wallstreetbets,People don't have lidar in their eyeballs yet they are perfectly capable of driving. Ergo autonomous driving does not require lidar.
2021-04-28 21:28:01,wallstreetbets,More of an expert than most people on here. My fear was that they were taking advantage of the lidar hype much like many biotech companies come out saying they were working on a covid vaccine for a price bump only to later say oh yeah it didn’t work out. But from what you’re telling me all signs point towards at least a product that is what they say it is.
2021-04-29 08:44:14,wallstreetbets,"lol. are you comparing human eyes to the camera vision? human eye is much more complex and connected to a brain. and i think it is somewhat like lidar+ camera vision. light bending depending on what you focus at is used to calculate how far the objects are from you. Vision only can easily give you false ranges, and this phenomenon is very common to find on many pictures. vision only can't replace human eyeballs as camera cant focus on every object in the frame. it has to have other form of data in addition to the camera vision to do the eyeball function. you stated lidar is only delaying the perfect form of camera vision to do what eyeballs do but i think lidar + camera vision will do."

2021-04-29 07:40:02,wallstreetbets,GME has over a half billion cash on hand no debt expected profits to be reported in the QE already changing into a ecommerce. AMC 5.7 billion in debt 470 million in rent coming due expected another half billion in loss next QE only 25% of theaters open at 25% to 50% capacity. Shares have been diluted 75% from the original offering and about to get 43 million shares more and even after selling it wont even cover the expected loss. The fundamentals are entirely opposite.
2021-04-29 07:47:09,wallstreetbets,"Sure now, not trying to argue GME hasn't had a huge turnaround, but back in January GME was not profitable, transitioning very slowly to Ecommerce, and still had a fair amount of debt, but it still jumped. Also theater's are 98% open albeit at limited capacity , not saying that really changes anything in terms of fundamentals just being a stickler for factual correctness"
2021-04-29 07:53:12,wallstreetbets,"Just to be clear I'm not trying to argue that AMC's fundamentals are good, they're utter trash, I'm just saying fundamentals don't matter in a short squeeze play and you can use GME as pretty recent proof"
2021-04-29 07:56:07,wallstreetbets,That's 98% of their theaters in the US only dont forget most of the ones in foreign markets are still closed. GME  had the fundamental last year and it's written in DFV's thesis. Just being a stickler to factual correctness.
2021-04-29 08:21:10,wallstreetbets,"True but a large majority of their theaters are in the US... and I could argue that AMC has a positive outlook long term with two of their major competitors not surviving the pandemic, a shitton of new releases that were delayed coming out this summer and a deal with WB to screen those films at a reduced cost, but none of that changes the short term facts that they are currently not profitable and in debt. My argument though is simply that GME, when it popped off in January, was in a similar position and therefore fundamentals don't matter for a squeeze. That's it, not bashing GME or DFV"
2021-04-29 08:29:56,wallstreetbets,When GME popped of it had already started its transition with RC at the helm moving to ecommerce you saw that in their 4qt earnings report. AMC would be a good long term stock if they can get back to 100% Showing blockbuster movies to only 25% to 50% capacity will keep them from ever turning a profit and continue packing on debt. If they integrated into a stream service like a Netflix platform to show new releases they could make up some of the loss but I'm not even sure studios would agree to allow direct to stream for the new releases and I dont recall the CEO ever talking about maybe trying to do that.

BTW We have tried to bury it with disastrous results.  It can be stored but only under the right circumstances."
2021-04-28 21:53:28,wallstreetbets,"So other than the hazardous waste that has to be stored in a mountain it is clean? 

Is that your argument for why nuclear is actually clean?  It is so clean it has to be stored under a mountain.  Do you people even read what you are writing?"
2021-04-28 22:22:02,wallstreetbets,"I'm not saying it's clean, but if managed properly it would be much better than fossil fuels."
2021-04-28 23:00:32,wallstreetbets,"You clearly don’t pick up on sarcasm since my post was pointing out at how the waste of nuclear renders an entire area uninhabitable and toxic for hundreds of years due to the half life of the spent rods. 
Me being serious: Yes the toxic waste byproduct of nuclear is some of the worst but if confined to a super remote, uninhabitable area with no water tables or ground water etc. this is the cleanest means of producing energy on a massive scale thats also cost effective. So would you rather coal power plants that pollutes while producing energy that is uncontrollable and spreads far and wide Creating health problems for the populace? Same thing for solar panels in other green energy all involve the same hazards so yes when you look at nuclear at least you’re able to control the waste to one area and seal it away.
You have done zero research and it shows"
2021-04-28 21:46:00,wallstreetbets,"I understand all of that.  However,  my original objection stands.  A power source that produces hazardous waste is considered to be a clean source of power only by people who don't understand the meaning of clean."
2021-04-28 21:48:03,wallstreetbets,My comment regarded the use of the word clean to describe nuclear power.  Nice tangent though
2021-04-28 21:50:46,wallstreetbets,"Do you understand the word clean?  Which is cleaner: Solar or Nuclear?  

Look at the net solar power being produced worldwide and then tell me it isn't ""mass-producible""."
2021-04-28 21:55:07,wallstreetbets,"I’ll accept that. I’m personally fine with people calling it clean because I think nuclear is going to be pretty critical to a “green” power grid, because otherwise we’re gonna need a heck of a lot of batteries if we’re mainly relying on solar and wind. In comparison to what we have now, it’s pretty clean, and if calling it clean gets people over nuclear stigma I’m all for it."
2021-04-29 00:22:32,wallstreetbets,"Currently 2% of the world's energy is produced via solar. Maybe it's possible, idk how cost-efficient.. I just know that educated people vouch for nuclear.. It's a lot better for environment than ""clean"" coal - thanks obama"

(2) As a small player competing with bigger fish, that makes CLOV an attractive acquisition candidate at some point.

2021-04-29 09:29:42,wallstreetbets,"Rare earth metals are a totally different critter.  They aren’t rare at all, they’re just found in very low concentrations so processing is very costly.  Mosaic isn’t in that business nor are they in uranium mining.

Mosaic’s phosphate division makes DAP and MAP.  Do ammonium and monoammonium phosphate.  They have potassium or potash mines in Canada as well.  That’s it.  They’re strictly mining to produce Fertilizer products.

Prices may continue to go up, but prices in agriculture are always cyclical.  Farmers will change crops and or reduce what they plant as fertilizer prices rise.  Near term they may do well, but fertilizer for this year has already been purchased.  Earnings may be good, but guidance could move the stock more than earnings in either direction."

2021-04-29 10:32:09,wallstreetbets,"This isnt completely unheard of.  The bid/ask could have risen above your limit for a very short amount of time then gone back down quickly.  There could be a number of other orders ahead of you in line and not enough takers/buyers at that price to match the quantities being sold at that price.  Then the price went down below your limit and your order didnt get filled. 

With options you always need to look at the volumes.  Don’t buy any contracts that dont have ample open interest and active volume otherwise there is a much smaller market out there when you want to sell.  Secondly when selling you need to look at the quantities associated with bid/ask prices. If the ask has (for example) 100 contracts available for sale at that price but the bid only has 10 buyers at the bid price a lot of the asks wont get their price because supply is greatly outnumbering demand."

Bought a bunch of shares and will wait for the US to become the last western nation to legalize. 

You know after the pandemic the US needs is tax money and jobs which is what legalization provides. It also let's the cops and the courts free with no more wasting time on pot.

I can hold shares for years until the envitable legalization but do expect a tick up before the merger as Apha keeps trying to stay at 87% of TLRY stock price and it keeps rising accordingly. Let's hope anyway.

2021-04-28 20:29:20,wallstreetbets,"Realistically, if you're in it... sometime in the next 3mo or so, you should see anywhere between $20 - $10,000 depending if newbs like you HOLD the stock and don't get excited and sell.  If too many people get over exited and blow their load early, it hurts this for the rest of us.  If everyone holds for the true peak, then we all win.

And I say ""true peak"" because the hedge-funds/shorters out there will try to collude on faking a peak.  They'll let it drive up to $20 then short a bunch more to force it down.  If people have ""paper hands"" and see it drop from $20 to $18 and sell then it falls all the way down to $10.  If people have ""diamond hands"" and hold, then the hedge funds just dug themselves further into the hole and that powers us to climb to $100... every once in a while they will pick a point to make a stand and if we HOLD during those stands, we win."

And yes, this guy decided to sell 50,000 shares of his own company when he thought it shouldn't go up any more.

That was pre-$9.50

If you had an employee of your own company, who you brought in, who you gave a job to, who you pay good money in salary to, who you gave stock to, and he SOLD that stock because he didn't think it could go any higher, would you keep that guy around?

2021-04-28 21:27:00,wallstreetbets,"Ok I’m gonna ask super noob questions:

1. Where is the best place to see the actual earning reports? Is it best to find it from the actual companies website, possibly earlier than in a “google search” feed?

2. Where do you find the “expectations” to compare against? Actually...who even makes these? It’s just an average of various financial institutions, or where should I go to see what the actual legit expectations are?

3. Assuming company “A” beats said expectations, and may go up, generally how much time is there before a stock jumps, or vice versa? I never catch any actual report, I suppose I’m unprepared, but how much time does one generally have to put 1 and 2 together and buy a company who just smashed records?

4. Do big companies have leaks and know this info slightly before earnings reports? Or do they just have a couple people/teams per every stock ready to click buy/sell? Or do they use some proprietary software to pull earning info, compare against expectations, and buy/sell instantly?

Thanks and sorry for the noob Q’s, anyone input great appreciated. Thanks and good luck!😆"

There is a MAJOR difference, and if you didn't expect a post earnings dip I'm guessing you haven't been in MVIS very long."

My wife's boyfriend promised me a hug after I wash his Camaro, though..."
2021-04-29 15:09:00,wallstreetbets,I had the same experience. It was my only LSD trip and after years of anxiety it just sort of went away and hasn't come back. That was about 7 years ago.
2021-04-29 15:54:25,wallstreetbets,You can still wash his car

2021-04-29 11:09:10,wallstreetbets,"Yes... Well, more or less I would say. I would go into it but and it's nuanced and depending on who you talk to, you may get different answers, Not wildly different, but subtlety... However, there is a general understanding in the expert and non-expert community for how one would go about starting their psilocybin regiment for depression or other disorders. I suggest you research ""microdosing Psilocybin"" and ""psilocybin treatment for depression"" ""psilocybin treatment for PTSD""(I don't know if you have PTSD...But you are a vet, so I'm going to blindly assume you just might) Compass pathways (CMPS), [https://maps.org](https://maps.org)  and look up Dr. Robin Carhart Harris and Paul Stamets, oh and James Fadiman to start with...Also Check out [shroomery.org](https://shroomery.org). It may look like it was made in the 90's (well, it was, but they just keep it lookin that way cuz, I guess, if it ain't broke, don't fix it, lol), but you will be able to find out literally anything you would ever want to know about psilocybin (i.e., ""magic mushrooms"" case you aren't aware) by searching through the site or posting questions in the various forums they have. The people there are eager to help others... They and that site sure as hell helped me find what I needed to find/learn in order to \*I plead the fifth\* and I think I'm starting to feel better. Treatment resistant depression is a bitch, but we'll see how things are in the coming mounts... I have high hopes. 

&#x200B;

P.S. DO NOT take psychedelics if you are on anti-depressants like  SSRIs or lithium. It can lead to serotonin syndrome (witch is potentially fatal) and/or seizures (also possibly fatal). If you are on anti-depressants and (after you have done your research) you do decide that you think that psilocybin would be a better choice for you, talk with your doctor about what he thinks about you tapering of anti depressants completely. Even if psilocybin is it's illegal in your state (like it is in mine \[EVEN spores are illegal here, as well as in two other states. point being you can probably grown them yourself relatively safely"" [https://reliablespores.com/](https://reliablespores.com/)""\])  

Good luck, thanks for your service and I hope you feel better soon stranger."

2021-04-28 23:28:49,wallstreetbets,At least hold where it was. Definitely wouldn’t bet on $800 or $850 myself but PINS and MSFT dropped on great earnings as well. It defies common sense that a stock goes down when the company beats earnings estimates. I get there is a lot more to it but still.
2021-04-29 04:20:06,wallstreetbets,"Yes ‘beats earnings estimates’, but the issue is it simply isn’t big or fast enough to justify its jump over past year or so. Considering it only has a 1-2% market share and yet is bigger than all the other manufacturers put together twice over, investors need to see it doubling or tripling estimates every time to even get close to justifying that share price value in under a decade. So when it only just or even considerably beats them, it drops."

Mvis makes nothing. They make no money. It was a momentum play, when the momentum is done, it'll probably settle down around 15-20. Maybe we'll see another jump to 30 on Thursday, but I have a guy feeling people sell the news in Thursday. I'm not in on this also. Just here lurking on all the people who hold bags."
2021-04-29 06:54:33,wallstreetbets,"To each his own. I brought more MVIS @19.50 and I feel pretty good about it. I'm holding some and took some profit on both peaks. People said it wouldn't peak again, and yet it did just that to almost the same number. And guess what, it's probably going to happen again. So don't take any advice from me, I'm just a hustler turning coins into dollars while some of you retards are doing the opposite."

Cleanliness - yes and no - it’s up to the persons personal hygiene. When you’re first starting, and youre trying to get the hair to lock, you don’t want water in them really. Apart of it is the natural grease and dirt and other grease you put in there. When they are locked you can wash as much as you please. Even without locks I only wash my hair maybe once or twice a week depending on my activeness. Of course if I’m sweaty working out I’m going to wash them. There’s a bunch of different dread washes you can buy over the counter too at places like Sally’s, but the best places are black beauty stores/salons. 
I definitely suggest getting them done by someone that is experienced with them. They can start them off right and give tips. I only let one other person do my dreads over the 5 years I had them lol. 
I don’t think there’s any damage done. Unless they’re super heavy or not taken care of. My personal hypothesis is that The back of Busta Rhymes’ head is from heavy dreads for a long ass time. But I don’t have anything wrong with my head. Just t shirts with stains on the back from dread grease lol. The grease o suggest is Murray’s. It’s a bitch but it does the job lol. 
And to get rid of them - if your hair is fully locked, yes you have to cut down to where it isn’t, so most likely shaving the head unless to purposely grow it out and not dread it for a while. If you change your mind before they’ve locked, you can untangle them, but that would take a shit ton of time I assume."

Also his hair is super heavy. I always tell him he has enough hair for 3 heads. As much as I like them I don't think they would work well on his hair, scalp type. Thanks so much for the very detailed response."

2021-04-29 09:43:35,wallstreetbets,"Two things because this is a bit of a false equivalency with $TLRY/$APHA.        

First, what the weed companies can do is provide consistent quality and convenience. Yes, you can grow your own, and weed is easy to grow, but that doesn't mean you simply get a good product. The average person can easily grow tomatoes, but they don't because to get quality tomatoes you have to put a fair amount of effort in to developing them.        

Second, and this is more important for this/these stocks are the markets they're in, except for Canada, are markets where use is by prescription. The U.S. is something they're looking toward for the future, but it is not being counted on as the major driver of profits right now. $TLRY/$APHA has a huge worldwide footprint, and the strategic ownership of Sweetwater Brewing in the U.S. is designed assist as an entryway into this country when nationwide legalization happens."
2021-04-29 11:01:45,wallstreetbets,"Consistent quality, but that level of quality is awful. The reason it is awful is because of the pointless regulations. It's not possible to distribute quality cannabis nation wide, on one knows how to move it fast enough. Doesnt the fact that these companies dont care about the product concern you?

Tomatoes are worth pretty much nothing. You can buy a tomato for a buck and like you said, they take quite a bit of effort. If tomatoes cost you $10 each while a tomato plant can produce 400 tomatoes, then people would grow tomatoes. There are no models we can use for cannabis, it's just not similar to anything. The potential for bottom up disruption is huge.

If they are looking to the future, do you see developments which might hedge against regulation changes? What if some smart people get together and realize by changing the regulations the industry could be 20x more profitable. Then what? 

Eventually someone will figure it out, if it's not these 2 companies, then what? Any company that could produce and distribute cannabis before pre packaging ruins it will be wildly profitable. It's a technical issue, it will be solved eventually.

It all comes back to the industry being an infant, chances are what work for it now. Wont work when it matures."
2021-04-28 22:16:56,wallstreetbets,"Not true my friend, Sweetwater LLC already sells craft beer infused with thc in 24 US states. Manitoba harvest like wise sells medical stuff in 17 states"
2021-04-29 11:27:29,wallstreetbets,"You're referencing ""regulations"" without saying who's regulations you're talking about.       

Once again, anyone getting into $TLRY/$APHA as a U.S. play should have a long-term hold strategy because nationwide legalization is going to be a while. If they're interested in a company that has an international footprint in countries where the only legal weed is from medical prescriptions, this is the play.         

And I haven't heard any complaints about weed sold in Colorado, Washington, or California having problems in terms of quality and consistency. And if you don't think cannabis has an analogue is prohibition era alcohol, I don't know what else to say."
2021-04-28 22:39:33,wallstreetbets,"None of Sweetwaters beers have THC in them. And medical and recreational programs are very different beasts from a regulatory standpoint.

I’m not knocking Tilray/Aphria, I have a piece(albeit a small one) in both, but In my opinion Cura is the play if federal legalization is your catalyst. I have seen the ease with which they are capable of coming into a new marketplace and cornering that market. They have a great product, tons of cash, and a corporate structure that is as tight and well organized as any non cannabis company I’ve seen."
2021-04-29 13:26:10,wallstreetbets,"Regulations, to be universal apply to any cannabis regulations that are pointless. For instance where I am the code says you must grow on a concrete floor... that's dumb. The product is now more expensive for no practical reason. Basically weed cant kill you unless a bail falls on you. You could produce better quality, more profitable product without the BS. No one died because the plant didnt grow on concrete before legalization.

If legalization is going to be a while, and you dont know what the rules will be. How do you know these companies will still be profitable? We saw lots of companies fail as the rules for legalization got sorted out here. Shifting from medical to recreational isnt easy, changing how you operate to comply with stupid rules isnt easy.

Sorry, too many differences between alcohol and cannabis. Again, there is no model we can adapt to cannabis, it's an entirely unique product. Something you can grow for a few hundred dollars which yeilds 10x as much in 6 months with youtube. If you can bake a cake, you can grow top shelf chronic. The bottom up disruption from brewing alcohol is not comparable.

... just go buy some. Even the $15/g stuff is awful. If you haven't noticed the drop in quality since pre packaging started well, I guess it's fine right? I'm going to guess you also think %18 thc bud is worth more than 15%. Just look at how bud should be dried and cured, then realize the rules actually prevent this from happening. It's not a small part of the process, curing can make or break quality smoke.

Like I said before, there are many, many technical issue they need to solve. All of them are solved by local producers selling to the locals."

2021-04-29 06:44:11,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been holding AMZN for 20 years also. It has been quite a ride. My brokerage has asked me repeatedly to sell it and diversify since AMZN is now an outsized portion of my portfolio. I keep coming back to the same thing: “if you could show me any other companies with more potential upside and less potential downside, I would consider it, but until you can do that, I see no better investment than leaving AMZN alone right now. So with the potential for a split as much as 10:1 and a big earnings beat, AMZN could skyrocket over the coming months towards 5000. A split could also land AMZN in the Dow 30, and if that happens, index funds will pick up even more shares, and retail investors will be able to afford shares and options again, so the upside potential is huge right now. All eyes on market close today, for sure."

Go check out the court case between Apple and fortnite. Platforms like apple, Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo don't have to allow third-party platforms to sell digitally, for security measures.

2021-04-28 20:56:54,wallstreetbets,Tbh I don't think it's going that low ever again. People are too used to seeing it $150+. Market psychology has it's say. But this is not assuming any market shenanigans.

2021-04-29 15:36:23,wallstreetbets,Its funny because i was looking at options for them that evening and decided to wait a bit instead. I'm short cash right now with everything loaded into commodities and miners.
2021-04-28 23:53:00,wallstreetbets,"It's a measure of a few things.  One of the more notable things is past performance as you say.  However, now that we are in a world where meme stocks are a thing it's important to know what makes a stock easy to manipulate.  It's unlikely that we get a gamma squeeze if the price of option contracts are very expensive.  Therefore, it would most likely occur when options are cheap and IV is therefore a future indicator of a gamma squeeze or the ability to apply some gamma pressure.  When GME stock got to $325 the cost of a option contract was $100+ with a $325 strike.  That basically told you it was way too expensive for the retail masses to continue applying pressure b/c they could only afford far out of the money contracts at $800.  IV and the option contract price was a very good predictor of the future."

Doesn’t seem to grasp the basic idea that a speculative company is already heavily discounted off future potential earnings in the market therefore any investment at this time is a wager on how the next 3-5 years play out, which includes a tremendous upside for those willing to take the risk in a company that has already begun the process of de-bulking risk"

2021-04-28 23:26:39,wallstreetbets,"You don't realize a simple engineering notion: Hydrogen can be produced on location by [electrolysis](https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-production-electrolysis) from solar power, and this isn't for cars. 

Industrial vehicles and long distance shipping vehicles either need to be designed around massive, expensive batteries that are hot swappable, or they can use generators to power a smaller battery. Regardless of your approach, you're going to have to build out a network of locations that serve those kinds of vehicles.

Making hydrogen isn't as energy efficient as charging a battery, but the efficiency is improving faster than batteries are shrinking, solar is getting cheaper, it refuels as quickly as gas, and it weighs a lot fucking less."
2021-04-28 23:36:40,wallstreetbets,"There may be a corner case for hydrogen vehicles for defined routes and large cargo or specialized vehicles. These are niche products that will be difficult to scale. I’d be reluctant to invest in something facing such headwinds. 
Also Nikola has been caught lying and scamming investors repeatedly. Even if you believe in hydrogen as a mode of propulsion I don’t believe Nikola will be the company to implement it. 
Lastly all the prototypes we’ve seen from Nikola have been either slow moving unloaded Iveco trucks or that other one that rolled down a hill. I strongly suspect the drive train on those prototypes can’t handle a payload nor a high speed which is why all the demos have been in a closed circuit"
2021-04-28 23:42:32,wallstreetbets,"For shipping, it's either going to be:

* hydrogen
* cheaper, lighter batteries that charge faster
* diesel

Right now we're using diesel. If someone comes up with that battery tech, I'll invest heavily. Elon isn't making semis right now because he can't meet battery demand for consumer vehicles (and they'd take a day to charge on a supercharger)."

2021-04-29 09:37:20,wallstreetbets,"This was my immediate reaction to seeing his 1-2-3-4-5 thesis too. Also, his “consolidation” period included... two of the Elliot wave episodes from his examples. It’s like he went from linear to logarithmic and expected the same mathematical mapping to apply.

That said... this is going to sound like such a hippie cop-out, but technically isn’t all money and all valuations artificial? The ‘29 crash was in part a reaction of the London stock exchange going down. The dot com burst was partly a reaction to the Japanese recession. External forces shape the market probably more often than internal forces. The recent recession took a dive because people expected it to. 

All that being said... the case could still be made that we are still in wave 3 and the next correction will be a “natural” wave 4, followed by another bull run. Or, pumping 1/3 of all money in one year might have just fucked with all natural models."

My girlfriend doesn’t enjoy meat (not fully vegan but chooses vegan over animal product 90% of the time). She shops exclusively at Trader Joe’s and brings home all these “Trader Joe’s Brand” meatless meals and they’re pretty damn good. I love meat and won’t give it up, but their meatless alternative taste good/are satisfying for a meateater. I would guess there is a decent size target market for people like us who buy more meatless options than meat options and the space is wildly underserved. TTCF is an easy buy."
