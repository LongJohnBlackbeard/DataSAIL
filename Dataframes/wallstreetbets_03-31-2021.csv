03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Recent events?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Decent earnings call, more stable price movement, raised analyst price target, new hires, etc."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"My coworker was mentioning this IPO- he stated he used them in the past to learn different topics. When I asked if he still used the site he said no. When I asked why he shrugged and said he lost interest.

Does anyone know what their user retention rate is?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh no shit! I used them back in 2017. IMHO opinion, I think this company could go way far. Online degrees that are actually accessible to everyday retards like me? Hell yeah, I like that.

Be me, 5 years in school full time maybe looking at finishing 2 associate degrees (EET/Lib art eng transfer) by NEXT year. 

This is awesome shit, def support."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You see Coursera was massive in early 2010s. The courses were mostly free from top universities.

Then many MOOC providers entered the market and will continue to do so, both mainstream unis and independent course providers.

So not sure if Coursera's value will skyrocket in the future. 

I myself was a strong user of Coursera from 2014. Nowadays, I just watch Youtube, go to Udemy or EdX etc"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"they also go over lot of the issues with their model in their disclosure. They are on the expensive side with their degree online, also most of the increase in revenue this term was from Covid (black swan event). Can this be sustained, they have 6B evaluation. I like the stock and model, its better than lot of tuition/tutor centre from china, but comes with some risks ?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not that this really affects your DD, but I can't stand their website UI. It's the worst."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What certificate did you get?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn't this another company owned by Google or am I thinking of a different training company called Coursera?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fun fact, in Googling to try to find their retention rate, I found a course they have on retention rates üòÇ

https://www.coursera.org/lecture/wharton-capstone/customer-retention-18-24-Htlpf

I did not find a number to report for retention. I found 84% for ‚Äúcommitted‚Äù people but I‚Äôm not sure what that means. Maybe after you pay to enroll, 84% of people finish the course? The money is spent either way so I expect it encourages completion in that case.

I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for though, I think what you want is ‚Äúhow many people come back after using it?‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know that number. My guess would be that many people use it to achieve their goal and then go away until the next need comes up. Maybe that‚Äôs a year or so later, or maybe a few months."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think the main competitors are probably Udemg or EdX. I don‚Äôt know much about EdX to be fair.

My hypothesis is that demand will stick (personal and corporate) after a slight drop when covid ends. Just like companies moving to remote/hybrid environments.

What I think will make Coursera a strong play is their marketing. They‚Äôre actually pretty strong in this area. They‚Äôve got the big names to throw around as content partners (Yale, Stanford, Google, Boston Consulting Group, IBM, Carnegie Melon, Columbia, Duke, John‚Äôs Hopkins, the list goes on).

https://www.coursera.org/about/partners

Edit:

YouTube - I use a lot for learning a quick thing around the house. But if I‚Äôm learning a professional skill, I want a certificate I can show my employer and put on my LinkedIn to attract recruiters."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am speculating here. My position is that this area has a lot of ‚Äúpull someone in, get interest for a course or two, then they leave.‚Äù Most people just aren‚Äôt life long learners.

So, the people come in, pay for a course or two, then leave. And then the next time they have a need, they come back.

I would expect cyclical engagement rates.

On the big money side, my position is that companies are recognizing that remote works (support: see the number of companies transitioning to remote/hybrid setups permanently). I think a lot of training budgets will follow when executives see they can keep paying for remote courses and cut out the hotel, airfare, meal bills they‚Äôd otherwise be paying.

Lastly, an unlimited corporate license is way cheaper than paying for conferences. The street price is like $400. Can‚Äôt attend a good conference for under $3K or so after conference cost, airfare, taxi, and per diem."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha! I am not a UI person so cannot comment. I actually enjoyed using the mobile app to scroll through and find interesting courses when I was enrolling.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Won‚Äôt name the specific one for anonymity reasons. It was from a top US school (considered better than the one I attended for my undergrad degree). It pushed me pretty hard and was fun learning. Some sessions were done on my phone for lectures (like watching a good YouTube video and taking quizzes) and some were on a computer (graded assignments). My honest assessment is that it was on par with the courses I took in college - though that has been a while.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think that‚Äôs a different one. $COURS was founded in 2012 by Stanford University professors.

According to CNBC ""more than 150 universities offered upwards of 4,000 courses through Coursera, which features over two dozen degree programs at prices that are lower than many in-person school offerings.""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coursera"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't worry, OP's big words confused me. I bought CRSR"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's the thing. Coursera are not the only MOOC platform that offer courses from top universities. EdX and many other MOOC platform also offer courses from top tier universities.

So there's kind of a parity. Can't really see how Coursera will be able to offer much better value in the future.

Side note: EdX offers MicroMasters, MicroBachelors, Bachelors and Masters programs."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I seem to remember back in 2018 these certification courses from Google.   The website was corsera.google.com.  that doesn't work anymore.  I was just wondering if this was the same company that Google was backing and in return was having them run all these different certifications through their systems.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It may be, I am not certain. I know Google is a partner who provides certificate for their Google Cloud Computing Platform - but there are tons of providers doing that (IBM, RedHat, AWS, etc).

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because they are about to announce best in class lidar, which will make them more valuable than LAZR, 8billion market cap. Mvis has dozens of other patents, plus the hololens and picoP verticals, and LAZR has bulky weak lidar. That‚Äôs it."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I really don't understand the RKT vs UWMC comparison. I just bought 100 more shares of UWMC in addition to another 60 shares of RKT today.  


Owing some kind of allegiance to any single company is inherently a dumb fucking idea. We're not here for turf wars, we're here to take risks and gamble our money. Personally, I couldn't fucking care less which company makes me gains and, ideally, if the industry itself does well - which *it likely will for the next 2 years at least* \- you come out ahead regardless.  


If you ignore the RKT comparison. Currently, UWMC is trading near its all-time low. At under $8.00/share it's a steal that anyone should be happy to get in on since buying it today is equal to buying it before it's run above-$12 back in January. If it drops any lower, it just makes averaging down from sub-$8 that much easier because you can just buy more. The company isn't going to go bankrupt and there is plenty of opportunities for it to run again.  


Shares or longer-term options (past august) would be the play. Personally, I'll be picking up more of mine tomorrow."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Also J.P. Morgan bought 340 mil of the note offering they just did

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Hi fellow investors

Sir, this is a casino"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the biggest position I've ever taken. 1980 shares at an average of $9.90. Seeing the -20ish% has got my butthole itching.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hodler of both RKT and UWMC here.
All this either 'this or that company' nonsense is just pack mentality. Personally, I believe both companies have enough room to grow. One of the above comments mentions the housing situation. Yes, it is true that last year was the peak and nowadays it has slowed down a bit. But we cannot not factor in the immensely high demand for houses, yet there being limited supply (in terms of material to build houses, and then the houses themselves). And the mere fact that there are more retail estate agents in the U.S. than actual properties to be sold. Right now, there is a demand for houses. Yet, also not too many people are in a hurry to get houses now because...well, rules of economics. Demand is high, supply is low = price goes up. Hence, most people are willing to wait (unless they really need a house). Again, this is not DD, but an honest rational look at the situation.
Hence, it will take time till UWMC and RKT both take off big.

Now, I do agree that UWMC is way undervalued. I‚Äôm not saying that it should be around RKT price (although, if the companies are both dealing in the same industry, logic says that hey should be priced around the same ballpark....but in the market, who cares about logic?)
It would be nice to see the price of the UWMC go above $10-$12. At least it would be half of what RKT is now. Both companies have good financial reports, and I believe both companies are a great companion competitive companion to each other.
My 5 cents...and it‚Äôs ok if you don‚Äôt care.
To all the üíéüëêüèº of both - I salute you! Keep holding, keep investing, and we will rocket. Not financial advice. Just retail tradape."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why did you spend the first paragraph explaining how much 10% is lol. 10% is 10% is 10%, no need to multiply it by the public shares and then compare to the public shares"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I hold both RKT and UWMC. I sell cc on both. I‚Äôm currently bag holding RKT @ 38 and see a very long road to recovery. I‚Äôm in UWMC at 8.30 and it‚Äôs paying off much better with ccs since it should bounce between 10-11 based it‚Äôs prices before the craze of 2021. I like the stock.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"UWMC is the way üöÄ short volume has been keeping this low, after dividend reinvestment, then blow out earnings. You could see a very nice 45% move to the upside."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"TLDR. My 4/16 $10 calls going to print, or no?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,There is no way that this stock is priced 7 bucks. its severely undervalued. this stock should be above $12-$15
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Guys it‚Äôs not hard. 

1. Low supply of houses = bad for number of mortgage applications 

2. Interest rates going up = bad for number of mortgage applications

There is a reason the short interest is so high. We hit peak housing autism last year, and things are going the other direction now. This is not a growth company, because this is not a growth business. For it to grow, we need more people able to buy a home. Are more middle class and upper middle class people being minted that can afford homes? You don‚Äôt want your money here, because there‚Äôs none to be made. It is a profitable business that will have good and bad years, and will never take off like growth stocks can."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Why do you like this stock over Rocket? Doesn't RKT have the bigger share of the market?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This sub is going to collectively lose so much money playing RKT and UWMC.

I'm in RKT right now but mainly because it had a cooler name."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think this is the first time in the history of my reddit I downvote a DD about a stock I own..

Your argument is ""we are in a bearish market, and 10% short interest is high"" Yet the indices are near all time highs, S&p hit an all time high today .. We are in the mother of all bull markets with a huge ass bubble ...  and ""10% short interest is completely normal"" ..

Also high short interest means the company is shit! It's not a good thing! GME was a very particular case whrere there was potential to turn it around .. Look at the list of highly shorted stocks, they are complete garbage

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck this company. I try to say it every (day) time this dogshit gets posted. All this company has going for it is that it makes a lot of money now. There is no growth thesis. The housing market is at all time highs with all time low rates. There are lots of disrupters entering the market. Whoever here thinks the business climate for uwmc will be improved 2 years from now raise your retarded hand.

There‚Äôs speculation that their cutting out brokers by either stealing their customers when the customer calls RKT instead of their broker (where good businesses refer the customer back to their broker such as UWMC) and also are trying to get real estate agents to get there brokers license to deal with them directly. (Cut out brokers and Increase refi sales). They have two channels retailer direct to RKT, and wholesaler. Their biggest ROI and business as a whole is predominantly retail with Refi. They‚Äôre only benefiting right now because of the low inflation rate and low interest rate. Once inflation and interest rates go up, RKT will be hit hard."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro you‚Äôre so wrong it‚Äôs not even funny. Having a high interest can mean two things either positive or negative sentiment. Negative as in a stock has a high interest because a lot of shorts think it will fail, or a stock just has a high short interest and could be positive sentiments because it can indicate that the stock price is very undervalued with a low P/E ratio in comparison to the market. Guess what? UWMC has great fundamentals, is undervalued, and has a low P/E ratio. FYI the short interest mention was just to explain ‚Äúa‚Äù factor to why the price is stuck at $7.80 - $8 range.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Replying to my own comment like a weirdo. ‚ÄúRKT hit hard‚Äù I mean there profits and sales will be affected due to inflation and interest rates increasing more then wholesalers. Wholesalers actually make more money when interest rates goes up because they can provide better rates then retail lenders such as RKT. Also, UWMC is the largest whole sale lender in America with a market share of 34%. Everyone needs to chill with this RKT vs UWMC there both great companies."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Mfw yahoo trolls you. So they pull dow volume into DJI... the fuck.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"But he still has a point. A sell off of that volume in the DJI, in that short period of time, has never happened. It's not close, either. Zoom out and it's clear something's fucky. Comparing avg volume of DOW to DJI is pretty smooth brain, but the point he's making still stands."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"https://i.imgur.com/1rcqze1.jpg

That‚Äôs yahoo volume for today...

~~I think you‚Äôre lying.~~

Edit he wasn‚Äôt lying fucking yahoo were my sides."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Am I also retarded? Yes.

But looking at DJI on yahoo his average volume and today's volume seems to line up. What am I missing here??

[Yahoo DJI](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EDJI/)

EDIT: Well late to the game here it seems, phone doesnt like to refresh the comments I guess... but also looking at Webull I dont see a daily avg listed"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It says av volume is 4M. You think average daily volume is 400M?! Lol you think it fluctuates trillions of dollars every day?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! 2 hours
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is being shot to the top by retards, and awarded. And he's comparing two different tickers. I don't even know how you can possibly get the average volume of one ticker and the daily volume of another ticker without realizing it. Like you have to type in two different tickers to get the info he got."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Because it‚Äôs wildly fucking retarded even for our standards.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Every day's volume on yahoo finance appears to be parsed incorrectly. They're all rounded to the nearest hundred, and every single day is 100x less than what the daily volume is in webull. The 8.118 million day you're referring to is showing as 811.8 million in webull"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yahoo (or OP) ate too many markers. Investing.com has it as 418638143 today (or 420M) and 406215875 (or 410M) as the average daily over the last 3 months. Higher, yes but not crazily so. DOW (the stock) has an average volume of 4427536 (or 4.4M)."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"That happens quarterly correct? Over the past year, the next highest volume is ONLY **8.1 million** so that theory does not add up at all

Edit: yahoo has incorrect historical data"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Bruh.. They rebalanced more than 10x what have been traded any whole week since 20 years in one day?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Isnt it to be tomorrow, 31st March?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't understand the correlation. This seems like something else much bigger. Another hedge fund being liquidated in my opinion. Do OTC stock blocks being sold show as part of the volume or not?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,all i saw was crazy price creep. seemed stable though. what happened?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Those bean counters are not fucking around these days
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy shit write on the wall that way people don't ruin my math when stepping on it. I truly love how much I learn in this sub
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"ya, we are"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone who watches the US equity markets would instinctively know it is unlikely that only 4 million shares of the 30 companies in the DJIA are traded daily.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes it seems that the historical data tab on Yahoo Finance is fucked up. So OP may be off the hook for this one.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes this.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fwlhx5/interpreting_dji_volume_indicators_yesterday_apr_6

sounds familiar?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Webull's DJI chart showing volume every day 300-400 million so idk where anyone's getting this other information
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait so AAPL stock has an average daily volume of roughly 109 million. AAPL is part of the DJI. You‚Äôre seriously trying to suggest that AAPL has 25x the volume of the entire index it‚Äôs listed on? Have you thought this through?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Honesty don't know how he made a post this long with graphs and everything without noticing he mixed his crayons up in the wrong boxes.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Except he‚Äôs wrong. Unless every site is currently wrongly reporting today‚Äôs volume.

Edit the websites were reporting the wrong shit topkek"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, they're not. They're just rounding the volume incorrectly. Multiply the volume every day by 100x to get the true volume"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, it doesn't."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, the volume is correct. The average volume for DJI is 400M. He is comparing it to the average volume of DOW, which is 4M."

I don't think he's comparing 2 different tickers"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I wasn‚Äôt. The websites themselves are fucking up and reporting historic data incorrectly. Top kek.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,He might be mentioning two different tickets and we can all point and laugh. But it‚Äôs better to do your own research. Check DJI for yourself his numbers are corrode he‚Äôs just got the ticker mixed up in the post.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yahoo been eating the 64 pack. Historical data tab is all wrong lol
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,There has been plenty of DD on shorted stocks being hidden in etfs.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You belong here.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Today is March 31st
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It's the 31st March today.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Marry me please
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh come on, don‚Äôt downvote him that shits hilarious"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,A day late and a dollar short?üòÖ
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Volumes were showing trilions üòÇ I guess they fixed it now!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but this was the DJI ticker I don‚Äôt know how much of that is traded a day do I... I see simple data like volume I assume it‚Äôs correct.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"$450 million is equivalent to 15k in volume, even if the same thing happened this is on an extreme scale"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The Yahoo Finance chart shows historical data never really going above 8-9M the last five years, so maybe they ingested the data wrong?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not suggesting shit, just pointing out how OP's mistake is not on his end. I think I figured out what's probably going on (Yahoo is pulling in DOW's historical volume for DJI or rounding incorrectly)."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Does the daily volume of an index represent the trades made of that index or the trades made of the stocks within it??
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only it's not a problem of typing up a different ticker, it happens also on the historical data on Yahoo:

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EDJI/history?p=%5EDJI](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EDJI/history?p=%5EDJI)

So if anything, Yahoo and other brokers started parsing wrong data."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Seems like intentional joke

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Today's volume is correct. The average volume is not. The actual average volume is around 400M. Unless brokerages are currently multiplying all historical volume by 100 on it. Yahoo fucked ya.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didn't actually check for myself just read your post. And then the plot gets even fuckin thicker with the websites being wrong! This was a wonderful saga, so many twists! 69/69 stars"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs all under the DJI ticker though. So this is just a rofl glitch
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I laughed a good belly laugh at this ü§£
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,April fools
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol, so it is üòÜ"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, yeah. Havent you seen a retard before? üôÇ"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,">Yeah but this was the DJI ticker I don‚Äôt know how much of that is traded a day

The DJI ticker is *not* traded; so any time you see volume for DJIA it is referring to the aggregate volume of the 30 components."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Webull shows basically 100x the volume that yahoo finance is showing. Every single day is either almost exactly 100x or off by .02 million or so. Also yahoo finance has every day's volume rounded to the nearest 100 so it looks like a coding error
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If one were to pause before posting this and think for like... 3 seconds... to seriously consider the idea that there‚Äôs only 4 million shares traded daily on Dow Jones stocks when just a single component, 1 out of 30, has an average volume of over 100 million shares traded daily, this shit show could be avoided."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You don‚Äôt trade an index. It tracks the price movements of its constituent parts. 

Jesus what the fuck are you people doing playing with stocks if you don‚Äôt even know what a fucking index is????"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait you're not supposed to eat the grape one.  Fuck I was wondering why I kept shitting out a purple candle.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah my bad. Other sites had the same for DJI - showing 400m volume 4m average ... and they call us retards when they can‚Äôt even parse data properly.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,But today's volume on the DOW was 3.6M but that historical tab shows 420M lol. Someone else pointed out the historical data prior to today is all divided by 100. So they fucked up pulling it in.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,To autist or not to autist
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,im glad i was here for this
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Where do you see avg volume for DJI on webull? I dont see it just today's volume...
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mixed up index with etf, thanks for pointing out the difference for me. [oh and fuck you 2](https://youtu.be/F380CP_6a8w)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bought 500 $1.5 p on \^TNX, its on margin, do you think they'll print?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,The way I invest this chart is fine makes as much sense as anything I know about the market I can‚Äôt even read.  I am paying a 7 year old to dictate this now.  When I‚Äôm rich I‚Äôm hiring this cat to do all my investments and I‚Äôll be able to afford a hot tutor to teach me to read
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes I'm in exactly the same boat my phone has a picture on it that looks like corn and when I click it I can talk into my phone and then just post my words and then there's another way to make it read things to me so I don't even need to actually look at the phone
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Got my cost basis to about 10, but I'm adding slowly. I also bought a 4/16 $9 call. I'm small time."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Waste not. Truly a retard pirape
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is that you, Captain Barbossa?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What's this brokerage?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"So uh, are my Jan 2022 $12.50 calls just fucked then?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"$12.75 a share for BB isn't that crazy. Assuming you keep lowering it via CCs, you'll be fine by summer. This isn't loss porn. Wtf wsb."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,this is the perfect time to buy jan 2023 options in my opinion.  i just bought a 10c to go with my 3 4c's i bought in early december. also bought a couple 9c's for this friday just incase we have a quick  bounce back
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is WSB, long term hold folks are over at r/investing."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Flair me mods. I'm the captain of the BB pirates.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,eTrade
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd buy them for a dollar.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I payed $13.08 and fortunately I have made about 20k so far from selling CCs. I just hope we find a bottom soon,"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Bruh I got 650 shares at 10.50 which calls should I sell
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have a feeling BB still has room to fall.  I hope I'm wrong but for the time being, its pure theta farming for me aside from a few month-old yolos that are pretty much worthless already."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Hope you will be able to make 32x without longterm hold at least once in your life
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,So your effective cost keeps going down. You took off .34 a share this week and can do that next week. This isn't loss porn until you sell
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What are you selling that you made 20 k wtf
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Up to 6 $11 strike or higher weekly calls. It's called cover calls. It's a passive way of making money. It's boomer shit by wsb terms. You can sell $20 strike every week and make chump change if you're actually long on BB and wouldnt want to sell for less.

Say you get .10 in credit per contract for $20 strike, if it moonshots one week and you get assigned. You'll be selling 100@ 20 so making 20 - 10.50 + 0.10(already recieved), or 9.60. Really .10 today and 9.5 when assigned. .10 is probably way more than those calls sell for but it's meme stonk so wouldn't be surprised if it was actually more.

Seperately, you can also sell calls against your current calls via calander debit spreads known as poor man's covered calls."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs what my 401K is for. Cash account is for weekly 10 baggers, or bust."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"A CC in this context stands for covered call.  Its an options contract that give whoever buys it the right, but not the obligation, to buy from me my shares of BB  at an agreed upon price and future date.  In return for providing this valuable service the the buyer, they pay me a fee, called a premium.  I've been doing this every week for the past two months and have made an average of about $2500 a week so far."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would you sell a strike that's over 100% OTM? BB's moonshot days are long over.  Just sell the $11 strike.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just giving an example. Selling 6 $11 strike and having it get memed to 15 would suck. 

A passive way would just be selling quarterly 20 strike calls."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,That jump today was juicy. I‚Äôm holding shares at a $3.21 average and April $19 calls that have been bleeding for a month and a half. The news today is the catalyst we‚Äôve been waiting for. MVIS to the moon üöÄ
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice dude. I bought MVIS when it was at $2/share. Wish I‚Äôd held a little longer
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Great freakin day!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you selling covered calls? I definitely would if I was holding that many shares
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,But did you sell?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let's get something straight... a YOLO is not a YOLO if you don't lose money by ""investing"" in the stock. Buy some Weeklies ending next week or the week after with a strike 10-15 points out... thats a YOLO... GTFOH with buying shares and saying ""YOLO""!!

PS:... just had 414 contracts expire for $IWM 185 STRIKE. $20K out the window.... that's a YOLO.

PSS: also made 90K with 120 contracts on $BBBY....."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Seriously. I don‚Äôt know how it hasn‚Äôt become a WSB meme stock yet. I think if AMC/GME/BB etc... weren‚Äôt taking up 99% of the discussion on here it would be.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,MVIS technically isn‚Äôt the supplier MVIS owns the display engine for the Hololense. But regardless it shows how massive the potential here is for MVIS and this isn‚Äôt even its most valuable vertical.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I posted a DD on MVIS a week ago and an update today. It summarizes a lot of the MVIS chatter if you're interested in a semi-TLDR.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is a monster stock. This military contract is just the tip of the iceberg. Their best-in-class automotive LiDAR A-sample will be complete in April and all signs point to a buyout already being negotiated with Google for the Auto Lidar vertical and possibly Microsoft for the AR divisions, there could be a bidding war soon unless a deal has already been inked. CEO Sumit Sharma used to be Director of Google Glass. BOD Mark Spitzer has ties to Google. Judy Curran was appointed to the BOD a few months ago, she‚Äôs a major power player in autonomous driving with deep ties to Ford (Ford and Google have a strategic partnership). The newest BOD, Seval Oz, is a major power player in autonomous driving with major ties to Google.  Seval Oz has been on the board for the last month and has not filed a Form 3 or 4 with the SEC yet. The only logical reason for her not doing so is if she is being compensated by the acquiring company (Google). Several BoD‚Äôs have stepped down in recent months (to make room for the new appointees) and have not sold their stock.

Whatever happens the next few days, weeks, or months, the following are undeniable dots.

Edit: STEVE HOLT/CFO exercised his options to buy shares at $17/share a few weeks ago... very interesting that he would choose that time to exercise them... this is BAFF.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol @ those seriously asking about MVIS on the basis of a measly Hololens contract...you have no idea the potential this baby has!!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,MOON SOON!!!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,News dropped earlier today and the price already rose 51% today. Not that it can't go higher but I'm not sure I'd go chasing it.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôd say it already went pretty high today

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,People that aren‚Äôt in just need to buy the dips. This company has massive potential
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is not the big news shareholders have been waiting for. The Lidar for autonomous driving coming is the major catalyst.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This wasn‚Äôt even the news we are waiting for. This was a secondary vertical that popped today. Wait until the Lidar news is out. That‚Äôs the news you want to sell.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Not one made public. But I also think they‚Äôre showing multiple parties this month which is why the date is ambiguous.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you! Not sure how to tag/ link to a subreddit
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes agreed but OP seemed to be specifically relating his move to this news, which might catch them in the middle. The Lidar news could definitely drive this higher, but it would be unlikely that the completion of this contract would cause it to go up a second time. Other items would continue to drive price"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I just typed it down and then it popped up for me automatically
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Were you on a call when you took this screenshot? lol

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Discb went all gme on us
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I suggest to approach with caution. My calls for viac belong to IV now. He took em from me. Legit walked up and said ‚Äúgimme my calls pussy‚Äù but it‚Äôs alright cause I got mind control over em
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,DISCO on DISCA üï∫
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought some 4/16 calls on $VIAC. Hope you‚Äôre right! Any thoughts on VIACA and if that might swing like we saw with DISCB today?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"My question is what makes these stocks worth more than what they were before the recent spike? Discovery was around 30 pre pandemic, and in the 20 post pandemic. Disca is back to were it was Feb 1st.

Viacom is close to prepandemic level, but has streaming platform that may raise it's value. Not sure why disca is worth a lot more than prepandemic though."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,VIAC may be next. Loading up
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm with you brother.  Apparently I shoulda bought DISCB but I‚Äôm in DISCA
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,bought into disca after seeing the wild action in discb..whats that about?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I see that it dropped based on the margin call.. but it also looks like multiple companies gave them a downgrade:  


 ViacomCBS was downgraded to underweight from equal weight with a $59 price target, down from its previous $82 per share target. Viacom shares were falling 14.2% to $56.91¬†Friday.¬†

Meanwhile, Discovery was downgraded to equal weight from overweight and its price target was lowered to $59 per share from $65 per share. Discovery shares were down 21.9% to $45.13 Friday**.**¬†  


Could be a great 50% discount.. or it could just be normalizing at a correct price."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You have to factor in how much of that growth spike was because of Tiger cub buying up the stock.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Already made a cool $1k from what I threw at discb. Dunno how I feel about disca
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,it looks like its just returning to where it was
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought the drop on disc will double in a month. Easy money.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The are 160 million outstanding shares of DISCA. That will hard to influence with buys with so much cushion. DISCB only had 6.1 million with a very small float, which is why it went up so high and so quickly. If we want something that has. Popped out of this liquidation, we should be looking at VIACA. VIACA has 52 million shares outstanding, but only 10.1 million of that is float. It would a much easier to influence the price of this float than either DISCA or VIAC."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The real play here for free money is calls on DISCA and puts on DISCB until they normalize their price ratios again.  You don't know whether A will go up or B will go down, but you know ONE of those two things is definitely happening.  Bet on both with light leverage (options), and your gains will outpace your losses."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it's so easy money people would be all over it by today.

There is catch and you did not cover that."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah that‚Äôs exactly what I thought of when I seen it lol
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"VIACA would be a faster to influence, because of the low amount of outstanding shares and float. VIAC has 502 million outstanding shares, so it would be harder for us to influence share price because there is so much buffer with a large amount of shares. VIACA only has 52 million outstanding and a float of 10.1 million. You can equate this to GME vs AMC, where GME had 56 million shares and AMC had 400 million. GME mooned because it was easier to buy up the shares."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Very much a possibility since that squeeze happened with discab but I wouldn‚Äôt go all in on it maybe a small position on it
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Do what you will with this information but the version of VIAC looks like VIACP. VIACA still has options and looks relatively large.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,DISCA launched Discovery+ in Q4
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,VIAC also had Sumner Redstone pass away last year. Many say he held the stock back for decades.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Because it has a much smaller float so it doesn't take much volume to get price spikes
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah reversion to the mean depends on how long we're counting.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly easy money to be made on calls and shares
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice input bro
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,plot twist: OP is selling calls and is OK with shares getting assigned
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey man if you don‚Äôt want money then don‚Äôt do it
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets, 20% from portfolio poured into calls. Does it count as small or (almost) YOLO? :-)
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got that, but who‚Äôs buying?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you Archegos and Mr Hwang for getting a margin call. .

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh here we go again.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,These are always misleading because you can draw all sorts of shapes given the window of time. Zoom out or in and it looks different
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You've got reality leaking out of your triangle, bruh."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Technicals and GME does not match well b'cus it is not normal buying and selling, 20MA, 200MA, wedges, c&h means nothing to diamond hands, they only know holding. GME is a HF made beast with a haunting attitude to get back to it's creators.

EDIT: Nothing wrong if it does breakout from the wedge as you plotted it. It probably will too because we all know where it is heading to."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,WHEN IT GETS TO THE TIP IT TENDS TO üí• SPLODE üí• UPWARDS PRETTY VIOLENTLY AFTER BEING TEASED THAT LONG!! JUST SAYING!! üòè üöÄüöÄüöÄ
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Everyday is a breakout, and tomorrow is always the squeeze."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"if these firms are running out if money because they covered the shorts with money that doesnt exist, they cant afford to place the buy orders that run the price up.  if you want to see that money, you need to hold long enough for them to find the money, everyone does.  thats the play."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Indicators aren‚Äôt to indicate you. They‚Äôre a way of communicating to the masses what‚Äôs about to happen. When a break out is identified the bears lose interest so they stop pushing it down and bulls take over. So if you‚Äôre a bull you know you have backup with indicators.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"These aren't even lines drawn to match after-the-fact, these lines don't even fit as-is. There are dildos poking out either side."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Just the tip?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn you GME! You either fall back to $40 so everyone can triple down or  üöÄ to my anus....I mean Uranus.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yawn. I wish I had a dollar every time someone posted a chart and said, 'This is it!!!!'"

BUY and HODL is the thesis. I can be patient, even if my triangles sometimes fail to perform."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,i will always downvote all GME's technical analysis.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,No lines matter hedge funds are controlling this we just wait until they concede
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt think standard patters matter with this stock.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean... I want GME to moon as much as anybody does. But maybe break $200 and stay there? Seems to struggle mightily at $198+
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm convinced you all just draw random lines on charts and call it bullish.

Nope, shady people are shady because they don't like the light, let alone spotlights.  Gme hasn't really dipped because of this as well."

You just can't apply ordinary analysis to a stock which can see up and downwards push of 100 points per day, better just read about fundamentals and check weekly top DD for GME https://www.reddit.com/search?q=gme%20flair%3ADD&sort=top&t=week

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes keep telling yourself whatever you want.  In a year it will be closer to $40 than to $200, your more than welcome to check back in a year and laugh at me, I don't mind.

Best case is it's a slow glide down, but there won't be more stimulus money, eventually people will sell to go on vacation or pay bills, and the price will drift back down.  The turn around will take years, not months, and with the massive processor shortages consoles and computers will be delayed and hurt their bottom line.

I do think GME will survive, this has been a tremendous advertising campaign, and it may well be worth $200 a share, but it won't be in the next few years.

But what do I care, I only had a couple hundred percent return on my MVIS investment today.  You guys stay in that Gme waiting on that ship, doesn't hurt me."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got in at .98, sold at 12 expecting to buy back in on the dip, watched it go to 25, saw it at 12.01 this morning and decided to watch and wait ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"didn‚Äôt sell in the high 20s, def not selling for 18"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,the tendie gods smiled upon me
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Their $35c were cheap as fuck ($0.18) and jumped up to almost $1 each today that's what I loaded up on.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm holding for now, when MVIS last jumped it ran pretty big day after day. hoping for the same."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I sold a few to cover today but holding the rest to see how the movement is. Secondary catalyst caused this movement today so I don't want to jump or roll yet. have 18/19/35 calls

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean Congrats! Lol
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This made me jizz in my SOXL today too!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Are we expecting another squeeze? What do you think the peak will be?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I should‚Äôve picked those up too, I def will if we have a dip or red week"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same, holding 4000 shares at 15.5 average."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it worth exercising  the calls  or rolling it over ?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Again my friend, you did good! üëç"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Selling CCs on it makes me nervous. Made $250 off of 2 today. Might buy shares.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"When you have too many options to want to transfer...same boat, same moon MVIS!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Ur uncle?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,same. did we just become Eskimo brothers?!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,really not sure. gotta see how she be moving the next couple weeks.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I sold all my CCs pretty far out the money after a huge run and little pull back. Didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúlose‚Äù the shares, but got lucky with the timing"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,options and GME keeping me tied to RH
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,She gonna start walking at 17 where she left off imo.  Everything worth having is just settling back to where it left off.  But she won't drop!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I had some $35s I let go of today. Holding my  $12s and 15s until the next spike


Might add to my long positions soon. Need to check the IV in the Am"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I opened a webull and fell in love with the data. Slowly building that account. RH is just holding mvis options and shares for the moonski
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was staring at the cheap 30c and 35c earlier this week, blew it by not going for it"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wasn't expecting for it to pop so fast, but I got em for $0.21 and sold em for $0.93 today. Not too bad"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Hold and sell @$100+
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"High average, but I still think you are going to print by EOY."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I like it
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Just bought 25 shares myself so I could have a lower average than youüòÇ
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,27.50 üòÇ
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Good ape
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only have a few shares, but will probably grab a few more if it stays ""low"" when I have a few extra dollars to toss in.

Or if those penny stocks I've got actually make some money :)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I'll have a better life after riding this rocket üöÄüöÄüöÄ
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck the haters. I too have over 99% of my portfolio in rkt. Its going to pop. There are way to many catalysts in the mix right now to have a price of only 23. Or even 27 for that matter. Its just a little dip. Its
1. Fintech
2. Value stock
3. Complete market domination.
4. Has proven to be good in every market. 
5. Rkt is turning detroit into Wauconda 

This stock will catch whales. My guess is at sometime dan gilbert will buy back the remaining 5% of float before the end of the summer so they can issue another special divvy after they destroy all sales records possible. Market is so hot for houses right now. Everyone wants to move and there are not even enough houses on the market. Plus rkt will now offer loans immediately after filing your taxes on intuit turbo tax. Like wtf cmon people this company is the play. Survive!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm there with you, throwing up on this roller coaster right now though ü§Æ"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry for your loss. Rocket ain't going to make u rich. U want to get on a rocket buy gme. Not financial advice
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a holder myself, this was a poor choice."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Oof. Good luck retard. Seems like that money is better invested elsewhere and im sure you know what im talking about
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like this challenge

PS: Puts on him averaging lower than you"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol until the market shits the bed. Hope he knows when to exit. It'll probably be a cute little pop in price. Loss porn is better with wild yolo's tho
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Plus shorts have gone up from 17% to 23% from last week thats my guess for the price being stricken down daily. I say let their short intrest get bigger then when its nice and fat we grab by the pussy and have them pay for our wives boyfriends dinner.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"no ill invest wherever market is going to want to be, then i will sell it to other investors at a higher price. then i will find the next thing investors want and get in that before they all want it. rinse and repeat till i make $1MM"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds like good plan! üëç
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What are you doing?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol why even have the 7.48 shares I think you‚Äôve done enough self harm with those calls
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Why?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Let him ride the bull
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don‚Äôt you think they reissue the stock? Like an IPO?

Your money is fairly safe as it hasn‚Äôt gone above $2 in like 13 years"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,No
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds dumb but this could be a huge play
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Hate us cause you‚Äôre anus
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It will be huge but could go either way. It has also been speculated they could wipe out equity holders.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,My 4/16 30Cs are hoping you‚Äôre right
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right or wrong, I could at least understand why GME and AMC were shorted out the ass. Those businesses had been struggling and COVID didn‚Äôt do them any favors. But when it comes to ASO, I literally can‚Äôt wrap my head around the short interest. Like the business is fundamentally sound. They paid down 50% of their outstanding debt in Q4 and grew YOY earnings during a global pandemic.

What did people see that made them say, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs short the absolute fuck out of this stock‚Äù?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"14000 30 call options were traded today if I read it right.   And the delta on those options .26

Not sure how that translates in to MM buying."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I returned some shoes the other day...not sure if that is going to effect those earnings.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"People said the same after the PLTR lockup expired in Feb, then it sold off for a month."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"it's pretty much at it's peak now at 26.99, how much higher are you anticipating it going? I am not seeing it unless someone buys a shitload of calls"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"there's not much interest in the stock so it probably won't move much anytime soon. 

not unless u have funds to drop a couple billions. just a couple"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm in the same boat. I got 5  4/16 30c
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's quite a few companies on that list. The fundamentals are healthy, but you wouldn't think that with the high short interest."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Still trying to figure it out.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Democratic president and a significant amount of their sales comes from guns and ammo (which have been facing supply challenges since covid).

The part that shorts have wrong is guns and ammo is only ~15% of sales and if you take that out they are still very profitable."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Think of it like this, low volume stock.  Low borrow rates.

Hedge funds using it like a credit card.

They borrow the shares sell them then use those funds to buy other stocks.

Now that good earnings are here, and lockup has expired.  

There is a possibility of a squeeze happening. (Not like gme)  but still squeeze. 

If the stock starts rasing and borrow rates increase, with what ever they invested in falling they can get margin called or close the postions their selves."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The volume was definitely elevated on that strike today. The more interesting part of it though was the block order for 7,500 contracts. It was a purchase block, so someone is betting ~half a million that it‚Äôll hit $30 by April 16"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Those options are .60 a piece.

So every option you buy MMs have to hedge with 26 shares or sell puts.

Is that right?   

If the stock price jumps they have to hedge even more. 

 And thats how you get a gamma squeeze.

so if a 100,000 options get bought.  At $6 million MM have to hedge with 2.6 million shares.  And as price goes up they have to hedge further and further."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Was the store packed?  Did you ask the cashier how business was going?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,40-50 but I just made that up and don‚Äôt know anything. Sorta retarded actually.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,An article in the WSJ today ‚ÄúAcademy Sports Deserves Some Badges‚Äù makes me wonder if some interest might be brewing. We‚Äôll see if it translates to any volume.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is like the 15th post on WSB regarding $ASO. Clearly you aren‚Äôt paying attention. Or you have puts and are quietly touching yourself in the corner while crying. 

Or both."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"4/16 35c here.  swung for the fences, will probably get hit by a bat instead"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Low borrow rates aside, funds would still have to maintain margin requirements on the short sale. So I guess I‚Äôm not sure I understand what you‚Äôre implying here? Like the short sale locks up more of their cash than if they had just not gone short in the first place."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Volume today on the 30c was amazing. It might be slow at first but once we approach the 30 strike and delta creeps up closer to .5 it might start to run away. I‚Äôm definitely not jumping off anytime soon, and will probably double down on 30c tomorrow"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,it would be nice cause i like money
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,üßê

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just buy shares, imagine buying options from the people who you want to make money off of."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Options help the shorts but I‚Äôm glad you got gains
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Men, boys, old and young. Does not matter. You show a loss porn- your battery is dead. 

My theory is that constant checking to see if your -90% loss came down to -80% or not every 2 second for the duration of 9:30 am to 4 pm will eat the battery."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Worst comes to worst I just throw my stimmy in. I have a problem
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Right?! Crazy innit‚Äô
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Aye if I get paid out I‚Äôll buy shares bby ;) just some extra money to throw away
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,SOXL and BB/ZM can be your solution!

But I'm not selling."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm waiting till it hits $8 then I‚Äôll average down.  Long term I think they will either succeed or be bought out for their tech.  But that earnings call yesterday means a lot of pain for awhile.

..if you‚Äôre that sure about it reaching 8...wouldn‚Äôt it be better to sell NOW and then buy back at 8??? What kind of average down works like ‚Äúyeah I‚Äôll average when this stock goes down by 10%‚Äù"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's definitely a long term play.

There have been some good DDs after earnings that I agree with since they have restricted in sales with the silicon shortage + negotiations for an exclusivity deal bringing some licensing out of play.

Once revenue grows it looks like they will be highly profitable."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ha ha, James Cameron is firing up the Deepsea Challenger"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're dead right.

It's a personal minimum, personally I think the stock under $9 is a steal and would double down if I had the money because I never expected it to be in the $8 range.

It might never hit 8, but he considers it the sweet spot to average down if it gets there.

If he knew it was going to $8 he would be smart to enter a short position (selling covered calls etc), instead he remains bullish as he likes the stock now and likes it even more @ $8"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It will be nice if they can sell or license out those phone patents.  They aren‚Äôt in that business anymore and really need to rebrand.  Everyone still thinks of BB as the phone company that never adjusted to smart phones.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm with you. Less shares and a lower price but I'm going to wait until it goes lower to add. I've watched lots of earnings and this always drops for a week or two before climbing.

Glad bill hwang got fucked sideways and I generally hate banks (we can‚Äôt avoid doing business of course). However these banks had no way of knowing he was walking down the streets and pledging his stocks as collateral.

Something has to change. We need transparency into these shadowy hedgies because there are bill hwangs everywhere. We have reg u and t for ordinary margin traders. Regulate the fuck out of them. One man should not be able to do this much damage.

Also fuck credit suisse. They drool at high net worth clients and let them lever to the tits. They are the worst of the worst."

> This isn't the first time Hwang has been the subject of an SEC investigation. In 2012, Hwang and his former hedge fund Tiger Asia Management pleaded guilty on insider trading charges.

The fact that Matthew Fox put these paragraphs in such close proximity indicates he may very well have the smoothest brain of all."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You know, just the biggest fucking margin call ever. No biggie."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"See my comment above- the banks had no way of knowing that bill was taking his Viacom bought on loan and going to the next bank and then pledging them as collateral. He did it over and over and over. Like a half dozen banks had extended loans but their collateral was all concentrated in a few names like Viacom. They could not know he did this, so when they sold them they took severe losses because they all dumped Viacom.

Regulation is needed to stop pledging shares as collateral or increase transparency. Banks suck but this time they just couldn‚Äôt know."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Must give him props he was making 55-65%/year for 8years in a row. He was making money until he didn't. I don't understand why the banks were selling him these derivatives because the fees are low and their risk is quite big comparing to the reward.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's a reason why lending money for margin trading comes with insane interest (like up to 150% yearly interest), and that's why."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks man. Not everyone in finance is sociopathic and filled with greed, some are hard working people who want to do good. I have met the prior and I hate it about the industry.

The point is that he was buying, say Viacom. And then he would go to GS and pledge his shares to get another loan to buy MORE Viacom.  Then go to UBS, MS, JPM, Nomura and Credit Suisse and do the same thing WTF!!

The banks don‚Äôt share data with each other on their collateral. Banks are huge, there‚Äôs a lot of data and this business may even be automated to accept equities at a haircut (104% value of the loan). Each presumed that they could just sell the shares if he defaults. The issue is that the banks had no way of knowing that everyone on the street was holding the same collateral- Viacom! So when he chain-defaulted these banks had to liquidate all at once.

What can regulators do? I honestly don‚Äôt know but maybe set Margin limits on these funds? Also they could restrict how much leverage these funds take on and make it mandatory that they report. That way banks know more about the counterparty risk and won‚Äôt lend to leveraged clients.

Idk the solution, I‚Äôve been sitting at my desk waiting for the sec news to break. There has to be a fix or else excessive risk taking will again fuck the economy like it did in 2008. So disgusted by the greed."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,He won't go to prison.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Very true, he didn‚Äôt break the law. The system was flawed. That‚Äôs why the sec has to do something. You can‚Äôt run a fund without a broker and given he can only do leveraged plays, he won‚Äôt find one anytime soon. Boxed out"

This is not just some guy that spends 20 hours a day looking for loop holes.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"To my knowledge (very smooth brained), he didn't break any laws. While his actions are frowned upon (only now that there's losses), I think they were within the law or the grey area that has yet to be law."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"True but as a nuance the more money these HFs have the more Wall Street drools over them. They compete for these shady hfs and lower rates presumably as the size of the loan increases.

Greed, just pure greed and credit Suisse is notoriously the one that drools over wealthy clients the most. They also have like no risk management so they just rolled out the lines of credit."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is such a simple explanation of what he was doing. I appreciate it. I was trying to articulate it in my head, but not always make smarts - but you put it in place, so thank you. 

I feel that the solutions you put forth are good, this one seeming the simplest to implement: ""restrict how much leverage these funds take on and make it mandatory that they report"". I mean leverage is really the root of so many of these situations. 

Ultimately though, these people make so much money which goes to greasing the wheels of politics/""charitable"" foundations, lobbyists, etc., that they won't change it. Everyone in the club is getting a piece, they sure as hell aren't turning off that spigot."

In fact he could have been setup to cover up something else.  You are literally talking about a psychotic institution that destroys humanity. We have no idea what actually goes on in the dark but it's at least an order of magnitude worse than what we end up seeing. If one guy got caught there is \*AT LEAST\* 10 others doing the exact same thing that haven't been caught.

Think about basic crime. Say people breaking in to houses. Lots of people do it but only some small percentage get caught. It's not because cops are doing their job, it's usually some coincidence that leads up to a set of events that makes it all happen."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You aren‚Äôt seeing the bigger picture. If a globally systemically important bank fails do you think you wouldn‚Äôt be affected? Contagion risk is devastating. Credit Suisse doesn‚Äôt deliver its obligations to counterparties and then those counterparties can‚Äôt pay up and so on until you have a financial crises A marginally bigger bill hwang could have done that and then yeah I guess the whole global market would be on a fire sale... ironically bill hwang shorted the market so when it was liquidated the S&P shot up as banks covered positions. But that could have easily been the other way around. Get outside your narrow retail mindset if you want to understand finance
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I actually wondered if this was a diversion. It‚Äôs nice to hear someone else wonder that aloud.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Um because we don‚Äôt want another 2008? After 2008 we had a big push in the industry to make capital reserve requirements mandatory for GSIBs. Credit Suisse which suffered the biggest loss has capital buffers to absorb this, but what if it was a bigger client?

The financial industry has a lot of participants that rely on the scale of banks to provide services. A lot of firms like mine which provides investment options for 401ks are very upset with the risk taking at the banks. The Regulators do care about these contagion risks and get pressured by firms like mine to maintain stability. The sec just passed two risk management laws in the past 3 years that I work on so... they do things alright. Not always the best job but idk about how they benefit from a financial collapse. We would have to bail out the banks

Can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre just super jaded about the finance industry, which I understand. Just want to inform that something has to change to maintain global financial stability. And the sec aren‚Äôt the only regulators in global markets..."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Imagine you run a multi-million dollar company and someone just fucked up and lost you millions... you have insurance, why not game the system and say you lost 2x as much? Insurance fraud is huge, as are many other scams capitalism creates so wealth is transferred to the sane to the insane.

I try to think of all the possibilities I can. I trust no one or anything. I go off probabilities and I'm skeptical of explanation or justification. I'd rather err on the side of caution and minimize risk.

I think many banks, HF's, capital management firms, etc are just fronts and ways just to create obfuscation for the biggest crooks. The tip of the pyramid makes so much money that they have to keep it moving and flowing because if the money stops then it can be seen(it will pile up then if anyone is trying to track them it can more easily be found).  It's actually the government itself that does this and many people know how the game works and create smaller clones."

To clarify- this is not business as usual it‚Äôs one of the largest margin calls in history and a symptom of more aggressive risk taking in the financial system. I‚Äôm not a doomer and am keen to see the full disclosures by banks at the end of the week.

Tail risk is often underestimated... I remember cnn money telling people bear stearns would be alright, please continue buying their shares...

I care because this is my field of expertise- counterparty risk on banks. I‚Äôve worked at IBs in credit departments so you may be surprised that these departments are hamstringed by the business so they can take outsized counterparty risks because.... moneyyyy

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"""It also will hold a rare public session to discuss financial system risks from climate change for the first time.""

&#x200B;

Remember, when they ""climate change"" they are not talking about weather(that is what idiots on the outside thing).  They are talking about financials and they use climate as having to do with how much money they are making. When they are not making a lot, there is a lot of risk, or something bad going to happen they start talking about the ""climate changing"". Remember, they talk in code so they can communicate with their bedfellows in a way that no one else knows what they are talking about. It's also a way to manipulate the system, say, to extract money by creating false issues then diverting those funds to the ""climate change"".

&#x200B;

Thing about it, what kinda of financial risk actually occurs due to climate change? The weather isn't going to fuck with the $$$. The dollars ain't gonna burn up because the temperature rose 0.3F. Liquidity isn't going to freeze due to it getting colder.

When you go listen to them, they will never give specifics about climate change and financials that actually prove any thing like ""Here we see that the global temperature has risen 0.2F for the past three years and this has caused the Bank of Scam to lose an extra 2M dollars pure month do to evaporation. We can see from PV=$RT that if the global temperature continues to increase we will end up with a deficit that will severely undermine progress in exploiting the slaves.""

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,TLDR - He got margin called because he was leveraged to the tits. He was allowed to be leveraged to the tits because his position was hidden in CFDs.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,All within his *personal risk tolerance* ^GUH
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Bill was like i'm either shitting in gold toilets or cleaning toilets
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Tl;dr **bill wrote a check his ass couldn‚Äôt cash**
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I get this guy. I buy leveraged ETFs (like TQQQ) through x5'ed CFD contracts, on x2'ed margin money."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is partially correct; bill was rolling up the whole way (not as aggressively as your examples). The margin call came before his liquidity was 0 though; bank losses are stemming from the additional losses incurred between margin call and liquidation since the position was huge and took a lot of trading to unwind.

Remember, the notional value of Bill's positions (while themselves synthetic) were of course hedged with real shares/options by the banks selling the swaps. The banks want to be delta neutral for the most part. This is why GS/MS were among the top holders in Bill's stocks (up there with holding companies like Blackrock) which is very unusual for an investment bank. Goldman bought up the underlying real shares to hedge Bill's massive position and this is partially responsible for some of the upwards price action of these stocks since every time Bill rolled out his positions and re-levered up after big gains the banks had to buy more shares - a toned down version of a gamma squeeze kind of.

I believe this hedging also contributed to Hwang's fall. This obviously isn't substantiated but I would not be surprised if Viacom's dilutive share offering was ""encouraged"" by Morgan Stanley / Goldman in some way - whether approaching them with a sweet deal or worse. During this time the banks also had their media connections ramping up the China FUD full blast to pressure Bill's Chinese stocks. Once there was a catalyst to start downward momentum in Bill's stocks the banks had a fantastic money making opportunity that I imagine they figured would provide strong risk adjusted returns.

GS/MS had built up absolutely massive positions in VIAC/DISCA/BIDU/IQ etc. These have momentum on the way up, and on the way down. After the offering I believe they started selling off their hedges immediately (stocks had been falling hard for days before doomsday Friday on huge volumes) reinforcing the downward pressure. This allowed them to not only unwind their hedges at higher prices but also allowed them to make money on the swap by increasingly under hedging it on the way down. Wouldn't be surprised if they bought other derivatives etc. just prior to the margin call as well. Also, staying fully hedged up until the liquidation would actually result in huge losses for the banks selling the swaps due to slippage on unwinding the hedges - especially with Bill's billions in collateral being sold off at the same time. I imagine GS/MS had it calculated out and knew well in advance how much they would be able to push these stocks down and therefore knew maybe even days in advance that Bill was going to be liquidated. As soon as the point of no return hit GS/MS immediately dumped the collateral they got from Bill's liquidation and fucked the other banks lol.

The real lesson here is be very careful trading with these banks; especially vultures like Goldman. If GS is your counterparty you are the mark.

EDIT: apparently these may have been unfunded TRS. If this was the case all of this still stands for the most part except that GS would certainly be trying to sell the shares as high as possible while squeezing out whatever funding they could get from Hwang; just no actual liquidation event. Hwang would have been bled dry by funding and unable to continue"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,The cool thing about America is that Bill will be trading under another billion dollar flag in six years.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup, the Wanger got caught, large Marge called and is pissed they don‚Äôt even have his collateral to recoup parts of his losses. So sorry, don‚Äôt borrow more than you can pay back."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Bill Hwang GUH‚Äôd
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"To be precise, he owned total return swaps. In these, you pay a set interest, but get the dividends. The possession and ownership of the shares remains with the bank. These are great when you use them on stable or rising stocks with good dividends, but this also makes price drops catastrophic for you. You're essentially trading resistance to sudden crash for pure profit.

Us European retards can buy a very similar instrument, the unlimited turbo warrant (aka knockout warrant). They don't pay a dividend though, and effective theta decay is leverage √ó interest, so for leverage 10, interest 2.5% = about 25% annually. It also tends to accelerate towards the knockout and it depends on price history. Max loss is only 100% though, it's always in the money."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This reminds me of the whole ""Robinhood Infinite Margin"" shenanigans from... 2019?

"" Bill came up with a great plan. He's got the $300 immediately in his  account. Stock B trades at $150 and Bill expect it to rise even more. So  bill takes his $300 profit, and of buying 2 stocks, he leverages it  with the same 5:1 ratio and get about $1500 in leverage. Now, he's able  to buy 12 more CFDs of $150 each. **Bill has only invested $400 of his own money, but owns 18 CFDs, worth $2700!** ""

IMO I would wager a guess that the reason why you don‚Äôt see any purchases from him in the last month is because he intends to exercise the remaining 500 contracts. And that might be his last purchase until it is post squeeze.

He did the work. He invested when others didn‚Äôt see it. He stayed patient and picked up some nice profits along the way.

I mean... There are plenty of fools out there buying $300, $400 and higher strike contracts.  Why not collect some extra cash?

Worst thing... They expire ITM and he gets forced to sell some of his shares at $300, $400 or higher.  When your cost basis is $27/share... That doesn't seem like too bad a deal.

And let's be honest... Chances of them going ITM within the week are slim... So free $.

APR9300C are going for $3.48

Thats $348K in premiums.  They expire ITM?

  I will sell to recoup 2/3 of my initial stock purchases at the given time if/when it climbs that high.  All that I can say is that my 1500 has been interesting to watch here and there and if one day, like the rest of my 0.003 stocks lingering in my portfolio GME decides to rest with, so be it, but in my opinion, I don't think that is going to happen.  There are so many people that love playing video games, love GameStop (I think they can afford to drop the ""used"" prices quite a bit on some titles) and do believe in the companies future.  Holding.  Holding.  Holding.  Eat the candy damn it!

What is OP's highlighted thing?  It looks like a ""call"" for GME stock in the future on April 16th of this year at 12.00.  I just don't know what that means, does that mean OP is placing an order for GME stock on the 16 for that price?  What happens if the price is lower or higher?

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, kinda done with this smooth brain I have.  Just out of curiosity, April 16 comes and DFV exercises his calls, what does that mean exactly?  Like I know essentially he'll be buying 50K shares @ $12, but looking at the bigger picture, DFV is just one man with that many contracts.  He's been the only one public about his call options from the get go.

If even 10-20 people have a similar amount of options for April 16 and decide to exercise them, this would drive the price up and force HF's to cover right?

I'm smooth brain when it comes to calls/puts, so any enlightenment in this scenario is appreciated!

Before DFV exercises he could easily buy $10,000,000 worth of shares first then exercise to place max value on his investment.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,That's when I loaded up with more. Gotta trust DFV
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,When I saw him double down I went all in. Best decision of my life.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"There I was after the infamous January Halt, reading about what had just happened and lamenting that I hadn't cashed out of my options sooner, when I started reading the DD to see what smarter apes were saying. It was a shame, a travesty, a robbery. It was against the rules of the market, nay, of Capitalism itself! This was to have been a short squeeze for the ages dammit!

So I kept reading and realized...

The setting for the squeeze hadn't changed...! 

At first I thought it was all a dream- BUT THIS WAS NO DREAM!!!!

I was about to get in the shower and figured it would be worth whatever money I could put in just to squeeze them. After the halt, after drinking champagne and taunting the Occupy movement, after the housing crisis, if it would only cost a few meager dollars to do my part, I would buy back in. Come what may! Like you, I bought in at $40 a share.

I got in the shower and turned the water on. I noticed hair beginning to grow from parts of my fingers that I had never had visible hair on. My back was covered in a coating of silver! Large sharp teeth grew in my mouth! I got out of the shower and dried off. I looked in the mirror.

Upon checking my account, GameStop had already hit $140 a share. 

It was at that moment that I turned truly ape.

EDIT:
Everything about this story is true except the transformation into a different animal."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I deposited money in my account with plans to buy 2k worth of stock and then it spiked... gg I guess

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Me too, sadly, one in a lifetime opportunity is now long gone"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I intended to.  I actually planned on buying 100 shares the following week, but I forgot my phone at home when I went to work.  Nbd, I'll just buy tomorrow right?  Nope, that was the day it shot to 100.  Been averaging up ever since."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought in at 315, but believed so much I went in hard at 40 and got my average to 120. Never before would I buy more after such a loss. I BELEIVE!"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I think a lot of people have that regret but I know one thing I‚Äôm too of an ape to make such a big play. i like buy at 250 and sell at 50
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Still have nightmares of the the first big leg up to $17 and thinking I missed the boat
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I think about this every day. What a fool I was. Blind but can now see.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just wait, they said...

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I remember that Friday so vividly. Around 2, I told my gf who bought at the top that I will be biting a bullet and double down at $38 because there is no way that this was over. My gf doubled down too. Then after the purchase, I saw reddit and I saw DFV. I was so happy. I sold all my stock the week after and bought more GME"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I congratulated the apes in the megathread when it hit $34 in January

One kind ape said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still not too late to get in‚Äù

Well well well ü§£ got in at $110 and $44 eventually"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I had Robinhood open and was looking at the ticker on a Friday. It was at 38.  I showed the people around me and said now is a good time to get in (again).  I said to myself I‚Äôll wait until it‚Äôs 35‚Ä¶.  I never did get back in until it was 120 üòû
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was reading DDs around the 20-30 price points. Then I wanted to jump in at 40, but by the time money got into my account, it was at 60s. It's ok, I diamond handed and bought the dip at 40s after the January/Feb fiasco"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"YES! I was in at 58, held, panic bought at 320 then averaged down to 169. If it goes down below 100 again, if he's in, I'M IN!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Soon as I saw his double down I bought in at 48. Been averaging up a little since then. Wish I had more cash at hand when it was 48.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish I had gotten more
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I regret selling when it first crashed. I should have stayed in and I would have made a bit of money and I should have bought when DFV bought so many GME shares.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats nothing. Ive been following this since the beginning but have nothing to put in so all I can do is lurk and cry.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Twice I had the money and didn't buy calls.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I doubled down and probably the best decision I‚Äôve made in my life so far
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I know exactly what you mean I remember having 1k available and I should of put it all in.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,So fucking with you.  I worried and bought a fraction of what I could have and considered doing.  I didn't want to 100% my portfolio on a meme stock.  So instead of 40 or 50  I only got 10.   So pissed.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Then you're in for the fuckening for deep fuking vagesus has nothing to lose. You do.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Tell me about it
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude same here...when I saw he doubled down at $40 I really really really considered buying more, but I‚Äôm broke so it would‚Äôve gotten uncomfortable for me...definitely wish I did though. DFV taught me a valuable lesson"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought like 3 shares at $40. I have now about $9k invested and wish I would have spent all that $9k at $40 per share.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"*""You FOOL! This isnt even my final form! Wait until you see my TRUE power! HYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!""*"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If he's still in, I'm still in!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,So on April 16th is here just gonna exercise all of his options or something?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"""DFV now on the hook for millions more in taxes! SELL!"""
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also, where are the FUDdites who were saying on here 2 weeks ago that he had sold all his shares and cashed out? And that you should bail too?

This would imply he's still in, wouldn't it?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,We need to get Cramer to talk about this
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Businessinsider probably will
Have an article about it tomorrow lol"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude was like ‚Äúeasiest 20$ of my life‚Äù
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,the best part is that 99% of the people here would have sold him those calls.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Deep fucking imagine.

Edit: Guys, if the squeeze shoots up as fast as this comment has... tomorrow will be a fun day."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wish I had a time machine, so I could be the fool, too."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,OMFG I'd be so mad
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Citadel probably sold him the call
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I wanna be the fool
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm picturing the way that guy cries a little every day seeing that short sitting in his portfolio, knowing how screwed he is, not being able to do a fucking thing about it. Just imagine the antici..."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It took me a while to even wrinkle up enough to know what that was. When i really saw it for the first time i had one of those ""surprised bark laugh"" out loud that i'm sure they heard down the hall here at work."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Imagine having those calls convert to shares, then having 150000 shares of GME to write covered calls against at today's prices. 

That's what DFV could do if he wanted."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"¬´i might have been early, but im not wrong.¬ª"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Could someone explain this to a simple ape?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same here, especially looking at the absolutely ridiculous 87 thousand percent ROI."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Over **87,000%** gain. So far.

Not that it matters, he‚Äôll exercise. Waiting for that juicy 150k share update."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Very doubtful that they sold uncovered calls whoever they are so likely they are holding GME shares right now. However with the amount of institutional stupidity surrounding this stock you just never know.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Couldn‚Äôt whoever wrote it could have bought calls and get out of position earlier?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Deep fucking GUH!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I just hope for that poor souls sake that they were covered
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thought exactly that, perfect that this is top comment"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Who wouldn't exercise this @ $12 / share = only $600K capital required for 50,000 shares!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Not trying to be *that* guy but writing those 20cents calls does not necessarily mean it's a bearish position. This can realistically be part of a bullish spread.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Now their worth $17,800. Fuckin crazy. That is a yolo 9f a lifetime that we can all appreciate. This dude is legend status."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Anyone else with these 4/16 calls? 

Are you planning to roll them? Exercise?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can someone please explain calls? I've read about them time and time again on a bunch of different blogs but still don't really understand. Like you agree to buy stocks at a certain price? And hope the stock drops to that price? So you just set up an auto-buy so you don't have to pay attention? How do you figure out (guess) what price to set? Or you agree to buy stocks at a higher price? Why would you do that instead of just buying the dip (which is the only thing I really understand, lurking on here reading these threads)? 

Then there's sideways trading... I understand that a sideways market means that the stock price doesn't really change day to day, so basically are people just hoping to make a tiny bit of cash selling at like, $200 and then buying at $198? 

Thanks if you can help, I try really hard to follow these threads but I'm so lost with everything except that y'all are holding forever (I also assume there is an end point to this holding, but don't know how you're going to tell when you reach it)."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Who ever did, has prob now carved his name next to  'brooks was here'"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Right? I really wish that shit played out for me like this! 9M on a few bucks? GODDAMNNNN üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄü§öü§ö
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh I remember that scene in The Big Short!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Imagine having to explain that to shareholders...""what had happened was..."""
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,THIS GUY IS THE BOSS
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If your calls are ITM at the time of their expiration, do you have to exercise or sell them to make money, or can you hold on to them for a bit?

Does he have to either sell or exercise them on the 16th or can he wait another week and then do it?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,And it looks like he's planning to exercise them.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought 40 of those $12 4/16 calls back in December and sold them 2 days before the squeeze in mid January and lost out millions of $ of gains
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine next year when we look back $200...
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I pee myself every time I see this dude lose 10 million then get it back then lose it again then get it back week by week












No fucking way in hell I'd keep holding, but I suppose that's what makes him a better man than me. I could easily live the rest of my life comfortably with 25-30 million (probably what it amounts to after taxes). But this man doesn't care"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not to mention... DFV isn‚Äôt being shitty about it. ‚ÄúTake that you non-believing fucktards!‚Äù 

He‚Äôs kept the receipts, he has all the social proof, and yet he keeps plugging away like the Jedi-level ape that he is."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"ELI5, would you mind helping me understand what that means?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I enjoying looking back at his posts and seeing everyone griefing him, and he literally didn't care. They shoulda put quarters in their asses cause they played themselves."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,imagine exercising those bad boys
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I just keep wondering about those calls as theta / IV kills the remaining extrinsic value. Why keep them? There‚Äôs gotta be something there
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Can‚Äôt wait till they have to be delivered in 2ish weeks
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs even better is I‚Äôm pretty sure DFVs account is a Roth IRA. Doesn‚Äôt even have to pay taxes on it
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Absolutely lmao
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"What would happen if he'd only ought those calls and not any actual stock, so come Apr 16th he can't actually afford to exercise his options?

Is the play there normally to sell the option some time before Apr 16th to someone who *can* exercise them?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Most baller shit ever
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,SERIOUSLY!!!!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm too retardedto figure figure this out but what was the amount DFV invested?
dm me for investment advice"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Fookin' showoff
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"There‚Äôs enough of us to cover him. Painlessly.  Let him call the timing of doing so, in concert with his own group of reddit counsel. Such counsel will make sure the appropriate date is set.  Upon which ten of thousands, if not hundreds, will easily get him to the surface. There should be little question of this proceeding. He has saved‚Äîor supplied us‚Äîan aggregate  of exponential value.  It‚Äôs a no brainer. Somebody here knows how to organize it. I don‚Äôt. But let it happen. Like. Now. I‚Äôm here to do admin work‚Äîwhatever... to follow directions."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Can someone explain this option to me or point to a good article. I believe I have the general idea of options down but for example it says he paid .20 cents for 500 of them and it looks like they expire around 4/16/21 and the call was for $12? First question is what would've happened if instead of going up the price would've stayed the same or gone down? I've heard you can end up owing more money if that happens. Also how do you calculate possible earnings on that? With stocks it's just the difference in price you paid times the amount of stocks you bought.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,The guy probably sold covered calls and did not like missing out.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What happens when he exercises his calls ?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Technically, he already has the option of exercising them now, doesn't he? Why would he wait until the last minute I wonder."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,If that‚Äôs the day it takes off I‚Äôll piss myself laughing.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Triple down

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck I never even contemplated that he might buy more calls
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm a dumb. Can someone explain what a call is?  In a ELI5 way if possible?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,If he exercises it right before EOD it will blast off!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm waiting to see if he touches this to pay his quarterly estimated taxes due April 15th
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,He will
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is he here for the squeeze now?  Who can tell?

He invested because GME was undervalued... Is it still, or is it because of factors outside of GME that he's still in?"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"He most certainly will since he likes the stock, and last I checked he doesn‚Äôt know what an exit strategy is."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Most likely exercise them
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The man bought 50k more shares the day after the first congressional hearing.

Not options.

In short, he likes the **stock**.
Not necessarily the options or their premiums."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,he's going to exercise all of them. That was always the plan
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"i'd be kind of weird not to, right? anything above $12 is like free money."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it gets to near April 16th he won't have any Theta gains and exercising is the smart choice as he can get 50,000 shares for $600,000. The Market Makers that sold him those shares will have to buy $10,000,000 dollars worth of shares at today's price to deliver."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Potentially? At that strike price you'd only need about 600k.

500 contracts, 100 shares per contract - 50,000 shares x $12 = $600k"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Itd only be like 600k to exercise them so im sure he will. I think he really wants to lower that cost basis
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"At this rate he thinks the price will go up significantly higher, so he will probably exercise all of them. If GME went up to about $400-$500 before April 16 he might sell, but if we‚Äôre lower I think he‚Äôll execute."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,He bought 50k more shares in the high thirties. Why wouldn't he then buy more at almost ten bucks?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are a LOT of potential reasons to not exercise In-The-Money calls. If the option writer(s) sold these calls naked and haven't yet covered, they may end up buying the shares to cover at a higher market price between now and April 16th. Having multiple options expire ITM on the same date can also shake things up, this is 50,000 shares and certainly other apes saw DFV's position, did their own DD or shook a Magic-8 ball, and without taking financial advice from others purchased options for the same date. The value of the calls contracts will also increase as GME's trading price increases (can also decrease, and also decays, not to get into the Greeks here)."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"He will exercise and buy more. According to his own DD and everything he has said multiple times, he believes in the long term value of the stock.

&#x200B;

Meaning he will hold this forever, even after making these big bucks, because he has smelled even bigger bucks"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Would be a fool not to. And would send the strongest signal to all diamond hands
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Of course he will. Why wouldn't he???? It's $600k for 50k shares, worth $9.5m."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Of fucking course he will, it‚Äôs a deep value to exercise them"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It would be stupid not to exercise them. Lol, come on."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,If a number are exercised that would definitely help push a potential squeeze
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't that cause a major squeeze??
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,He wouldn't be holding onto that much cash if he didn't plan to exercise those contracts.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs essentially an option to ‚Äúcall‚Äù upon a certain number of shares at a given price. In this case is an option to attain 50000 shares (500 options for 100 shares per option contract) at $12 each. They expire on the 16th of April so Keith can either sell those contacts off based on the value today or exercise those options to get 50000 shares at a cost base of $12 each. Hope this helps. If still in doubt search what is a call option on google. P.S don‚Äôt buy options if you don‚Äôt know how they work. Keith made tons of this play but you can also lose a lot of money. None of the above is financial advice.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,He has more bananas than the rest of us apes put together
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The $0.20 you see on the screenshot is Premium per share.

1 contract is for 100 shares....

100 * $0.20 = $20 per contract.

500  * $20 = $10,000

He spent $10,000 for those contracts"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"500 Contracts = 50000 shares.  100 shares per contract.

50000 * $179/share = $8,950,000"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"He has 500 contracts. each contract is x100 shares. So he paid 0.20 premium per share, times all the 100 shares, is $20 dollars per contract. He has 500 contracts so 500 x $20 = $10,000. The reason it sky rockets is because he has the leverage of 500 x 100 = ANOTHER 50,000 shares on top of his 100,000. I hope this helps"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"He's just bullish on GME. He's not in it for any ""squeeze"", he's just long on it. His entire thesis was GME being a $30-40 dollar stock when he bought in, he got proven right, made 11m, and now he's just sitting back and doing fucking nothing. If it goes down he doesn't care because he's in it for the long long long long game."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Fake news. They just keep shorting more and more. Far from out of their positions. That's what they want you to think.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"That news was probably a lie. Plus, he‚Äôs invested for reasons completely unrelated to the squeeze. He believes in the company. Ryan Cohen allegedly suggested last fall that he thought GameStop could reach $1000 a share without a squeeze. While that seems unlikely, at the rate he‚Äôs making changes I wouldn‚Äôt put it past him. Rising a few hundred dollars from where it is now seems very possible. DFV could reach 100 million from just the company‚Äôs growth over the next 5 years."

The person took the $10k and the responsibility to deliver those shares should DFV want to buy them anytime up until April 16.

 Probably didn't buy any shares to give him because GME is gonna go bankrupt and these will all be worthless right?

Well, right now he could buy 50,000 shares for $12 each from that someone, then sell them at $180 or hold until he wants to sell, but he probably thinks it will go way higher than $483."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, if you shorted at $5, believing 100% that its going bankrupt and never covering... I'd probably naked short and do it as much as I could, infinite free money, right?

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd almost agree that it's usually the probable position, but the shorts on this were absolutely sure it would bankrupt within a year and they'd have nothing to cover. 

They overshorted beyond comprehension for months on end with basically an infinite free money glitch. 

Then the cat, the apes, the crayons, and the retards happened to all shit in the same spot in the woods, and fucked the bears over."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idk there's another 44 out there, I'd take a fucking loan out to have capital to exercise these calls"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Options are split into calls (I think the stock will go up) and puts (I think the stock will go down).

Each unit of a call or put is a contract for 100 shares.

So let's say last year in July, GME was at $5.

You think that it's gonna be worth WAY more in the future, I think its gonna go bankrupt or be worth $1/share. 

So you say ""Hey, I think by April of next year this company will be worth $60 per share! I wanna buy a bunch of shares to make tendies with, but I can't afford a bunch right now.""

I'm sitting here thinking you're a moron and this is gonna be worthless in 6 months. So I offer a contract, pay me $0.20 per share (in bundles of 100 shares), and I gjve you this contract that says you can buy GME at $12 per share anytime before April 16 next year. 

That costs you $20 per contract. 500 times over is a promise that you can get 50,000 shares for $12 each.

It's great for you because you get time to save up money to buy the shares at the bargain price of $12 each, even if it's trading at $45 or $50 by then. You could buy those shares AT ANY TIME, and sell them immediately for nice profit, even if it went as high as $500 a few months into the contract. 

It's great for me because you paid me $10,000 for something I fully expect to be worth much less than $12 until April 16. If it's under $12, then why would you pay me for those shares instead of buying them at $10 from the market?

Well, April 1st comes around, and now those shares are worth a heck of a lot more. If you wanted to exercise your contract and ask me for the shares, I'd have to go and buy 50,000 shares at market price if I haven't yet, and sell them to you for $12. 

You'd have to pay me $12 per share but it doesn't matter since you'll be able to sell them for a profit of $178 per share. Or hold onto them and sell them when they're worth even more than that.

Effectively, this has guaranteed your price will be $12.20 per share ($12 buy price per share, aka  ""strike"", plus the .20 premium per share).

The rest is profit."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well 500 calls would've cost $10,000 at $0.20, but shit dawg, anytime I can turn $20 to $18K I'll fucking take it lol. 

This man held through what no one else would. Not even Michael Burry has balls this big."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Each call is the option to buy 100 shares for $12.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,He‚Äôll have to buy 50k shares but he‚Äôll have to forgo his profit on the options
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,He owns more of the stock. That's about it
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"He can exercise the calls and for each contract he gets 100 shares of GME, so 500 contracts he can turn into 50,000 shares"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs mostly waiting for him to buy again. Exercising the calls will cause the seller to sell their shares which will cause the stonk to go down. But if he even spends half of what he gains on these calls (if we stay where we are), he will help a possible catalyst to drive the price to the moon!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Same
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bet he just buys more stock. Maybe.

Calls are too pricey atm."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope he doesn't.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Options allow the right but not obligate to buy a certain amount of shares. Usually the amount is 100 shares which makes 1 contract. A call option is a bet that the price will go up. The price that the stock must go over for a call option to be valid is called the 'Strike Price'. Think of the Strike price as the line in the sand that determines if a contract is valid or not. DFV's Strike Price was $12. Meaning that if it goes over (which it certainly is) he only pays $12 for each share $12 x 100 = $1200 with current value at $189 the total of 1 contract is $18,900. A $17,700 profit before taxes. DFV bought 500 contracts and that's why he a legend."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,There is no way they aren't hedged
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm gonna be honest with you chief, I don't see dfv ever selling his GME stake. GME has everything going for it to be valued at the same value as tesla, pre 4:1 stock split. I'd say in 10 or so years GME will easily be in the thousands of dollars per share."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Word
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought 7 more today. Fuck it.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Same.  I now own a whopping 2 shares of gme.  Bought in at 187.  Kinda sucks because I remember the stock prices being like 40 a share a few months ago and I feel like a dumbass.  I also feel like it might actually be worth it anyway
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Did he yell Yes or No?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,His options have almost certainly been hedged by whoever has sold them... they have been deep ITM for months.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm not sure when the MM would feel inclined to purchase the shares but they may already have in prep for exercising. 

I‚Äôm not knowledgeable with how close to expiration they do this. But DFV‚Äôs are deep in the money.

Options being exercised is a catalyst for a gamma squeeze. It doesn‚Äôt replace the eventual short squeeze that is deemed to be inevitable. Could a gamma snowball into the real squeeze? Maybe, that‚Äôs something to be hopeful for. 

Is it guaranteed? Heavens no. A stock could have numerous mini gamma squeezes and not actually turn into MOASS.

Stay patient, buy and hold. And there is some really good DD out there about avoiding call options purchases for rooks, newbs, and crayon eating apes with GME."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. It‚Äôs not a dumb question when you aren‚Äôt familiar with it. Once you see it for the first time, you‚Äôll never ask that question again.

I‚Äôve learned a lot the past few months and it‚Äôs only a fraction of what many others on this sub understand, so keep asking questions and learn!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If he‚Äôs still in, I‚Äôm still in"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,If he's still in I'm MF in!!!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"His exit strategy was the few million he cashed out a along the way couple months ago. I am in full support of DFV and own quite a bit of GME myself, but lets not forget that he has already made a huge amount of money regardless of what happens in the future with the stock. Obviously he is still being bullish, but he has cashed out quite the ‚Äúsafety net‚Äù already."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,He will exercise them and then be offered a seat on the board seeing  as though he will be one of the largest shareholders.  It would be great publicity (like they need) to have an ape on the board.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The difference is between selling the contracts for the cash now vs. Actually exercising them to take possession of the stocks.  He's not just going to lose all the value, but it's an interesting question to see if he exercises to hold or just takes the money"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,These are probably already hedged. I won't bank on them having to buy all the shares at market value
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not today's, the moment of exercising, or soon after, sometime after."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Exercising is almost never the smart choice. There‚Äôs still extrinsic value he‚Äôs wasting if he exercises. You sell the contracts and then if you like the stock you can buy the equivalent number of shares and still have money left over.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's important to remember that MMs aren't the only ones writing options even if they are the majority. Plenty of people, especially who would be in the WSB community, also write options to further capitalize on their stock market plays. Whoever sold him these calls could have bought the shares below the strike price and just cried their eyes out at the opportunity cost they lost having to sit on them as GME went past $12, yet they have not necessarily lost any money on this."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"As stupid as some of these hedge funds and market makers have shown to be when it comes to risk management, they're almost certain to have the shares ready if he was to exercise them."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This made me lul
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Those calls have been in the money for so long I think the options sellers have already bought them a long time ago as a hedge.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It would be poetic justice if DFV initiated the squeeze by exercising his Calls on 4/16.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, these shares are definitely locked up waiting for DFV to exercise. Even if it hadn't gotten all the way to nearly $500 a share they are too far in the money for anything other than immediate bankruptcy to take them out of it. And even then, Gill becoming literally world famous in the space of 3 months and getting congressional scrutiny over his very public statements would become a nightmare scenario for anybody unable to cough up his shares on demand."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Liquidity be dryin', Melvin still cryin'"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,it has an average volume of 45 million. why would 50k shares exercised have any impact on that. (except for the hype that DFV is doing it)
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah they're so far ITM they'll have been fully covered for a long time already. The shares will just be transferred from whoever sold the option to DFV
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean look at volume for the day. Nah.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,He has calls that say he can exercise at $12. Do the math.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôll cost him 600k. $12 strike price x 500 x 100
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Truly retarded
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,The hype could start another buying train. Just fantasizing. I won't put a date on anything.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"No dumbass cultist, he posts on red days only lately. KEEP. THE. CULT. ALIVE."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I meant doing nothing as in not selling.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Cause he could exercise them and sell CC‚Äôs unless he thinks the squeeze will happen before/at April 16th
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,So if GME hits 189 it triggers a buy for 100K shares? I‚Äôm trying to understand what it is exactly I‚Äôm looking at. Needless to say I‚Äôm just starting out into this
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah, that's right. I haven't bought options in a while, I forgot it was 100 shares per contract."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Doubt
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,??? He's losing fucking money on them genius
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah. I think it‚Äôs going to bounce up then back down through several more cycles but it‚Äôs not going crazy super high again.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Say what you will. I‚Äôm around his age with a family and it‚Äôs incredible that he‚Äôs done what he‚Äôs done, but keeping it now is the best option."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same, it spiked to $100 a day or two before I got my paycheck, so I missed the whole week or two it was sitting in the 50-40s"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Likewise. Couldve put in 10x more than i did, but at least it helped me average down to $122"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're 100% right, fellow ape. In the end, happy I was still able to contribute some rocket fuel and average down. Just holding and waiting for lift off now! üöÄüôå"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"He sold loads of calls, he had about 15m cash before he doubled down so he'll owe tax on that"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I got 10k invested and it sure as shit isn't worth 9 million....
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Sometimes losing looks different than other times.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you know when he bought them?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,2.6 million total wow balls of steel!!!!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"10k is nothing to sneeze at. He obviously felt strongly. Wonder if he will exercise all of his options 10,050,000 shares executed could be a nice catalyst, especially if they can‚Äôt be found. Kitty could own more than Ryan."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup. x500 of em too. Turned $10k into $9Million on those calls, lmao."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,He paid 20$ per call. He bought those back when gme was like 4$ tho
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"He paid $20 per contract. So he paid $10k total.
The man is a legend."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,$20 x 500 contracts so $10k total which is why his % gain looks like a fucking glitch in the matrix lmao
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Per share included in the call. 

500 calls x 100 shares in each call √ó $0.20 premium per share = $10,000"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Why tf would you buy to close if they‚Äôre covered? Just let the shares get called away.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't even understand what he did but I think he also doesn't ü§î
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What an absolutely retarded play. You should have just let your CCs get assigned and you wouldn't have had to waste 250k lmao you would have your money back + the 12k in premium. Net positive overall.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You sound like me. We can set up a hedgie and charge people for our plays... they‚Äôd make a fortune on reversing the plays...
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gah, thought you were me. Until the part where you bought em back. I had 10000 shares, sold CCs on 7000 of them at like 20 bucks, because uberkikz said he was doing same thing because he thought the sales numbers they were about to release would drive the price down short term. Next day I though. Eh, I'll buy these back, never know what might happen here, but right as I was about to submit my order I got distracted at work. Next day, boom up to 37. In the end I made about 300k, my initial position was worth 4.8M at the peak. Sucks. I don't have the diamond hands."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Can't wait til I'm a retard yoloing this kind of money
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,how does selling shares allow you to buy the call back?  You can buy the calls back without touching your shares
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm out of breath after reading that fucking roller-coaster ride. I can't handle that kind of drama, I'm at 328 and haven't budged an inch. pure grade-a retard with the smoothest of the smooth brains. I've paid way more for far less entertainment so it's all money I set on fire the second I bought in but, man do I love what's going on in this sub! its like i found my people. apes strong together. edit: also fuck the hedge fund fucks. they should all be out in the street selling pens from a tin can!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You are a true ape
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Schwab at least lets you do that as a single ""limit - credit"" transaction; you shouldn't need to wait for the buy to close to go through to sell."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"omg, this would be me if I actually had that kind of money. I feel you.

Edit: Eh, I take it back. After thinking about what this guy is saying, I think he might be more retarded than me."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is there a reason the table shows it as $0.20 paid for 500 calls instead of $20 paid for 500 calls or $0.20 for 50,000 calls. I understand the core concept of the stock market and the various contracts but was so stuck on understanding how the position in the OP added up to $10k paid until your comment saying that they‚Äôre in sets of 100."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I just hope for the sake of the banks that sold these and other calls in meme stocks (I hate this phrase), that proper risk management measures were in place. Sure the hedge funds can do as they see fit which is why they got fucked in this case and rightfully so."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This made SO MUCH SENSE (after re-reading it like 5 times, I'm kinda slow). Thank you so much! Seriously, thank you. I'm going to save this comment to refer back to. I UNDERSTAND CALLS YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats how much I put into GME @ $40 LOL to think I coulda put 10k to make 10Mil kills me. And the funny thing is way before this hype I got a free GME on Stash when it was like $6 I think a while ago...I was thinking of buying more but sold it and bought something else (that tripled....I turned like $100 into $500 and put it into GME) So out of the 10k I have I used like 3k in other stocks I bought SUPER CHEAP and they exploded... so I guess its just learning...I still dont really know options tho
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought shares with the profit and exited with a nice 6 figure gain but man i am so pissed at missing out on ~$5M

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Bag holding 150k shares. Just kidding. I love DFV!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,could be one of the most lucrative plays I think I've ever seen or heard of.. insanity..
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I know I'd gamble on the exercise rather than the sell. That should drop that 100k share to around 16/18 ish.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Will the exercising of the calls actually affect the stock price the way that buying the shares outright would? Or probably not, since the shares have already been bought by the person selling the call?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Would you need to actually have that much cash to buy the shares? I thought under certain circumstances that the broker lends you the shares, you sell them on the open market for $$$$$$ and then pay the broker back $ for the shares (the 12$ per)

Thanks"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"When he exercises and buys that many shares at that low of a price, will that register a momentary enormous drop in price for GME?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"And that's only $600k in cash, which is change for him now.  That's pretty crazy!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"So some schmuck has had to hedge this whole time, buying more and more shares at escalating prices, desperately hoping the price falls to anywhere near $12, while not being able to stop thinking about that 9mm in the safe? I have to wonder if they have them all yet, or are waiting on some planned fuckery to try and grab them last minute. I would almost feel bad for that person, until I realized it‚Äôs probably a HF, fucked around and found out.

Would DFV exercising those contracts all at once have any impact on the price?"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Agree

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do you really think so?  I'm pretty new to all this and I keep seeing people saying the stock is gonna rise astronomically and it just doesnt make sense to me.  Regardless of that fact, I bought my first two shares of gme (and my first stock investment ever) this week because I would rather lose $400 than miss out on potentially thousands.  I hope all of you are right...."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Personally I am as bullish as I can be about GME.

I just wonder about DFV as a value based investor.  Would he dump April 16th...?"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,For you smooth brains when you sell an option and also possess the 100 shares that is called a 'Covered Call'.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The MM delta hedges actively. When the contracts were sold, they probably hedged by buying enough to remain delta neutral. As the price of GME went up, the MM continually bought shares to hedge the short calls. As of today, the deltas on those calls are practically 1, so the MM most definitely already have those shares on hand. MM still makes profit on theta, which is all they care about. Someone correct me if I'm wrong. I am simple ape."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, now, with how the hedgies are playing this and the current prices of options, options should be a no go for people who don't REALLY know what they're doing and who have money to punt. It's too easy for a seemingly smart play to just get washed out by hedge fuckery. 

(I say that as someone who even made 500% money on way OTM GME options)

Just buy stock."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This will make him one of the largest shareholders? How many shares will his calls get him?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Guy was a state champ of running....he for sure exercises.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôll cost him $600k to exercise and make potential billions, or he could walk away with the measly $8M now. What do you think he‚Äôs gonna do?? (Considering he‚Äôs sitting on ~$12M cash)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Let‚Äôs hope it goes to $500 the day before lol so that market maker gets really fucked big time üôåüèΩ
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"In a normal situation, you might be correct. However, in this particular situation exercising brings $1.5 million more value than selling the option contract at face value based on today's GME stonk price."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Would be the smart move, but we'll have to find out."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought them and lent them out to some shortie to make some meager interest on them
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,MM would be idiotic to not have hedged those shares already since they are deep ITM so i wouldn‚Äôt count on much action from it

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Please go check out that he always (for months) posts on the last trading day of the month. 

He posts on other days too, but today was a given no matter the outcome.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Weird thing about Maths! They do not change in direct proportion to the size of user's brain.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,He's got 10 mill in his cash account he can squander the rest as he please and still live like a king.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,he already has 12 million bro!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd suggest editing your comment since new information has been provided to you
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You guys got yours? I'm still waiting and the IRS tracker doesn't have any info for me.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Only if he sells it
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,At $40 he can hold for that long term tax help. This shit is worth more than $40 just on the team hired in the past couple of months.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,holy shit i just realized hes well on his way to holding for a year and ltg tax will apply. DFV be my sugar daddy!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"He had 1000 of the April 16th calls. You should check out the history, it's impressive the level of DD and diamond handing.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,For now
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish I had enough wrinkles to make a play like that some day. Damn son.jpg
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Meanwhile the 250 call (yes 1) I bought a few weeks ago expiring tomorrow has lost $4500.  And one just like it last week too.  When I bought they were almost ITM.

Me $9k -> 0.

DFV $10k -> $ASS loads of money.

DFV >> me

And yes captain hindsight, I should have just bought shares.  Also remember the ""advice"" about not buying options was not in fashion a few weeks ago like it is now."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,...So far
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait so he can technically sell some then use the cash to exercise right ? üòÆ
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"And the fukkers who sold them lose their locked up shares at that twelvie

Love it"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,9 million.... So far...
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,And counting
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Imagine 150,000 X'ing some calls on a company that the public not only thinks is dying, but funds are actively going out of their way to kill. My mind cannot comprehend. DFV is the definition of a chad."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,... or is it?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I have 1.7K invested and it is not worth a million yet. Im confused
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"500 x 100 = not 10,050,000"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"More like 20k to $20m+

He sold 500 and used a little bit of the profit to double his share position.

I forgot what price he sold em at, but that's where the 11 mil in cash came from lol"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Nother ape here. Did he call GME to be over $12 on april 15 2021? Is that how the call works?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,That's just chump change now. Absolute legend.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking you aren‚Äôt upside down in a covered call scenario. You just don‚Äôt get the benefit of the huge share price increase and that‚Äôs saying someone actually executes it. Best to let theta destroy it.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"No he does, you are just even more retarded"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"He needed to liquidate so he could buy the calls, I assume."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,He probably had no cash to buy it back and had to sell some capital to buy it back.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,They quickly went from +$12k to -$250k in my account balance as the share price mooned. Like everyone I assumed stonks only go up

I know if I was absolutely sure I'd short every fucking share I could convince at in that infinite money glitch.

That was the play, until retardation, crayons, monkeys, and a cat had a fateful encounter."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is gonna need to be a group effort

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,i remember when i climbed my first branch ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but its a little more complicated than that to understand. Basically, calls give you the right to buy stock at a certain price, and puts give you the right to sell at a strike price. Most people buy and sell contracts for the money, while other people who are a) rich and b) willing to invest long term actually exercise them for shares."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,And circle gets the square
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah that's the intrinsic value. Option contracts also have additional value based on time left/volatility called extrinisic value
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,bingo
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,He‚Äôs played this like a damn fiddle. It‚Äôs amazing
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,The latter is the most likely situation.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm pretty sure you described short selling, which is kind of the opposite of this. With short selling, you get lent the shares and sell them, then buy them back low, kind of like what you described. With exercising calls, you need the liquid cash to exercise, or else you can,t do anything with them except sell them hopefully while people are still buying."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You either need to sell the option before it expires or buy the shares at that price
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"i think you get the idea... so whoever wrote those calls will be forced to sell 50,000 shares to DFV. if they have 50k shares sitting around, great, those will get delivered off to DFV. However, if they don‚Äôt have the shares, they will have to buy the shares on the open market or get a borrow to hold the 50k shares short. If the person doesn‚Äôt cover there trade (get borrow or buy) in a timely manner, the exchange will buy them in and cover their short at market prices."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, when you exercise calls, you pay the person that sold you the contract, not the open market."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably the opposite,he is paying the contract writer $12 a share. The contract writer has to go buy them on the open market."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If the people who sold the contract actually own the 50,000 shares then ownership will just transfer to DFV. If they don't own the 50,000 shares they will be forced to buy them off the open market which will probably  cause the price to go up more"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not unless there's another 50,000 shares that need to be bought to cover similarly deep ITM investors. At this point, all the normal investors at those low prices have either already exercised or intend to exercise at expiration, so there shares have been covered or are being covered already.

The real movement will come if currently far out of the money calls suddenly become ITM last-minute, forcing options writers to buy shares on the market to hedge against exercising. Calls that have been deep ITM since early January and mid February have long since been at least partially covered."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not if they‚Äôve already been hedged, no. And give the price has been well over $12 for a good long while I‚Äôm willing to bet it‚Äôs already been fully hedged, probably back in December/ early January, and if not then, for sure when it stabilized around $40 in February. Whoever sold him those calls knew they‚Äôd be exercised if the price went over $12, I really doubt they waited until now when the price was $200 to start covering"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"When selling covered calls is the objective to make money off of the premium and hope your shares don‚Äôt get called away?

Edit: i know this is WSB but I‚Äôm trying to learn a little even if it‚Äôs from ü¶ç"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you‚Äôre right, definitely hedged, I just didn‚Äôt feel confident stating that.

That is why everyone should avoid deep OTM calls with short expirations. Ignore the premiums, it‚Äôs easy friggin money for MMs and hurts our cause.

That‚Äôs why I think it‚Äôs the shorts taking out options strikes deep OTM. If it‚Äôs true they can convert short positions that way it becomes a cluster."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, I made 200% on $22c on AMC a month or so ago. Within a day it would‚Äôve been worthless. 

Buy stock. Hold stock."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate the feedback! You humble me.

I‚Äôve learned so much from people across multiple subs and what we need to be showing each other is how much we genuinely care for the retail investor. 

Even the YOLO fools, though DFV‚Äôs moves look less like a YOLO and more like the smartest, most stable move ever lol.

The time will come when our involvement (Reddit army) will be brought into the limelight like never before - it hasn‚Äôt happened yet!

My hope is that they look at us as a solution to the problem, and our moxy is effen strong. We need to spread kindness and change the world if we believe to be the solution, otherwise the villains will villanize US."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If he's still in, I'm still in"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup. He sold some of the calls back at the first launch attempt in January, turning 10,000 in investment into $11 million in cash. 

Given that his entire investment is less than a million so far, he's come out FAR ahead on this deal no matter what happens from here forward. He could exercise those calls and then watch the stock crater back to $4 a share the next day, and he's still made out like a bandit."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depends how loose your definition of ""one of the largest shareholders"" is.

He has far more shares than you or me, but even if he executes all his options for a total position of 150,000 shares, that's still only 0.003% of the available shares. He's almost definitely in the top 1% of individual retail holders, but that doesn't mean that much in terms of power/influence on the company."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"50,000.  Each call is 100 shares"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I truly think they should have had him make a guest appearance on their earnings call.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Where‚Äôs there ever any question
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,All we can do is hope that smarter and richer apes than us have this figured out and want to really take us on this journey with them and is not just using as as fodder.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,How much did you make off gme?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro.. is clear DFV is holding so you apes dont start sending him threats like with the other guys. He is set for life at this point.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Or make sure he lives like a king and secure his entire family‚Äôs future for generations.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre right. DFV took this play like an absolute professional
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure, he *could* hold, but it makes the most sense to sell for maximum gain and simply pay the short term tax.

Taxes should be second here. 

I mean, if we were so worried about taxes, we could just hold until it‚Äôs a loss, then no taxes!!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I checked out his first yolo post of everyone shitting on him
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Do I see it right: from 1k option ns to 100k?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Nothing gets me harder than looking at the comments that laughed in his face. Who‚Äôs laughing now fuckers
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"He needed to free up some cash so he can execute the calls, which I imagine is what he is going to do."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm willing to bet money come April 16th DFV will exercise his 12 dollar calls and then he will own 150,000 shares of GME!!"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,He doesnt need to sell any of them hes sitting on 12 million in cash rn
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve got 50k invested and it‚Äôs not even worth 30k lol
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Vsauce, Michael here..."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"My bad, I thought the 100,000 were options he paid .267 for. Now I see they are shares he paid $26.79 for. Huge difference."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't forget he had to pay lawyers too.  He for sure ain't no dunby and I'm sure he  got a *really good lawyer* to help him write his speech/testimony for congress.

He likes the stock."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think he sold in the high 200s, low 300s, so it was at a great price.  

Doubled down in the $40s, so his timing is spot on!   Which is why his balls are so big."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look up options. He is saying that he wants to be able to buy 100 shares of GME for $12 a share, for each contract. The $20 per contract he paid is for locking in that commitment. As the price goes over $12 (strike price), the contracts are worth more. It gets much more complicated but that‚Äôs the basic idea"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's a contract to buy 100 shares for $12 each on or before April 16th, you pay a premium to the seller of the contract. The premium paid will give you an idea of how confident the seller is that they won't be losing money on the deal. It costed dfv 20 cents per share, so $20 per contract, meaning the seller thought it was so unlikely that they would be over $12 on April 16th that they were fine making only 20 cents per share. 

DFV bought 1000 of such contracts, he sold 500 of them I think around the end of January iirc, which is how he ended up with over 10MM in cash."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's a contract.  He paid someone $20 for a contract that at any time of his choosing, the person selling him the contract is obligated and required to sell him 100 shares of GME for $12 a share.  The contract expires on April 16th, 2021.  The value of that contract is $0 at any time GME share price was below $12.  If it remained below $12 the entire length of the contracts term, the seller made the profit of $20 per share and walks away with the money.

However instead the price skyrocketed as you know.  So at any point, DFV can exercise those 500 contracts that he paid $10,000 for, and force the seller to sell him 50,000 shares of GME for a total of $600,000.

DFV now owns 50,000 shares of $GME, with a current fair market value of ~$9,500,000 at the time of this screen shot.

You can also just sell the contract itself to someone else.  They will instead just directly pay you the difference between the ""strike price"" of the contract ($12/share) times the current stock price (~$192/share at the time of the screenshot) and you just walk away with the cash instead of the shares to sell, without having to come up with the $600,000 cash to buy the shares.

In this case, the offer for the calls is listed on the left there.  $179.70.  Times 100 shares per option = $17,970.  Times 500 call option contracts = $8,985,000."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right now just 1 out of those 500, **fucking .002 of his position**, would get him almost 100% return on the entire position. It's nearly incomprehensible."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"But covered calls are covered, meaning your profit was locked in as long as it was going up?

:)  were you FOMO'ing the rise and tried to get out to ride it or something?  (honest question.  sounds like something my brain would think is a good idea in the moment...)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Okay it's only minus to exit the position. you were still up 12k

I had gotten into GME really low, but I paperhanded once I thought the profits were running out. The next day was the giant overnight spike and people started posting his yolo all over the place. I read back into GME, rebought, and I've been up and down and right now I'm running pretty much even. If I had taken his advice at my initial buy-in and held I would be up over 500%."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Makes sense. Thank you
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok that clears it up well. Thank you!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok that clears it up. Thanks for the response!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Unless the actually  own the shares
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct, covered calls are obviously the smarter way to sell calls. Selling naked calls/puts means you don't have the shares in hand and is straight up gambling hoping to get the premium without any safety net. This is why Melvin and Citadel are fucked in the first place. Unrestricted gambling."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"People buy deep OTM calls with short expirations as lotto tickets. MMs are a neutral party that provides liquidity for people who want to buy these contracts. The transaction actually is still a bullish sentiment and requires the MM to buy GME shares to hedge. So overall it helps GME. If the price of GME continues to rise, MM has to keep buying more shares to hedge. This is what causes gamma squeezes. When enough OTM calls start to get close to ITM, MM need to buy more and more shares. This results in the squeeze.

If you think about it from a shorter's position, it doesn't make sense to buy deep OTM calls to ""hedge"" or ""cover"". From a delta standpoint, it doesn't change their overall delta exposure much, and it costs them money to do so. More likely than not, they will be losing even more money by doing this unless they can flip the contracts for a profit."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for sharing. Something everyone should see. Facking legend
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The best one by far is this:

Right now it's literally the world's most talked about YOLO. Just goes to show, most people on the internet have no fucking clue what they're on about.

Also this one is pretty good:

> Aged like milk in the sun"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,He wasn't wrong. He was early.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Still can‚Äôt believe he didn‚Äôt sell the calls when it hit $400+ with 700% IV those premiums were absolutely insane, especially w 3 months left to expiration. Hard to imagine shares going high enough to make up for the absurd premium he could have grabbed selling those. The man has a plan though and he‚Äôs stuck to it this far so I can‚Äôt judge"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"How many people are in the room with you? Zero.

I am not a cat."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,The lawyer: ‚ÄúWe like the client‚Äù
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Clarifying that he as a matter of fact is indeed not a cat was crucial I believe!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You, Sir, nailed it! 

Small addendum: 

>He is saying that he wants to be able to buy 100 shares of GME for $12 a share for each contract ***[on or before the 16th of April 2021]***

The expiration time is crucial for an options, since it gives the seller a way of estimating how likely it is to happen.


The more time, the more can change."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"> He is saying that he wants to be able to buy 100 shares of GME for $12 a share, for each contract. The $20 per contract he paid is for locking in that commitment.

So if he paid $20 for each contract already, doesn't that mean the price has to be above $32/share ($20 contract price plus the $12 share price) on April 16th to make money on it?

Not that I'm saying it won't be, lol, I'm just trying to get a better understanding of the process."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,FINALLY a simplified explain action that I can fucking understand about call options. THANK YOU SIR!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correction, if the contract is never in the money, the seller of the contract made the profit of 20 CENTS per share, not 20 dollars. They were so confident it would not be worth $12 that they were fine making only 20 cents per share for that risk."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Almost like I would call it a deep value play
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably this.  He could have bought back the calls, raising his original cost basis, then selling new covered calls at a higher strike.  The math works out the same as just buying 100 shares at the current price and writing a covered call from there."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only up $6k because he was upside down by $6k when he entered the position. If his numbers are correct, selling calls at a $37 Strike for $12 premium per share when his cost was $43 per share, that means he would have been assigned at an effective cost basis of $49 per share, meaning $6 profit x 1000 shares = $6k."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you know your GME, then you would know where he‚Äôs coming from..."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay so if i own 100 shares of a stock with a cost basis of $9 and it‚Äôs sitting around $14, should i sell calls with a strike price higher than $14 to try and collect premiums ?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lotto tickets yes. Interesting sentiment.

I don‚Äôt think MMs hedge at all though unless the strike price is approaching ATM. Even if they did, and it supported bullish sentiment, they are profiting off of those shares more of the person just closes their position up some bucks instead of exercising, then the MM sells their shares and makes money on that.

I could be completely wrong though. There‚Äôs a lot of theories and I‚Äôve witnessed too many times the past few months where tons of options expiring ITM didn‚Äôt do any sort of Gamma squeeze the following week. Likely because MMs bought already and the shares were transferred, less so a catalyst"

I wasn't sure the exact price his first batch of shares was at and didn't stop to look it up when commenting, so I threw a high estimate to make sure I didn't understate it.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're missing the part where a contract is for the 'option' to buy/sell 100 shares, so that's why brokers show the prices as 0.20¬¢ per share to buy the contract. So to fix what you wrote, it'd be 12 + 0.20¬¢ = 12.20 per share to breakeven."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"No. Each contract has many shares, I think 100 shares per .  He is not paying 20 bucks per share on a 12 dollar strike that would be fucking pointless."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What you  are trying to figure out is his breakeven price. The price he starts to make a profit. Each option corresponds to 100 shares. He paid $20 to buy 1 call options. You would divide the $20(aka the premium) buy 100 which would be .2 and add that to the options strike ($12) which means  his breakeven would be $12.20.  As long as the share price of GME is above 12.20 before the expiry date DFV makes money or he can choose to sell the options to someone else before it expires.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Think of a call as the same as the option period when buying a home. You're paying a premium to buy something at a later date.

You might pay 1k upfront for the right to buy a home at 200k and have a week to decide. (Your contract expiration date)

If the housing market soars and that house is now worth 300k, well tough shit to the seller, you're contracted for the next week that you have the right to buy that house at 200k. So you can excercise your option and buy the house at 200k even though it's worth way more.

If the housing market tanks and now the home is only worth 100k prior to the expiration period, then you can walk away and just lose your 1k (premium cost upfront)."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Uhhh... I think the only comparable  depths known to man are tied between the Mariana Trench and Ken Griffin's impacted colon when this is over.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only if you think the price would go lower than the amount above $14. If you make the strike price $16 and the price goes to $20, you're losing value $4 per share. If the strike is at $16 and it goes to $15.99 on expiration you collect the premium and are safe because the price did not exceed the strike, which the contract buyer does not have the right to exercise aka execute the order and collect the shares. The Strike Price makes all the difference."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The MMs actively hedge depending on the delta of an option. Or else a black swan event can wipe them out. There is 0 reason for them to sell naked calls. They are there to provide liquidity for the options market. They simply profit off theta decay, which is why they remain delta neutral on all their positions. This is not a theory, this is a fact.

Gamma squeeze isn't caused by ""tons of options expiring itm"". It is caused by there being a skewed amount of open interest on OTM options. Then some catalyst causes the underlying stock to quickly rise in price, thus causing the deltas of the otm calls to rapidly increase. When the deltas increase, the MMs need to purchase more shares to remain delta neutral. A Gamma Squeeze amplifies a stocks momentum, it does not create it. Hope that helps."

Mainly for nostalgic reasons and to occasionally revisit a game. The other reason is because after spending $30-$60 on a game, I can‚Äôt sell it for $1.50. I‚Äôd rather let it collect dust than sell it for that. Lastly, if you buy digital, you have nothing to show for your investment. If/when the console company retires that console and closes that store, you are left with a digital copy and no way to get a replacement if your hard drive fails. I can always go online and find a physical copy to put into my disc based system if my original is damaged."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This guy's right on the money. Only note i would make is ...

>  If the strike is at $16 and it goes to $15.99 on expiration you collect the premium and are safe because the price did not exceed the strike, which the contract buyer does not have the right to exercise aka execute the order and collect the shares. The Strike Price makes all the difference.

This isn't strictly true. Option holder can choose to exercise an out of the money option (generally it's only automatic if in the money) and they might choose to do that for some reason if it's close to the strike price. Capturing a dividend date or locking in a price after hours, are examples

If you're interested in this kind of trading read up on ""the wheel"" and generally exit before expiry - don't risk it!"

It will be interesting to see how the market will react to this.

It's $2 above VIAC and was likely shorted down by arbitraguers from $100 to match the crash in VIAC when Archegos got liquidated.

DISCB exploded in the same setup today when the shorts got squeezed by how illiquid that class of shares is.  VIACA is similarly illiquid.

The key is somewhere around a difference of $5 between VIACA and VIAC.  If the difference gets that large I think the arbitraguers will panic and cover on VIACA sending it to $80-100."

I‚Äôve personally used them for a certification - and it was incredibly valuable. Graduated college over a decade ago and took college level courses on Coursera in a new topic. Learned a ton and loved the format. Shared the certificate on LinkedIn, saw a $10k raise specifically linked to the new skills I learned in less than 6 months.

Professionally, we are now buying their enterprise training suite for our employees. They‚Äôre confident in negotiating and getting good numbers. A lot of their competitors haven‚Äôt updated in over a decade and don‚Äôt have the latest and greatest tech of the breadth of content.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let this comment in the GME thread be remembered as how I sacrificed all of my karma for a moment of reason:


The stock is still hugely overvalued even if Gamestop puts together a killer plan to build a website that sells video games and hardware (in 2021/2022) and executes said plan. The company's best move right now is sell the shares they bought back last year for billions in profit. They would be well capitalized to move ahead and extremely foolish to not make that move at the current share value.


Edit: you guys are absolutely delusional, clueless, greedy, or all of the above. If you actually cared one bit about the success of Gamestop, you would understand a share offering at the current market value would be a huge win for Gamestop. But you don't care because you are bunch of greedy fools using Gamestop to fulfill your hedge-fund-slayer LARP.


Edit 2: I don't need to be a CFO of a multi-billion dollar company to understand this is a no-brainer move by Gamestop. They repurchased 40 percent of their outstanding shares in 2019 and 2020 for $5 per share. Now, they have the opportunity to sell those same shares back at $100 per share or more. They would make billions of dollars in profit for its long-term shareholders."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The bigger picture is MVIS is producing Lidar too. This contract has nothing to do with their lidar vertical. So now it might be in Microsofts best interest to buy MVIS so they don't have to pay royalties. Rumor is Google is the interested party for the MVIS buyout. Do you think Microsoft really wants to pay Google royalties if that's the case? In other words, a bidding war might be on the horizon for MVIS buyout"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Dohhhh wishing you kept ten percent back. Great job. This one is real steel and going nowhere over eighteen months but up. Hey back in when you get a dip in a few days
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I saw DD on this sub, seemed legit"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I had a good sized position in this, sold for a small gain this week to ride UWMC. I don't think the FDA is going to rule on the MRTP until a permanent commissioner is confirmed, and that seems like a ways off. Definitely keeping an eye on the stock though."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,No matter how much good news or DD comes out on blackberry the stonk keeps dropping. Remember buying the dip a few months ago and it just broke its support level again below $9. Feel like this might go to $6 again before it started blowing up. Down 50% but thinking about buying the dip ! this has to be the last dip right before it takes off right ??
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"this means nothing as the stock continues to tank

Holding 50 @ $20.70 - come get me"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy the dip. This is a 2023 stock.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes will dip again

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Was that before China stole half of it
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"BB is shit. 

Nobody wants their tech and hasn‚Äôt since their phones came on scene 15 years ago. 

Their bullshit excuse that they missed revenue because they‚Äôre trying to sell pattern licensing is just that - total bullshit."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,So you're saying it should be about $2 per share?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Hope is not a strategy
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,today my bday. just bought 55 shares. At some point red line turns green i think.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I believe BB will continue to go up after all the bad reps because it can still maintain its eps which is more important than revenue for shareholders. In other words, despite loss in Revenue ""To an average person, a company's gross¬†revenue¬†is the barometer for success, but as a smart stock market investor, you have to drill down even further with your fundamental analysis when considering buying (or selling) a stock, and that leads you to the¬†most important¬†metric of all,¬†earnings per share¬†(EPS)."" Like Mr. Chen said when pandemic problems improves so will BB revenue - give it a few more quarters to mid 2022 year BB should have better tractions. At least give BB a chance to roll out its IVY to win OEM and earning. I'm extremely optimistic and can't say how much excited I am. Trust me most companies do not make in this pandemic anyway, revenue or eps are compromised."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is wallstreetbets not r/investing
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Who knows, my own opinion is that if the sale went through it would be in the range of $2-3b. RBC are low ballers"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,OP bought into the BB hype and is now bag holding
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Proof? or you're just one of those China = bad morons.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Why the fuck are you holding at $20?????? Dump and reset your cost basis.""

ofc you're the same retard who posted that earlier."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hopium is a helluva drug.


Also I have hundreds of shares üòî"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,$BB TO THE MOON KEEP HOLDING FRIEND 2023 WE WILL BE DANCING ON THE MOON $BB TO $200
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"But BB has beaten its EPS in the previous quarters but this time it just about managed to meet it. Furthermore a drop in revenue could be indicating a bigger issue at hand. a drop in market share, perhaps. will have to see how next earnings is."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Why do people keep parroting this?  DFV bought GME 8 or 9 months ago because he thought it was a good long term investment and everyone here treats him like the 2nd coming of Christ.  All investing is a bet / educated guess regardless of the timeframe.  Bets don't need to play out the next day or the next week.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is still wallstreetbets. Have you seen the retarded plays people have done on BB. This is like a parlay. You're betting on all the pieces coming together for massive gains. Next 3-6 months will give an indication if we fucked or not.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,If you can't sell it then it's not worth anything...
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm holding a bag on it too, but it's not a huge bag. Just bought in for the hype. Maybe the hype will bring it back. 

That blackberry hasn't been bankrupt ten times over now is sort of a miracle."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"What‚Äôs your point???????

BB is shit. They‚Äôve proven that the past 15 years and now they keep on with their lies and excuses. 

They‚Äôre trying to sell patent licenses and that‚Äôs why they missed the operating revenue mark by a sizeable gap????? Yep makes sense."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I too enjoy getting high on BB
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,They supposedly have a buyer lined up. Or Chen is so stupid I can't even quantify it. There is no way somebody is so absolutely clueless that they would defer licensing payments without some time of assurance.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"10 years ago they were huge , just been a slow death if you look at yearly earnings and stock price. Just down hill for a decade with no stop in sight"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You sound retarded/misinformed.

 They were not licensing out those patents because they are negotiating a sale to a NA company. This is expected to result in a big lump sum payment and trailing payments for the next 7 years, if the deal goes through. Considering these patents are related to mobile/networking, this is bullish for what BB is now in. Their qnx related sales were hit by the chip shortage (literally google this if you think this is bs). 

The company has recently under went rebranding and now increasing their sales team. You said before no one wants their tech, LOL just read all of the partnerships they acquired this year."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,except it's like PLTR in the way that it's been working hard on the down low and they'll reap benefits down the line.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You don‚Äôt get the point. 

A potential divestiture of a segment of the business has absolutely zero to do with current and ongoing revenue streams. Their excuse that they missed the revenue target by a wide margin because of a potential transaction is complete and total bullshit."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly. They don't make fucking phones anymore. Every G7 country uses their shit for a reason and has for a long time.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,When‚Äôs the last xpiry
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep same, still holding. Actually, I'm so retarded that I even added more on ü§°"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same boat, BB is still Bae though, she just needs some time to grow into herself"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah definitely regretting some of my calls but I also loaded up on some stock and I still feel good about the company
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I think this is going to be a good long term play. I'm averaging down now that it's on sale.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"In at 20 and averaged down to 14. Feels nice doing the DD, checking the math, having them release more good news and shit still tanking. 

Hit that point where reclaiming the value isn‚Äôt worth it vs just writing it off, so it gets to sit in long term forever. Or until I need a fat chunk of loss for the tax man, maybe? Would that even work?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,bought the fucking turd at 21 - FML
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,BB is going places. Just hold and you'll be fine.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ever notice on the chart when a stock goes sideways, the bollinger band creates a narrow channel and candlesticks rides within the narro w channel.  What I‚Äôve noted is that most of time, at end of narrow channel, the % of stock popping compared to going down is hi. I will take those odds"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,why is everyone fucking rich here. Can't even afford 1% of this. Fuck my life :(
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I'll be joining you with the exact same amount on Monday
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"$15k in shares is not a yolo. This is an r/investing play. You have unlimited time for it to work out, or at least break even.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"MVIS making waves before their April Lidar sample.  They knock that out of the park, and their buyout price just skyrocketed.  One of the most future proof companies out there, and the value is starting to be seen"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for sharing
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I cashed out last week at 18.50 just a couple hours before it started tanking. Bought back in at 14.40. This ski jump is the only thing saving my portfolio now.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Of course it did. Right after I sold....ffs
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Finally!! AIMBOT in real life!! Go US military!

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone know why the sudden pop at 3'o clock?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Have 275 shares @ 14.65 average. Sold 2 $25 C 04/16 contracts and was feeling pretty good about making up for some losses. Now I'm worried. Should I buy the 2 contracts out?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck yeah! 20k share gang! There's a lot more on their runway, so holding until we see a buyout or obscene prices!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What's the connection between Microsoft and Microvision? Did I miss something obvious here?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love this stock, she dips enough to load up, then flies on a regular, let's hope we can break the $20 resistance soon."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I started holding this when Trey's trades said it would go into the hundreds.. I bought around 18 thinking it wouldn't go below 20 once it went over. I was hating on him and myself for a while. I kept seeing news stories posting that MVIS is a joke.. then this happens. I have to remember to go against the news.. But I never sold so I'm glad it's up but for how long.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bought in under 1$, averaged up to 13, sold all at 15 and bought all back in at 11. All the true longs know how tough it's been, nothing but hate everywhere for this honey pot of a stock"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What does this company do exactly?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"My hot take:

$TRMB will be more influential for $MSFT hololens applications primarily due to geospatial abs indoor positioning tech plus lidar."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"here, have an upvote"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You dummy. MVIS is one of the meme stocks here that has long term viability
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Been holding at $20 and hoping for the April showcase as well.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"what made the price go up, didn't followed this stock"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Same.  Then I saw the yearly chart.  I'm a moron.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice! got in for 1k @ 1.40
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I was going sideways/down for a while - so understand the temptation to sell
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Microsoft was announced as the winner of an Army contract for AR headsets. Microsoft Is A Long Standing Customer For Augmented-Reality Modules From Microvision.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Some of the Underlying technology is made by MVIS.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The U.S Army granted Microsoft a 10 year - $21 Billion dollar contract in order to continue to use their Hololens, which Microvision is the engine for.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/31/microsoft-army-augmented-reality/"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Explanation (not financial advice)  : Stonks only go up. This is the way!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,The Hololens uses MicroVision chips
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Not just MS. Good chance niantic will also be using Mivrovision light engine. They also have one of the best lidar systems available.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is just a good stock doing good stock things.

But I require another dip now, as I have sold for tendies today."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The contracts are made money right now. $10 s over what you paid  Or do you like to gamble? I am hoping for more than $25 a share, but it's a gamble. I have been on both sides of options. Now I have just shares  Time decay might help you soon. Whatever you decide Good luck."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Augmented reality from Microsoft uses a microvision component. And Microsoft just got a big military contract for augmented reality
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,They use mvis tech in their hololens
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Check out r/MVIS
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, forgot non-lemming opinions were ok, my bad üòÇ"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you hold tho?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,üòÇ
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You are savage! But I gave him an pity upvote also..
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Mvis is not a meme stock and had never been. Clearly you have not been following the market long. Mvis been around since before you were born probably.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bought at 9 sold today 18.75

Just need another dip so I can keep riding the train. But didn't want to regret it and hold a bag so took some tendies."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,DOD contract apparently
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way. ^^
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah, as I though then. Thanks :)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Very cool, though it might have been something like that, thanks :)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean i'd still include AMD as a meme stock back in '17.  idk how 'serious' the company is, but it's being meme'd out."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,The best bags are always filled with regret tho...
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If microvision has taught me anything, it‚Äôs that this stock consistently goes up 35% and then down 40% the very next day, only to go up 50% the day after that and then down 40% the following day. I think selling today was a wise choice."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I have enough of those already!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"this is the third time this story has been posted here, and imo it's kind of bullshit. all the wash sale rule does is add the loss to your cost basis for the next trade of the same security or ‚Äúsubstantially identical‚Äù security so in order to get hit by it you'd have to be doing something really strange in order not to recapture that loss on the next trade. they don't really explain that at all in the article making it sound like the loss just doesn't count which is not correct."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Prime WSB material there. Show yourself!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Trading between $200K and $2M a day. God damn
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is nonsense. Taxation is based on accretion to wealth. If you provide the cost basis for your transactions, you can't be taxed for more than the difference between the sale and the purchase price."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The IRS is reasonable and will likely allow him to... nope he‚Äôs fkd, it‚Äôs gives no fks"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is me but not 800k, except I didn't make money, but still got hit with wash sales. I still don't understand wash sales."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What the fuck can you do in that situation? Looks like the only option at that point is to put everything into gme and let those tendies pay his tax bill. May be the only thing stupid enough to work
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,TD just adjusts my cost basis to reflect the wash sale and it changes my average purchased price. Did it with GME when I bought back in at 45 and it showed my average cost per share was like $95.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,GUH
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"All he has to do is claim trader status, which it sounds like he qualifies for, and problem solved. May cost him a few hundred bucks to have his accountant amend the return, but no real harm done."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Can some1 eli5 how this is possible?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Find yourself an accountant worth their shit if you are day trading.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I cant imagine how this could happen unless youre using some really suspect broker.

On most and probably all brokers your wash sales are accounted for instantly and added into your following position with a wash sale.. there wont be any surprises at the end of the  year during taxes"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Boooo!!!! I get why the rule is there, but they should really look at net gains for all investments, not piecemeal things apart with the wash rule..."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Goddamn. Pour one out for the homie
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Gotta love the IRS
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"rofls - so in other words - he made profits of 2m or whatever to incur a 800k tax bill, but couldn't count any of the losses, which was essentially 45k less than whatever profits he made. LOLOL. This why you gotta rotate buckets."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Pfffffff. Someone made money. Tf
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Simple just take profits and üíé ‚úã those losses until they're green
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this what T1 is about
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Well played
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Sure but isn‚Äôt the max loss you can deduct still only 3k a year?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,hodl britches
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Someone literally told me yesterday i was dumb and america doesnt have that rule, how wrong that man is."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This retard just didn‚Äôt realize that you have to calculate the wash sale yourself if the broker is dog shit. You add the loss to your new shares cost basis and profit/loss gets decided on that price. If u sell after year ends with a wash sale, then the tax situation sucks ass."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"and bought more at close, love the manipulated drop!!!!   those 200s are in the mix...  not that i care, uvxy looking crazy crazy cheap, but eye on the prize... hodl britches!!!!!!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,i did not know about this rule. thanks
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, but what is this ""sell""? üíéüëê"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,true that. It is indeed a bullshit story.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe he lost it all the next year, before tax time."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Selling in your taxable account, then rebuying in IRA.  Wash rule disallows the taxable account loss and stepped up basis doesnt matter in IRA, its 100% taxed"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,More fear to throw at us. They can suck it
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not BS, disallowed wash sales do exist, the main culprit is usually day trading pennies like a mad man, the accounting software for your broker ultimately decides your fate, if it reports x amount, x amount it is and you're toast"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,The rule is going n place to prevent you from selling a stock that is down for a loss and then buying it back immediately so they can claim a loss on their taxes but not actually change their investment.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It prevents people from making a profit then taking a loss on purpose to write off the taxes. I just learned about it lol
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've noticed disallowed wash sales mostly happen when averaging down a cost basis and subsequently selling for a loss, the fact that the default execution order for any broker is FIFO I think contributes to this as well, especially in the context of intraday trading"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The IRS does payment plans.

He'll probably have a long one."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Bankruptcy
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You trade x stock throughout the year never waiting for 30 days before buying back into the same stock.

Every time you win its listed as a taxable realized gain. Every time you lose the loss gets disqualified because you don‚Äôt wait 30 days before buying back in.

You sell again in December, don‚Äôt wait the 30 days  and buy back into the same stock in January. Your losses are now carried over into the new tax year but every gain you made last year is taxable."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets," the irs kept track of every winning trade he had and added it to his tax liability while completely ignoring his losses, because of a rule they have that erasing a loss if you buy the stock back within a month of having sold it at a loss. That means that everyday this guy was just adding small wins to his tax bill, all the while in reality keeping his winnings down by also realizing small losses, but those losses were  completely ignored by the irs because he was buying back in within a matter of minutes or hours. Most brokers can and do track your wash sales (ignored losses) so that you can see the effect they have on your tax liability, but in some cases the rule isnt automatically tracked and this guy clearly could not see their effect or was just completely ignorant to the meaning."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Helps stop fraud
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I kinda feel like this is easy to avoid if you just, ya know, don‚Äôt claim the loss. At least for the thirty days"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,no
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What does that have to do with this
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"NET loss. Your losses offset gains until you're 3k in the hole, at which point you can't deduct anymore that year but those losses can be carried over to follow years."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its should have been tra ked automatically by rh too, no? Maybe he was skimming options contracts too, i dont think most brokers keep track of wash sale rules as they relate to options."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"could be, rough year."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you sure about that? I often buy/sell the same stocks in a cash acct and a rollover IRA acct. I don't recall ever seeing an incident where my actions in the rollover IRA acct affected my actions in the cash acct.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,fuck iras anyway unless you are getting matched.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Infinite money glitch
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Does it have to be the same stock? Also are options with different strikes/expirations considered different for this rule?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"So I‚Äôm trying to wrap my head around this. Say this trader buy into a security at 40 with 1 share, it goes to 80 and he sells his share for a $40 profit. Then the stock drops to 60 and he says ‚Äúwell shit, I‚Äôm gonna buy back in‚Äù and does so. From there, the stock continues to drop, and at 40 he says ‚Äúfuck it, I‚Äôm out‚Äù and sells for a loss of 20.‚Äù  The next day, it hits 42 and he says ‚Äúhey maybe it hit bottom, and he buys back in (at this point the wash is created correct?). The price goes to 52, and he sells again for a 10 profit. 

At this point, he‚Äôs sold for $50 total gains, and $20 total loss leaving him with $30. However, he‚Äôll still be taxed as though he made $50 correct? If he had waited 30 days between buys; he‚Äôd get to write off that $20 loss, but since he didn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs as though it never happened. 

Suppose he then doesn‚Äôt trade that security for the next 6 months before tax time rolls around - is there ever a point where the $20 loss is realized, or is it as if it just never happened, and only the gains happened? 

Not looking for financial or tax advice and you‚Äôre not liable or anything, just curious on how this concept works"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I might be missing something but even if he waited 30 days he would still only be able to deduct 3k in losses
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,IRS has not even defined wash sale rules for options and its very difficult to track even for the brokers who track it.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Capone didnt self report his income either until audited
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"wash sale applies to any of your accounts as well as your wifes accounts.  Good news, her boyfriend‚Äôs account aren‚Äôt applicable so you could just load some cash onto there if he lets you.

Edit for clarity: you can‚Äôt get wash saled just with ira though because you obviously don‚Äôt get to claim losses anyway.

For instance, you sell a stock at a loss in your cash account, then you rebuy into your ira. You can‚Äôt claim the loss."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol, pretty dumb sentiment.  

Might not be for you, but easiest tool to avoid some taxes."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mmmmmm so close. Youre right about everything up to the second sale. When he buys back at 42, typically, the wash sale qill be tracked by the broker and his loss will get tacked onto the cost basis for his new share, so it will seem as though he bought back at 62 rather than 42. So then by selling at 52 later on but within the same tax year (or quarter depending on how you file)  he effectively erased half of his origional loss but will still realise an 8 dollar loss originating from the first sale."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The loss is realized after 31 days, without overcomplicating it if you close out a wash sale stock before the end of the year (I honestly don't know the exact date because this hasn't happened to me), let's just say before Thanksgiving, then your losses are cemented and 'correctly' taxed for ALL of the wash sales you made.

TL;DR I can trade at a wash 1000x for $1 gain and $1000 loss in April and so long as I close the position before thanksgiving I can claim $999 loss."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also he has to exit the security to have an offset. The irs is a rolling 12mo window, so on long term plays, the complex can have complications

I read this as he‚Äôs still holding something if he has that wide of a disparity"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,No it doesn't. He can still claim the loss.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only if hes net negative, if he made 45k in realized gains then, as long as a loss doesnt get erased by a wash sale, it will be deducted from his gains right up until hes -3k net for the year"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Phew thank god. I haven‚Äôt done taxes yet, and thought I was fucked."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"more of a tax gamble imo, if you are getting matched then it's a no-brainer."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The problem arises when someone carries a wash sale balance over into the next tax year. Say he buys back in at 42 on  jan 1st after originally selling at 40 in December. For the previous year, hes now liable for the full 40 dollar gain because he essentially erased that loss off of last years taxable gains by buying back in."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same. I started investing with wealth simple (Canadian RH) and immediately thought I could day trade. Cause fuck doing homework or learning the basics of something new. Yolo

Got smarter a week later. Been holding everything since"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If he had waiting until february to buy back in the second time, his 20 dollar loss would have been figured into the previus year tax bill and hed only be liable for a 20 dollar gain in that year because his second biy back felloutside of the wash sale window"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You mean you‚Äôre holding in a TFSA? Because you can day trade in Canada, just in a personal account."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the educating! I have a tax professional who handles my taxes, but it‚Äôs nice to have a vague idea of how that works! Cheers!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Short the expensive one, long the cheap one = profit?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Much of the recent VIacom drop could be attributed to a combination of mean reversion after significant outperformance and the news of a capital raise.
The stock more than doubled in less than two months and was overbought with an RSI over 80.
It‚Äôs now oversold but still slightly above it‚Äôs rising 200 day moving average. This should be a decent setup."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm so glad someone else has figured out that VIACA is the play to make right now.  Too many people are locked on to VIAC, with its much large float."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You beat me to it. I will be posting a long form DD over the next couple days on VIACA. In short, the banks, GS MS Nomura CS, all built enormous positions over the past seven months (hint hint Archegos) and now are tripping over themselves to sell VIAC. Given the insane volume from the past few days, that selling looks close to, if not entirely, finished.That makes the setup for VIACA very very similar to DISCB with a pretty underpriced company underneath it all. Arbitrage teams may have been caught offsides there, too, which makes me wonder how they are positioned in VIACA/VIAC.

I am in the April 60c and 70c for a lot, built the positions over the past two days and probably will keep buying tomorrow.

High risk, speculative, mildly informed, and retarded. The true WSB way."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm in for 1 DISCA call
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well fuck me. Yesterday bought 10 calls 4/16, $45 strike for DISCA. Sonofabitch"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Smoothbrain reporting, let me make sure I got this right:

VIACA is going to take off relative to VIAC just like DISCB blew up today vs DISC? 

So calls on VIACA?

Puts on DISCB because it's overblown?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,i bought the wrong disc (A) because it has options...
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"DISCA is one vote, one share of DISCB is 10 votes."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just tried to buy some puts, they don't exist for DISCB."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm short Viac disca and amcx at least near term
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets, ViacomCBS Inc 1? only got this one on saxo trader
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,DISCB can't be shorted.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"one would think it would revert back to normal ratio, I went with the VIACA play anticipating a similar pop as not a shorter"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,100% agree! plus the low volume on VIACA a little buyside pressure and this pops bigly
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"What percentage attribution would you give to the overbought RSI vs. the massive selling forced by Archegos margin calls?

I'd argue that 99% of the cause of the drop is the massive selling from the Archegos margin calls.

Maybe just me though."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,preach chimaera!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I like what you just said
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd hardly call this a beating to a much more developed DD, saw a potential parallel, called it out.  Looking forward to it!!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"call volume also noticeably increased last few hours to, spread the word!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"get some VIACA, spread the word, you have a 2nd chance at it..."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"it could, just pointing out a parallel trend

DISCB doesn't have options, even more a reason for VIACA to pop!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,maybe you can buy the right VIAC(A) because it too has options...
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"right, my additional vote = more vote, not 1 vote

all about the volume, look at DISCB move today, easy to see potential for VIACA for something similar"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Something else to consider...DISCB does not have options like DISCA does.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,go long VIACA calls if you think a similar pop might happen at VIACA..
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,How?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Will only know this in hindsight when total institutional and highly concentrated buy and sell data is released.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,pickup a VIACA call too ;)
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Done. Grabbed 100 shares. Hoping to grab some options tomorrow at market open

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"even more of a reason to get on VIACA, will pop even more than DISCB"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Too illiquid
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"i‚Äôll get one maybe tomorrow, spread was a bit too wide for my liking today"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Viaca calls are super pricey though
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"f yeah! spread the word, super low volume, pop this biotch!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Have calls on VIAC and DISCA. Would love for them to pop.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"right and is why it mooned, same with VIACA + options, no options on DISCB"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"totally agreed, bought anyways, put on a much lower limit than ask and it triggered, had to play with it a bit"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,get you some VIACA!! look at what DISCB did vs DISCA today... VIACA has super low volume but comes with options!!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Would be nice if instead of # it was a % of the total shares or the float - would read better.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"KYnc jelly meme is go, I got 6k to throw away tomorrow"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The #1 on this list is KYNC, which is currently trading at 0.0045 a share. Can anyone explain what the deal is there?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"How is SPY on that list? In fact, it being there kinda suggests to me there‚Äôs not a lot of RELEVANT information? Or it needs cross referencing to other lists to see a picture?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Isnt the relevant figure FTDs as proportion of float? Otherwise companies with billions of shares just have more FTDs...
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Weird, I‚Äôd expect gme on it too. Maybe the floats so small it just doesn‚Äôt rank."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You can't add them together as they're not daily values. Each day is a cumulative value.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Should be done in $ value or % of float, number of shares is relatively meaningless"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,KYNC has the same peak GME had on January. Weird.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"When will the margin call citadel? Starting to think they struck a deal to not be called so they can slowly buy back shares to deliver, thus our sideways trading"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,RYCEY's FTDs are rather interesting. Would they be shorting it to death?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Not seeing my rocket ship listed unless it‚Äôs the one w V after it. Pls correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. Can‚Äôt stop won‚Äôt stop
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Where is GME on here ?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice DD, thanks. Vigilance!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, I don't think this is useful information unless it's % of float.

KYNC looks to have billions of worthless shares.

EDIT: it should also probably be moving average of outstanding FTD. It's already aggregated, so they're adding the same shares in again and again."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Weird. Well, I have 2k to throw away, so 500000 shares it is."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hedgies want to bankrupt KYNC (get that stock to $0.00) so that they don't have to buy back the shares. This is what their goal is and shorting and ftds were their main strategies before ape movement. If it weren't for apes liking certain stocks and holding to keep the price afloat, KYNC would be what a lot of meme stocks will turn into."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably shorting it into the ground
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy, buy everywhere"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, with every broker increasing the margin rate and restricting sales, shares were tracked and delivered with much higher scrutiny.  When you trigger congressional hearings on a specific stocks people start getting their ducks in a row."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah right. If they were buying back shares, wouldn‚Äôt the stock would be climbing very quickly instead of trading sideways?   Who else would be selling GME?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone posted good DD On rycey not too long ago and it got buried. I peeped their profile and they were pretty legit. He also posted BE calls
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME is way down the list.
It has 386,618 FTDs 1st half of March.
If the total FTDs each month are added together, GME has 31,341,902 FTDs since December"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,GME only has 70mil shared and 30-something million FTDs so it's not on the list. These companies have many more shares outstanding so have more FTDs
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It's 52 week high is 0.0055. It's more likely that the company is mostly worthless with too many shares in their float.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have literally anything backing this up?

Or are you another one of those ""hedge funds are the boogeyman behind everything"" guys?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I understand correctly, any overly-shorted stock can backfire if enough people buy and raise the price, right? Obviously it won't become like GME unless it's shorted >100%, but wouldn't the price multiply if it doesn't decrease as much as shorts bet it will?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,So...we doing this or not?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Makes sense.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Well sells/buys are pretty equal. I'm hoping it's tomorrow
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Right but you can‚Äôt add them together.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea, it's got something like 3.5bil outstanding. Some doodoo OTC, though, at .0045/s, 3.5bil can shrink fast."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I won't be touching this with a ten foot pole.

[https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/KYNC/profile](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/KYNC/profile)

There's a link there to the company's latest financial report.  KYNC is either garbage, or so early in life that it doesn't have anything going for it that warrants a public float yet.

It looks like the president was recently replaced.

Twitter feed doesn't inspire confidence either.

[https://twitter.com/inckync?lang=en](https://twitter.com/inckync?lang=en)

If I had to guess I'd say it's 50/50 on whether or not this turns into some kind of PnD play for the insiders.  Any company that isn't putting out solid financial reports but has 4.5B shares outstanding is ???

That said, the folks shorting this stock either have inside information or balls of steel or both."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm doing it! Cheap and sounds fun enough!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"not only that, Citadel is masking a lot more of the numbers with conversions and complex options plays. But that's pricey. Most of these other FTDs don't involve the kind of money we are looking at with GME, so not as much money or strategy are being used to mask that behavior.  With GME, almost every statistic is suspect in some way because it's fucked with majorly"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,">With GME, almost every statistic is suspect in some way because it's fucked with majorly

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"True, and no that's not being a dick. At least not IMO, I should have worded it as such.  It's also hyperbole, since it's not every statistic.  I'll leave it up as-is since I said it tho"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you think class action lawsuits happen over night? They can take up to several years to conclude.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I got in 5 @13.10 lulzzz
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,How is the customer experience? I know one of the big draws to RKT is how easy the app is to use and how easy the company is to deal with.  Have you experienced what its like to file a claim?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean its a good point but some of the reviews (even in the big names) are same way awful
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"IMO, The shorts are relentless bashing this great company like they did in $GME. As of the end of 2020, ROOT had 323K auto and 8K renters policies in force. According to the NAIC, there were a total of 49 auto and 1 renters complaints against ROOT in 2020."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Feel free to copy my DD and post it anywhere you like!

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"this thread also feels kinda sketchy to me. Only 90 upvotes, yet a good amount of awards."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is Wall Street bets. There are other stonks available on the market. Please exit the casino if you don‚Äôt want to play.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,lol after getting upvoted you edited your post to bash $ROOT?? Fuckoff hedgie... You shorted this for too long!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed remember redbull shit took 3 years.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The customer experience is kinda crappy. Not terrible. But the communication timeline is really unnerving as a user who has to actually use it. I had a not a fault accident as a root user and you just submit a ticket essentially and are not able to actually talk to someone unless they are initiating the call. Which is not as calming as being able to get someone on the horn when you are not sure of your tow and storage fees are going to be covered by them because you car is totaled in the middle of a busy freeway on ramp and the tow truck they say is covered can‚Äôt get to you cause you‚Äôre blocking the traffic that would allow it to get to you, so the police say they are just gonna have their crew tow it to a yard...

That and they kinda pull a bait and switch. My cost doubled from year 1 to year 2 without any incidents (this was before I was rear ended. The accident happed after the renewal went way up and I was shopping for a new provider). Happened to me my sister and my fianc√©. All on our own plans, but our year 2 renewals are where 60-85% increases without any tickets or accidents. I can‚Äôt help but think they have serious customer churn."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've never seen such horrible consumer reviews from such a great company. Wouldn't be surprised if short interest continues rise past 50,60,70%"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,They do not and I hope your analysis is correct. I'd jump in if it turns around.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You are as dumb as your message thread and the product itself.....try download this junk and give it a try then post your garbage ideas.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I really hope your holy lord and savior Andrew Left of Citron Research guides you to financial success but his track record is absolutely terrible.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,The initial post was to bash root. The reason why you posted this was because you watched Andrew Lefts stream yesterday. Google Andrew left and then get a quote from root and tell me if you still wanna invest. Hard to be a hedgie when your a 23 year old college student with 4K riding on GME ü§°
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Andrew ""gamestop is going to $5"" left? I don't see what you mean he called that and look its happened"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I believe BB will continue to go up after all the bad reps because it can still maintain its eps which is more important than revenue for shareholders. In other words, despite loss in Revenue ""To an average person, a company's gross¬†revenue¬†is the barometer for success, but as a smart stock market investor, you have to drill down even further with your fundamental analysis when considering buying (or selling) a stock, and that leads you to the¬†most important¬†metric of all,¬†earnings per share¬†(EPS)."" Like Mr. Chen said when pandemic problems improves so will BB revenue - give it a few more quarters to mid 2022 year BB should have better tractions. At least give BB a chance to roll out its IVY to win OEM and earning. I'm extremely optimistic and can't say how much excited I am. Trust me most companies do not make in this pandemic anyway, revenue or eps are compromised."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell weekly puts and pocket the premium. If it dips to your target strike price and you get assigned you lower cost basis
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes!!n

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you explain to this retard ape? I just learned about selling puts recently.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Congratulations! This is retarded, I'm all in!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Pee-pee went hard at 31k
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I came for the confirmation bias but I stayed for the heroic story of your daughter. Thanks for chopping those onions.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're a damn good father. After reading your post, I'm making the MakeAWish organization my go-to for donations."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,So buy at 1k got it
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"So formula for GMEs fair value is: 

**((GME Revenue / Roblox Revenue) x Market Cap GME) / Outstanding Shares + Hype x P/S = $550**

Sounds good to me! I‚Äôm in!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,So you're saying it's a regular value at $550 or...
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn. That's a lot of nice words there soldier. 
   
I'm seeing this potential now though. The fucking merchandising opportunities alone! Their trademark could be revalued at about 1,000 times whatever it is right now thanks to January. Everyone in this sub is going to be wearing GameStop apparel. They have the opportunity to brand their own video game systems. Their own Twitch. Plus, I think once the stores are revamped, people will actually want to go play in them. It is cheaper to go to a LAN place than buy all the new games. Or maybe they go with Netflix of video games and acquire Gamefly? There are a lot of possibilities."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Many say ‚ÄòI like the stonk‚Äô, well brother, I like you.  Thanks for awesome DD and good lookin‚Äô out for you and your daughter. I‚Äôll be thinking of this post for a long time regardless of where this journey takes us. Peace. üí™üèº"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You said that GME's online sales were great ""despite the pandemic"", but I think they were great because of the pandemic. Stores are closed, either due to the planned closures or due to covid lockdowns, so the business went to the ecomm channel. 

Solid DD though, and I still like the stock with 12 shares @ $307 (pls fly again)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I see charts, I buy more"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Just bought 10 more shares just to feel alive
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the warning. I‚Äôll stop after the TLDR. ‚ù§Ô∏èüöÄ
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"My thoughts exactly. The market still expects the stock to fail, even here you have people calling gamestop overvalued, laughing at the idea that gamestop might be undervalued even though the fundamentals say otherwise.
If the market realizes gamestops true worth we will see  a value above 500 as you say.

Gamestop has always been a value play, i feel that people here forget that."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Claps hands slowly. You my dear primate are one brilliant ape. Thank you for this DD. See you in Andromeda!

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Good man right here.   I nearly lost my son due to kidney failure and Children's Mercy went above and beyond to save his life.  He's considered a miracle now with nearly zero indication of any past occurrence.   I donate all I can to that organization and IF this moons I will make sure that Ronald McDonald house gets plenty as well as Children's Mercy.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I can sleep until i feel GME's touch!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Stock price go up. Got it. Buy more and hold.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Awesome DD and the best part was about your daughter. thank you for sharing.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I disagree with the assertion that amazon will grow roughly 30% over 2 years. People recently, including myself have realized the third party manipulation of reviews of products and shitty timelines for said products. 

When I finally do find a real product, I could have got it for 10-15% cheaper elsewhere. I'm not renewing with amazon this next cycle. I think I can do better just dealing with shipping charges if it guarantees a great product for a reasonable price."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs either a fundamental play or is an arbitrage play of HF‚Äôs being over leveraged. You got to pick one. If you are saying it‚Äôs a fundamental play you need to scale down the P/E (not P/S) to typical retailers even add a small premium.

If it‚Äôs an arbitrage play none of this matters because you are playing over leverage which doesn‚Äôt account for fundamentals. They live in different worlds.

But applying over leveraged angle and multiplying it with fundamentals is a fake exponential model."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean you‚Äôre preaching to the choir on this sub
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME has ALWAYS been a deep value play. The short squeeze thesis didn't become a thing until way later. Check DD history and you'll see.

So glad my cost basis in in single digits (and paid off my initial entry in the January spike. Downvote me if you want, the peace of mind is worthwhile for me). Literally can't go tits up"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What/is there some incident or thing that will trigger another sharp jump in price? Is there going to be a squeeze as the shorts try to cover or did that already happen? Sorry for the glass brain.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,!remindme 2023
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Kind of a bunch of false premises that you're relying on here.

For one, Walmart closes stores every year.  They closed 154 last year, they close 22 the year before.  Benefit of owning the building: you can close and shut it down with no additional cost.

Which brings me to the second false premise: leasing doesn't mean you can just stop paying your lease and bounce.  They're contractually obligated to continue paying for the lease until the lease expires.  Close a store with 2-4 years left on the lease, and you're still paying for it until the lessor finds someone else to fill the space -- which is a harder thing to do with the decline of retail."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Man these comments are all circle jerking each other. Does anyone have any opinions on this besides rocket and ape emojis? It would be nice to see a legit discussion
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is singlehandedly the most garbage dd I have ever seen. Look, at best, very very very best, gamestop can get sales figures that look like Best Buys. They don't sell phones or speakers or televisions so bringing up the entire electronic sector at 88bn is retarded. A brick and mortar store that breaks out I to online sales of games, computers and consoles IS best buy. So look at their sales, take some off the top because best buy electronic sales figures in other electronics and then see where that puts gamestop. If you want to invest this as a squeeze play that is fine but do not pretend the squeeze play prices are based on fundamentals. As far as fundamentals go, they are trying to break into big o line sales in a sector that is slowly weaning it's buyers away from physical purchases... Not a good look if your only sales come from nintendo and consoles alone..."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm not gonna read this but you are right.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You're literally retarded
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,">just how massive Gamestop‚Äôs online sales growth were last year, despite the pandemic

Hahaha how is this DESPITE the pandemic?

This was a lot of words to get to a ridiculously off base conclusion."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel bad for the noobs that just joined this sub and have no idea how crazy this valuation is.  I have a friend that is convinced this thing is going to 2k and he won't hear a counter argument.  A sustained price of 550 is literally retarded.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for confirming my bias üòÅ
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,So because Amazon sells a fuck ton of desk lamps and water purifiers labeled in the category of ‚Äúelectronics‚Äù you think RC will manage to squeeze record profits out of the 0% cut the GameStop receives for a digital copy ? You people are getting more and more deluded by the day ... fancy format with 0 logic does not make for a DD ...
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Lots of words and graphs ... God job üöÄüöÄüöÄ

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I remember your daughter.  I was one of the costumed indivduals.  I don't have a lot of GME but holding until you can give your daughter as many experiences as possible.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,So sorry for your daughter. You are the best father she can get. Thanks for all your work and DD. I cant wait for the price to squeeze to donate money (too broke right now). I wish you all the best for you and your loved ones!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"When I saw Ryan Cohan‚Äôs Blockbuster tweet, I knew I had to buy.  Blockbuster was a household name, their failure to adapt to changing retail environment, and lack of interest in video streaming was their demise. Their front office was a mess, with a lot of positioned people making one bad decision after another.  Now just picture Blockbuster having a player like Ryan Cohen back in 2012 when they began to warm up to the idea of video streaming. They would have been as big or bigger than Netflix today. Well, they didn't get a Ryan Cohen, so instead of focusing on online streaming, they placed all their bets on retail. Bye-bye Blockbuster. They turned down Netflix's proposal in 2001, laughed them out of the room, instead of being open to new ideas.  Gamestop is the complete opposite of Blockbuster, they are adapting, making appropriate changes, hiring top players, and they are changing fast. I agree with this analysis and believe Gamestop‚Äôs future is bright."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This post really is way too long tho. 

TLDR; online sales platform is üöÄpotential"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stocks are based on two numbers:

1). Exploitative opportunity for future growth (can these employees create enough value)

2). Visionary leaders (do I trust these leaders to create enough value)

Is the formula ‚ÄúE and V‚Äù more than we want to spend, or is it less? If it‚Äôs undervalued, you buy, if it‚Äôs overvalued, you don‚Äôt.

Then, take a private poll. Not totally private, more like I‚Äôm sitting at dinner and say I hate the stock, and because you like sleeping with hookers too, you don‚Äôt fight me on it.

Then, take other people‚Äôs money to throw at the stock, as well as piles of shit if you hate the stock, and when the money and shit balance, you have the price.

For GME, the formula is as follows:

E = semi hard

V= Rock hard

I‚Äôll take it."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Small note, my understanding is that Walmart doesn't sell their shuttered locations to prevent competition from replacing it"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I believe in the stock (GME company as a whole). Transition to mostly online model is the way. However, I believe the company will have success in its hybrid approach (brick and mortar being around 20-30% of the revenue). Physical locations can be a wonderful opportunity to build gaming hubs where gamers can interact physically. We know that the virtual/augmented reality field is expanding, and I believe that the company‚Äôs partnership with Microsoft will not only bring efficiency in the update retail technology, but may have huge potential for providing unique meet-up destinations where gamers (as well as other interested users) can experience newly developed VR/AR games, experiences, implementations.
I may be off in what physical spaces may provide, but I would not want to see the physical spaces close. They won‚Äôt be as much store (even though you will be able to make purchases there as well), but more of experience-driven centers. Plus, after this whole pandemic here even more under control, I sure as heck would love to go to a GameStop hub, have a beer and snacks, meet up with friends and enjoy some new digital gaming experience.
All this is to say - GME to the üåò !!!

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great presentation, but i hope you realize that the only thing driving the price of this stock is the amount of money being poured in and also the shorts having to cover their margins. Other than that, Gamestop is not a 25 billion market cap company when the company has been decreasing on average 20% YoY with 5 billion in revenue in 2020.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I didn‚Äôt read this all the way through (so long!) so excuse me if you answered it but what exactly do you see GameStop selling online? Chewy makes sense because there‚Äôs a million kinds of pet food / toys / supplies but that‚Äôs not really the case with games. I can buy a game system but once I have the system it just makes more sense to buy the games from the Xbox / PlayStation store because they‚Äôre already right there. Is this a streaming play? Like GameStop is gonna compete with game pass or whatever the Sony equivalent is?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stopped reading after the most idiotic statement I've seen in days on your first point.  Gamestop is less valuable because they don't own their own buildings.  Sears/Kmart stayed around so  long because they owned so much property, they kept selling it off to stay afloat.

Walmart has 10,000 rent paying tenants, which almost covers the real estate costs, and over time becomes a significant revenue stream after initial outlay is recouped.

Reading this makes me wonder which community college intro to finance class you dropped out of.

Tl;Dr: GME isn't going anywhere and will bleed over the next couple of years."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"POWER TO ALL THE AMAZING PLAYERS. I just signed up for Chewy and their monthly deliveries. Planning to buy some Pokemon games soon from Gamestop as well

Edit: Invest in companies that you like."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"99% of the people here didn‚Äôt read all of this. They see numbers and use it as confirmation to get excited. Make your money on it but don‚Äôt be delusional and think this is actually worth hundreds. GameStop is a shit company who hates their workers. It was at its price for a reason without the HFs shorting it. 

Edit: I bought shares in December before any retards try to say I‚Äôm a bot or short seller. I‚Äôm just not delusional like you all."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not to brag fellas; but this is all I needed to see. Tomorrow I join the big boys club and move up from 8 shares to 10 shares. I hope that helps get you closer to your daughter being able to retire. Another reminder that the wrong people have the money. 

If she wants to come up north and fly fish in the fly fishing Mecca I'll happily show her the best spots."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,No its not.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"1) RC has been on the board since what December? He‚Äôs definitely been there long enough to be the reason GME raised online sales ü§°

2) the pandemic definitely didn‚Äôt force retail to close their doors and thus customers had to buy online. Zero correlation here."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Phenomenal read. Thank you for telling your story and being so vulnerable.

This should put everyone at ease that no matter what cost you are buying at now (missing the $120 dip from last week, or $40 from Feb, etc, etc) means nothing in the grand scheme of things. Whether this thing moons or not is irrelevant as the growth potential on the investment is far better than any mutual fund or other investment for your hard earned dollars.

Apes together strong. Wishing you and your family the best health and happiness. I have a baby boy on the way in September and this community is really amazing to hear everyone's stories."

lots of building hidden bullish divergence on the daily with stochastics crossing back up to the upside indicates momentum is once again favoring the bulls, as price continues to make higher lows and consolidate within a giant ascending triangle, a bullish continuation pattern. 

The hourly chart shows price is getting very close to a decision which way the next expansion in volatility will go, with a break below the 200ma/ema likely leading to a return to the $90 region, and a break of the top side resistance at $210-$225 triggering a measured move to $400 and a chance to challenge the all time high.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great DD. I‚Äôm excited to see how they will approach  e-commerce and take a bit of thunder away from the other sellers. I think the biggest opportunity  (when it come to buying games) lies in the UI of the apps. when it comes to purchasing games..Amazon, Walmart, BestBuy have good apps when you know what games you want.  But when it come to just browsing the store to discover different titles (not just new release titles) it‚Äôs tedious. And I think GS with their ‚ÄòDream Team‚Äô lineup can capitalize big time on that opportunity."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I do feel that GameStop is undervalued but $550 is more of a gamma squeeze than anything. Your analysis is pretty spot on but that $550 number sounds more like somebody holding 20 million shares for the margin call tendies .

They would have to pay off the total remaining lease payments or sub-lease and as for the size, there are few bldgs. that size empty, another box store (or 2) or a car dealership and now even a call center would take it over.  I realize this is far from the point you‚Äôre making but you gotta use legit info."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,DD is great. It‚Äôs pretty dumb that I can‚Äôt preorder online and can‚Äôt get it same day without paying more (rush shipping). Pickup in store is not an option on preordered games when ordered online.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Except when you sign a lease, it is a contract for a specified time period. If you break the lease the penalties can be as much as 100% of rent owed to contract end, plus the cost pf demolition of the improvements. So not so easy to just up and move. That is why they will slowly close stores as leases expire."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Great post. One point is the increase in online sales might have been due to COVID forcing people to that sales channel vs a successful transition to digital.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't think you have to necessarily pick one. If there is no catalyst for shorts to get margin called then the fundamentals and future direction causing people to buy in over time will cause the shorts to slowly get squeezed out and inflate the price higher than what it should be. Tesla would be an example of this but I'm sure there are others.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why not both. A short squeeze tends to happen because of a shift in investor sentiment. Right now investors still believe gamestop to be a struggling business, usually citing fundamentals. Once common investor sentiment changes a short squeeze becomes more likely. 

In fact i would argue that any fundamental-based investmant into gamestop is incomplete if you dont account for the volotility that high short interest brings."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"At some point during a turnaround a shitty company becomes a company worth buying. Apple in the first couple years after Jobs went back. It takes time to see the impacts.

The question about value is definitely answered by ‚Äúwhat people are willing to pay for it‚Äù. Sometimes that number is lower than fundamentals suggest  and sometimes it is higher.

For example when DFV was pounding the table that GME was not fundamentally valued correctly, GME was ‚Äúworth‚Äù (being traded at) $4 / share. Was this pricing by the market accurate? Was it accurate to the future? Was it accurate to the fundamentals?

Somewhere between fundamentals and make-believe moon-land exists a realm where enough people believe in a story that it becomes real.

The make believe land is proven to be a fantasy when sales and profits regularly  don‚Äôt meet expectations. The DFV land is proven when sales and profits regularly exceed expectations.

Apple was severely fundamentally over valued during multiple extended periods during the 2000-today run up. Or was it?

I eat crayons, but in my head Ryan Cohen et al have a story in progress and GME fundamentals could catch up to the current price fairly easily. Many people may not think so. This is fine. This will depress the price and maybe they are right. If they are wrong, then when they change their minds... moonland is not a fantasy."

It doesn‚Äôt matter how they reposition themselves. They don‚Äôt make anything. They don‚Äôt actually produce content, and their competitor in the digital space as a middle man is Steam. Steam that is already pretty great at what it does. The consoles all already have a direct from their manufacturer purchase method for digital content. 


Sure, there‚Äôs things GameStop can do to improve their business, but not *that* much. Remember Blockbuster? They resisted change and business models like Netflix and Redbox forever. Then they tried to scramble and compete with them toward the end with digital media and dvd by mail....and died. Because Netflix was already doing it better, and had been for a while. Steam is Netflix. GameStop is Blockbuster."

Fundamental investing in GME would not care about spikes in either direction or caring about a squeeze because the time line would extend past a squeeze. So why buy to then sell on a squeeze if you fundamentally think there is growth for the long term?

Arbitrage doesn‚Äôt care about the long term potential they are playing the pricing inefficiency of over leveraged and would dump without regard to long term.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, although the pandemic has changed the playing field a bit with leases.

From what I've been seeing locally, they've leased a LARGE store (under renos, can't wait to see what they do with it; I've seen tabletop-style tables and lan-style desks being set up) and appear to be combining the other three local stores with the big one. 

These other stores are within about 5-6 miles of each other, so really a waste. The big one is central to a LOT of parking, restaraunts, two stadiums and some very boutique places.

At least locally, they've got what looks like a great plan going forward."

As I just said, EU cannot investigate a data breach. We are talking about individual countries. I don't think a Lithuania investigation is going to catch many headlines - for one because such an investigation usually doesn't come with a press release. 
 
>  In terms of the data leak, I encourage you to at least skim the articles; it's about as severe as it gets. 
 
Ok, what sensitive data of how many EU private citizens was leaked to where and who could then access it? My understanding is that nobody knows. As severe as it gets would be bank records and medical data of every single EU private citizen posted on bittorrent. If you aren't talking about special data such as healthcare data you are by definition not talking about as severe as it gets."

Potentially? Potentially doesn't mean much, what actually happened is all that matters. 
 
> You can't tell me you don't seriously believe the hacking of millions of routers and other products which routinely access ""secure"" networks isn't incredibly severe. 
 
Do you have any evidence of millions of routers being hacked? Also, being hacked is not illegal, but not handling it properly can be in some cases. 
 
I think it's possible that there will be some DPA involvement, but I wouldn't expect much out of that in terms of publicity or action."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Please be right
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Latest Ortex data shows 30million shares short... that's 30 percent of estimated free float.

If you update the Free float with my patented ""Diamond handed autist"" adjustments (I call it the /r/canoo longs factor) that's probably more like 40 percent if not higher.

Tony did lose more money than I will ever have in 30 seconds by doing the right thing for the Canoo Investor.  That's a dude I'd go to war with.."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for writing this out. Agree with your points. My first response was also negative, but after digesting the information, I'm okay with it. Even though it feels we are more start-up now than half a year ago, since a bunch of pillars have been broken down. Would like to have some prove of progress in the next months."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Canoo Apes strong. Added more shares and 4/16 10C's. Pray for us.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought the dips and will not sell until next year the earliest.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This has gone from a 'good investment' to a 'DVF' play. Compared to its peers Canoo is incredibly undervalued. Cash on hand + assets + IP is basically market cap at this point, and this is a company that Apple was previously interested in buying.

A lot of the downwards pressure has been from short selling (Ortex estimated 25mil, up from 17mil EOD Monday. NEW INTRADAY ORTEX HAS IT AT 30mil 3/31). I've lost most of my portfolio on this and I'm STILL bullish on this thing. GOEVW are a steal and are much safer than options (though those 12.5c are cheap).

Lets look at where they are:

Multiple Vehicles that are verified moving:

1. LV vehicle out next year (see Jay Leno video of him driving it)
2. MPDV (haven't seen this thing rolling yet) EDIT: Credit to Snurty down below. Shit rolls yo. 
3. Truck (check their instagram for it driving around)

They already have been focusing on refitting vehicles. Their current method for testing vehicles goes:

1. Crash Car
2. Refit Skateboard (MPP)
3. Put new tophat on
4. Crash it again
5. PROFIT!

Some analyst asked them during the call why they had added a new model (truck) to their lineup but their number of prototypes hadn't increased. The answer was that the MPP (Skateboard) is considered the prototype not the tophat. All they did was pull the LV tophat off and throw on a truck tophat.

If that isn't fucking cool I don't know what is.

Beta testing (crash) is DONE. They're doing Gamma testing for drivability now as well as figuring out where their next factory is ""in the next few weeks..... or months"" (because Tony is being cagey)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree with your views. I just sold more puts. The mounting short interest is going to get the attention of opportunistic traders sooner rather than later. From what I‚Äôm seeing on Ortex, it‚Äôs being shorted now more than ever and the fees are increasing to do so."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Interesting Summary
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love Canoo, I dislike Tony. When he will be able to put the company and the brand above all else starting with his out-of-touch ego, planets will align.

That said, excellent write up. And I ultimately agree that preserving their IP was probably the right move with a long term perspective.

Now that conference call was catastrophic. They could have made the exact same strategic choices but present them with a better light. 

Tony please take notes: ‚ÄúWe are better positioned to execute our strategic goals. We are fully funded and ready to move forward with manufacturing. We believe the tactical shift will produce greater shareholder value.‚Äù That ain‚Äôt rocket science.

Edit: Sorry pressed send by mistake. Also what was up with the world needs EV at the start of the call?? We know that. That‚Äôs why we are logged in and probably bag holding too üòÇ

Ok and to cut it short: the tech alone is worth the market cap and yea they got an extra $700m in cash."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The few worthwhile takeaways I had from the ER were found reading between the lines, and mostly in the Q&A time.

Not advice, just being speculative based on words and tone.

From my notes, in no particular order
+ Europe interest, sounds like private + public
+ positioning for global expansion
+ eliminate IP leakage and low margin contract engineering 
+ Domestic market appetite is high
+ confidence behind skateboard engineering, capable/validated to meet demand and efficiently iterate with tophats
+ study leadership hires. Industry vets being on boarded

Neutral 
+|- finalists for US location being reviewed
+|- No hype approach. Announcements to arrive with signed contracts

Negatives
- investor relations non apologetic, no plan to fix
- lots of weak leadership language, not confidence inspiring that he‚Äôll be able to successfully rally employees to deliver on his vision

I would not buy calls. Shares and warrants here, will give it until ‚Äò23. Added some to my position with this dip!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are some huge red flags for me. I don‚Äôt mind the long term pivot (I think it makes sense), but I‚Äôm not feeling confident they‚Äôre going to have a manufacturing agreement done any time soon after that call. Tony reminds me a lot of an old boss I used to have that was very good at talking a big game, but very bad at executing. At this stage, not being able to provide almost any concrete details makes me incredibly uncomfortable. If you‚Äôre coming in with a pivot like that you should 100% have something more concrete than ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to build a micro gigafactory somewhere‚Äù and ‚Äúwe‚Äôll announce a contract manufacturing agreement in weeks to months‚Äù.

I love their vehicle design and I really want one of those trucks. But they haven‚Äôt shown they have a concrete plan to produce them at scale, and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if their timeline gets delayed. They‚Äôve got 700 mil on hand, so they‚Äôve got a runway, but until they actually start delivering a clear vision I‚Äôd stay away. If they don‚Äôt show any ability to create a plan and execute the floor of this is not going to be $8."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It would be an OS of sorts. BB and Amazon wouldn't keep the data. The auto maker would get the data. BB and Amazon would simply collect a subscription fee. It is also a pretty big deal for self driving cars because it'd allow the collection of data from people driving their own personal cars. Tesla already does this but it'd get all the other competitors I'd hope. You'd also have plenty of applications. Sorry for the also long answer tried to keep it as short as possible.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,....that's the way..
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,That's the way we like to **HYUCK**
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't care seeing 7,2 next few weeks, or even seeing 6. More opportunities to buy the dip.

The important thing is the price we will see in some months."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,So it's a data collection tool for vehicles?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,We like to
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao. Buy at 6 or 7,2 is a HUGE difference. Can load up 25% more shares at 6."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty much. Lol I should have just said that.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,GUH
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,When you are already holding a bag... it makes no difference :P
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,If you dont like money it doesnt i guess.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I do like it, but I have not anymore to buy the dip right now...

I already did yesterday, so right now, I only have one option.

Be patient and hold the bag :)

&#x200B;

It will rise again"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,i prefer buying at peak price
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I just bought shares in Nomura and Credit Suisse who got hosed by Goldman Sachs.  I figure a discount on a bank is worth more in the future than the overpriced amounts I was seeing in VIAC and DISCA.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"DISCA. Nah. That stock is up over 123% from a year ago even after the dump.

VIAC is up over 214% from a year ago after the dump.

&#x200B;

Are they really 'discounted' or was Archegos just really dumb and loved leveraging."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Wouldn‚Äôt mind a viac pop tomorrow
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree, bought some Viacom. Just by looking at the ratios and growth prospects they look like a good deal. I haven't really heard any arguments to counter this except ""you must be dumb lmao"" ""you don't get it lol"""
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought some cheap calls on both, but after seeing what happened with discb today im wondering wtf? Where's my 100% jump on disca? Lol"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"RIP Gabe Plotkin who bought calls on discovery when GME gamma squeezed in January. 

Mama Cathie may buy more Discovery for ARKF"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"VIAC has a dividend, but it's low for a dividend stock.

DISCB was violated by P&D today. Total bandwagon.

These things were on stilts before the crash, and they still are."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This message was brought to you by, Morgan Stanley. ‚ÄúPlease get this off our books!‚Äù"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Invest in VIACA instead.  VIAC has 502 million outstanding shares and it will be difficult to affect the price with buys.  VIACA has a outstanding share amount of 52 million, with only 10.1 million of that being float.  The share prices for VIACA are only $2 more expensive.  With VIACA your buys will make a much bigger difference and could make some really good gains."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dont forget there are still open position that needs to be liquidated on these stocks, only 2 of 4 or 5 banks liquidated their position."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"both those stocks are very sus, if you look at the 5 year chart they only shot up RECENTLY in December 2020 so no thank you"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,too bad i bought discA and not discB >.>
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"My broker is Morgan Stanley.  Talked to her this morning.  She picked up some for herself, but she also said that there may be more banks out there with more VIAC stock to unwind so it may go lower, just FYI."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought $10K of DISCA. Looking at VIAC. 

What are some other Archegos stocks? I've been trying to find a list of them!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What's up with DISCB today? It's up like 80%. Someone smarter than me tell me if puts on DISCB make sense please
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Viacom is a terrible idea. Even discovery are eating their lunch
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Name me one memorable thing these flacid companies have done in the last five years.  I'll wait
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha if you knew the real reason behind why they tanked you would stay far far away from that stock. Its only going to get worse for them
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,fuck disc A get disc B
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a failing industry.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn't the news say that the banks weren't done liquidating all the positions yet?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I want to put some money in VIAC since it's at a discount and will most likely go back up. Do I buy VIAC or VIACA?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Discovery is way too late. Just asking to bag hold of you buy now
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only retards bother with $DISCA, true autists are already squeezing $DISCB."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"MTV AIN'T COMING BACK BROTHER!

You think credit suisse or normura wants to hold that shit right now?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,what about GSX?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't know anything about VIAC sorry... I personally have no interest in it. I like to invest in growth, value stock and I don't like VIAC dilution, balance sheet and they dont have half the content DISCA have so I would steer clear. I eat crayons so, do your own DD."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I YOLO'd my account at $VIAC yesterday. $45.1 ish avg price.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"They‚Äôre still higher now than they were 3 months ago, but we probably have different risk tolerances. I can only take a risk if it involves buying more of one singular stock until I land on the moon"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,same
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it 'discounted' if those banks have actual realized losses of billions?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,VIAC was $40 before COVID crash. Now they have released Paramount+ and they have a ton of really popular shows they own. There's no way this stock doesn't get back to $60 soon.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"123% over a year isn‚Äôt much of a crazy run up. Tesla is up 560% in 1yr. After the tech sell off, and people are still buying in on it."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Imma suck fuck, I like a quick buck"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Viacom was down because of the covid crash dipshit.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought 125 shares! Lets see what happens tomorrow
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,P&D?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,">  With VIACA your buys will make a much bigger difference

Yes! Yes!  Take a look at the DISCB  squeeze today, a smaller float compared to DISCA."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I would wait for another drop before buying back. Prolly in the mid 30 range.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah from 65 to 150? Wtf?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's what I'm wondering too, I looked to see if there was any news announced and I couldn't find anything."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably a mini short squeeze. Fidelity has 0 shares available for shorting. IBKR has barely any too. Something like that.

Seems start of 2021 is a mass of short squeezes."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't think there are options on DISCB
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs the difference between DISCA and DISCB?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey fucktard... 90 Day Fiance! Every woman is addicted to that shitshow.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Sumner Redstone died last year
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,yea you sound like you really know the real reason. Hows that silver play working out for u?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,If you knew the real reason you could just say so - probably posing
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,If only it would be bad enough my 4/16 $30p would print for DISCA
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Was just looking at that as well, it seems like a reasonably safe bet given it hasn't been priced lower than this since January 2020.

Some concerns about new Chinese laws but Citigroup thinks they are overblown & has upgraded the stock to a buy .."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It is known.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,D'oh!   They have ways to write things off.   I'm imagining a Swiss/Japanese hit squad plotting revenge on GS.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"But the world will be spending time outside, with summer and the vaccination programs.  We've all been watching screens for over a year.  People want to get out more."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Paramount+ is just a rebrand of what was CBS All Access. I don't see how the product offering is different + improved enough to justify the recent stock rise.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,The only problem is too many people are locked onto VIAC they won't even consider VIACA.  Sigh....
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,MM got Short squeezed when their arbitrage went wrong... DISCA will follow soon ish. Same happened last year in Q1. Do your own DD. I'm retarded.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,200 actually for a brief moment ü•¥
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn, you right"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"DISCA gives you 1 vote per share.  DISCB gives you 10 votes per share.  DISCA has 162 million outstanding shares, and DISCB has 6.1 million outstanding shares.  Other than that it's the same."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,DISCB gives you voting rights.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Disc b give shareholders 10 votes / share instead of 1
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Read the lawsuit youll know too its no secret, just yahoo news and them prefer to keep it a secret"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol it just might. Calls on Gold & Silver right now are easy money next week Puts on QQQ/SPY/DIA will print :P
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you truly call yourself a WSB player without holding a peak bag in some portfolios?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"That doesn't mean streaming will just stop? You can still subscribe to a service and go out more, those ideas aren't mutually exclusive"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you cancel Netflix because you want to spend time outside?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"CBS all access was only... CBS

Paramount+ is Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central, the Paramount film studio, BET, Showtime, CBS"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,That's his point
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,The squeeze will come from a hedge fund and then wsb will buy the top. So it‚Äôs all good. Lol.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What makes you think DISCA will follow?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Same will happen with VIAC?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I have 10 votes on DISCA right now. I just bought it cause it dipped. What does an ape do with a vote?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,So does DISCA. DISCB just gives you 10 votes per share instead of 1
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt see any lawsuits that will materially affect Viacomcbs: one lawsuit of a writer against the writers guild relates to viac; one lawsuit against a person - redstone, related to the merger but I don‚Äôt think that will affect the new merged company - just that person"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"you seem pretty confident in that, why?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed.  I even see it with my kids.  They will go outside, but those screens have become habitual."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I exclusively Netflix and chill outdoors.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"i cancel netflix before i buy groceries, then buy again when i return home"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Will all of those be exlusive to paramount+?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for the correction. I think the real reason DISCB skyrocketed was the low float.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Viacomcbs You are looking at the company anyone can do a quick google search on a stock and see notable lawsuits for the company... What you should do is look at the lawsuits against the CEO and top executives, there are quite a few big ones for some very important people, its an easy way to hide information if the hedge funds dont want a stock to tank. Just a suggestion, if you want to buy, buy but id wait because its going to drop much lower in the next few weeks. Then buy before they announce new directors and leadership. Just my opinion, take it to the bank. Aside from the lawsuits they also have 555M Float so it could take longer to crawl back up than a stock with say 10M shares so if you want quick money this wouldnt be the play. Good luck"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Because thats what he bet on and hopes will happen
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably. I read an article saying 95% of the stock is owned by one guy, media executive John Malone"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,600 shares at $25 is 15k and with that money you can get roughly 10 leaps at $10 strike which lets you control about 920 shares depending on the delta. And then you sell 10xPMCC on them while weekly adding cash covered puts to fish more cheap shares then rinse and repeat
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"When everyone was looking at VIAC, lol"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice gratz and fuck you :D

On a more serious note:
Why is this happening to DISCB but not DISCA? Cause of the votes per share?

On my broker (from Germany) I was only able to buy DISCA and well I see no correlation between A and B which kinda sucks :("
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Never knew there were a B.  I noticed on A on Yahoo finance, it's % Held by Institutions is showing **143.47%.**  Not sure what that means."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought 3k worth of disca Monday and fucking discb moons. Would be my luck.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I  bought DISCB Monday at $54.12 and sold today at $135 for a +149%  (+$11,342) gain in two days. I intended this to be a value play so it  was in a retirement account and the gains are tax-free. I bought at  nearly the absolute trough and sold near the peak ... and it was all  blind luck.

My brother pointed out  the Archegos situation to me Monday morning. I picked up some VIAC and  Discovery, but skipped Baidu. I chose DISCB over DISCA because they were  the same price when I bought them. I didn't research the voting rights  to any extent but figured ""why not?"" if they were the same price.

I  was simply in the right place at the right time and I'll take it! The  price was moving up so fast when I sold that E-Trade quoted $124 and the trades executed at $135.

(I tried to make a separate post but a bot deleted my post. If anyone knows a way to show clean gains in E-Trade after you've locked in profits I can make this a new post.)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice!

Someone know why Class A didn't move? Is it because class B have 10 vote?

Will ViacomCbs have this boost too? lol"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Woah that bounced back fast

 DJ Goldman, Morgan Limit Losses With Fast Sale of Archegos Assets 7:53 PM ET 3/29/21 | Dow Jones  By Maureen Farrell, Margot Patrick and Juliet Chung    
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley  were quick to move large blocks of assets before other large banks that  traded with Archegos Capital Management, as the scale of the hedge  fund's losses became apparent, according to people with knowledge of the  transactions. The strategy helped limit the U.S. firms' losses in last  week's epic stock liquidation, they said.   
 

Losses at Archegos, run by former Tiger Asia manager Bill Hwang,  have triggered the liquidation in excess of $30 billion in value. Banks  were continuing to sell blocks of stocks linked to Archegos Monday,  traders said.   
 

""This is a challenging time for the family office of Archegos  Capital Management, our partners and employees. All plans are being  discussed as Mr. Hwang and the team determine the best path forward,"" a  company spokeswoman said in a statement Monday evening.   
 

Archegos took big, concentrated positions in companies and held  some positions in a mix of stock and swaps. Swaps are a common  arrangement in which a trader gets access to the returns generated by a  portfolio of shares or other assets in exchange for a fee.   
 

Losses threatened to spill over into the so-called prime brokerage  businesses that have been handling the firm's trading. The group of  large Wall Street banks includes Goldman, Morgan, Credit Suisse Group AG, Nomura Holdings Inc., UBS Group AG and Deutsche Bank AG, said people familiar with the firm's trading.   
 

On Thursday, Archegos asked banks handling its business to meet to  hash out a strategy to liquidate its holdings, said a person familiar  with the meeting. The firm's largest positions had turned sharply  negative following a long run-up. A proposal emerged for all the banks  to hold off on large trades and to talk further over the weekend, but  the call ended without any agreement.   
 

On Friday morning, banks started seizing Archegos' stock, and  Goldman Sachs started selling in size. It quickly became clear there  would be little to no coordination among the banks.   
 

Goldman and Morgan each raced to liquidate positions tied to Archegos.   
 

The discussion among so-called prime brokerages was extremely  unusual and has happened only a handful of times in recent memory, in  some cases averting liquidations.   
 

The decision to sell early helped insulate Goldman from losses that  have hit other banks. Goldman expects the results of the Archegos  account to be ""immaterial"" to its financial results for the first  quarter ending this week, according to a person familiar with the  matter.   
 

Morgan Stanley sold 45 million shares of ViacomCBS Inc.  Sunday night, marketing the blocks to a select number of clients and  responding to big investors who called to ask about additional blocks of  stock the bank might be unloading, said traders.   
 

Banks on Monday sold blocks of stocks worth several billion dollars  in companies that also saw selling late last week. They included blocks  of shares in Discovery Inc., U.S.-listed Chinese tutoring company GSX Techedu Inc., Chinese e-commerce platform Vipshop Holdings Ltd. and ViacomCBS, again.   
 

Wells Fargo, which on Monday sold blocks of stock, including in  ViacomCBS and GSX, also told clients Monday it had finished liquidating  its exposure.   
 

Credit Suisse and Nomura weren't major sellers Friday, traders said.   
 

Credit Suisse said Monday it was too early to quantify the exact  impact it faced, but that it could be ""highly significant and material""  to its results for the first quarter, which ends this month. Nomura said  it was owed about $2 billion by a U.S. client. A person familiar with  the matter said the trades in question were related to Archegos.   
 

Shares in Nomura fell 16%, a record single-day drop. Credit  Suisse's U.S.-listed shares tumbled 11.5%, the biggest decline in a  year. In New York on Monday, Goldman fell 0.5% and Morgan fell 2.6% on a  day when the Dow Industrials rose 98 points and the S&P 500  declined modestly.   
 

The Archegos episode is the latest in a long history of blowups to  reveal that while Wall Street banks bill themselves as second to none in  gathering information relevant to investing, they often struggle to  know what is going on next door. That shortfall is germane to the  Archegos liquidation because it seems clear that the banks didn't  realize until too late that they were holding similar positions, with  malign implications for efforts to keep markets in those shares from  falling further.   
 

""You can have a suspicion that maybe this person is doing this  trade with a bunch of other people,"" said Jay Dweck, a former trading  and risk-management executive at Goldman and Morgan Stanley and now consults for banks and hedge funds. ""But no one knows the aggregate.""   
 

The steep losses at Archegos come as a council of top U.S.  regulators known as the Financial Stability Oversight Council is already  scheduled to meet on Wednesday to discuss hedge-fund activity during  the pandemic-triggered crisis. The meeting is the first for the risk  council during the Biden administration, which has pledged to scrutinize  financial weaknesses revealed by the pandemic-triggered market tumult  from March 2020. The council is made up of the heads of the Treasury  Department, Fed and other agencies.   
 

Mr. Dweck, the consultant, pointed to a case that many on Wall  Street are hearing echoes of this week: Long-Term Capital Management, a  massive hedge fund that blew up in 1998. Firms learned the full extent  of the hedge fund's problems only when government officials summoned  them to Long-Term's offices to pore over its records, he said.   
 

""The upshot is, you're going to have stuff like this happen,"" Mr. Dweck said.

[here's](https://i.imgur.com/oi3cLBe.jpg) DISCB's yahoo page

This spiked on such little volume, wonder what would happen if it gains more vol"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got spooked and sold at 127!
Still cleaned up though.

Why aren‚Äôt people all over this stock rn??"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought on Monday and sold yesterday for a 40% profit.  Jealous that I didn't hold longer, could have made over 100% return in two days."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can I ask how you spotted this one?

I always seem to be seeing the news, but the actions already taken place 2 days before.  

I know the adage of if you're reading it, you're already late, but it's almost like it leaks days earlier...."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great, I put 3k into VIAC expecting it to rebound after the crash last week. Chose VIAC over DISCB for no reason whatsoever, assuming theyd both move up the same way they both moved down.

Nice to see VIAC is down 3-4% from last week and this has doubled."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Way to fucking capitalize, I would have as well but Im all tied up in GME/AMC/SLGG"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What the hell happened I bough my the wrong series...üò≠
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this squeeze expected to last hours or days?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Looked at disca and disck but skipped discoüò¢üò≠
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,DISCA needs to do this next.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why are there so many share posts on wsb now

What the fuck is this"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"why are useless after the fact clowns like this allowed here ? 

&#x200B;

I gave this out YESTERDAY in the 70's in public.  Not here. Reddit doesnt deserve me"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,lucky b\*&Sturd.   why didn't you clue us in on this yesterday?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You think itll go again tomorrow?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Or even $DISCA for that matter
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,My straddle on VIAC is dead in the water.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right, because like that one guy said, they got solid kids programming over at Viacom, so it has to bounce back,  right?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I was looking after discb initial crash but didn‚Äôt pull the trigger like this magnificent bastard (OP)
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I Just made and order for 124 shares! @44.44, i Hope It gets filled"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,seems some idiot shorted the wrong disc and now covering with only 5% of the float available to do so...
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs due to the votes per share - this is my guess
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,i think some shorting idiot at a hedge fund just learned the lesson of their short lives.  Pay attention to the details.  They probably intended to short DISCA and somehow shorted B.  only 5% of the float is available to trade.  A setup similar to VW/porsche.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Short squeeze?!?!?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"if you consider being on the short end of market manipulation ""luck"", then sure."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,$DISCA should make a recovery too after the selloff; power play stock.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice win man!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I also have 100 shares of VIAC but it‚Äôs not moving.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought A @42.7. Making a nice little run. Not a squeeze like B but a few bucks
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I seem to be going against the grain. I bought nearly $2k worth of puts $30p 4/16 on VIAC. May the greatest retard win.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idk , I think so. At least that's what I've read so far.

I was only able to buy A from my broker, well and C. But not B.. sucks :D"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Guessing someone who wanted a lot of voting rights bought in
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre telling me. I thought it would be a month or two before we saw a recovery
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn't bounce back.  It mooned.  I suspect it will come on back down.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs never too late
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Woot!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,That's generally a good assumption. This is some extra wierd movement
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Same...also it was down the most so i was hoping it would have better bounce. Hindsight 20/20 i guess
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah. Its whack üòÇ
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt know about those squeeze terms anymore, being used like prayers. But something ought to happen :-)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can't go wrong on any of these, $DISCA $DISCB $VIAC $DISCK are all value plays.  

Edit: $DISCB *was*"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I jumped on that too. So we are kindred apes
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You can probably get at least 5% gains from VIAC.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I was looking at stocks that had the greatest fall due to the Archegos liquidation and this one popped up. I saw that discovery has its own streaming platform and their growth strategy looked solid so I bought in. It started popping later last night so I doubled down. Sold today because it felt frothy.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy the dip yo
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you think it will grow tomorrow?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for posting this. My trade was indeed sketchy af.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,The weirdest thing is I received an error message when trying to buy more on Schwab. It stated ‚Äúthere are not sufficient shares available‚Äù
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It's not strange it's public knowledge that John Malone owns 95% of the discb shares.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Not sure. Maybe there will be a surge again tomorrow. No telling really. I got PDT flagged today playing this one so i‚Äôm out for a while.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Gains are gains man. Cheers!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I explained it in a post above
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok so apparently there is a c too.Can someone explain this fuckery to me pls?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I didn‚Äôt even know it was a squeeze
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"won't happen, float is too large"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt appreciate the name calling. How did your trade work out for you?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Because I wasn‚Äôt sure about it and did absolutely no DD
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I have no idea. It‚Äôs over it‚Äôs pre dip price.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly. I didn't even know there was a $DISCB   wtf???
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's plays like this that you know who are newly christened retards and who actually knows what they are doing, why buy $DISCA when $DISCB gives you more voting rights per share"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"different shares hold different voting power.

for some reason, DISCB has a tiny float, as opposed to the other two. Think back to RKT and how it squeezed because insiders hold most the shares, discb is in a very similar  situation right now. I think this can run again personally, but my average is sitting at $79 so the downside for me isn't that huge."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you get an answer? I want in on this
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Doesn't matter. Stocks have value because institutions value them. Institutions vote.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"> There has to be at least a corelation to their price movement right?

Not the guy your asked but not necessarily.  Share price movement is all about inventory available and the amount of shares being traded that day.  Class B shares for Discovery have less shares available and have 10 times the voting power of Class A.

You can have days where one class of shares moves down in price while another class moves up."

Without a spell checker this would look like a menu in Chinatown.  üôåüçÜ"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, you buy the shares so you can write covered calls and make money every week.

Stocks that don‚Äôt have options are less desirable, as stocks, because you can‚Äôt write options against them as insurance/profits."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well in general different classes of the same stock grow and shrink at the same rates.  Look at GOOG and GOOGL for example.  What happened today with DISCB is a total freak anomaly situation that could just as easily have happened to DISCA or DISCK....it was just dumb luck that DISCB happened to have a short squeeze.

Recognizing that they would typically grow or shrink at the same rates, the reason you would go for the cheaper stock class is because you're getting more value for your money in the event of a dividend or a buy-out.

For example, say you buy $10k worth of shares--right now you could either buy 230 shares of DISCA, 78 shares of DISCB, or 271 shares of DISCK.  If the stock goes up 10%, you'll have 10% more value, and if it goes down 10%, you'll have 10% less value, regardless of which class you bought.  But if they pay a dividend of $1, then you are either collecting $230, $78 or $271 for the same initial investment.  If the company gets bought for $100/share (which isn't out of the question that some bigger streaming company would come pick up Discovery), you're either getting $23k, $7.8k, or $27.1k for the same initial investment."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,">""Why the fuck is it valuable to vote on this company?""

Especially us plebs. If you don't own a significant share of the company, and if you're here, you don't, then voting in corporate elections means fuck all. If we pooled our money together, we could vote and make corporations less shitty, but I'm sure they'd make it illegal somehow."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Stocks have value because institutions value them. Institutions vote.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is still important to know who has voting control. Voting is super important. Those who vote, control the fate of the company. Yes, your miniscule vote is largely unimportant, but knowing who is in control and deciding the fate of the company plays an enormous part in deciding whether or not to invest. Not understanding it leaves you at a disadvantage."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If institutional investors and billionaires value voting rights, that's where you want to be.  The whales push DISCB up and not DISCA."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Was expecting inflation to pick up (most of my other posts are short treasuries - not puts which have a time decay - which I mostly closed out yesterday).

But this trade was just for fun before the intention to plant report. Basically everyone overguessed the acreage for this season because vaccines are coming out quickly, but planting decisions were made 1-2mo ago when vaccs weren't as widespread. 

Every contract through Mar 2022 are limit up... I'm going to take profit and look for another point to sell treas before jobs tomorrow. 

USDA: you're looking for the prospective planting report from today [https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/)

[https://www.andersonsgrain.com/market-commentary/market-videos/usda-report/2021/mar-31/](https://www.andersonsgrain.com/market-commentary/market-videos/usda-report/2021/mar-31/)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Due to local fluctuations in the tropopause, the jet stream has been shifting rapidly in a counterclockwise vector, causing a rapid disincorporation of the Hadley vortex cells in the lower ionosphere. Because of this, the geostrophic solar wind balance has deteriorated rapidly in the northern hemisphere. In essence, autumnal weather patterns in the western United States will lead to the biggest corn yield in recorded history. Investing in corn futures could likely produce up to $1600 per day in passive income. However, investing at the apex of the curve would be the most conducive to profit as the arbitrage (particularly 12b-1 fees) will develop at a market share higher than the back-end load. Basically, no one will be able to buy the stock at a higher price than you, and all value invested will be retained. A preliminary market penetration investment of $50,000 would be most efficient in generating this revenue."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Also positive for all crops is how bad the last few plantings were. Agriweb and other farm sites have been showing for years that USDA and others constantly revise crop and animal yields down quietly.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Like what that dude, said, 100% got lucky because of the crop report. 

Also the vaccine distribution fast means probably more food demand (remember last year when food was being dumped)? This might be like the semi shortage, where producers expect still low demand, but all of the sudden demand comes back quickly. You need a good 4 months between planting and first harvest. Also corn prices somewhat follow energy prices. 

You can analyze it all you want, but seriously, I had cash to burn, didn't want to go into equities again and just threw some darts at a board."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"well, we've learned our lesson and the majority of farms in the US try not to do monocropping these days so those fields arent always the same produce in the first place and yields can be massively different depending on factors like rain fall, it being too hot, or too cold. So depending on the factors, a field that grew corn one year may have decided to grow soybeans or wheat or hemp this year. I'm not sure how the vaccine plays into it, but I'd guess a return from labor shortages caused by covid could affect estimates."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Answer to all your questions is it's all fake and gay and OP just got lucky
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly why do you think the price of pork bellies is going to keep going down, William?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sudden return in demand for food (mainly feedstock) and energy (ethanol). Some silos are still probably full of 2019/2020 harvest, which might suddenly be depleted due to vaccinations/people going out again. Because people (USDA and traders) thought vaccine distribution wasn't going to be as fast and widespread, their forecast for demand and planting was going to be low.

Turns out, plantings are low according to today's report. But, everyone now sees the recovery is ultrafast. So, you got low supply and high demand, just like in the semiconductor market. 

That was just a guess. I honestly just got lucky."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree. Holding is the easiest part. The hard part is figuring out how much you think you can live off of and how much you can invest in holding. These dips have been very very kind to me as well. I was able to go from 24 shares at $264 on the way up in January to 180 shares now. What a wonderful time to be alive. Hit the gym and stay healthy retards! Gotta be able to enjoy these tendies we‚Äôve worked so hard for!!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I recommend downloading stock alarms or setting stock alerts for üåù. I don‚Äôt check my phone anymore. Was literally checking every 5 minutes before.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Now transfer out of robbing hood :)
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Now transfer that to a fidelity account
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,THIS
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I still don‚Äôt understand why people are still using robinhood. Basically like a dude fucked your girl and you still hang out with him everyday.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"what i would GIVE for that price average, danggggg! Ya'll fuckers come rescue me outta the 200's already"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Isn't this psychotic? Buy GME and literally set alerts for 1000, 10000 and go about your life. Love it"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Why are you still using Robinhood? Transfer those stocks to a trading platform that didn‚Äôt sell out its users.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can do this all year. Even when its up, i‚Äôm eating
mac and cheese. Its delicious.

HODL"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Billions. It‚Äôs costing them billions to hold it down. Tic tock.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I can up you by one ‚òùÔ∏è! I changed and then threw away my account password .#Apestrong
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Buying shares is the way.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,We can stay retarded longet than they can play dirty tricks
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Too easy!! I Just keep getting more on a good dip!! Support Our QUEST to pick the 3-400$  apes ü¶ß 
We getting there!!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If only holding those Robinhood IOUs meant a damn thing to the market. When it moons, you'll get your money... but because RH doesn't let you technically own the shares, your shares don't positively influence the price."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Congratulations and fuck you !
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh shit. Stocks are an idle game. You buy in, buy the dips, and then just let time go by. Who knew?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It needs to go on sale so I could buy more cuz I love the stock dearly
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Get off Robinhood.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Get out of robinhood
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Get off robinshit
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"going to explain for the 100th time I have EVERYTHING off of Robinhood except GME. Not trusting a 7 day transfer. Once I‚Äôm done with GME I am done with Robinhood, literally fucking cry about it some more. Good god."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It appears they keep coming up with shares to short so it s gonna be a while until the infinity of these shares are bought up.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Costs them nothing to drop the price. MM let them Short a large order which they immediately cover as it drops.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I used to check every day but have held for so long I haven't checked this week yet.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agree, who cares. Boomer's think we are all ADD all I have to do is wait. I'm already winning why not wait for more wins."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I have only looked at the price today twice. First when I got up today and just now at 3:00 pm I won't be looking again until after hours closes at 8pm. Holding
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just keep buying...like, I get paid, I buy a share..
Next week, another share!

Part of me is hoping for it to drop to 40 for a week so I can load up.

Funniest part of all of this is that now we are starting to realise what DFV went through before he got rich, whether it happens to us is anyones guess, but if he's in, I'm in."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, it isn't totally free to HODL.  There's ""opportunity cost"", meaning that you are giving up on the other things your money could be doing.  There's a bit of education for you, fellow ü¶ç"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Delete RobinHood
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why Robinhood  though? You know they‚Äôre evil, right?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Get tf out of Robinhood
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Opportunity cost, my friend. It's not free for you to hold if it trades sideways. If there are other investments that are making money while you're holding then you're losing out on money."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Why are you still on RH though?!!!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gratz for the stock, I‚Äôm a bit sad and disappointed to see it in RH, after all they did they don‚Äôt deserve anything support or help."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Is that Uphold?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This ain't no Gme. This is life
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Governments paying for my stocks either, fuck em."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets, Is that from January?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn‚Äôt trust Robbin Hood with $29, let alone $29k."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Typically I don't last longer, but I'll HODL this one in for my fellow apes."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,The money I have invested in GME has become retirement money. I can hodl for another 30 years!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Free, he says. Holy shit you motherfuckers gonna die poor as fuck"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Crazy how easy it is to just not look
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Partial shares make me cringe but maybe it‚Äôs just my ocd lmaooo üò¨
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep it's so easy to hold.  I stopped logging into my broker at this point.. just check the price on a ticker.  I have phone alerts set up for when things start to moon so until then I just check to see what games are being played today.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Transfer to fidelity or Ameritrade. Fack RH
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly the sideways trading has made it far easier for me to focus on classes. I believe in the thesis and I don't need to constantly worry anymore... In short I like the stock and will silently hold until üöÄ
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The answer to your question is nothing. The market makers and hedge funds who are trying to remain delta neutral when your friends gamma squeeze on February 24th and March 25th are buying the dip. The reason why your price isn't going up is 1) there is no short squeeze and 2) the hedge funds wait for the OTM calls they've covered to expire, then slowly unload their shares to ensure the next week's OTM calls expire as well with 100% returns on the shares.

GME in March is one of the easiest hedge fund plays on the market, because they know retail will buy any dogshit that comes across their plate. It doesn't matter whether its $6 5DTE 800c, or $348.90 shares 10 minutes after the hedge fund buys a massive fuckton of 330p and starts selling 259k shares with a 240 limit sell."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Down vote for being on robinhood sorry not sorry
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You should drink your own piss if it drops 30% in the next month
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think this

Set up GME recurring

Is not big enough"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Alexa, play Carmina Burana"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I no look at my phone too guy.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn, I need more shares."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats! That‚Äôs the key is to not constantly look at the price swings every minute or hour. That shit is stressful!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Could've bought lower if u didn't use Robinhood.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It'll be the first time I last long in my life
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Lot of people are loving this daily up and down and making good money on it.  Keep that support line in place for the day traders please =)
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell covered calls guys
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you knew more about investing, you wouldn't need to wonder so much."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell weekly covered calls
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"tradingview is a pretty good platform for setting all sorts of alerts. it can ring your computer screen, email and even sms your phone."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, it blows my mind how many posts still have screenshots of people that are still on RH."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,IS
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Your wife doesn‚Äôt have a boyfriend? How the fuck are you suppose to concentrate on stocks.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Anything you recommend? I'm still on RH.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Me too! IMO they are no Robinhood - they stole from the poor to give to the rich!!! FUCK‚ÄôEM!!!!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"congratulations for what? he didn't sell yet

grats on future moon trip i guess"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,markets transfer funds from the impatient to the patient
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,If it moons all prices under 200$ are considered a sale though
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao this cracked me up
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"transfer takes on average a couple of days based on other users experience including my own, do it now and sleep at night."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"By the way, I'd strongly advise against using Robinhood. They are not a real broker."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the situation I am too. I already transferred my other stocks but am afraid MOASS will happen while my shares are being moved, but I also have a fear RH won‚Äôt let me sell shares when I need too so I have 2 extra shares in my other account I got when it dipped down to 45."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs so annoying when people post RH screenshot and all the comments are bitching about you still being on RH. Like STFU! Those comments are annoying as hell.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Took me two days to transfer and 1 Day to get off margin
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hopefully you‚Äôll be able to sell when the time comes. That would be the only concern I would have if I left my shares in RH. Transfer to fidelity only takes 2-3 days for the shares to go through. They show up as margin initially, but convert to cash after another 2-3 days to process. I‚Äôd implore you to seriously consider this"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude shut up
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You should drink your own piss right now for saying ‚Äúdrops 30%‚Äù, meat handler"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs cringe because you were saying you liked the stock two weeks ago. Shitter
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but I mean... I can‚Äôt afford three digits of GME. But I can afford double digit shares. 

If I had more money I could make more. Sure. 

But even if just one share is all you can afford still in for huge gains compared to what you started with. 

If you can afford to invest 1k and get 10k back - that‚Äôs probably significant for you in a way 10k isn‚Äôt for someone investing 10m. 

We all riding this rocket together for significant gains. Look at the gains you can get compared to what you have now, not compared to another ape starting with more. 

I like the stock. Fack yah, GameStop!  Good childhood memories."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Although this is true, in situations like WSB, you‚Äôre also risking a lot more. I bought 45 GME @$44, can I look back now and say damn I should‚Äôve put in $10k? Of course, but at the time GME was a speculative play and $2k was my risk tolerance, the amount I was comfortable losing."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"that's a feature not a flaw. it's called the matthew principle.

look there's something to be said about getting a hand up.

i can tell you though, it's 80% psychology. i did it. 10 years ago, my daily routine was 2 bottles of plastic jug vodka. i didn't have a bank account, a valid license or insurance, my registration was expired.

i sank pretty low, i'd dumpster dive for food. cash in my empty vodka bottles and split it between taco bell and more booze. for a time i even worked for less than min wage just so i had *some* money coming in.

it's way different now, it all started when i got clean & sober. believe me i know what it's like to be behind on my promises, to have too much month at the end of the money. keep your eyes on the prize and keep grinding. the hardest part is getting started, most people never do that.

two books that helped me immensely in the beginning were ""the 12 pillars"" by jim rohn, and ""the richest man in babylon"" i forget the author but it was written in 1935 or something it's sage wisdom.

don't wish it were easier, wish you were better. don't wish for less problems, wish for more skills. don't wish for less challenge, wish for more wisdom.

<3"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"this, 100% lol.

I look at my portfolio and say ""hmm, I made $7.58 today. Nice.""  I look at the father in laws portfolio and he's up like $2k on GME alone that he bought on a whim."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Easier still to not trade at all. Proportionally less likely to result in gains, though.

Tiny gains are what build up to big investments."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm still on Robinhood only because all my shares are GameStop and I only have 3 shares. After I liquidate my assets I‚Äôm switching immediately over to Fidelity. I should‚Äôve done Fidelity in the first place since that‚Äôs where my IRA is, but I‚Äôm an idiot"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Well its a big trading platform for a reason and theres alot of new guys who can get going quick and easy thru them. So its not that surprising

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Remind me in 30 days
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right? I literally have $10 to play with. I put $3 in Disney and $3 in GME. If I end with $10 instead of 3, that's a win for me right now. I'm saving up for a wedding and college, I don't care how much I get out of the stock market"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can't read, does this say ""people with 10m to invest should give 10k to people who only have 1k so they can go all-in on GME""?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Narrator: It's still speculative
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,retarded yolo's will always make more money but those that practice good risk management will get to keep it.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was responding to the comment about how much you HAVE not how much you chose to invest. 

The post I responded to was about needing money to make money. 

I mean you‚Äôre right but missed the point I was going for.  Lots can‚Äôt find 10k to invest even if they wanted to."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am just now seeing this through WSB. Some apes and some of my non WSB friends are happy with turning $500 into $750 on SLGG, meanwhile I turned $2.5k into $4k on a whim. He made $250 before taxes and I made $1.5k through the same timeframe. Then I think of how small potatoes I am where someone else probably turned $10k into $15k, another person turned $50k into $75k, etc, etc."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not really, big players aren‚Äôt satisfied with those gains - they want us to be so they can stay stupid rich. We came to fuck up some hedgie money."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, not tiny gains, tiny gains in large volume. One has to beat inflation/CPI just to break even and one can't do that on 1000$ unless they know what the hell is going on and want to spend their life figuring it out. Having interests other than making money shouldn't be penalized."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same boat. I put all of my RH money in GME months ago. I don‚Äôt want to transfer or sell until we hit $1,000,000. I will then cash that out and transfer it. (My new deposits go to fidelity where I don‚Äôt hold GME.)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,WAY
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah, fidelity is good. phone app is pretty boomer, but active trader pro on PC is decent."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"fuck, now the marxists are here too"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,No
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"True and I get what you‚Äôre saying. What I was going for is what you see may only be a portion of their wealth, you may see 30k but for all we knows that‚Äôs 1% of his wealth. I think Paperboy Portnoy is a good example as he was options trading with 3 million but that actually was only 1% of his wealth or something along those lines. 

But yeah you‚Äôre absolutely right, the rich get richer through opportunities of diversification. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve seen an opportunity in TSLA or RKT or FB but I had my risk tolerance in GME/AMC so I had to hold off on my purchases. Whereas someone with more money, could do all 3 if they wanted without worry"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup, same.  I hold small shares in a few things, because I only throw a little extra cash at it here and there instead of saving up for a decent amount share purchase all at once.  When the FiL asked me about GME, I told him ""eh, maybe buy 10 or 20 shares, but you'll have to watch it close so you don't miss out on the opportunity to sell"".... he bought 100 shares worth $12k.  Pulled his principal out 2 days later (last friday) and let the profit ride.  
If I had his portfolio to trade with, I would either become very rich in a very short time... or back to where I am now if I followed most of WSB's advice."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"it's not that having other interests is penalized, it's that taking risks is rewarded. 

for most people, making regular purchases of low cost index funds is the best long term roi. stock market inflation adjusted returns over the last 100 years is 7% annually.

it's also wrong to assume most people in here are making money. a few post major gains and there isn't much loss porn lately, it give the impression the sub is wildly successful but this is survivorship bias. it's gonna be easy to make money in this market, just don't short the money printer, but don't confuse brains with a bull market.

this market is a gift. get all the stimulus bucks you can get your hands on and find out where the rich are putting their money. they know what's coming and how to protect themselves from it.

those holding cash are going to get fucked hard over the next couple years."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea if RH doesnt remove the sell button when the time comes
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"you have a portfolio that isn't 100% GME? pssshhhh what a paperhanded bitch.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I prefer RKT to UWMC, just to add some popular dissent.

UWMC is in debt and I'm not the biggest fan of the company. RKT is killing earnings and issuing special dividends left and right.

Also, small edit, RKT is showing very similar hyper inflated OBV levels, similar to GME, AMC, and PLTR, so uh. Timing may be relatively similar for moon."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Should‚Äôve picked UWMC while it‚Äôs at a discount...
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Also very likely the same people shorting it. You know just incase of a *cough* margin call *cough*
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably but i know nothing about it at the moment. Been taking a little break , feeling a little burnt out"

2021-03-31 19:35:03,wallstreetbets,"VZIO: The IPO That Flew Under the Radar  

Hello fellow degenerates.

VZIO  IPO'd last Friday and it appears to have flown largely under the radar  which I'd attribute to all the other crazy shit happening last week. I  didn't even know about it until shares were already for sell. The shares  went on sale in the 17-18 dollar range, way under the proposed 21-23  range. Seeing this looked at the numbers and bought some shares because I  thought they were impressive.

I'm  just gonna throw it out there that I am not a financial expert and this  is my first time reading numbers from a prospectus document so if you  see any logical errors or bad numbers please point them out. I'll  largely be using the numbers I got from the prospectus document found  here: [https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-082123/](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-082123/)

As  of last Friday VZIO has put 15.2 million shares for sale on the market.  The company's total shares outstanding as of 2020 was \~144million  (these aren't on sale, just held by inside investors). At the current  stock price of 24.5 that puts the company's market cap at about 3.5  billion. According to RH VZIO's current P/E is about 4.45, which is  insanely low for a well known brand and a growth stock, which leads me  to believe the stock is majorly undervalued. The stock price could  easily quadruple to put the P/E around 20 which is more inline with  competitors.

The last couple of  years VZIO has transitioned from being just a hardware company selling  TVs to also becoming a streaming server provider. Because of the low  margins on this service it has become a huge income stream for them and a  source of extraordinary growth. Think of their streaming service like  Roku, but actually built into the TV. VZIO's income and revenue for the  past couple years were:

Total net revenue

2019 $1,836,799,000

2020 $2,042,473,000

Total gross profit

2019 $165,165,000

2020 $296,358,000

Net income

2019 $23,086,000

2020 $102,475,000

The  net income increase was largely due to the profits from their Platform+  revenue which has grown 304% from $36.4million in 2018 to $147 million  in 2020. The CEO states that the company plans to reinvest that money  into the hardware side of the business to develop better TVs. Another  bonus is that the CEO has deep ties to Asia manufacturing which has  proven to be extremely helpful in them securing required components for  their TVs and keeping their supply lines healthy while competitors face  shortages.

Taken form the  prospective document as of December 31, 2020, Vizio had $207.7 million  in cash and $625.8 million in total liabilities.

Vizio's recent financial results can be summed up as follows:

* Increasing operating profit and margin (They are making more money and making more money with less cost)
* Growing topline revenue
* Sharply increased gross profit and gross margin
* Growing earnings
* Reduced cash flow from operations

The  HD TV market is growing and expected to grow substantially in the next  few years. As of 2020 Vizio also made up the third largest brand of HD  tvs in American homes, so it has massive name recognition.  VZIO has a  lot of big rivals to compete against in this growing market that may try  to take out the smaller competitors. The name recognition might help  VZIO's potential for acquisition by a large player seeking to quickly  enter the Smart TV/connected home market by buying out an established  brand. In the past VZIO has shown it is willing to sale. It was supposed  to be purchased by a Chinese company a few years ago, but the deal fell  through.

In the short-term all  the stimulus will likely keep demand for TVs purchase high, which makes  short term prospects for VZIO look pretty good. The long-term potential  for growing their operating margins through streaming services, a ever  growing TV market, and the potential for buyout makes them a solid place  to park some money.

TLDR;

The  company is profitable, growing in the streaming segment, increasing  earning, and has all the right ingredients to become a big player in the  next generation of connected TVs by offering a TV + streaming service  similar to ROKU but in one piece of hardware. Also, there's only 15  million shares on the open market so a lot of demand can cause a big  increase in the stock price in the short term.

Positions: 100 shares of VZIO."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,If I had any money I‚Äôd buy into this. Never thought I would like a smart TV but I‚Äôve been happy with my Vizio TV. Just hope they don‚Äôt fuck it up by pushing ads like some other manufacturers have done.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"There was not much, if any, news about VIZO‚Äôs IPO. I caught it on the first day and bought in. I think they are in a good position to take some of ROKU‚Äôs market share. Excited to see where this will go!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea.. all this GME BS drowned this out had no idea they were going public

I'm a bit more cautious thou, TVs are a race to the bottom, there's not much room for margin and TCLs and Hisenses of the world are closing in

Vizio also recently exited the Canadian market, which is a little concerning"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Currently Holding 1100 @ $21.20
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,would love for it to dip a little to touch on my low-ball buy limit
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I tried to post about it 28 days ago, but didn‚Äôt have enough karma at the time. I completely forgot about it and missed the IPO. I own Vizio TVs. They‚Äôre good quality for the price imo and they last a while. Sad I forgot to look into the IPO date."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,VZIO makes some of the shoddiest TVs on the market. So the stock will probably print lol
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,150 shares @$21 for me. Long hold for bigger gains and will continue to add.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Using my informal metrics for investment, I say this is solid.  The metrics here is that everyone wants a big and/or smart TV.  Lots of companies make them, the good brands are very expensive, Vizio is the brand everyone finds when they want the affordable option; which is usually the majority who can't really tell the difference.  So basically, very solid business with lots of areas for growth.

Just my opinion, not financial advice."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I did about 10 minutes of research and threw $50 in @$20. Ill. see where it goes in a week.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you figure Visio is a growth company? Is their main thing not selling TVs? That seems like not a growth market imo
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Insiders actually did sell around 1mm shares on Monday. Still a good sign the stock still went up after. And yahoo finance had their PE ratio off a decimal point. 44.5 instead of 4.45, but funny enough refreshing now has it at N/A. 

But my Td Ameritrade also has it at 44.5

I thought the PE was too good to be true"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck me, I didn't know they IPOd. Just bought as much as I could with the change in my account.

Thanks OP!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Vizio TVs are garbage, I don‚Äôt like the stock"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought 10 shares. What do they do?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Vizio sucks, Samsung all the way"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You son of a bitch...I‚Äôm in.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Their website has a TLS error. Uff...
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hate the stock because of their bargain bin priced tvs , but you son of a bitch I'm in because people like to buy cheap garbage."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holding a nice chunk. I think the Archegos thing tanking Discovery and Viacom kept this on the down low for a lot of reasons, but buying screens and the content all in one package makes a lot of sense to me"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"OO man, they actually stated in their prospective document that target adds on their OS was one of their growing revenue streams. I agree though, I'm getting tired of fucking adds everywhere."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Into Rokus? I don't follow. Vizio needs to drastically improve the ""smart"" side of their TVs. Their TVs themselves are decent and comparable to TCL. Vizio's sounds systems are good.

Roku, as far as I know, isn't in the TV panel/manufacturing business. They are the software and pairing with products I thought."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Roku doesn‚Äôt make tv‚Äôs. If you look for some DD, you will see Vizio is working on evolving its software and is tapping in on advertising using home screens."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Had a Vizio TV in 2015, was great for the price. Wanted to get one this year but was pissed they dont sell them north of the border anymore. Seriously competitive with the Samsungs, LGs, and Sonys."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,GME isn‚Äôt done and is a better play than UWMC.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,RBLX went down quite a bit and assuming VZIO follows it and BMBL it'll come back down for a decent entry.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It isn't about the quality of the product but the profitability of the business model.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is what I imagine every time I view the daily thread. Hundreds of kids screaming about their stock they have 2 shares in going down.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,They have accessories that they sell too like sound bars at what not. I would expect they'd want to expand into all of the home theater market. No actual research on my part just stating what I know they sell in stores.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,That makes sense. Using numbers from the their prospective document matches that P/E.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Vizio TVs are garbage and they sell from Wal-Mart where people buy cheap shit by the boatload. Therefore I like the stock enough to buy in after a nice decline after a week or two and then sell a month or two after buy in to take profits and run.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,They make televisions that dont work with hulu no matter what.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it‚Äôs ads included in the Pluto TV /Watchfree streams fine, but not just BS ads like pop-ups."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is actually the main reason I hate the product. But at the end of the day look at how the Mobile game market is and it's fine. Some people don't really care about ads and the price for the TVs are actually really low so it's a win win situations for them. The main thing they need to do is make sure they're keeping up with samsung and LG in terms of picture quality as best as they can and they'll be safe. 

I never see myself owning their TVs any time soon but I know how attractive the price is and am willing to put some pocket money down on the stock."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct, they don't manufacture TVs or panels, I think they meant the Roku Smart TV market share (i.e. TCL sells almost all their models with Roku's OS built in)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"But they do ship with TCL TVs, which are cheap and prolific."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Well Roblox is kind of a one off as it was arguably way overhyped and the valuation is insane. Don't know anything about VZIO btw.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shitty tv with ads everywhere that collect and sell user data, this thing is gonna moon isn‚Äôt it"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,someone gotta start somewhere
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"We have Hulu directly on the Vizio. TV is pretty shoddy but a 65‚Äù for like $400 with a Costco warranty, can‚Äôt complain."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"According to the CEO they were going to use the money from streaming to reinvest in their hardware, so hopefully they will be able to keep up. I know the TVs have improved in quality over the years. I've known a lot of people to have them. I personally do prefer Samsung TVs, but a lot of people like buying big ass cheap TVs. So if the TVs stay cheap and the picture quality if comparable with a good UI then I think they will do well in the future."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Vizio sells cheaper tv's... I would say well over half the people in the U.S. is in the lower - middle class. Poor enough to not want to spend $1,500 - $2,500 for a name brand television but rich enough to spend $500-$1,500 for the a tv of the same size and capabilities as the name brand one.  


So what I'm saying is, I think it will do really well. I wish I would've known about it."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I actually really like the intersection of price and quality with a Vizio (we own three of various ages) what pisses me off is that hulu blames vizio and vizio blames hulu and the end result for me and thousands of others (if you look it up) is that hulu sort of works at best. it's been like that for years.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup. My co workers are all starting to buy 80""+ TVs for cheap just to have a big screen but I'm sticking to a higher quality 65"" for now until they get cheaper down the line and still have all the stuff I need. Imo if you want a good viewing experience you can't just invest into the TV. The room and sound need investment too so for me I'm ok with splitting the cost all the way across my living room."
2021-03-31 19:33:37,wallstreetbets,"69 calls (110k) on PRLB (Protolabs) - Part 1, Qualitative analysis IMO PRLB is going to absolutely eat alive the machine shop industry in the next few years. Here's why

**What is Protolabs?**

Protolabs is a next generation machine shop. They take customer orders and then cut metal, print plastic, apply finishes etc. to spin parts back. Right now they are too pricey for production runs, but they serve the prototyping demand fairly well because they have insane turnaround times. They claim to be able to ship parts same day as they receive the parts for quotation. I've never seen that in the times I've used them, but generally you can get a lot of metal parts at your doorstep within a week of file upload. IMO they have 1 competitor, Xometry. I'll try to do more DD into Xometry but since it's privately held, DD will be a little more difficult. I've used Xometry before and in general PRLB just seems faster and to offer more services but I do need to do more research into Xometry.

**Traditional machine shop supply/throughput limited by human labor**

Right now it takes a lot of machine shops weeks before they start to work on any order, and the reason for that is because they need to have a backlog of orders in order to be profitable. Protolabs has cut out as much of the need for human labor as possible, and they are basically aggressively trying to have machining as automated as possible. Right now if you want to cut any metal part with a machine shop, you have a person in the loop setting up the machines, dragging the part from machine to machine and pushing go, etc. Protolabs still mostly operates like this too, however by servicing the high mix/low volume market Protolabs is not supply limited by labor. At the moment the cost of ordering parts through Protolabs is prohibitive for production runs (lets say anything more than 5 parts), however as technology advances and the costs of doing things via automated manufacturing processes decreases, there will be exponential increase in demand and Protolabs will be able to scale because they do not operate under a business model that necessitates them having a backlog of orders.

Also, if inflation really does pick up and the cost of human labor increases, at some point we'll hit the part of the S-curve where increasing costs of traditional machining exponentially increases demand for PRLB. So PRLB benefits from 2 parts of the exponential increase in demand- decreasing costs by their own methods, and increasing costs by traditional machine shops.

**They have a process for identifying and integrating the latest in manufacturing technology**

In general I think 3-d printing and other advances to manufacturing will mean the end of traditional machine shop services (currently 20 bil TAM), but it will be difficult to figure out which 3-d print manufacturers will be the real winners because there is a big difference between cool technology, and technology that addresses actual customer demand. PRLB has regularly been incorporating new technologies for years, and so they understand better than anyone IMO what technologies are worth buying, and what gaps need to be filled in order to streamline a next generation machine shop.

**Their automated quotation system has dramatically cut down turnaround time**

This is their real bread and butter. Right now with a traditional machine shop, you send them drawings and CAD files and they sit on their hands for a week and get back to you with any manufacturing issues they found, then you fix those issues and then the machine shop waits another day or 2 and then gets back to you with a quotation. Since machine shops need a backlog of orders and won't get around to your order within a few weeks to a month anyways, this back and forth of a week to get a quotation really isn't the longest path of a part.

With Protolabs, you upload a CAD file and their system automatically gets back to you with manufacturing issues immediately after upload. You can then reupload and, if it passes their initial checks, you get a quotation instantly. This cuts down the quotation process from 1 week to an hour. Additionally, Protolabs wins here because they do not have a human in the loop, so the cost for them to quote jobs does not increase with demand = higher margins.

Once the new wave of manufacturing really takes off, even if traditional machine shops incorporate advanced manufacturing they're going to be way behind because now their week quotation is going to be the longest lead for a part. And that factor is going to be the final üöÄ that gets this party started and will ultimately give PRLB a big share of the [32 billion TAM](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/machine-shop-services-united-states/) for manufacturing services. Currently PRLB does 434mil annual rev, but that revenue will exponentially grow at some point.

**Why I'm buying now**

At the moment I haven't come up with a good process for determining when these exponential increases in demand occur, however ARK hold's \~10% of Protolabs shares and IMO the main reason Protolabs has fucking tanked over 50% in the last few months is because people are convinced ARK has illiquidity risk in their holdings when they hold too much of a stock. üêª are absolutely fucking themselves shorting this shit - luckily for us it has given us a great entrance. I'm playing this with Dec calls because YOLO but honestly the liquidity in call options sucks so shares may be a better way to play this.

Future write ups will be me trying to baseline costs of production runs by uploading parts every few months to get a feel for how fast costs are decreasing, I'm thinking this process will give a better idea of when demand exponentially increases for PRLB

https://preview.redd.it/fx4ooubmudq61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=30394aba0dd17f2e5929a9cf4db1d3966b96c3d6"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like the idea of them so took a look for 30 seconds. Their 4th quarter earnings sucked and they have been on decline since. Does not appear to be related solely to ARK. Their margins shrunk ~4.5%, and their revenue declined 2%. That was Feb 12 and probably a significant factor. Still like the idea, but no DD is complete without accounting for shit earnings. Not making money is fine for growth companies for a bit, so long as they grow, rather than shrink."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Was bouta roast you for being incredibly late to the PRPL hype train lmao, learned of a new feasible play instead.

\+1"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôll take... *checks wallet*
2 please"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Prototype machinist here. I often use Xometry for work because the prices are VASTLY more affordable than ProtoLabs. That being said, we did just order stuff from ProtoLabs because we tack on 40% and pass it off to the customer. However the short of it is, I've sent $10k in work to Xometry over the last year and only about $600 to ProtoLabs. That being said, if ProtoLabs can get their prices down even just a little bit, they will have a huge advantage."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd disagree that ProtoLabs is going to decimate US small machine shops.  Many places are beyond capacity for work they can take in right now.  ProtoLabs needs to get beyond charging a premium for quick turn around times that rely on simple fixturing and using large raw stock. Not being a üåàüêª, I've used them in the past and they rock, just have always sourced to other shops when making production work for better pricing."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Were you ever a little boy in Bulgaria?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"!Remindme December 17, 2021"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you're going to an industrial shop for hobby purchases, the expectations on both sides are going to be worlds apart. Industrial shops run by **schedule**. Hobbyists do not.  You are correct in saying it is a different business model, but not for the reasons you think. Its different because its ""on-demand"", and not scheduled. It is a retail market, not an industrial one. 

A retail supplier will have to find a way to make the least profitable type of order somehow profitable.

*Right now it takes a lot of machine shops weeks before they start to work on any order, and the reason for that is because they need to have a backlog of orders in order to be profitable*

This is not true.  You can't bill for a backlog, you can only bill for a finished product (some contracts allow progress payments after material is purchased). A backlog isn't profit, its a wait-list. It is also a way to predict earnings for the year (bonded shops need to do this regularly). If you have ""work on the books"" it means a contract is signed, and is scheduled to happen during that year. The healthiest shops do tend to have the largest backlogs (good past performance = repeat orders).

Profit is earned through an efficient, scheduled process. Its too long to explain here, but pm me if you want a detailed explanation, or want to know how to get your orders faster. lol"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is a great comment, my gut is telling me that their 4q sucked due to most of the US shutting down again, the manufacturing customers PRLB services were really susceptible to slow downs because, like my last job where I used PRLB, manufacturers that integrate Protolabs machined parts have to do the work in person, so when one person gets Covid the whole office gets sent home for a week or 2 or whatever. At least at my last job we ordered less from PRLB during the last quarter than we normally do

All of that being said I haven't come up with a solid way to quantify if shut downs were what made their last quarter suck"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,lmao i can't fw prpl
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"We've used ProtoLabs a lot over the last 5 to 10 years.  Xometry is eating them alive.  The time to buy ProtoLabs was like 2017 when they were $50/share.  It doesn't help that ProtoLabs quality is slipping.  We've had to send orders back a couple of times in the last year because they couldn't hold their stated machining tolerance and parts didn't fit.

I wish I'd thought about prototype shops early in the pandemic, they did stupid amounts of business on short-order medical devices over the summer."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"They're beyond capacity because they have to have an order book filled because their business model has inelastic staffing. What happens as things get automated more and more and humans get taken out of the loop? Whoever has the most automated processes wins.

I will concede PRLB is a longer term play in the sense that small machine shops will be able to compete, but I think their time is limited to a few years. If inflation really picks up this year, and we're already seeing minimum wage get ticked up (CA just went to 14 from 12), the rising cost of doing things at small machine shops will contribute to exponential increase in demand from PRLB"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed you can't bill for backlog, what I was getting at was that a machine shop does not staff up for peak demand, meaning if one week they need 80 man hours and the next week they only need 40, they will staff up to 40 man hours and either ask someone to do overtime or add orders to a backlog

Protolabs works the other way, they are not supply limited

Also disagree with you that Protolabs is a retail shop. 500 mil in revenue last year, that's not hobbyist/retail money, it is commercial prototyping. Protolabs has been building that market since they're the only ones that can really serve it, compared to traditional machine shops that previously serviced it but in a generally inefficient way compared to prlb"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"That very well could be. It‚Äôs an amazing business model. If they can automate upload to production to shipping it could be pretty big. Do you
Know if they report customer/sector demographics at all?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,">Speculation: Maybe also because of the Brexit, IIRC they have quite some production capacity in the UK, and after Brexit that is not as accessible from Europe as before."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Not since the bad times![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|feels_bad_man)
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"In all fairness, I've had problems with Xometry too because they sub it out to other shops and they drop ship it to you. Some parts last year were missing a tapped hole entirely. Some parts I just got in today had the hole, but it wasn't tapped. Easy fix that I'm not going to bother sending anything back for, but mistakes happen. I make mistakes on parts, too. But typically it doesn't get out the door before I fix it. Still, for the price...

I DO get better swag from ProtoLabs, though. Their box of snacks is better than the one shirt I've gotten from Xometry."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've never had tolerancing problems with prlb but I don't remember ever sending them anything that needed tight gd&t, I'm not even sure I sent anything with any GD&T call outs

What kind of parts were you making?

Also what makes you say Xometry is eating them alive? I'm assuming you mean that you've gone with Xometry a lot more than Protolabs recently"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Machine shops no doubt have a hard time with staffing.  Schools aren't producing enough good machinists each year.  On the same note as automation picks up across industry schools are producing even less controls and automation engineers and technicians.  Our manufacturing industries are facing many labor headwinds, a $15 minimum wage isn't one."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. On-demand prototyping is definitely a growth market.  I'm not diminishing the type of purchase, overall amount of sales, or your hard work researching this. I see a difference in the expectations of the buyers, sorry if that wasn't clear.

I'm not disagreeing with you on staffing, either. You could certainly carry extra people on payroll if you wanted to (and if income justified it). Some do this, many prefer to maintain consistent work weeks and sub work out. Its a choice for each owner. It really is a balancing act, with costs and risks for each decision.
 
Keep up the good work! I'm interested to see where this goes."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,They probably do but I don't know off the top of my head where to find it lol I need to do some more dd
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like ProtoLabs as a company.  Their marketing is definitely better.  I've gotten good customer service.  If something is wrong they fix it, but usually prototype work is urgent so the time lost is still a problem.  


I've held their stock for a few times and made \~$30/share on them a couple of times.  I'd love to see them turn this around and be competitive with Xometry.  Improving their pricing now that they have competition would be a good move."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the thought out response, I see what you're getting at about buyer expectations...there def is a big gap to fill, but I think it's inevitable that it gets filled with a shop that is built around automated processes. I think traditional shops that see this coming will be able to pivot and incorporate more automated processes, but I suspect a lot will get displaced. Maybe not though, we'll see"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Read the earnings reports they release every quarter. Usually on their website there will be an ‚Äúinvestors‚Äù or ‚Äúshareholder‚Äù section that links to the documents. 

Also check out earning call transcripts. Curious to hear what you find out"
2021-03-31 19:25:34,wallstreetbets,CLF gains. I‚Äôm not selling. 
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You should realize the gains and move to shares. Close dated options are volatile and there will be a dip after this run. You will likely lose 20-30% of where you are now.

Edit: once volatility drops like it always does on bull flags so with IV for the options along with your profit. Good enough to screen shot = good enough to realize gains."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I have taken profits. Won‚Äôt be a pig.  I did keep a small potion of the April 9 calls.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Not closing short term positions until we bust down the $20 wall. Not selling my leaps until $30+.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the stock!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Congrats but I'd consider selling the 4/1 contracts.

I made a little bit on some $17.50c in early March when they made a little run, before the last dip. I was highly tempted yesterday to go on another batch of the $17.50c. But alas."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Why did clf pop?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You might wanna jump out of the 4/1 contracts.  Not worth waiting till the end, especially when hedgies catch on."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn those April 1st calls have some juicy gains.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is a vitards I can imagine, r/Vitards"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Since we have been deemed being one and the same. Congrats you and me ! Oh yes...fuck you, then me."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,When did you buy those?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Im here to see the loss porn since you are getting greedy and not selling.....been there done that

Greatz and fk you"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Good advice. But it sounds like OP wants to be a pig.  I don't know if they'll take it.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,what are the strike prices?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I took all my CLF profits this afternoon. Gonna see what it looks like after market open tomorrow. Definitely buying back in for the long term.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Because Steel getting hot. Uncle Joe saying the safe word ‚Äú infrastructure‚Äù a few hundred times later today in Pittsburgh.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Big infrastructure talks = lots of steel demand. Notably, this huge increase in steel prices has a magnified effect on CLF's profit margin because they own a number of their own iron ore mines - their cost to produce does not increase, but their earnings will explode due to the increase in market price of steel."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I sadly haven‚Äôt held a position in CLF but I‚Äôve been paying attention to them since they began aggressively expanding. They have been buying all their competitors up and creating a more fluent supply chain. Lots of good business decisions and a solid market.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm selling chunks as we speak.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats the right way. Id never hold long again since I lost 350% thinking there is more profits to be made
2021-03-31 19:22:01,wallstreetbets,Squeeze not gonna squoooze itself 
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm waiting for the peak to buy

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I always question this also because most of us would pay a lot of things off if we had anywhere near that amount of money. This is just money somebody else is willing to lose and that is jaw-dropping to me. It could also be somebody that has been involved in stocks for their whole adult lives or stocks passed down. It's still a lot of money that I wish that I had.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs very very unlikely to turn into 10k regardless of volatility. There‚Äôs to much DD on this to fail. If this stock doesn‚Äôt moon then there is fucking huge manipulation and the government needs to step in to fucking give me my God Damn Tendies.

You could really apply his reasoning to any stock you choose and without proof. His analysis also has a problem. The remaining open interest is priced with better strike prices in the 100s. So even if it were still possible to squeeze, you would need at least 10x capital to bust them. This is of course assuming that these are naked shorts - which we don‚Äôt even know."

They are undervalued from a revenue aspect in comparison to all other peers. Fair value is $45 in the short term. I think under the new leadership of Bill Foley they will be able to become the major wallet for all sports betting and be a universal payment processing wallet for sports betting in the future."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Good luck

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Ouch b
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You should be good
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been long since late last year, how did you calculate $45? I need confirmation bias"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Sometimes you just gotta like the stock
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey, I think u/greensymbiote did a good analysis on it a couple weeks ago. I am going to copy down some of his calculations from 2 weeks ago below. Additionally, since the market dropped a bit I included a 10% decrease in valuation to be conservative which led me to the current 45 dollar price target. Here it is.   
This is an EV/Revenue  ratio analysis. 

‚ÅÉ PayPal : 12.8x - 16x (based on PT) >>> Paysafe SP: $26.67 - $33.33

‚ÅÉ Repay : 13.75x >>> Paysafe SP: $28.65

‚ÅÉ Affirm: 32.2x >>> Paysafe SP: $67.08

‚ÅÉ Nuvei : 40x >>> Paysafe SP: $83.33

‚ÅÉ Adyen : 18.6x >>> Paysafe SP: $38.75

‚ÅÉ Square : 11.2x >>> Paysafe SP: $23.33

‚ÅÉ Shift 4 : 11x >>> Paysafe SP: $22.91

‚ÅÉ [Bill.com](https://bill.com/) : 84x >>> Paysafe SP: $175

‚ÅÉ Stripe : 52.8x >>> Paysafe SP: $110

‚ÅÉ Chime : 50x >>> Paysafe SP: $104

‚ÅÉ Checkout : 150x >>> Paysafe SP: $312

Average (excluding outlier Checkout): $75.54

Conservative Average (excluding all above $100): $48.45

Additionally, he included in his post the fair value based upon EBITDA  which came to 135.98 but I believe revenue is a better indicator for the company so I used that metric instead."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look at square and paypal. If you‚Äôre patient it will get to $200+ in 3-5 years.

This is not financial advice, just speculation."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,AMEN!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you! Have unfortunately had to sell covered calls to try and recoup my losses since I bought it at $15. I wouldn't mind unloading a few 100 shares at the strikes I sold but want to hold this company for a long time because I think that sports betting is probably going federally legalized before marijuana at this rate and think Paysafe will have the upper hand already handling most of global iGaming transactions
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Why EV/Revenue instead of EV/EBITDA?

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Is pltr trying to steer our society? I‚Äôm not acting defensive or downvoting. I just don‚Äôt automatically correlate big data always meaning negative outcomes. Also data doesn‚Äôt equal surveillance.

Their enterprise software is actually decent, they just need to cut more fat from things related to legacy business. Give it 5 years, I can see them becoming a profitable, smaller company that deals *only* in management software and cybersecurity.

Anyways, if that were my position, I'd hold. I never take the loss if I can see any future upside in one of my stocks."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,My mom doubled down today from 2000 to 4500 shares. She likes the stock. She's held for around 10 years
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Not selling until it hits $450 minimum. I got time and that‚Äôs mainly because I can‚Äôt tell time.

I‚Äôll be loading up all the way down to the bottom because what can I say? I like the fundamentals, I like John Chen, I like the stock, and I love a good Kim Kardashian comeback. Remember, AAPL was almost dead in the water in the 80s and just look at em now. Long play that I expect to yield some handsome returns."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dumped it a couple weeks ago in the 12s. Best decision I made all year.  
Would consider buying back at around it's current price (8.50ish), but I also think it is not done dropping. I can see it going to low 7s."

3,000 shares at like $17...guh"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Weeks and months are nothing. It's a great value buy long-term and was at $20 as well. Just means you didn't time the bottom right but that's hard to do.

Hold for a few years and the chart changes and you're so close to the bottom that it doesn't matter. I'm just pissed I didn't keep more 'dry powder' (gotta stop watching CNBC) to buy in deeper and lower."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I hate it but I warned people about bb months ago and got downvoted to shit. Im lucky to break even off it. Might buy back in when it's at $6 Canadian. At this point theyve been pivoting since 2011 (a decade) and still haven't become successful. Down vote away again.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is what I was hoping for another AMD turnaround story.  I thought it would be real cool to say I got in on this when it was still small

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I believe BB will continue to go up after all the bad reps because it can still maintain its eps which is more important than revenue for shareholders. In other words, despite loss in Revenue ""To an average person, a company's gross¬†revenue¬†is the barometer for success, but as a smart stock market investor, you have to drill down even further with your fundamental analysis when considering buying (or selling) a stock, and that leads you to the¬†most important¬†metric of all,¬†earnings per share¬†(EPS)."" Like Mr. Chen said when pandemic problems improves so will BB revenue - give it a few more quarters to mid 2022 year BB should have better tractions. At least give BB a chance to roll out its IVY to win OEM and earning. I'm extremely optimistic and can't say how much excited I am. Trust me most companies do not make in this pandemic anyway, revenue or eps are compromised."

After a long string of only positive news for the entire year

$BB Is down to $3.69"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel sad for people who bought bb at $30 but the stock is still a value play IMO. But I bought in at $9 so it's easy for me to say that.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm down voting you but not because you told me to
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Go look at AMD‚Äôs price history in it‚Äôs climb up and you‚Äôll see many trips within ranges like BB‚Äôs.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I think they will easily scale to meet future demand in cyber security. Particularly cars using qnx.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why wouldn‚Äôt you like it? 

IVY is Palantir for your car and QNX is already in 175m vehicles. Tesla may have more miles driven but that‚Äôs going to change rapidly when IVY is learning at 300x the rate. Autonomous driving is going to be as standard as power locks and Tesla competitors are going to be lining up to take any solution that isn‚Äôt Tesla.

Add in cyber security, if you really think papa government is going to let 100s of thousands of Teslas drive around cities unmanned without massive security regulation I have a bridge to sell you. BB was born dealing with government security regulation if anyone is getting clearance for robo taxi‚Äôs it‚Äôs going to be BB."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is literally potential vs execution at this point. Potential is massive, execution has been shit. Add in an uninspiring CEO and here we are. Hard not to own some shares with the potential. Hard to own a lot with previous execution and the CEO. All comes down to personal risk. Some people won't mind losing their entire portfolio on a lotto play, others wouldn't dream of investing in a company with such shit execution. At this point it all rests on Ivy."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just recently trying to learn about calls and covered calls... Generally, what are you doing for yours with BB, and what kind of profits?

I have enough BB and couple other steady-moving long investments to try some CC's.  Still trying to read up."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,She might have made more from just selling calls on them.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bb wil have its day yet, but yea it's been a rough go"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Before it turned meme it was floating i the 4s and 5 for 2020.
Then there was a 6 week period between 12/2020 and 1/2021 where it floated 7 and 8ish. 
It went full blown meme end of month 1/2021 and has been slowly declining ever since (a few short lived bumps along the way).
IMO it's low spot is the low 7s and if it gets there then you will see value investors driving the price back up probably around the 10 dollar mark.
I don't see BB (or AMC) as a good long term investment. To make $ IMO you have to time the edges."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hi from the future, I am dad. How was ER from March 2023?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I have been watching BB from the sidelines. I may start scaling into it. BB seems like a legit long term play.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, my basis is around 15 after averaging down. I really wish I didn't FOMO in when I did. If BB is still below my average when I close out of other trades, I will average down again, I'm moderately confident this price will be a joke in 2 or 3 years."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah you did because I told you too. Must be new to the market. There's no time for feelings in the stock market kids

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gotcha, I appreciate the context. 

I disagree with BB being a solid long term play, as we're pretty much median for both 2 year and 5 year prices at the moment."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Just because the proscenium was floating 6-7 range before meme mania doesn‚Äôt mean it going to low 7‚Äôs again IMO. I feel like the big p&d also attracted many new investors who did their own DD and are holding for a long term play... and some are kind of forced to hold. I feel bad for the ones who bought at the peak

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Doesn‚Äôt really matter who is developing the self drive tech be it a manufacturer like Volkswagen or Ford or a software company like Intel or Aptiv they all need learning from miles driven and this is what IVY is providing.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Sybase story is a lot different than BB. I'd recommend looking up his interview on the turnaround of Sybase. Kinda weird how he paints himself as incompetent. I honestly don't get why he'd say I didn't really do anything but he does. Gives a good representation of who he is as a person yet makes me kinda not like him as a the head of a company. Humble yet possibly incompetent.

That way, your money's not sitting and you don't have to worry about timing the bottom, and you still reap the benefits of it going down.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I completely empathize with those bagholding at 15+.

That being said I'm loading up in waves, my cost basis is $10.19 atm thanks to some covered calls I fully expect to expire just so I can collect smol premiums. 

I would love to double the intended position and be able to buy at like $4-$6; but I will be a big sad panda if I miss my shot to buy under $9 b/c I'm being greedy."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I haven't ventured into puts yet, I've only been doing covered calls with shares I own so far.

I've done some reading on cash secured puts, I'm not sure how comfortable I am with them at the moment. I know that I'm just picking a strike price to buy at anyway and collecting premiums off the top, but something about the needing funds to be available is making my head hurt, as a wrinkle is trying to form. I'm used to buying stock and then the money being gone immediately. Cash secured puts seem to read that they both will lock the funds up immediately, but that I also need to take care to have the funds available when they assign. 

It is this discrepancy that is causing headaches and wrinkle formation. I am going to get more coffee and crayons and try and worth through it.

Edit: I think the coffee helped make a wrinkle. It's both because if stonk moons the put will have losses. The covered puts only ensure I cover if it bleeds, not if it moons.

Second Edit: Fuck, wrinkle mighta smoothed out. The whole point is that I can't get assigned if it doesn't hit my strike, doesn't fuckin' matter if it moons. Gdi lmao I need more crayons."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"For me BB is a decent sized investment and reading through there is a nice way to get a quick glance at any events happening.

Ignore the panic and hype, snipe the articles. 400 @ 11.05. It can go up to 20 tomorrow and I wouldn't sell, as many have said this is a long term play."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"They lock the funds up immediately, so no need to worry about debt (unless you're at a higher options level than me and they allow u margin) you can just sell the put and then spend the premium how u want. I would only do this If I was gonna go ATM because premiums on puts are kinda garbage for some reason"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The banks be fucking me rough man, they enabled options, but only tier 1... the hell is that bs, gotta wait 2 weeks for them re-enable tier 2 and give me covered calls.."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not really. 

Deep OTM calls ($12) right now for next week expiration are trading at .02. 

At 140 contracts, that's $280 dollars premium to risk 14,000 shares to not exceed $12. Does the opportunity cost sound worth it to you?

 Is $280 ""making bank""?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeh, I just spent 30 mins on hold with Fidelity, but they helped me confirm my wrinkle. Funds locked up just like my limit buy, but I get a premium on top. 100% fuck yes.

If stonk moons instead I just don't get assigned and the put expires. Free premiums, huzzah.

I raised my options level to 2 from 1, soon as they approve me I don't see a reason to do a limit buy and not a cash secured put...like ever again."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What the fuck kind of bank doesn't have CC on tier 1? It's the safest strategy that exists lol
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess I'm spoiled since my buy in was $9 CAD and I sold a bunch of 15C for April 9 at $1.25 last month. I stand to make money even on assignment.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,the only time I do limit instead of cash secured put is if I want less than 100 shares or its in my TFSA and I'm not allowed

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I had 20 contracts up nearly 600% and cashed out so I can lose it on the next trade.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,CLF was my free stock lol
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs where I‚Äôd sell
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell and take profits. Worst part of options is waiting even an hour and you could lose half of it
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,HOLY MOLY.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Balls of Cliff
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I banked my lone contract this morning on the 20 high price hike for 1.61 for the contract. Regret not putting in more a few days ago. Printed money for me. My first option win.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,When I signed up for RH they gave me a free share of CLF and I sold it for less than $4. I could be rich right now.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the heads up :(
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Make sure to get out before it goes off a CLF
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Stocks only go up
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I sold my 4/1c at 17$ strike at 18+$ for a 3x profit.  I got bad luck so I locked in profits.  Went back in at 20c 4/16, the 3 ema's crossed today on the 4hr chart at the same point so we're going into a bull run!"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,i love these kind of days when you get a surprise bump from a stock
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I turned my initial fuckin'-around position of like 13 shares into 20 with some well timed swing trades. Still pocket change, but I'm recovering from jeemee nonsense, so my resources are limited to my regular tiny contribution."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is actually relatively solid advice. Secure some of your initial investment at least
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah, steel is just starting is run up right now, its predicted to peak sometime this summer"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Stock is still trading at a forward P/E of under 5. No other steel stock is as cheap as that. I'm holding my July calls yet for when the stock hits a fair valuation. [Note: not financial advice].
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,But why
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You're at least 50% poo tho

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Been talked about since december
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank the wsb mods for banning the OG who posted the original DD because it was taking attention away from GME. Then they did it to the RKT guy. Pathetic.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This Thang gon bull run, check the ema's on the 4hr chart!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Except for cliffs 10 years ago it was about 100$/ share
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Announced forward guidance, including $4bn EBIDTA. I‚Äôm retarded but a 9bn market cap for 4bn seems small."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,There's an announcement happening on 4/14.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Famous words before GUH but like dude said you don‚Äôt go broke taking profits.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You'll never go broke taking profits.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,To make money
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Because theta is waiting in the wings to screw you
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm down $2
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,That what everybody says until they‚Äôre holding Tesla stock and Elon musk smoke weed on joe rogan m
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't know why GME posts keep getting attention when other stocks are out there others would like to see DD on. Silly!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Steel gang went and made their own sub
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I followed that post DD, I was looking for it to show a friend but couldn't.  Now I know why smh."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Wtf thats retarded as hell
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Shhh
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If their earnings guidance is realized over the coming year a conservative P/E ratio of 10 would put them back in the 70-100 range for share price, so there's tons of upside left to bet on."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,These are July calls.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Wat. If you know anything about the fundamentals behind CLF you'd know to hold at the very least until earnings at the end of April. He can get even more value if he holds until the Summer.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Fundamentals are still solid though
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone did the DD on this.  There's a contract or announcement on A contract happening on 4/14 after that it should spike harded.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Vittard right? Haha i remember
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shit your right, my dumbass was mistaken stocks only go up especially cliffs, everyone should buy it."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Bull run!  Check the ema's
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre right, haven‚Äôt put my contacts in and saw 4/16, carry on"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,But the CEO just shared earnings yesterday on a conference call?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This shit will at the VERY least be $25 by the time this guys calls expire. Honestly It'll probably already be there come earnings later this month. There is literally zero chance it is less than that come July, and it's more likely gonna be in the 30s, maybe even higher. The fact that people are telling him to sell just reinforces the fact that most of this sub is twice as retarded as they think they are"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes sir
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nephew, delet this. That was guidance. They moved earnings UP on the call to April 22nd. How you thought yesterdays news was an earnings call when they announced moving earnings up, I have no idea, but here we are. Are the folks that downvoted my other comments this retarded too?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but you know options are worth more in a volatile market right ?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup. I got lucky and found them yesterday. Bought 2x 4/1 16c and cashed out at the peak of the run up with yummy IV. Now I can actually research a bit more and buy some longer calls. Bullish af for the little I know currently on CLF
2021-03-31 18:02:10,wallstreetbets,"Free the Whale- A brief WSB history lesson and why $SEAS stock is overpriced (again) TLDR; $SEAS is not worth $50 right now. I bought puts and I‚Äôm considering going short for the first time ever. FREE WILLY.

QUICK SUMMARY ON WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY: If you're thinking you've seen this before, it's because my post got deleted yesterday because a couple things I said were not approved by the mods. Mods said I could repost it now, so I decided to go a little more in-depth into everything SEAS related. I even put some quick headers for those of you wanting to skim through. I‚Äôll be answering lots of questions in the comments. Also, thanks to u/Neighbor_ for the inspiration on this play.

SEAWORLD HISTORY:
SeaWorld is a well known aquatic theme park company. Everyone knows these dirtbags as the guys who abuse whales, if you are somehow too young or you live under a rock go watch the movie Blackfish. It was a documentary exposing the life of one of the captive whales and it's pretty fucking disturbing. After a while their fins don't even stand straight up anymore from stress/mistreatment. PETA (ok fuck PETA though) has been on these guys asses for years and rightfully so. They‚Äôve improved somewhat over the years but their reputation has been permanently damaged.

WHAT HAPPENED IN 2020:
The documentary and story caused a slight dip in the stock AND specifically in attendance, but both eventually recovered, and SEAS was hitting ATHs of $35 a share in the beginning of 2020. Suddenly COVID appears out of nowhere and many start to fear companies like SEAS would take major losses and have to add on even more debt. A now-retired and legendary WSB member known as u/fuzzyblankeet notices and creates an epic analysis of SeaWorld‚Äôs debt far too complicated for the average ape on this sub today. Check his profile if you want to read it or reread it.  He wound up getting rich off SEAS death puts that he bought before it tanked due to COVID. He‚Äôs probably somewhere far away on an island now loading up on more $SEAS puts tbh. 

WHAT HAPPENED IN 2021:
SEAS struggled to crack $30 for the rest of 2020, but in 2021, it went from a low of $30 on February 1st to current all-time highs of $50. In my last post, I kind of breezed over how the stock even got to 50 in the first place. It seems in February there was a rotation by (mostly) institutions from growth stocks (think AAPL, TSLA for now) into more value heavy stocks (think VIAC, BA, air/cruise lines). I believe these institutions were betting big on recovery plays such as SEAS, and in the process these stocks have become significantly overbought, smashing pre-covid levels easily. This is backed by an unusually high % of the stock owned by institutions. 

Keep in mind this company is still losing a shit ton from being mostly closed, about 25 million per quarter. SEAS also had to add another 225 million in debt to keep from going under, bringing debt to 2.2 billion. How SEAS is sitting at 40% above precovid levels while adding lots of debt and burning money out the ass is beyond me. I don‚Äôt really think they are going under but it‚Äôs certainly a possibility in the next few years. 

WHY I MIGHT GO SHORT:
This brings me to my next point of why shorting could be a better option than puts. My prediction is that institutions will inevitably rotate out of a shitty stock like SEAS and back into growth when they realize how overbought some of these recovery/value names are. Predicting when this will happen could be a challenge. We saw it a little bit in what happened with VIAC/DISCA but I don‚Äôt think it will be to such a major degree this time or happen as quickly. I think SEAS could climb up to 52 a share this week and that would be a good spot to go short for me. 

My final point is to take a look at a stock that is eerily similar, Six Flags. Both companies are theme parks that were doing about 1.4 billion in revenue in the years before the pandemic, and six flags was experiencing better growth than SEAS. Cash flow numbers and amount of money burned from pandemic were similar as well, but Six Flags is sitting at 47$ compared to ATHs of 70 a share. 

THE LONGER TLDR:
You probably just ignored that entire post but I‚Äôll sum it up again for those who can‚Äôt read. SeaWorld is a notoriously immoral company that abuses whales and is sitting 40% above pre-covid levels despite being mostly closed the entire time. They‚Äôve done nothing but add on debt and hurt growth prospects, and who knows if they can even return to precovid levels in terms of revenue and attendance. As for now, they are not projecting 1.4 billion in revenue until 2022. Regardless, I feel morally obligated to go short and FREE THE WHALEüê≥üê≥ I will be answering as many questions as possible in the comments.

Not financial advice just what I‚Äôm thinking."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What are you thinking about your exit strategy for your short position
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would also look at the Seaspiracy movie on netflix and its gaining popularity to influence the way people view sea parks like this. I consider that a possible mid to long term impact. Maybe. People have a lot of options for entertainment and vacations, and looking at sad dolphins in a cage will probably fall out of style before roller coasters."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Just shorted with 10k. FREE THE WHALE!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I want to but the bid/ask spread is so wide on these, it gives me pause."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Interesting DD.

1.  Shorting a company on moral grounds sounds risky af.  I wouldn't, but that's your call.
2. Comparing anything to pre-covid levels means nothing.  Almost every index is well above pre-covid levels and we know the economy isn't as strong as it was before.  Some of that is just more money in the market.  
3. You haven't really laid out what, if any improvements were done during Covid.  Many of the entertainment companies took the extended time being down to improve their facilities.  The one thing they normally don't have to do major rehabs is time.  They had it during Covid.  Casinos are a good example.  Many of them sunk huge money into upgrades during Covid.  If SeaWorld did the same they could have big numbers soon.
4. We still don't know how to gauge what consumer demand will be like this summer.  It's anecdotal, but the wife and I have hopped on a plane on a whim a couple of times already this year just to go somewhere.  Nothing planned, but we spent money when we got there."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mon Dieu!!

I am bloody well in!!

FREE THE WHALE"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve been digging into this myself, do you have any ideas on trike prices/dates? There‚Äôs so many unknown factors but, everything is telling me this whale is going to sink"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Have a 100k short that is down 3% based on the last SEAS post. IMO this will require patience. They will probably see a surge in demand as people lust for family friendly outdoor activities and international travel is limited.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"To understand the exuberance, look at how many rollercoasters they have built that are due to open this year compared to the competition.  Additionally, most of their parks in the US are in the South, compared to Cedar Fair and Six Flags, which have a good number of large regional parks that only open seasonally.  


I'm long SEAS/SIX/FUN with some DIS and CMCSA to cover Disney and Universal Studios.  But I did get in SEAS at $30, so I don't care if it crashes.  I just like rollercoasters."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree. I also thought the same thing late last year and bought puts only to watch it rip 150% over the next month. Market can stay irrational longer than blah blah blah
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've seen the other DDs on $SEAS and I tend to agree with what I've read so far. The current share price makes indeed little sense and the company's financials remain scary. Apart from the increased institutional holding (although not a small point), what would be the other elements that could justify a long position on this stock? How's the current outlook for parks reopening? Just trying to come up with a more balanced view"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dunno, I was there two weeks ago and it was PACKED."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Where does one go to short a stock
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This makes more sense than anything ive ever seen on this sub (been here since January)
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,So what kind of puts we getting üëÄ
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I will probably secure gains at 35-40 levels but I could see it going to 30 or below, it was at 30 just two months ago!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"1. The moral part is only the start, I‚Äôve been clear that this stock is not worth $50 right now based on when they are projecting to get back to normal, I‚Äôm not even sure this stock should be 50 if they were open the entire time

2. Comparing to pre-covid levels is important, gives context to growth prospects before pandemic, what investors were valuing it at and yes there is more money in the market now but that still can‚Äôt justify a massive run-up like this in two months. There is still wayyyyy too much uncertainty about the pandemic/end of 2021 for this to be priced like they already re-opened. 

3. I don‚Äôt think there were any major improvements made that will cause a massive increase in revenue/attendance after reopening, the only thing I can say is that they have done a pretty good job of losing the minimum and staying afloat. 

4. Agreed that consumer demand will be tough to gauge but regardless, unless there is an extremely large increase in attendance (I‚Äôm talking 20% more attendance than pre-covid levels), I don‚Äôt think this valuation can be justified right now. And keep in mind SeaWorld is not projecting revenue to be at pre-covid levels until 2022 FOR NOW."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Ask Bill Ackman about shorting companies over moral reasons.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Ugh. Of course...
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,i guess long dated ones

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm spreading all over the weed ETFs. Way too early to try to pick who the 2-3 winners will be while prohibition is rampant. You'd think Democrats wouldn't fuck this up and legalize it within the next 3 years, but I've also watched them fail to strategize their way out of a wet and loose asshole with a fart behind them.

I'd rather bet on the tide to rise eventually, than which boat will still be around when it finally does.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,how do you figure Canadian marijuana companies are going to get in for New York legalization? I bought CRON for this because they're american and they're backed by Altria.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice. Hold firm. The shorts will eventually get bored when they see we‚Äôre not selling. They‚Äôre all over APHA and TLRY today.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs all good. At least you got skin in the game. Be patient and disciplined. Grow it to 50 shares. Work for more Green Day‚Äôs than red. Nobody‚Äôs perfect and you‚Äôll have some setbacks but stay focused on what you believe in.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,They‚Äôll be there. Just not today.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I believe it‚Äôs a $25-$35 stock post merger and I‚Äôm keeping through APHA and TLRY merger. There will be volatility through April but I feel we‚Äôve turned a corner and they continue to march upward. 

I will probably sell some at $30 and keep rest long term through legalization where I feel $50-$70 is possible. My plan is to also accumulate CURLF which I think is a primary takeover target for a Canadian cannabis company like APHA. They already said they‚Äôre looking and the CEO of APHA will likely make some fast moves after the merger."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,100% agree. Need more support from the ranks to overcome all these shorts.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt give up on it. I‚Äôve done same before. I‚Äôm always trying to get better at being patient.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,MSOs are the play imo. They are scarfing up the limited licenses and already got the footprint
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great question. Canadian firms like APHA, TLRY and CRON are going to have to continue to buy American companies to increase revenue and build their access to US markets. CURLF is an example of a US company that would be an ideal target for APHA and TLRY post merger and immediately have access to 23 states."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What's your average price for each and total gain thus far?

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Got ten shares of each company! Am I doing it right ?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,/sigh *puts it back in the pants* xD
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"To add to this, MSO‚Äôs are the play if you are betting on upside from US legalization. If that isn‚Äôt your primary motive for investing in cannabis stocks, there are good LP‚Äôs out there (in my personal opinion APHA/TLRY are one of them) 

The problem is, once you‚Äôre looking at LP‚Äôs there are also looooots of bad ones out there, backyard weed farms that bleed investor money and have questionable paths to profitability.

At a glance, MSO‚Äôs are better than LP‚Äôs, but it‚Äôs a space worth navigating if you believe in cannabis stocks."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, there's zero chance of apha/tlry buying curaleaf. Prior to their merger curaleaf was the largest cannabis company in the world. They have a stronger position in the US and their stock is currently split between the Canadian and US exchanges. 

Another merger? Maybe? But highly unlikely. They're going to have to continue looking for unique foot holes for their US position and will be directly competing with curaleaf."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,CRON is an american firm...
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,$17.87
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Still holding. I have faith in APHA to go much higher. We‚Äôll eventually see if I right.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks ü§©
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,No. Do some research and pick the one you believe in based on your research. Otherwise your just guessing with you hard earned money.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,CRON is based in Toronto. That‚Äôd make them a Canuck. [CRON ](https://www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/marijuana-stocks-to-watch-meet-cronos-the-heinz-ketchup-of-weed-2018-10-16)
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"When tilray hits $35.37, you're going to post on wsb because that'll be the day you'll own $1,000,000 in tilray shares after the merger.  I'm gonna be the first to congratulate you.  Idk my math could be wrong because I'm retarded and not a financial adviser."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well I used to work In the cannabis industry in Denver and I remember when reps from Trly would come to town ( they where interested in buy up a few local shops ) they seemed to be the o oh big boys at that time ( this was right around when they linked up with AB ). So generally I know a bit about them and how apha is going to convert their shares when they merge. 

What I do t get is why apha is better to hold if you only get .8 a share of Tlry ?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,you're right. I assume they were American because of all the money that Altria invested into them.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Some people feel that owning APHA gets you into TLRY at a discount which is what I believe so right or wrong that‚Äôs the plan and I‚Äôm sticking to it. Thanks for sharing your experience in CO. Share more. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one finding it helpful and interesting.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed. I had to double check too. CRON is another favorite of mine. There will be significant consolidation in the sector this year and I feel CRON is next with Altria currently having a 45% stake with warrants to boost to 55% and control of CRON. They also have deep pockets to snipe a few well positioned US weed brands to leverage their licensing for faster access to the US Market.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well for the most part in Colorado people in the canna biz are not big fans of ppl like trly or apha since the market out there is a lot more mom and pop focus. That mostly comes from the craft brewing scene that started there years back. However the canna industry is really maturing fast in Colorado and generally speaking the west coast, so consolidation is pretty much the only way the industry will move forward ( that is why I think these two companies are gold ) I know trly has some partnerships with a few of the big canna companies in colorado ( green solutions I know carries their thc infused beer, spoiler it sucks cuz it has no booze in it ). So I only see it can expand with in Colorado. I also know hey have partnerships with a few Cali shops too. So they are keen with working with local companies in certain markets. But before we go legal country wide, we won‚Äôt see any major brands . Personally I think legalizing will happen over the next 3-5 years so yeah I a def long on these guys"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup, makes absolutely no sense"

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

This isn't personal, we're just asking you to take a break and lurk the community for a little bit. We're... ""special"".

Edit:

Im glad this didn't go as crazy as it could have. If there was a day to go hard today was one, with likely re-balancing of portfolios happening to hopefully reflect end of quarter trends, data, and announcements after today's close. So the not so severe day speaks to how careful the short side is forced to be. Another piece of their hand is shown.

GME now officially prints +1000% from the $15 January print to this $189. This doesn't guarantee people and institutions piling in and re-balancing to buy GME, but it certainly bodes more confidence.

They'll do this so that GME goes up by about $100 with the assumption that everyone will just sell up like chumps and take the humble profits that Hedgies have allowed. It would be such a shame if everyone were to HODL just a a little longer and reap the billions that Melvin have arrogantly risked like the feckless drains on society they are.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"To my fellow banana people who are staring at the chart and tired of it trading sideways.  I know it‚Äôs hard but it‚Äôs for our own good that we relax and focus our minds on other things for a while.  The flatline movement this week can actually be a really good thing as it can lower premiums for option contracts.  The gamma squeeze at the end of February likely wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without the flat trading around 40-50 the two weeks prior.  Contract premiums would have been too expensive to create enough open interest.  So my recommendation is this: close your app, set price alerts, and leave it alone for a bit.  I‚Äôve got an alert for if it hits 215 so I can whack off to the chart and an alert at 175 so I can buy the dip.  If we stay steady through to next week I‚Äôll check in on the option premiums and consider picking up calls around 200-250 strike.  Either way hedgies are fucked."

:::AFTERNOON UPDATE:::

Fellow apes. We await our chance to fly to the moon. Today does not seem to be the day, but we have held the line strong like true apes... THANK YOU FOR ALL THE SUPPORT YOU FINE APES AND I HOPE TO HEAR MORE OPINIONS ON THIS MATTER!!!!


:::Original post:::

Guys. I do not think any of these hedge funds are anywhere close to being out of the woods yet. They have basically ‚Äúmortgaged‚Äù their shorts for later in the year. Meaning yes they have paid millions if not billions in premiums because the pain of actually having to get the short called would be unbearable to them. But at some point in time they will have to call all their shorts because mortgaging the future will become too expensive. Most likely bailed out or go chapter 5 or 11 depending on what they want to do. Once a company is shorted with a large amount of synthetic stocks and it gets called out for an extended period of time (first time in the history of the world) with too much interest in buying...

Now the part that makes all of this even more sweet is THEY CANNOT GET OUT OF THE POSITION REGARDLESS OF WHAT THEY DO IF WE HOLD.

They will need to buy our shares and at that point in time we will deem what the price is. The math is simple as long as you hodl....

I would like to hear everybodies opinion on this matter the way I see it.

I am going to eat a crayon and remember to tell you all this is not financial advice.

Edit - KEEP THE UPVOTES GOING APES WE NEED AS MANY APES TO READ THIS AS POSSIBLE SO THEY HODL ALL THEIR BANANAS FOR OUR LIFTOFF! * still not financial advice

Edit #2 - this is not advice it‚Äôs my opinion explained in a way that hopefully people can realize what is actually happening without going into all these technical numbers. KEEP UPVOTING ALL APES!!! * this will never be financial advice.

Edit #3 - watching CNBC to see what kind of scam they are trying to pull off today. They are very quiet. In fact haven‚Äôt said a word about the stonk. Today and tomorrow will be interesting to watch boys. 8:56 am

Edit #4 - I just can‚Äôt wait til OPEN!!!! 9:04 am

Edit #5 - boys keep those upvotes going. We gotta get to the top so ALL APES that can read can read this opinion. It‚Äôs not financial advice. I did math with green crayons.

Edit #6 - some good comments apes! What I have to say is I am happy to lose my small amount to bankrupt the corrupt!
Never financial advice.

Edit #7 - apes it‚Äôs time to get to the rocket. Leave all the paperhands in the loading dock and let‚Äôs strap into our seats. Tminus 10 minutes until we can fuel the rocket!!!! If you have any fuel to add today do it up!

Final morning edit - ok we are ready to open. I will be hanging out in my ape den watching the stonks this morning. I will be back around 12:00 eastern for a morning update and my opinions on the day. Keep it up boys and remember buy buy buy hodl hodl hodl. See u at lunch!

They are spreading news about new attacks and an expected dip, which would probably bring the most clever of us apes to think day-trading this stock might be a good thing to profit even more. (Basically a ""Watch-out, a dip is coming but all should be fine if you re-enter at lower prices again"").Most of us know that this procedure can harm the idea of what we aim to do, don't fall for it.

Im also different from you in the fact that I've been poor and don't have to worry if I'm able to buy my 2nd yacht or give up one of my 5 homes. You might think that I will eventually give in at a low price but that won't happen.

- Don't panic, ignore FUD accounts.

- **Remove stop losses** (the big short attacks you see are hunting for them)

- Stop watching if you're nervous, set price alerts if you want

- Buy the dips if you can / want, but HOLD

- Trust the DD (providing some below)

- There are no hard dates for a squeeze, and you're only going to disappoint yourself otherwise

- This is going to be ***volatile at times***. You do you, but in my opinion *Shares > Options*
  1. Today is the end of the first quarter
  2. Today is the last day of the infinite money cheat code for hedgies (1st DD)
  3. Short trading week because of Friday's market closure

A steady level $180-200 for 5+ consecutive business days shows just how strong the stonk is. $GME was massively undervalued at $2 and even $38. Every day the stonk is up at $190 the hedgies bleed harder. Eventually they will start to haemorrhage out of their buttholes until the government denies any request for a bailout. Then and only then will their painful lesson be learned. When they have no choice but to admit defeat, clear out their desks and limp home past the remnants of this absolute bloodbath.

HODL."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Theory time: 

Long whales don't want a margin call at too high of a price. If the market crashes they don't want to lose out on all thier other investments.

They are hoping if they wait it out it would give time for some to sell and lower the bar for a margin call. If they jack up the price to force a call it could get out of hand.

They know the squeeze is coming and will just slowly bleed out the short HFs. They want to mitigate the impact of the squeeze but not stop it. This could explain why regulators are looking the other way in the case of  the short ladder situation. They also don't want a collapse. 

Short HFs know they will be margin called so they will wait for that rather then sell off all their customers positions themselves to cover. They need it to look like they are fighting to stay alive otherwise who would ever invest with them or give them work if they gave up.

I'm not a numbers guy and everything I just said could be completely wrong but I feel like with the way the stock has been so consistently sideways everyone on all sides seem content with the status quo."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"My fondest memories at a Gamestop (EB Games):

One time I was in the car with my dad in the evening, we stopped at burger king for a meal, then we stopped at this little EBGames in Langford BC and we found the Half-Life platinum pack for 30 dollars. I was so fuckin stoked. My dad grabbed it and put it on the counter and just said ""Don't tell yer mum"".

Stared at the package all the way home in the car. I used the CD key on steam and BOOM every GoldSrc game was on my account. This was around 2005.

&#x200B;

The other was when me and my best friend went to the mall to get Halo:CE. Went to check it out and the cashier was this big british dude. He just looked at us and said ""Your nawt seventeeyn..""

""But yeah my moms right outside (she actually was)""

Then he just gave us the most condescendingly British response

... ""Yes lad but as I see it.. ***You're nouht sevonteeeen""***

The stocks had been bought by the chimney with care, in hopes that DFV soon would be there.

The retards where nestled all snug in their bed, while visions of green lines danced in their heads.

With Cohen in his kerchief and I in my cap, had just settled down to make hedgies cheeks clap.

When out on the market arose such a clatter, I opened Fidelity to see what was the matter. 

Away to open the app, I flew like a flash,
Tore open my portfolio and threw at it, some cash. 

The moon on the breast of my fresh GME,
Gave a luster of midday to all who could see.

When what to my retarded eyes did appear? A fuck ton of money for 8 tiny shares!

So I thought, I'd like to double what I'm making now. So in total at least 70k.

He informed me that I'd need 1.8 million dollars to pull that off. So I did some math.

- Don't panic, ignore FUD accounts.

- **Remove stop losses** (the big short attacks you see are hunting for them)

- Stop watching if you're nervous, set price alerts if you want

- Buy the dips if you can / want, but HOLD

- Trust the DD (providing some below)

- There are no hard dates for a squeeze, and you're only going to disappoint yourself otherwise

- This is going to be ***volatile at times***. You do you, but in my opinion *Shares > Options*
  1. Today is the end of the first quarter
  2. Today is the last day of the infinite money cheat code for hedgies (1st DD)
  3. Short trading week because of Friday's market closure

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey Ape's,

Please follow my line of thinking here and let me know what you think....

RC is onboarding several high level execs from super solid companies.  They would never leave, not even for RC unless they KNOW that the GME company plan will work long term........but also, there would need to be a short term incentive for them to move right?  A financial incentive.  That's what it would take for me to leave a perfectly good and solid position at a world class company like Amazon or Chewy.    

Ok, so if RC is offering incentives, I would think stock options would be offered to the appointee's.  If they know that the options they receive are gonna be the subject of a guaranteed MOASS, then RC is basically offering them a winning lottery ticket to move over right?  

So, having said all of that, my logic would conclude that somehow, RC would need to try to delay the SS until such time as he got the entire crew aboard that he is looking for, so he can offer them Stock options as well to entice them to move from these fortune 500 companies.  Therefore, when his board is set and his management team is set.........I would think .....Moon time?  

Is my thinking kinda thin here?  Or am I on to something?"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just some analysis of previous moves on GME. If you guys take a look at the 3 or 6 month chart of GME on TD Ameritrade with the MACD indicator on, one can notice that the red candles are closing soon and if we look at last time,GME went from the lows of 40$ to shooting up to a high of 192$ that day once we broke over to green candles from the MACD. Notice how selling is going down, market if beginning to pick back up from the sell off and GME is near entering bullish sentiment again through MACD. Also I suggest people go look at OBV and I‚Äôll keep it simple, this indicator suggests that there was little volume from selling and the OBV is actually higher than previous months when GME was upwards or 300$/share. This signals that people have not sold and actually continue to buy! GameStop should have some upcoming catalysts this month Forsure so this is not financial advice and only my opinion."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"President Joe Biden has unveiled an outline of his infrastructure plan, and it includes a proposed $174 billion investment in electric vehicles.

The Biden administration has released an outline of its infrastructure plan on its website.

It includes a $174 billion investment in electric vehicles that they summarized:

>*‚ÄúCreate good jobs electrifying vehicles. U.S. market share of plug-in electric vehicle (EV) sales is only one-third the size of the Chinese EV market. The President believes that must change. He is proposing a $174 billion investment to win the EV market. His plan will enable automakers to spur domestic supply chains from raw materials to parts, retool factories to compete globally, and support American workers to make batteries and EVs. It will give consumers point of sale rebates and tax incentives to buy American-made EVs, while ensuring that these vehicles are affordable for all families and manufactured by workers with good jobs. It will establish grant and incentive programs for state and local governments and the private sector to build a national network of 500,000 EV chargers by 2030, while promoting strong labor, training, and installation standards. His plan also will replace 50,000 diesel transit vehicles and electrify at least 20 percent of our yellow school bus fleet through a new Clean Buses for Kids Program at the Environmental Protection Agency, with support from the Department of Energy. These investments will set us on a path to 100 percent clean buses, while ensuring that the American workforce is trained to operate and maintain this 21st¬†century infrastructure. Finally, it will utilize the vast tools of federal procurement to electrify the federal fleet, including the United States Postal Service.‚Äù*

Without going into details, the investment will include funds to help automakers secure materials for electric vehicle production and converting factories.

The announcement confirms that the initiative will also revamp the consumer incentive to buy electric vehicles.

Again without going into the details, we do have a confirmation that it will not only be a tax credit, but it will also be available at the point of sale, which is going to facilitate sales.

The summary also confirms that this incentive is only going to be for ‚ÄúAmerican-made‚Äù electric vehicles.

Recently, Democrats have introduced several new legislations to reform the EV tax incentives and one of them, [the GREEN act](https://electrek.co/2021/02/26/more-generous-electric-car-federal-tax-credit-reform-being-proposed/), included a point-of-sales aspect.

Ugh one time I showed my coworkers making 100k in a week, and 30k in a day.
Literally lost all 100k real quick, but now I‚Äôve rallied up basically my whole workplace on GME.
I‚Äôve changed two of my coworker friends‚Äô lives.

Back when they missed out on me telling them about FCEL at .50, they listened to me for GME at $15.
One of the lowest paid employees is up 300%+ on her fcel, it‚Äôs hilarious, she‚Äôs a better trader than all the other car salesmen.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Futures are flat as of 0600. Dow, S&P, Russell 2000 all hovering around their close from yesterday. Tech stocks are trying to get off the ground, with the Nasdaq up 0.3%. Bond yields are steady as well.

There just isn‚Äôt all that much to move the market. (By the way, notice how quickly we‚Äôve already moved on from Archegos?) Earnings season doesn‚Äôt kick off for another couple of weeks and there just don‚Äôt seem to be any catalysts until then.

We do have the ADP jobs numbers for March, scheduled for release before the open. 550,000 new jobs are expected. This usually doesn‚Äôt move things very much unless there‚Äôs major deviation from what‚Äôs anticipated.

That leaves us with today‚Äôs infrastructure announcement by the Biden administration. Lots of drama around this already, as can be expected from an incoming administration‚Äôs first major piece of legislation (not to mentioned the poisoned political climate we find ourselves in).

But details of these plans have (been) leaked out already and frankly they don‚Äôt look particularly draconian where tax policy is concerned: Corporate taxes will be raised from 21% to 28%. That‚Äôs still well below the 35% level that existed prior to Trump‚Äôs tax cuts.

That‚Äôs it. Nothing about income taxes on individuals, wealthy or otherwise. Some talk about discouraging tax havens for corporations that I‚Äôm sure will be well heeded but ultimately go nowhere.

So unless the Biden administration is hiding its true intentions with this infrastructure bill, there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any reason for concern. There could of course be further policy announcements forthcoming. Maybe that‚Äôs what the market is worried about. But even then, the Democrats‚Äô majority in the Senate is razor thin.

In the end this whole infrastructure bill may just end up being more PR than anything else. Certainly wouldn‚Äôt be the first time."

""While our analysis of iPhone procurement and mix drives our FY22 estimates higher and our 'Core' value to $128 (from $115), our analysis of the auto market and Apple's multi-year investment in the industry (self-driving car licenses and LiDAR patents) suggests to us Apple's auto optionality is worth at least an incremental $14/share,"" they said. UBS says an Apple-branded battery electric vehicle, or BEV, could achieve a 5% market share. Apple shares rose 1.8% in premarket trade, but have skidded 10% this year, hurt by the rise in Treasury yields that has pressured other technology giants."

Seeing the business ""turning the corner towards stronger trends,"" Canaccord Genuity upgrades BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) from Sell to Hold and adds a dollar to the price target for $10.
The firm notes BB's weaker than expected Q4 results driven by licensing headwinds due to sales negotiations for part of its mobile patent portfolio.
Canaccord says BlackBerry management has ""created a cogent long-term strategy,"" but the firm is on the sidelines waiting for more evidence of product roadmap execution and emerging cross-selling opportunities.
The firm says a deal to sell the licensing business would ""unlock value and provide a capital infusion to drive accelerated software and services growth.""

1. PLAY (Dave and fucking Busters); up 500% since last March with no pullback, higher than pre-pandemic price. 40-50% drop imminent. Fraud 

2. T (AT&T); 190 billion dollars of debt on their balance sheet, they created HBO max to stall their cash burn, it‚Äôs turning out to be a massive failure... Hollywood will return to theatrical theatrical distribution. Over the next few years, AT&T profits will be shadowed by their mounting debt.

3. AMC; dilution, fraud, debt, bad management. Price target $2 by November-December. Cinemark (CNK) is the better cinema investment if you have to buy the sector. Less cash burn, better management, less shares out standing, less debt...etc"

feeling good about CHPT longterm. 

Quick DD: 

- They're down from their 1 year high by 50%
- More companies are going in all EV (Voltswaken being a recent silly example)
- Biden's Infrastructure plan, whether it passes or not marks the beginning of more discussions EV. 
- Chargepoint is the largest network of independent EV chargers. 

GAMBLE: They're a decent acquisition target for any company who wants to quickly increase their EV charging footprint 

Risks:

- EVs might be a bust. My take: this is very very unlikely to happen

- Chargepoint charging stations might not be popular. My take: this is definitely possible, but is mitigated by the fact that the rising tide of charging stations raises all ships in that it increases EV adoption which will help CHPT even if there's a more popular competitor. 

It's a no brainer if you're going to buy and hold.

* OKC +7.5 -- Look, this team fucking sucks. But the Raptors are not that much better and Lowry was just ruled out. I'll take the points.
* BOS -2 -- Jaylen is coming back to the line-up today, and the Celtics badly need to turn this season around. Expecting a close game with the Celtics coming out on top.
* BKN 1q -4.5 -- Expecting Brooklyn to come out strong here before they bench their starters in the latter half of the game.
* Julius Randle u40.5 PRA -- Tough matchup physically against KAT. Could easily see this game turning into a blowout and Randle getting less minutes.

Looking at Knicks -3.5 as well, but no action yet."

I did not keel u/richtofin115, bun bun did. Rich took out rat\_fucker\_sam after I mistagged the wrong rat fucker, and then mistagged again, so they all showed up and we (ok, just me) asked them to stay because they were cooler. Rich got insecure, which is what u/cashflow_ was with the Remy pictures, which is all because I'm going to destroy him maybe in the bracket and probably some other things. 

Mod bracket has been a thing, how have you missed that? Disappointing. Its been days. Beaver is #1 mod, zjz is last place mod, OIP was last place mod but moved ahead of lulzcakes and zjz after some things. Piss martini came after I tipped off beaver that memetron9000 is a sneaky fuck and memetron said he wouldn't try to come for the #1 spot and beaver gave him a piss martini. Canadian mod made it rain bans because he was upset with last place and not satisfied with 3rd to last.  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èAMA never happened, but it was offered because V1 was getting tin foil hat on us thinking I was trying to lead some covert ape attack.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It was at three days to cover two months ago. They covered. Anyone who thinks there are still short positions open from $15 is deluding themselves.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you were in since $19, honestly you're in a position to benefit from the restructuring that's happening. However, it's unlikely to have an intrinsic value over $190 for a long time. If it was me in your position, I'd peel off about 20 shares right now to lock in a 100% profit on original investment at the very least before gambling on the rest. Right now you've got a tenbagger on your hands."

As it‚Äôs tied heavily to technology it has seen some price suppression recently but overall It‚Äôs a long play and just requires some patience. You‚Äôll be laughing at the end of the year.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,you completely misunderstand their strategy. Selling legacy patents is a great idea.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"So what you're saying is that because they're selling patents they have held since their old phone days and no longer need, it's indicative of a failing business?  I'd be more concerned if they weren't selling off useless assets to fund their new technology."

If they get assigned, you've sold your shares.

As opposed to Naked calls, where you suddenly have to buy at market to fulfil the contract. Thos is generally considered a bad move.

The hope is that they dont get in the money, you keep the premium..... or that they're expensive when you sell them on a green day, and cheaper when you buy them back closer to expiry."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Two days ago you could make 53 bucks per contract/100 shares for 11 dollar covered calls.  Play the options game with those shares.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,The big take away from this is that Goldman is the guy in the prisoners dilemma who fucks over his counterpart.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow, Goldman gave a really shady firm way too much leverage, then when it started blowing over, shorted stocks, dumped the shares right after, leaving other brokers and the firms in impossible situations, but getting a profit. 

Yet retail is the problem here.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Somewhere out there, I'm convinced there is a bigger Archegos. 

We've seen this happen a couple of times. Last year it came to light that Softbank had YOLO'd billions of dollars into tech calls. Now we've learned that Archegos had secretly amassed tens of billions of dollars in credit swaps.

We've observed that when WSB frantically buys calls, it sometimes causes a gamma squeeze as MM's try to remain delta neutral. 

Somewhere there is a hedge manager with 10x the capital and 10x the leverage. I don't know who they are or who they work for, but I guarantee they exist and I guarantee they will try this - or maybe they already have. It'll be a fun ride that'll cause quite a runup in the markets, until that hedge manager fucks up. I'm convinced a large-scale version of Softbank or Archegos is going to cause the next collapse."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's one of those movies where if you didn't get the point at one age, try watching it again later and it might make more sense. That's happened to me with a number of films, first pass I missed the point, second pass I realized what I'd missed. 

I will tell you that there are other films considered classics that are not going to be timeless, things that were only significant where and when they happened. People will tell you Easy Rider is an all-time classic, for example, but the impact will be lost on people today. It was one of the first films that really broke free of the production code and did things you just couldn't do in films and was significant for people growing up in that era. Coming to it long after the fact, it's going to seem overly long, poorly edited and self-indulgent. (And ten people are going to call me a Philistine.)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You sound like me talking about the Beatles. Same era, different medium."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup. It's possible to acknowledge something has a certain prestige and importance in history while not ""getting it"" yourself. Like I know nobody is ever going to experience the Matrix like those of us who had no idea what it was, hadn't seen trailers and caught it in the theater for the first time. Blown. Away. 

There will be other cases where you understand what the director is trying to do and just feel it's a poorly executed movie. A lot of people like Gangs of New York but I thought it was a complete misfire. Likewise, many people will swear by There Will Be Blood and I get the story that was trying to be told there but didn't like the way it was executed."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I remember watching the lobby fight scene (in the Matrix) for the first time, in a theater.  ""Spybreak"" by the Propellerheads started, and I was so blown away with the music and all those bullets flying everywhere. People now look at it and think ""oh boy, green screen, who cares"" but when you were watching that sort of thing for the first time, it was incredibly intense."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"That movie remains so impressive still. They had a comic artist help them with the visuals and that's why every shot i so dripping with style. 

These days they can just throw everything at the screen and the lack of restraint lowers the impact. I saw the best takedown of the first Hobbit film where they added video game overlays and sound effects to the mine chase, just highlighted how ridiculous and inconsequential it was. 

It's too bad the sequels showed they had little understanding of their own success and what made the Matrix such a good movie. Everything they've done since has been an exercise in amazing visuals and pointless storytelling. I don't have high hopes for the next Matrix."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought GS stock because of how they were able to dump the bags on the shitty banks. Obviously the one to be in. Bullish.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Entertaining how it all lines up almost perfectly, but realistically the different segments of the bank are separated. The ER team at GS has the same type of relationship with GS's commercial banking segment as they do with JPM's or any other bank's commercial banking segment. Any foul play that occurs within the finance space is almost always within the same segment, not across segments."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone else remember when the only reason Goldman didn't win the mortgage meltdown was because AIG was going to default on Goldman's contracts?

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn, GS employees communicate telepathically now. How are we supposed to compete with that? /s

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I really do not think there is anything to see here.  GS is right, Nomura should look at their risk management models or improve their execution capabilities in the US.  
Morgan Stanley and GS were able to navigate out of their positions with minimal losses.  Why didn't Nomura have the same foresight through their risk mgmt models to do the same?  
This could be a systemic issue at Nomura, which GS is claiming to be the case, thus the downgrade as this could happen at anytime with any client with brokers that have out of date risk mgmt models.
All that said, the banks are shady af but this is not one of those cases... in my view."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Is there a way I can use that to my advantage?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Goldman takes the short position by definition when it sells anything to its clients. I recall Blankfein laboring that point during the 2010 testimonies.

Your stock market had a chance at 2008 to improve, but the US ""money talks culture"" stoped the good guys and nothing changed. Your economy fucked the rest of countries, more or less.

Make zillions of dollars in short time is not financial sustainable, this money don't come from nowhere. Sometimes the market must tank, and it's the little guy who pays.

Maybe this time US has a new chance to improve and change things and stop looking like a country full of cheaters.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Why should GS care about the market when the US government will steal the peoples retirement funds for the next 5 generations and the federal reserve will just print money to bail them out? There us literally zero repercussions for these people not to cheat the system every chance they get. Seize 100% of all earnings for this AND fine the company a % of those earnings. That'll curb this crap fast.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"But do you honestly, honestly believe that the Archegos fund and the likes of it are somehow a thing of their own? Brother, it ALL comes back to a couple of giant banks. They create the funds, they name CEOs, they provide the leverage and yes, they take it all back when it suits them. The Hwang guy is a scapegoat. The true players probably cornered him somehow back in 2012 or whatever(insider trading or whatnot), made him take the helm of a fund that they would use for their scams. Then when if/when it backfires they'd have someone to throw under the train. Think."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Agree this new wave of retards ruined this sub.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The reason they're against it is because many of the firms that were going to liquidate certain stocks were going to do so slowly to avoid  a precipitous drop in the price which would screw other firms over.  


Goldman bought Puts against Nomura, then dumped stock Nomura held, driving the value of Nomura's holdings down, then downgraded the Price target for Nomura, which ends up benefitting Goldman's Puts. That's how I understand it."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Bagholder?  They came out pretty well. They shorted mortgage-backed securities while most other banks were clueless on what was happening. Even pitched their trash to clients to get it off their hands

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not blaming Goldman directly for this, they are however an involved party. What we are most pissed it is they seem to do this constantly and get away with it."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL FUCK Capitalism.

I‚Äôd rather gold Do this then be the bag holder. The Chinese markets have always been a no no in my brain since they are a commie regime, can‚Äôt trust them. Gold covered their own ass and probably a lot of americas by doing this, but the average ape sees this as another problem with HF.

FU #1 - Before all this, THEY PUSHED NOMURA ON THEIR RETAIL CLIENTS and artificially inflated the stock price with their volume purchases. That the stock was ""outperforming"" didn't happen by some magical accident.

FU #2 - THEN they secretly bought the puts, betting the stock would actually drop instead.

FU #3 - THEN they dumped the stock that would tank Nomura.

FU #4 - THEN they downgraded Nomura for being ""poor risk managers...""

FU #5 - The laugh they had when they cashed in huge on their puts knowing they had successfully clowned not just their own retail investors, but the SEC and the society the SEC is supposed to protect."

LOL do you hear yourself. Old eurofag here - use your brain, Goldman Sachs is always ahead of the curve, they're head and shoulders above everyone in investment banking and have been for a long time. And for a reason. They were the first to flip their position back in 2007/2008 and they're the first to abandon ship now. Despite the deal they made with other banks to sell gradually. They simply honour only what they consider to be good business."

You are. The Fed forced all of the banks to accept bailout money whether they needed it or not, so the ones that did wouldn't be singled out. GS didn't need any money, neither did JPM.

GS helped its clients short subprime mortgages. They even shorted some themselves by buying credit default swaps from AIG Financial Products. AIG thought they were being clever by selling insurance on something that couldn't possibly blow up, which eventually it did. GS realised AIG FP had sold so many CDS that they might blow up themselves, which prompted them to also short AIG as insurance on their insurance."

Take a look at the defi space right now. There is a TON of money sitting around waiting for ""finance people"" to take it. The difference is, in defi, you don't need millions to be that finance person. Oh, and all of the loans are properly collateralized according to risk - defi isn't giving uncollateralized mortgages to subprime borrowers, for example."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I once got 3 speeding tickets in 2 weeks and beleive u me the ticket costs pale in comparison to getting too many points on ur license and having to take a class or get it revoked. I was on thin ice with my license there for about 3 years from that. Also the increase in auto insurance premiums is a lot more than the tickets.

From being hunted for killing Jesus, running banks and lending money to kings so the kings could wage war, then being slaughtered and blamed for anything from the Black Death to witchcraft. It‚Äôs amazing really and a testimony to their resilience that they managed to survive so many years of hardship. 

It‚Äôs heart warming that they finally have a nation of their own and at the same time a testament to the doom of humanity that they learned nothing and now treat others exactly as they themselves have been mistreated for millennia."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Forced.

The bible tells christians not to bank. The quran tells muslims not to bank for non muslims. Banking was a low prestige job tied into a waning goldsmithing industry at the time."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not gold smithing, crusades fall out. The templars had a thing like banking which got hard core stomped on by France and the Pope they owned at the time which is where the banking and christianity not mixing became a long term stance. After this, people elsewhere knew the usefulness of banking which is where the Jews stepped in and, since they didnt have beliefs to the contrary, introduced interest fees so it wasnt a 1:1 borrow, so they could actuall feed their kids. Then the hapsburgs codified Jews can be bankers in polite society and not much else until after the time period in europe that spans american revolution - post napoleon."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like a great system, but this is by ""income"" rather than ""net worth"" right?

In that case, someone like Bill Gates or Buffett would probably get fined in the 4-5 figure range. Those two in particular don't actually throw money around like other billionaires. Most of the 1% of 1% of 1% guys don't actually have that high of incomes so much as have tons and tons of wealth. 

It would probably hit C-suite execs, sports athletes, movie stars, and active board members harder than someone like Gates in particular."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Same in US. Too many points on your license and BYE!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,US speeding fines aren't that expensive relative to incomes or depends on the state?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,That's why they're being pulled over... expensive car = can afford the ticket =more money for the cop budget.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not a %, it's a ""day fine"". So you might get fined 40 days of income."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Speeding ticket in US is 150 to 300 or so. You get ""points"" against your license but they can go away by taking a driver course. So it's dumb. Lol.. Pple just speed here because they can."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Insider trading applies about trading with insider information on the company, not on peoples decisions to buy and sell."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck that.

The boomers were gifted the greatest economy in this history of the world in the sole industrialized nation left standing after WWII. Their parents actually, you know, invested in the country. They built the interstate system, dams, schools, water systems, the electric grid, you name it. 

Did they continue investing in the country to try to make steady progress and ensure a bright future of sustainable growth for their children? No. They wanted more and more. They wanted to suck every last drop of gains out of the system they inherited and not bother to maintain that system. 

Look at a 100 year chart of the market. See how it goes nearly exponential in the 1980s? That is the boomers sucking all the value out of the investments made in the 40s, 50s, and 60s while lowering taxes and stopping investment in the future.

In 2008, when it looked like their precious 401ks were fucked, did they reverse course and start investing in stabilizing and returning our markets to slow steady growth? No, they fucking tripled down on an irrational market and stuck the future tax payers with the bill.

I don't pretend to be clairvoyant enough to know where we go from here. But, I suspect that, since the market started moving exponentially up in the 1980s, and we doubled down on the level of growth in 2008, we have not yet seen the end results of the selfish, short sighted, and, possibly, disastrous policies enacted by the Boomers.

It is silly to blame individual Boomers, but Boomers, as a collective, will go down in history as the generation that won the economic lottery and squandered it."

Now, I have a silver 3000gt, speed more often than I should, and have yet to get pulled over because it doesn't look as fast."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,DAMN that's huge! yeah I'd pay much closer to my speed knowing it would cost me so greatly a price to break it.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Lies designed to hurt people would fall under the wrong kind of free speech

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"So you're outright saying Jews are better than everyone, or?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"No. You need to read more. So, as a jew you are not allowed to lend to your people, but you *are* allowed to lend to me, a gentile, AND charge me interest? How very convenient. Nobody forced ol Meyer Rothschild into banking. He chose that and for a reason. Why didn't they choose agriculture? Transport? No they chose banking. Awww, poor ol them. The fuck outta here with your biased religious propaganda. You're not here to further rewrite history. Here to make money so shut the fuck up about religion and history. I went to school already. Three of them to be exact."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Do not advocate for civil asset forfeiture... it is very much not a good thing.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, what the Boomers did isn't really surprising given human nature. What happens to lottery winners? They go broke. What happens to trust fund kids? They don't understand the value of money and squander it. What happens to many pro athletes who come from nothing and get multi-million dollar contract? They spend it all in a few short years. Same thing with the Boomers.

Imagine if the DOW was somewhere around 12,500 (close to its 100 year simple moving average), but we had taxed the other 20,000 points of value and invested it in projects for the benefit of the whole public. Sure, people's retirement account wouldn't be nearly as fat, but we might actually have a social safety net, shiny new world class infrastructure, healthcare for all citizen, affordable world class education. 

We have been tricked into believe that a skyrocketing index is good for us, when the data shows all it has really done is made the rich even richer."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I only saw 2008 mentioned, so I assumed we were talking about modern times. Are you seeing comments I simply am not? Because I'm having a hell of a time finding any reference to the 90s.

You're gonna have to enlighten me here."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am a europoor so I dont know much about free speech as we all live in very strictly controlled communism. 

But lies are a nasty part of free speech. There should be a consequence for those lies and it should be objectively decided what are lies and what not. The issue is that for this to work you need a judicial system that works.

All this is very far away of the scope of this forum so  I‚Äôm done."

Maybe they should announce something with autonomous driving or hydrogen to be back in the news. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)"

Fortunately I sold before Windows Phone pretty much gave up. At the time all the pro-NOK folks kept saying 3G and 4G would save them, never happened. They kept continually losing contracts to Ericcson and Chinese subsidized providers. This 5G argument is the same shit."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,They Even made a company NOkia thats justo too much hate... And hate doesnt go up only love can save them
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,That was because Pfizer has been in existence literally 200 years and has little growth room. BNTX or moderna or ocu any other of the new vax players has better volatility/growth projection
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You obviously have a bigger brain than I do. So would you please explain why did it go down instead of up? I'm genuinely interested to know.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same thing going on with Ocugen. They are a medical company in India that developed a COVID vaccine with great results. Price shot up from $3.40 to $16 and then fell flat back down to $7.62 at the moment. My brain says how many Billions of people live in India and South America & the African continent that could benefit from another vaccine? 

I‚Äôm still in on it as my gut tells me when their earnings start reflecting the vaccination the price will take off again. (It was $175.00 stock as little as 2 years ago so it‚Äôs not a nobody company) 

I‚Äôm a stupid ape and this isn‚Äôt financial advice. ;-)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The only ‚Äúbad‚Äù news I‚Äôve heard about Pfizer lately is that the Russians have been very critical of all the vaccines, mainly Pfizer, probably because it was the first to come out. The most likely reason is that the Russians want to sell their Sputnik V and not because there‚Äôs something actually wrong with Pfizer."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I did that too and even bought a few contender companies who were coming out with potential vaccines and got absolutely dicked. Possibly because this was not a profit driven endeavor and something Pfizer already had the wherewith-all to accomplish not needing major investment.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,its cause in the weeks leading up everyone knew the vaccine was coming so when the official news came it was already priced in

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I think yes

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is not true.

At 25 bucks a dose and 1 billion doses, you would increase pfizers annual sales by 50 fkn percent.

COVID will be the new forever flu.  There is so much money to come in from this over the medium to long horizon.

The market is a beauty contest and PFE is, right, not thicc in the right places"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy the rumor, sell the news."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The price was already baked into it. The price of the stock already rose through anticipation of the approval and when approval did come, people sold the stock (sell the news) and there would be set of people who would buy thinking it will go up. Key is to get in as soon as there is news about vaccine trials."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably the vaccine was already priced in in the stock price when you bought it so when it came out people sold.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stock markets are actually competitions between people, over companies. At the time that he purchased, people began selling (to bank the profits) this lowered the price.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,But that's still more than a 100% gain...

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve taken a massive current loss on this because I attempted to buy the hype. However, I think that NOK, BB, and GE. Are all excellent long term plays if we can wait it out. Nok has reverted to a very stagnant long term support level which may make it a great buying level. GE is starting to come out. BB is on the way down also making it a good buying opportunity. But this is all long term of course."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a hard time distinguishing rumor from news
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I read somewhere that Nokia found the cure for Cancer. But also they found a cure for the cure so they can give it back to the patients if they don't pay up.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Shit. So the easiest simplest answer is also the correct one. My brain just gained 1g of extra matter. Thanks!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Manipulation

WSB concerted action"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Could be but it's also a pretty common pattern. People buy in anticipation of a positive event which runs up the price long before it actually occurs. Right after positive event those people sell assuming that it's peaked brining the price down

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it still a mRNA vaccine? Also they raised their temp recently.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"not necessarily true, because their next goal will be to stabilize the mrna and produce later vaccine versions with improved shelf life and cheaper storage. after that they will/can leverage the shit out big pharma production and derivative vaccine development pipelines. that said, this will likely affect their medium to long term."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The numbers at almost 100% effective + took only a few month to develop is just unbelievable... The Chinese nonsense vax is more believable > using conventional proven tech and they never claim anything grand, not an iota.

The fact that many places bought the Chinese vax makes me believe their experts have considered all the facts -- including mRNA is just BS?

I believe mRNA is just another unproven biotech breakthrough... very far from they made up to be. But then it's understandable, we need something to calm the world down."

* Reasons to look forward to earnings, APHA will report positive earnings (which doesn‚Äôt happen often for a marijuana company)
* APHA has stabilized its expenses as revenue continues to grow -Sweetwater will be included for the first time on earnings and reports $200 million in revenue
* Tilray Merger Vote (April 14th) -The vote going through will be huge for both companies as Irwin Simon will take over as the new CEO of the combined company that will trade under the ticker TLRY
* The merger will play to both companies strengths as APHA is a king of development and production, while suffers in size and distribution ability, TLRY who suffers from the ability to develop and produce has amazing distribution and size 
* The joint company will become the largest pot company in the world by revenue and should take over Canopy in market cap quickly 
* Both companies have recently been acquiring distribution contracts all over Europe, and in some countries are the only companies to have acquired said contracts.
* Tilray Merger Date (4/20) 
* First off 4/20. 
* APHA is currently trading at a discount to TLRY when comparing the conversion of 0.8387 APHA to TLRY which creates an opportunity for Arbitrage.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey man, im at 30 shares lol. But tendies is tendies."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is about to be an exciting month for you then
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Didn't APHA/TLRY/weed stocks dip a lot recently? Also, what's your reasoning on a pot crash? I think it might dip further but because of the whole market, not the weed industry. I think it's promising with signs of legalization and growth, especially American ones."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes a Canadian company with a great CEO with a mind for expansion and development, and a solid foothold in the US (sweetwater) make no mistake as TLRY becomes the largest weed company in the world Irwin Simon will push to dominate the US and Mexican markets."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"you sure did show him..? I think. something something stocks always go up.
r/potstreetbets."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for putting in the extra effort.

Do you have any positions?  Please put them in a TLDR."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,A great choice for the merger if you ask me
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"APHA is currently trading at a discount to TLRY, this presents an opportunity for Arbitrage, this means if the stocks changed happened right now TLRY @23.23 as soon as the merger happened the $18.66 APHA shares would instantly be worth $19.45"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,">tb

There's an arbitration play at hand possibly.  Last time I checked APHA is trading at a discount to TLRY, so I could get puts in tlry and buy apha, because either tlry goes down or apha goes up to close the gap.

If the gap doesn't close you get more value out of apha, if tlry goes down to meet apha you make money from the puts.

But the specific numbers need crunching and I need to figure out the greeks in that play before doing anything, which I'm not doing."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Earnings will tell us a lot. Then it‚Äôs probably a week or so to merger and everyone who writes about pot stocks will be looking at these two companies
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Mine is 26$ but I'm sitting at 6000@ 10.45$ so I'm looking to sell half and keep the rest for life.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm looking for 28$  see if it happens
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Curaleaf is a great MSO and definitely worth making a whole post over, however this aphria valuation stems from earnings and merger, with a small correlation to hype from a future federal legalization, (expect a tilray dd post down the road closer to federal legalization). This merger will place the joint company as the largest pot stock by revenue, topping current giant Canopy, so to give a fair valuation for this company we should look at $WEED's market cap and expect to close in or even surpass that number."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is a reverse merger, so the aphria ceo will become the ceo of the new joint company, but it'll be traded under the ticker TLRY, for every 1 APHA share you hold it will convert to 0.8371 TLRY. So if you hold 10 shares of Apha you will get 8 shares of TLRY and cash for the 0.0371 remainder."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, I should have explained this better, this is why the sweetwater acquisition was so important for aphria, sweetwater is one of the most popular micro breweries in the US (also a very pro 4/20 brand that even has a 4/20 music festival) however it gives APHA a unique position to quickly move into the US market."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Not financial advice but I'd wait for the merger date before selling anything but if you have profits you like after earnings remember you'll never go broke taking profit
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It always bugs me how this coincidence just happened

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Hitler is that you?\^
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,32.49 checking in
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got in at $10 it went as high above 30 before it came back down to where its sitting now. Its certainly promising but there's a lot of speculative money in this which usually leads to wild swings. It's all very dependent on US legalising it across the nation and I think that's like 50-50 I don't know much about US politics coming from the UK but I feel like a lot of these politicians still are pretty Conservative, I feel like you don't get far in politics if you aren't Conservative, and for that reason I don't think there is any guarantee of legalisation across the US.

If all goes right though this company could easy be worth $100 a share. I think cannabis companies could have similar market caps to beer companies."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Possibly! We'll have to see how it plays out.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Got you
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,lol that‚Äôs not what arbitrage is. Arbitrage is buying and selling the same asset in different markets to take advantage of price discrepancies and asymmetric information.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you not doing anything or not crunching the Greeks? Lol. Plz update me when you do.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs fair
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,But are they allowed too sell cannabis in US right now? Or does it have to be federally legalized first ?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I have calls expiring 4/16 so I‚Äôll probably sell some and maybe exercise the others if there is a price gap between the two.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Columbine happened on 4/20 too. Imagine going to school high for that.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,That gets my dick nice and wet

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,NEIN I mean nooo who aus Zis hit-ler?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree with what you've said. Every state that does legalize selling weed makes federal legalization more likely.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahahahahahahahaha
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Arbitrage is a price discrepancy in different markets or different forms, for example a different form would be stock XYZ converts to ABC and has a price discrepancy. Same asset different form 0.8371 APHA = 1 TLRY"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol downvoting facts
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, they will either need to expand through pharmaceuticals or wait for federal legalization, however each state that flips will increase the odds of federal legalization."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Google is free; Merger arbitrage¬†is an investment strategy that capitalizes on the spread between a company's current share price and the consideration paid for its¬†acquisition¬†in the context of an announced¬†merger¬†transaction. The¬†merger¬†arbitrageur seeks to profit from buying a takeover¬†stock¬†at a¬†discount¬†to its¬†acquisition¬†price.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah makes me think usa is irrelevant to TLRY still. Would focus on their international outlook. Dont they sell in Europe? And prob in Mexico soon
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Both companies have medical distribution rights in multiple countries over Europe such as Germany, Spain, Portugal, and France. Although, companies have stated that using subsidiary companies such as sweetwater they are ready to spread brand awareness and move into the us market upon federal legalization (whenever that may be)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What about Mexico?
2021-03-31 08:47:47,wallstreetbets,"Significant Estimated Moving Average Crossover $225 incoming (short read DD) **EDIT** **3/31: Prediction Fail**

**Title** **EDIT:** \*Exponential\* Moving Average , too much banana liquor.

The color coded lines represent moving averages at certain prices on the stonk over time. Using the 55 and the 25, I will show why I think that GME will be (possibly) spiking toward $300 again soon.

* The dots in first picture represent 7 day intervals of the 55 day EMA at 182.
* The dots in the second picture represent 7 day intervals of the 25 day EMA at avg. 186.
* In the first pic. Everytime the dark red 55 EMA crossed to the bottom (from the top), it stayed on bottom for a significant period of time.
* Every time the 25 day yellow line crossed to the top (from the bottom), it stayed on top for a significant period of time.
* Those time periods at those crossovers for both EMAs were significant spikes in price.

My personal prediction. $225 level tomorrow. $250-$275 level Thursday. $300 level next week.

Eat bananas apes. 3 a day. Ape eat banana. Ape no cramp.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I read a post earlier stating that the margin call area seemed to be around the 350-400 price mark which of course was the rough price when they tanked half the price a few weeks back.

I've got news for you, it already did that and then some. Pay attention to the amount of shares available. You are  facing an uphill battle to get anything from this.

There is your bear case. Stock is trading at 81% of precovid levels with 150% of the shares outstanding. So before you think the stock has $5 in it to reach precrash, realize its actually $9.17 above that level.

TL;DR AAL has had to dilute the hellnout their stock to stay afloat. They aren't going to go under, but don't expect it to go up. Please don't YOLO into calls on this one. 

Positions: None I bought 3k shares @14 and was out @17.5 when they threatened employees with another furlough(stimulus prevented this or I believe it would have crashed already)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Bear case for AAL: it‚Äôs AAL
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Fun fact: AAL is the most overvalued stock in the S&P 500 compared to its analyst price targets
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've expressed this sentiment before and will continue to repeat myself like a broken robot until it isn't true - fundamentals are almost totally irrelevant to this market. 

I don't mean to say by that that your thesis is wrong - and I certainly don't mean to say that the opposite is right.

What I mean to say is watch the fuck out making what appears to be responsible, well thought out decisions in this batshit marketplace. In the short to midterm, at the very least, there is almost no predicting what a given security will do, period.

Edit: I'll add this advice is ESPECIALLY true for any bearish bet - which makes sense in an environment where the government is literally printing whales money."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is quite a dangerous play. Not sure about USA, but in my country, any ‚Äúreopening‚Äù is met with influx of consumers who have been eager to travel, play, shop, etc, and do the things they never could when during Covid. It seems people want to overcompensate their inability to go out. I personally would stay out of this one."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I misread this. I thought it was ‚Äú a bear case for anal ‚Äú.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"TLDR : sell naked calls, buy puts; preferably on margin 

Note: This is financial advice if you can afford to become homeless"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I prefer a case of beer.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,TL:DR AAL sucks fucking ass.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sales and business travel will never return to the levels it was before Covid.  Companies are saving so much money with people not traveling.  Zoom, Teams, WebEx... is here to stay."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree with you that it‚Äôs currently overvalued. I‚Äôve been keeping an eye on it since travel restrictions began, but I am still not confident about that sector. The only good news I‚Äôve heard recently is that travels are ticking up and they‚Äôve cancelled their planned furlough. I still worry that they are only this high only because of government intervention."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Overpriced in the short term and I‚Äôm also bearish long term. The airlines all go through cycles. They award huge contracts to their unions to avoid a strike when times are good. They beg for concessions during a downturn to avoid furloughs. If they don‚Äôt get them then they throw out contracts in bankruptcy court. AAL filed for bankruptcy with $4bil cash in the bank in 2011 and used all their cash for buy backs to prop up their share price since. I believe they can not do the same this time due to bailout restrictions. Their cap was 12 bil prior to Covid shutdown. Current cap is 11.5. Very overpriced and insiders still have large amounts of shares. We‚Äôll start seeing those dump soon and chapter 11 within 5 years in my opinion. 

I‚Äôm pretty retarded with finance stuff but I‚Äôve been a professional pilot since 2009 and obviously follow the industry closely. I just started buying puts on the industry today with plans to buy more."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, it‚Äôs a bear. I a dog with fleas. It‚Äôs a shit sandwich. All of it‚Äôs pilots think it‚Äôs going to go Bk any day now. It probably will."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I stopped playing AAL in December after my 1700 shares got called away.

Good luck..."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"AAL also had a fairly aggressive buy back program pre-Covid as well which drove the stocks to a pretty high price and contributed to the lack of cash on hand and needing stimulus to survive (from my understanding) paired with AAL‚Äôs pretty high debt due to their preference for a younger fleet (considerably more debt than United and particularly Delta). I made money on AAL as I bought in last March, dumped when it went up at the beginning of last summer. Long play would be Delta for an airline for me and I made a good chunk of money on DAL as well."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,All this and more was why I bought puts on AAL a while ago but they did not pan out. I think travel stocks are pretty disconnected from logic at this point due to hyper-post-COVID optimism. Dilution should wreck this thing but no one looks at market cap and just sees a lower stock price than pre-COVID and jumps to concluding that it's undervalued.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"One thing to note is that for the last 4 or 5 decades the airlines typically go Chap 11 every 5 to 10 years on average. The old debt holders become the new equity holders, new equity is issued and new loans secured, and then the cycle continues, until the now new equity gets wiped out in another decade.

This was the cycle pre Covid; Covid has done nothing but moved the timetable up for all of this. Even if the government was willing to bail out the airlines, there is no reason to do so until they wipe out the existing shareholders, and unsecured debt, with a Chap 11."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Will def go up. Fuel is only high because of COVID and travel is down because of COVID

Airlines will be extremely profitable within the next 5 yrs"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I already made 30k today in AAL calls.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,They‚Äôre requiring V cards to get on the plane and still require what 5 masks on simultaneously now? Some countries still quarantine people for two weeks even after 2 V shots. Puts on airlines. How does anyone still fall for this?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Comment says bear case for AAL, but volume is 3X‚Äôs that of other major US carriers, all have 600M+ outstanding shares.

I would think those with 600M+ outstanding shares trading 1/3 the volume would be bearish compared to AAL."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"how are you accounting for the money raised by the sales in equity? this isn't ""fake value"" added to the stock, it's an exchange of equity for cash so the business can invest/recover. it may have diluted the shares, but it increased their cash pile in the process.  i don't expect AAL to be the next GME but trying to build a bear case for a business in recovery with no evidence that it's going to not benefit from the same resurgence in travel as other airlines is misleading."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I fly American all the time, and based on the peanuts I get onboard, I'm expecting nothing less from the stock."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,They put out a 100% call for pilots to return from furlough this week so they can start hiring classes and wholey owned regional pilot flows up again.  They see the need for the pilots to return.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck that would have saved me an hour of research
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"fuckin real,

i'd rather fly spirit than american at this point lol"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thats why I have no stake in the game. DoorDash showed me the fundamentals don't matter.

AAL is overvalued by about 40% in my model, but I don't trust people to realize that or even care enough to go short"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Reopening requires less Covid positive and the US have had increased cases since the 23rd. Wave 4 already slowly starting
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Tormund Giantsbane just got a chub
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy puts dated for next earnings
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah a chunk of that is never coming back. 
Southwest and  other discount airlines are gonna be the ones to bounce back first and return to black ink."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"unless you're in sales or business this is a ridiculous thing to say, i am in sales and know sales people dying to travel again so they can close deals faster and build more relationships. zoom might be good for remote learning but it's garbage for closing sales deals and building relationships."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, it will come back. What you have said has been said before. And it came back."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This right here. Why are more not seeing this??? Sure airlines survive but the world has changed. I‚Äôve said the same thing too many times. Market is whack
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Another excellent reason not to get into AAL at this price expecting it to go higher. 

Anyone buying at this level is the bigger fool"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for the industry point of view and the 2011 BK info. Chapter 11 you say, fuck the puts time to go short!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree with you about 5 year profitability. All I'm saying is its overvalued now and don't expect OTM calls to pay off. Until they buy back some of the float with those profits this has peaked.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,5 years? Who‚Äôs got time for that
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,How is fuel prices related to COVID? Show your DD
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,The bear case is comparing the price precovid to today is apples to oranges. I'm simply telling people they shouldn't expect a PT of $29
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,CC all the way down
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol I bet in gun and ammo stocks that were beating expectations by like 3x and were increasing profits by like 70% you and the stocks were flat for months. Sure taught me that fundamentals don't always matter.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Post your model.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you feel this is true for other airlines?  Thoughts on UAL and SAVE?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You do you
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,vaccination rates are going to outpace any covid resurgence. the only thing to watch out for is a variant that the vaccine isn't effective against.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Came back after 9/11.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt even want to return to that business level of travel!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm in. Any rational person can see there is no big tourism recovery. The political theater of fear is already solidified in the minds of the weak. They‚Äôll take 100 shots wear a hazmat space suit and still be too scared of the 800 new variants that just conveniently popped up as people were reopening. What a coincidence!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe I read they cannot buy back due to restrictions from their bailout. I‚Äôm buying puts on the whole industry
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"> apples to oranges

But you can still compare them."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah man, here the wife is the boss"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You do know that there is a grace period of 90 days from contracting and being treated for Covid-19 before a vaccine can be administered, right?

Each positive case delays that persons timeframe for vaccine by 90 days.

And that none of the vaccines currently are approved for ppl under 16 right, which is \~21% of the US population?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,AAL filed chapter 11 in 2011. Took 20 years to come back after 9/11. You‚Äôre money is better invested elsewhere
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,And I did exactly that. At its current price its trading at a 30% premium to before the crash. Overvalued
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Wife's boyfriend* <---fixed that for you
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"pretty sure none of them are technically ‚Äúapproved‚Äù for anyone right now. Authorized, sure. Maybe you could even say ‚Äúapproved for emergency authorization.‚Äù But the word ‚Äúapprove‚Äù has a certain meaning in the context of the FDA process."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Pfizer will be approved shortly for 12 and over. Positive covid test also equals immunity so they should add to the pool of immune people until 90 days is over and the can get immunized.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"i'm all for being cautious and careful, but fearmongering doesn't help anyone either. yes there's a grace period, but the population that is excluded due to grace period isn't growing exponentially, people are also more aware and more acutely sensitive to the symptoms, and the impact to children is already shown to be low risk. 

&#x200B;

we're not going to ""eradicate"" covid-19 (the nature of coronaviruses is they'll never be eliminated) but it's going to become low risk / low impact enough that most people can start to go on with their lives without being afraid of their shadows."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not true at all. You can get vaccinated as soon as your are done quarantining for COVID-19, per CDC guidelines.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"No it didn't, do some reading at most two years. 1.66bn flew the year before 9/11 and 1.63bn flew in 2002 only one year after. Are you 14?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,We like the stock.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"No it does not according to CDC.

An an extract to the question about getting vaccine even though you have had contracted covid-19:

>Yes, you should be vaccinated regardless of whether you already had COVID-19. That‚Äôs because experts do not yet know how long you are protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19. ..."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôll let you buy the US airline index from me at the price on September 10, 2001 and sell it back to me at any daily price in the next 13 years. Let me know how much you‚Äôd like."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Then you should be happy to hold it longterm while its in the red
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"the recommendation about getting vaccinated anyways does not preclude that people who already contracted covid aren't protected / immune to some extent. remember we're not trying to ""eliminate"" covid, we're trying to reduce both the spread and severity of the disease so it's more like the common cold and less like the flu."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Index is different a whole pile of airlines went under. Poor leadership and recession. I was more looking at riders miles and flights. Major carriers are still around.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"i'm not in the red, i bought it well before and it's a long term hold for me, i've also held long term stocks that dropped 50% based on bad news that later recovered because bad news is sometimes just bad news and not actually impactful to a company's operating performance or intrinsic value. bear sentiment because a company issued more shares to raise capital is like saying IPOs should be bearish because if the company was doing so well why would dilute their ownership and share volume."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Every major airline besides southwest filed for bankruptcy between 2001 and 2011. All regional airlines did the same. They did not recover. You should stick to calling people 14. You know nothing about this industry

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It's leverage.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Does nobody here read the whole comment....

HAS A LOT MORE ROOM TO RUN AS STEEL PRICES RISE...

Debt in this context is good..."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"they will come down, right now id like them not to for my benefit. but with china rebates going poof, id like to see US steel make a come back and enjoy some higher prices as well."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I am aware of this. But for some reason it starts to be common that bad news equals rise.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"200k salary for a single person is not ""middle class"""
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,200k per year is middle class?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs the top 1%-2% in America
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Where does it say that? https://www.axios.com/biden-tax-plan-increases-b8905001-1ef2-45c8-8165-87ac89d1c2fe.html

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs not a super secret club we‚Äôd just prefer to keep the DD based on facts rather than religion like the current wsb culture lol
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Meanwhile Clf +20% right now...
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Because that's priced in prior to release.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,oh good I‚Äôll call my mom and tell her.  She will be so proud I climbed out of the middle class bracket üòÇ
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes.  I‚Äôm middle class
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"lol no way dude.  

you have to factor in coat of living too.   That‚Äôs middle class wages in most metro areas but you could ball out if you lived in South Dakota."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,https://www.wsj.com/articles/down-the-biden-tax-threshold-11616360766
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Its leverage...

Same concept as if I bought say an investment property and used debt to juice my returns.

If steel prices really do skyrocket, then clf is going go much much higher."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"lol get real dude. I make $175k a year and I know I am not fucking middle class. The average household income in my city is like $70k. I make over double that.

You are definitely in the top 5% of the country, maybe top 10% in your city but if you were in SF or NYC you still be in the top 10%."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"With everything remote now its your choice, and a retarded one at that, if you decide to live in a high cost of living area. That is your problem"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry to break it to you.  You are not upper class dude.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I must have missed the news about COVID vaccinations not working and another year of WFH lockdown.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"From your article:

But the day after the interview, Psaki said something different. A reporter asked for a definition of anybody: ‚ÄúTo clarify, did he mean individuals or households? Because it wasn‚Äôt very clear.‚Äù
‚ÄúFamilies,‚Äù Psaki replied.
This response was puzzling, to say the least. Her response raised the possibility that individuals making less than $400,000 would face higher taxes.

But at another point, Yellen also referred to families. ‚ÄúPresident Biden has stated that he will not ask families making under $400,000 per year to pay more in taxes,‚Äù Yellen wrote.

Meanwhile, Heather Boushey, a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, sidestepped the question in a recent interview with Bloomberg TV about the level of income that would affect individuals. ‚ÄúAll the details are still to be worked out,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThis is an ongoing conversation, so I can‚Äôt speak to specifics at this point.‚Äù"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm honestly curious what you consider upper class then because I‚Äôm friends with a millionaire that considers herself middle class. It‚Äôs become political double speak because the ‚Äúrich‚Äù are bad but the middle class just wants to ‚Äúsurvive.‚Äù
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can make as many excuses as you want to justify yourself not moving, but nearly all industries are permanently changed to allow for WFH. And can be negotiated for in your contract"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You left out the most important paragraph, but we will find out for sure this week. 

Naturally, we queried the White House for an explanation. A White House official told The Fact Checker: ‚ÄúPresident Biden‚Äôs plan will not raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000.‚Äù
The definition of ‚Äúanyone‚Äù is ‚Äúany person.‚Äù That would cover individual taxpayers."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,sounds like something someone who make less than $200k would say.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"you mean the part where WaPo tries to spin it into something positive by mentioning an unnamed ‚Äúwhitehouse official‚Äù üòÇ 

They are setting the stage my man.  Don‚Äôt be surprised."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol. They got you by the balls my man
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,nah I‚Äôm good.  Apparently I‚Äôm rich and not middle class so you gotta weigh the pros and cons I suppose.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not what anyone is saying. 200k isnt rich.

My point is dont bitch about living in a high cost of living area when its your choice"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm not bitching.  My city is actually considered one of the most affordable to live.   

I live in a middle class suburban neighborhood.  I am 100% middle class.  Maybe upper-middle now...but definitely not top 1-2%."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hehehehe I've heard rumors about retards like you, cant believe I actually found one. 200k middle class neighborhood btw heheheeee."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,To me BB has long term appeal. I looked into them prior to the meme stock phase. It's a stock that is cheap currently but can certainly rise  down the road as technology is further Integrated in our every day lives. They're also creating new patents which is always a good sign that R&D is going strong.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude, you have had so many chances to avg down, so why don‚Äôt you lol. BB is a long ass term play anyway."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,fuck dude.. this hurts. we be coming back for ya tho. hang in there.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude, seriously.. start averaging down.  If you don't have enough buying power, sell CC on 2k shares you have to increase it a bit. At 70% loss, it's almost not worth selling it."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"In the upcoming decade the importance of good cyber securty will play the biggest fucking role in the world. On a daily basis their are attacks. Here in my country you would think security wise it would be solid (western ofcours), no so many fucking flaws. Meanwhile data collectors like Microsoft and Amazon are placing their servers here. 

We shall see who will be the biggest fucking player in security for cars, data centers or smaller companies to help them secure their information. 

I am so fucking excited for the day, that $BB gets his acknowledgement that it deserves."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"$21 canadian so I think my average is like $17 usd? 

I thought a long time about buying bb and had decided to go balls deep over the weekend prior to the big run up of meme stocks. I had fully expected to be waiting for EOY to see big gains so I'm OK with waiting. 

Obviously in hindsight I wish I had sold at the peak and just bought back later. But I do believe EOY I'll be green"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Time to BUY!! bB to the moon

Nothing can wake this fucking thing up. Earnings report didn't help at all though lol. I'm in at $14, probably should have sold my shares to you so you could have my collectables.

Long long long term hold for me, I guess. I think eventually they might do something that the market sees as a positive thing, and we might eventually break even."

Dude could have been out at 20 for sure if he had common sense discipline to have ‚Äúsell pls‚Äù safeguard.   Yes it sucks to get stopped out but when momentum goes down for this long (like red coming out 10 times) you want someone to say dont bet black after 4th time in a row and just watch.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is quality loss porn. This is the reason I keep coming back to WSB.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This hurts the soul.

Are you considering averaging down or just holding? I don't know where your ""that's a lot of money"" line is but it's ""only"" about $15k to get your CB below $20. $40k will get you below $15.

Falling knife and all that but at 70% down the odds of this every breaking even are slim, so you've got to decide if you'd rather just cut your losses now and reallocate that $17k or try to average down enough to minimize overall losses."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Just sell it and buy GME lol
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"so you're the dude who bought my shares I sold at 28-29$ lol.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,In for 150 @ 14
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You fuckn hero
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,One of us
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would buy the dip. Average down to sub $10 cost basis, and you should be fine. This is not financial advice."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Position 800 shares. Bought in at $19 and slowly reduced my average all the way to $16. Selling weeklies to reduce my cost basis
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,How? Who? What? When? Why? Where? Here? There?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You really would be a talented put buyer
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"congrats, I really thought I had the highest average at 26something.

I've since fucked off from BB though."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wish I had as many positions as you, be patient it will pay out."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I kinda there with you. Bought 200 shares around 18.18. Been red for a while now
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh the fomo must have been bad.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,LOL
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,285 @ $21. Its the worst position in my portfolio. I got caught chasing it. Probably gonna average down today with the drop from the earnings report. We‚Äôll see how low it goes.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Here take this poor man‚Äôs version of an award üèÖ
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,My mom is holding 2000 for the last ten years. She hasn't seen the light of green for about nine of them. I think her cost basis is in the 30's although she is considering picking up more. You could say she likes the stock. I'm holding 100 as well at about 10$
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The 52 week range is 3.18-28.77, Jesus Christ what a timing you have"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,100 at 19. Someone come and save me.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell covered calls until the heat death lf the universe
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,F
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Average down
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Started average down but it keeps of hemorrhaging
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"i used to be like you adventurer, then i sold my BB for a loss to get moaar GME"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahah ohhhhhhhh farts....
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,They need to make a deal with Apple or Samsung if this is ever going to go back up
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,im in at avg 15  with 100 shares ... :-(
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Good time to average down?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"175 @ $22.83....guess I need to start drinking the kool-aid of this being a great longterm hold and all the fundamentals, yadda, yadda..."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dang this is straight up retarded lol. Just buy more and average down, ez pz"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the stock but you get the award for bad timing my guy.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck... I sold for a 2k loss
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Hold it!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Ummmm......to the moon?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I resemble this post at $14 and I thought I had it bad.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,respect ü¶ç
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Apparently, you dont like money?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs impressive
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,20 @23.95 barely enough money left to buy some crayons and sit back to watch the show
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,F
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Big ooof size
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right there with you, the scale is different though."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,How did BB ever reach close to 30? What happened that week?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep. Similar here. Didn‚Äôt lose anything if you haven‚Äôt sold. 
Long term invest I guess"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude....
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,100 at 12.66 looks like we will hold these for a little bit ü•¥
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,28.67 at the time was a good buy
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let us know when you gonna sell, so we can buy üöÄ"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought I was bad at 25.88
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What did you see in the stock that caused you to buy?  Did you learn anything from this?  Was it a FOMO thing?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought the dip at $24 üòÇ
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Today will be a good day to avg down. Currently 25 at 14.13 so I might get down to 11 after today, then hold for the run up late this year."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,That beautiful!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought it was a good idea to toss $600 on BB at 2:30PM yesterday, before earnings. I am retarded"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You and I share a bond (19.08 x 1000).
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Achievement unlocked
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,That sucks. I sold my calls at the top perfectly and felt like a king with those profits. If you were watching it closely enough on that day it was pretty obvious $28 was the top. Greed.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm at 28.50 the ship will pick us up soon lol
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Me too lmao
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm on the red also, but I WAS also red on one other stonk. The way I see it; stonks only go up, and Ape together strong."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Big oof
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you. I needed this. Just got out.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess sell covered calls when IV is back up to offset the loss?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you're dumb enough to hold, try being smart enough to average down."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,One day in January it doubled and then halved back down. In the last year it has done nothing really.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm 500 at 21$, but BB is a long-term play now. They've turned the business around. With EVs becoming more mainstream their going to the moon"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought a call at 28 and paid a premium of 9 üòÇ
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit you suck at this. Thank you, Well done"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I think you bought my shares
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,How bad is $16.70? Asking for a friend....100% not me. Okay fine its me.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"[$20 bagholder, checking in](http://imgur.com/gallery/8KtRJFN)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This made me feel better about my bb position
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Jesus.  I'm pissed I am in at $11.37.  Good luck!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn dude I thought I was tits up at 11.72 a share lol
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,HOLDING BB TO THE MOONNNNNN!!!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Hold forever. We weren't supposed to know about BB. NEVER sell. I'm holding a few hundred shares @ $13 until MINIMUM $40/share
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Those arent bags those are fucking dumbbells and you sir must be jacked

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Blackberry key 3 comming soon, don‚Äôt sell üò∂"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs not a loss until you sell, however, goddamn that is a large negative position. I‚Äôm sorry. I truly hope you can recover your money at least for a wash if not profit. Just stay strong and keep on holding. At this point there is no point of selling,"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought I was bad at 16.17
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,DAYUUMMMM üòØ
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought more!

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,How is your average price $28? Lmao i didnt know BB reached that high.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,595 shares @ $16.67.  I'm down almost $5K.  Just hold and hope for some kind of profit in next 2-3 years?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,this man really is holding at the tippity top
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jesus, that's quite an average price.  I thought I was fucked at 12.01."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Decided now was a good time to buy in got 24 @ 8.40 , not much but going to be holding this for the long run."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought firstly 300 @ $12 a rode that rollecoaster up and then all the way down. Im from Croatia and that $8400 is almost a year salary. Not selling
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Completely smashed. We‚Äôll pick you in 5 years brotha
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,There are no losers in trading. Only long term investors.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just keep holding bro. It WILL come back. When? I dunno, but it will."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,my average cost is $22
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It makes me feel better holding 3,500 shares at $12.50"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I totally fucked up my portfolio with this one.  Not going to make that mistake again!  How‚Äôs everyone playing this just hold or sell off and put money into something that will make money"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought got 900 shares at 20 usd. F
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Madness!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oof.

I started buying at 12.50. Never stopped.

I bought some at 8.58 today."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I also feel that way op. I'm still holding some BB from those heights and now I'm totally in the red on those remaining shares as my avg purchase price was around $9.20 ish.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is really hard to do OP.  Congratulations OP.  Your timing is impeccable.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Me too
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,LMAO
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Oof.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ooof. I‚Äôm with you friend, only at 500 shares though."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,1000 @ 7.23
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell and buy a long call to gain back losses should it go back up. Then use spare cash on GME. :)
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You'll fit right in. üòé
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You got this!  Just average down, cut back on your crayon intake and you‚Äôll be fine!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,450 @ 16.80 ü§¢
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,That is a special kind of retard. Bless your diamond hands.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn...I was pissed I bought at $9.56...
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,500 shares @ $15/shares. Covered calls are your rope out of the hole.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,pleas fly again
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,23 for me
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Bb has been my first ever big loss ( to me ) seeing -¬£784 is a big oof. 610 shares at $10.25 avg. Suppose it only has to raise 2 dollars and im back where we were . Goodluck with your shares man hope you can profit one day !
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,wow well i guess you can avg down now
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,There will be grief counseling and chocolate cake at the end of the test...
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Average down :)
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,We'll get back there one of these days
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,800@11.07 time to buy the dip
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is me, except for MJ stocks.  Bought right at the top of that spike which I thought for sure would only go higher after fed goes blue.  

Ya... but nah."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Actual Peak FOMO. Wild.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs not a 70% loss it‚Äôs a -70% gain. Head up king
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,ty for reminding me to buy BB today.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Remember, don't buy  a 52 week high"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy high, buy low"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,RH desktop version. Sophisticated autist
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Mother of Jesus fuck
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I'm impressed...
Like I would say those 10-11 bag holders might be ok in a few months or a year. 

You sir are gonna be holding for a while.
Maybe they will buy back stock tho."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,My mom has a better position
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs glorious üò≥
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Epic
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy moly
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know this looks bad OP, but if there is one thing I know about WSB it‚Äôs that if you Hodl long enough...the apes .... will ... cum!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,$28.67?  Dayum.....I'm in for $36.  $28 per?  Oh my bad never mind.  Can I sell covered calls on 6 shares?  Hey at least you didn't buy weed stock...no wait.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"if i was you, personally id close that postion cut my loses and jump into gme with thats left to recover ur losses when gme moons.  but that just my opinion and not advice."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"WSB would be all in on Toys R Us, and Circuit City if they still existed"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,cant wait to dump my bag as soon as it breaks even
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"What a moron. Still don't understand how BB even got mixed with GME, but someone fucked you guys so hard and is now laughing their ass off."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,25 @ $13
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol and I felt bad holding at a 12.27 cost basis
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Jesus bro
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"50 @$18 and change.  Feels bad but oh well.  Not selling at this point, I think eventually they will get the gains back but it will be a long hold."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought more today to average down. I am at $9.10 from $14. Just holding.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Just average down it‚Äôll be okay ape
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not a loss until you sell. Transfer your RH stocks to Fidelity. Maybe you'll get some wrinkles back on your smooth brain in the process.

It's not going to $28 any time soon - you're an investor on BB gang and Papa Chen will deliver the goods in due time. üíéüëêüöÄ"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,nice
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I am not fucking selling
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,40 @ 12.09 üòè
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Proud of you retard, but GUHHHHH"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I didn‚Äôt even know it ever got this high. You must have bought the literal top
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Making my 16.50 feel better. Its my smallest position but it looks like ill be holding onto it for a longtime. Best of luck
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone holding 10$ and 20$ calls omg im in pain
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, I am thinking I might jump in after GME."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Now that my $9 puts are in the money, I'll finally average down from by $20.70 bag."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"don't worry man, we're going to the moonüöÄüöÄ"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,818 shares @ 13.95$
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Just bought another 500 this morning. I like this stock.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep. This is one of those ""shorted stocks"" that was supposed to Rocket. It was an ACME rocket tho."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,115 @ 18.86 and bought it down sick  of livin in  the deep cave of BB
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You're our hero! üí™üòé
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Condolences for your losses. I just got in 100 shares @ $8.44 -- who wants this covered call?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This makes me wanna buy a GIANT bag.
The price is too tempting for a company like bb"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ouch, I feel for ya man.... I'm heavy in on BB right now, but bought it much lower point ($13.20 CAD). But i'm with you for the long haul none the less, waiting on more cash, and will be buying this dip for sure!  


I am in GME for the meme, and for the fight.... but I'm in BB because I ACTUALLY like the stock.  


As someone in tech I can say in all the history of secure devices , nothing came close to the Blackberry Enterprise Server infrastructure, for device management and security. So them making the shift to end point security for EV's is genius, and i strongly believe it will pay off."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm holding some $15.00 strike calls to Sep 17 expiration date... under water...what the heck! I'll just eat some üçå and wait
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Seems like WSB owns BlackBerry. So i can have a new Z10?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"How about we dumped BB, tank it to 1.99 and start the mooning campaign all over again?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel ya, but less so"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Ooooof
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just bought my first bb, we will come get you soon. 
This company knows how to adapt."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This make pain
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,100@ 11.88 :(((((
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shit, I didn‚Äôt even know it got that high."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Holding!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm in for the long term for BB, I‚Äôm down a fuck ton but I don‚Äôt mind, I have a feeling it will go up in the future."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I failed you man, I‚Äôm done with bb 
I sold yesterday at -60%"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, why sell for loss if you can just hold it for years until it‚Äôs worth more than current peak based on fundamentals?

If BB survived this long, they ain‚Äôt going anywhere now."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Literally how could you spend $57,000 on this and not average it down at any point between $28 and $9?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"150 @ $21, maybe one day..."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You are definitely my kind of retard. üíéüôå üöÄüåù someday
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Da fuq you all don't average down I'll likely never understand
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You guys want to buy my Zune?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,long term bb
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is GME story. NOK story as well. Little don't learn. The sub continues to convince people they can't lose. There's only one multi- millionaire here from GME, who already took profits and came back for cherry on top."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for making me feel better sir ma‚Äôam
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Showed this to my wife so she would get off my back for betting on dumb shit. Thank you
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I swore never to listen to my little brother's investment advice as he lost me 4k and 2 months later the stonk I was invested in would have net me 160k profit.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,and here I was feeling bad about my $7 NOK shares purchased around same time
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Keep Holding its bouncing tommorow@
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bought at 8.50 before the run up, sold at 21.00.  Now I am buying again at 8.42 and if it drops to 7.50 I will buy again"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,19 k loss for me so feel better
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,$19.41 boys
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Time to manipulate BlackBerry
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Right there with you on BB. I was high on the GME gainz and had to go back for one last score.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Average down and rescue your money.  Buy new shares every month until you can exit.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm averaged at 19.06 across all my accounts. I would need to sink another 10k of GME teddies in just to average to low teens.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm sry for u. I think ur beat but I wish you luck because you‚Äôre gonna need it. (I hate BlackBerry, I hate their phones, pieces of crap.)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Ahh shit I know what you‚Äôre doing... the reversey game... you see how much you are willing to lose before patiently waiting for the price to rocket to the fucking moon...
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy high, sell low 
No other way!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone have ANY sensible idea to jump in BB? I feel it‚Äôs going to slide to $4
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This will go back up
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,F
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hate to rub anything in but never, ever buy into a spike. Wait for it to come back down, then, if you still want to buy, OK. If you look at any stock chart that has huge spikes, they always collapse back. Some people get lucky and buy high and sell higher, but that's the exception."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,The correlation between good news and BB immediately falling has me thinking the only way this stock will go up is if a nuke is dropped directly on their HQ
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck yeah bubs, that‚Äôs the way she goes"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm in 500 at about $19 thank you for making me feel better. CC's been chipping away at it!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Imagine looking back on this time and realizing you lost all that money on fucking BlackBerry.. this isn‚Äôt the 90s anymore man. You could of been on the GME train with us several times, but you chose BB"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the best opportunity to buy more BB and average down.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would blackberry be worth buying? Has anyone even seen one of their phones IRL in the past 10 years?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Oof. I didn't even know it got that high.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Oooof... and I thought my $15.87 avg cost was hurtful.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy shit
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Been there. I buy a few shares every month and am slowly averaging down. I'll be damned if I'm exiting this position at a loss.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Pain.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You belong here
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,18.77 is definitely still bad.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,1250 @ 17.10 You are not alone
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm 18.74. Glad I'm not 18.77 though.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Waddup 30 @ $26. Guess it's the long term route for me
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,66 @ $21.81 here
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,18..7? I thought i was bad at 17.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"it's not a bag.  IT'S A LINE!  HODL!

I've got 100 @ $23.53, 100 @ 19.98, etc down to 11.15...

Edit:  etc = another 100 @ 19.81, 19.68, 18.85, 18.66, 13.90, 11.56.  Talk about hoping and praying.  I'm still wondering when they're going to turn things around because, to me, the company is solid, has a good plan, decent fundamentals, and I LIKE THE STOCK.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,can I join the club? I thought I was smart when it was around $15
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought I was bad at $8.45. At least I sold 30% to this guy at the top to get my original investment back..
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I got in at $20 flat. TWICE I was able to sell to people like OP at $28 and I didn't. Now my wife's boyfriend's kids are going to inherit BB shares because these won't be worth ANYTHING close to that ever again in my lifetime.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn, I bought at $17 and and my wife's boyfriend hates me."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you see every god damn meme stock out there that has had crazy spike and you wonder to yourself: which dumb mother fucker could have bought XYZ at that price?

Well there will always be one at WSB who impressively timed near the top.

Welcome home, fam."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Not alone at all brother
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought $NOK at the very top when they halted trading. Bought at @9.70. At least I can say now that I drew the spike in the $NOK chart. Could this be called vandalism? Went -50% instantly after they resumed trading.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I am here with you
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I was so ready to jump on the BB train. And then some kind soul reminded in the comments that BB breaking out was prophecised for years already and never fully happened. I remembered he was right and didn't buy in. Thanks dude whose name I forgot.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Idk he might be KINDA alone all the way up there haha. Though I don‚Äôt have much room to talk @ $16 average
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,We are not alone
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,BB certainly didn't get to the top all on its own.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Not alone
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh no... i bought the day before robinhood closed trading.  $30k investment... down 1/2.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Avg 17 and planning to double my stacks to drop it down to 12/13 which is fair on the long run
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Ayoooo 14 gang is here

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"BB gang: I bought around 8 bucks (Canadian) and held throughout. I didn't sell at the peak, it didn't even occur to me. 

Stay strong. 

I can cash out now and still profit but I won't because I know what's to come."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shouldnt get emotional. I made a really stupid move at beginning of 2020 on exxon and ate shit. Felt like shit, i took a break, but came back with some more knowledge and healthier risk tolerance.

You should also understand that normal, non social media manipulated companies dont just keep going up after bad earnings reports. Google any of 2020 Q1, Q2, Q3 earnings reports. They are either bad or mediocre. The articles themselves will tell you if the wall street is disappointed in the numbers. You dont even need to read any numbers yourself."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Hes got 2k buying power not even gunna make a dent
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You mean so many chances to hold even more bags? BB is at an absolute low since the spike, any averaging down would've just resulted in even more loss. That said, now is a pretty good time to avg down if you believe in the company long term."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably like me and buying GME instead.

position: 200 @ $19 (BB)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt get how averaging down works, especially if you‚Äôre just selling for a loss then buying back, wouldn‚Äôt you make the same amount over time, (unless you double down to average down)"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Ello there fellow BB.To! I've averaged down to a 17.60. might buy a bit today on the dip to get myself around 15 and then just let it sit
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Tell that to the guy who bought at $140 in 2008 or $50 in 2009!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,One underwhelming ER and BB fundies don't mean anything? Ivy confirmed for 2022. Once the subscription revenue from that starts coming in BB will be in great shape.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,what's horses got to do with it?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,God I hope so!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What will the lowest point of dip be? If only he knew when to average down. What do you think it dips down to ? Like $4.50?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I see this ""recommendation"" a lot to average down, and its absolutely used wrongly every single time. 

You NEVER average down on volatile momentum plays with dogshit companies, when the game plan is daytrading. You average down on 
1. Solid companies like Apple that print money more money than most countries, buy BACK shares instead of issuing them. etc
2. Boring companies that are hit by corrections and are worth more intrinsically than the stock price.

And yes, its a dogshit company. Revenue decline during a cybersecurity boom is pathetic. QNX got hit by car disruptions sure, but that  leaves you with flat growth at best.

This company has failed its investors for almost 2 years straight now (if not the last decade). Stop wasting your money on these idiots. They were 5$ a year ago and havent had a single good quarter since then. Go do some actual research. I checked at each earnings. All mediocre to dogshit reports. Why should they be worth anything more than $5? 

Momentum trading and speculation are a dangerous game."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depending on his situation, if he bought right at the peak, stop losses might not be a possibility.  I mean what if he purchased with cash that had not settled yet?  He would have to wait two calendar days before selling again to avoid a good faith violation.  I am not saying that this is specifically this guy's situation, but just that one can get into situations where stop losses do not help."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm always afraid that flash crashes will wipe out my balances if I have a stop loss, so I just rely on hope and luck to keep me afloat... Let's just say, I'm not rich yet..."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably even have a recession or two so you can get it on the lo-lo
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,220 @ 13.65 here man. I'm just gonna avg down over the next few months. All the DD I read said BB was gonna be a long play anyway.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It happened during the GME spike. It was weird. I was holding BB calls and sold near the peak. Still hanging on to a LEAP
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Eoy
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you followed that advice with Tesla last year, you missed out on tons of gains"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Companies buy back stock when they feel they are undervalued. BB execs sold a ton of their own shares and are coming down from being overbought. It makes no sense for them to buy back any time soon. 

I'm a fellow BB bag holder but I think this might just be an expensive lesson to remind myself to never go full retard."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,BB is the blockbuster of the mobile industry because BB isn't even in the mobile industry anymore. They're pivoting to cyber security and software.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thousands, if not millions, of people have lost money on GME too, buying in over $200, $300, even $400 a share. Don't act all high and mighty like GameStop isn't also a relic from the past that's trying to reinvent itself."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,BB hasn‚Äôt sold phones in years. They sell a car OS and have already embedded it in over 175m vehicles. Now they are working with Amazon to create Palantir for cars. Seeing as how they are already in and have always been known for top notch cyber security it seems like a no brainer play for the future of autonomous driving and internet of things.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Close to me. 173 at $15.14.  sold enough so that if it went back to my buy price id break even....... then never sold when it got to my buy price.  : |
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Then you are not a bag holder.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Feel bad for the people at the top of VIAC. I got the bag on that one and sold at 97 but I wonder who bought at like 97-100.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Hang in there brother I feel u! We're here for long term ride to tendytown
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,NOK got to $9.70? seriously? holy shit.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,480 @ 15 here :( will be selling probably in 2025 to break even
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not hard to diamond hand when there‚Äôs no one willing to buy shares at a price for him that would make the loss be not so bad.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Momentum trading strategies with 0 regard to fundamentals and QANON charts as reasoning will lead to more retail investors getting crushed and holding worthless bags.

Gonna have to hard disagree with you. Read just the articles on the dogshit earnings reports from last 2 years on BB. Should take you guys like 1 hour tops. Realize most are negative and sad, then put your money in a company that deserves your hard earned cash. 

These bagholding redditors are not your friend. You have no friends in the market."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It hit my stop limit
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, you don‚Äôt sell then buy back when averaging down. You just buy more shares at the lower price than your original average. This drives your average down."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Make sure in the very bottom right the square box once you‚Äôre in the options page says all. It‚Äôs probably showing you a number there.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,They do so much more than this. Every G7 government uses their security software as well.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel like this downward trend for BB is unsustainable.  They CONSTANTLY have positive news updates and the stock goes down.  When you really look into the company and realize that between them and Palantir they comprise over 70% of the United States Information Security and Analytics, how much interest they have from auto manufacturers, and the interest from the major tech companies that use their products, it becomes bizarre to see how low on the totem pole people seem to place these companies."

Ultimately sentiment tends to bloom and fade, Apple revived (not that it was dead) a lot of investor sentiment in the past year with M1 chips//further ARM progress and Apple Car (lol). IMO these innovations and new goal posts contribute to forward looking sentiment and future growth which are absolutely stock fundies, IMO.  

But otherwise I‚Äôm 100% with ya"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,!Remind me 1 year
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Especially in the bizzaro, zero fundamentals market we got right now."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The only reason it broke $10 was because it was being pulled upwards by other meme stocks. I think that many now realize the true value of the stock and the long road ahead, and it will be much more difficult, albeit not impossible."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is actually only like the 3rd time it‚Äôs dipped under $10 since it popped
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Anytime!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs only a matter of time before price catches up... the post was not a good buy point regardless üòÖ
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I got in at $10.45 and was sad it‚Äôs down below $9.00. This thread is making me happy.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I got 400 @ 12 but quantity fucks me just as much as you ;D
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,45 @ $15.00 patiently waiting for liftoff
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This was me until last week...brought this bitch down to 12 lol, should probably work my way to 9 dollars at this point."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only average down if you think it'll go up. Otherwise, you are doubling down on something that may tank anyway, locking up your capital and exacerbating your losses.

The biggest advantage of averaging down is that it helps you sell covered calls at lower OTM strike prices, which can be more profitable and help recoup some of the costs.

But you should do the math on what that breakeven point is for you and if the extra cost of investment to average down is worth it."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,For realz
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ouch.  Thank you for sharing your idiocy with your fellow apes.  It feels good to share - well, less bad at least.  Do that enough and its almost like feeling better :-D"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Let's punch his kneecaps in!

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought that when it started plunging down to ~$15, but honestly by this point..."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"As long as all of you believe...then that is the floor.
The new market is buy shares and HOLD (I kind of hate HODL) but that is the best strategy. You set the price! It‚Äôs only a matter time. Stonks only go up. üöÄ"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Averaging down is scary when the price is dropping but DO IT!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,The second he sells a $10 call the stock will close on $10.01 and he will lose his money.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Can confirm I had my fair share of paint chips this morning.  I meant Ivy and it's Feb of 2022.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Valid...but my brain can‚Äôt handle much more than the simplest of views.  I can‚Äôt think of another stock that has the kind of positive news that BB gets and still manages to go down.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is entirely why I‚Äôm here. It‚Äôs comforting knowing I‚Äôm not the most retarded person who downloaded WeBull.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,500 @ 11.46 here
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,So it‚Äôs a good buy right now?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"the fuck is this, *logic*??"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Selling covered weeklies has help me get my cost average down quit a bit
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,My teacher said exacerbating was bad.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Um...this sounds like financial advice...and we don't fucking do that shit here sir.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy clearly stayed at a Holiday Inn last night. I‚Äôm all in on whatever advice he is giving.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I think I need a little more explanation... this sounds good but I‚Äôm still confused.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck him up bois!

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm going long on bb but I didn‚Äôt get why it was going up to 30$... the price made no sense- QNX software is a long term play
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idk they‚Äôre so beloved in auto and have such a good foothold in autonomous, at this price I‚Äôve been averaging down from $14 to $10. I could see it going to $30 in a couple years...?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, if there was anything in the earning report that I could spin as a positive I‚Äôd have no problem with averaging down but other than pure speculation there isn‚Äôt much to go on.  I should have waited till they were more cash flow positive so what if it was a higher price by then"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,">er off selling puts on

I'm a slow ape and have never traded a call but am considering it... i'm holding 300 @ $14.  If I sell a $10 call and it closes at $10.01, what happens?  Does the call holder get my shares and I get $10/share?   Does that happen automatically through my broker or do I need to do something?  I should probably just stay out of options, but I'm bored losing at stocks... want to lose at something else for a change."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Big Brain: If I never sell ... technically I don't have a loss.   
Although a year plus, of holding stonks, the ROI better be good and worth it.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you sell a call at a $10 strike and it closes at $10.01 on the expiration date, then you will be forced to sell your shares at the price of $10. It would happen automatically."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yolo average up king üëë when it moons (never)
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"30 at $17. I‚Äôve been leveraging down as its gone back to $9 - calls exp in September though, so I‚Äôve got 2 earnings reports to go!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,NO!  this is PATRICK
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Prepare your congressional testimony
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok thanks a lot!!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Essentially, that's the best way to sell if you are in love with a stock but are willing to sell at certain prices... You can eat the premium and have a buyer lined up at the given strike. Selling covered calls is an excellent strategy for selling whatever you're holding. The only thing is that the premium won't necessarily cover your losses from $14 to a $10 strike. Another great strategy, if you're holding shares at the time of earnings and expect for the earnings to trade side-ways or down is to sell calls for the Implied Volatility and buy your calls back in order to cover your call when the price is crushed. Or you can just use the calls as an exit if you expect a god-awful earnings.

The disadvantages in the case of covered calls is that you still face exposure in the event of a decline and if you really want to sell the strike might not hit. If there's no liquidity, the selling pressure is much greater than the buying side, and the price is rapidly dropping, it might be worth it to sell a covered ITM call at a loss or buy a ITM put at a loss."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What the FUCK is a share
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Just sell calls above your average share price. You‚Äôll make back the loss in premiums. No need to buy more shares dude
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy some weed instead 

- this is not financial advice -"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wall Street would tell you to sell half and wait for the guaranteed short attack. After it gets manipulated down a dollar or 2 (your call), buy back those sold shares. Not only did you reduce your cost basis, but you are also back in with your original shares.

But of course, everyone here will tell you to hold and never sell.....I mean, who actually buys stocks only to sell them to realize profits, right?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Do it! This is the way. Doesn‚Äôt seem like a big average down though.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro sell covered calls to other palantards and this may actually end up profitable for you
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would I stop you? It can't go tits up
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs probably going to crash soon, like the rest of the market."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,With a wash sale to really lock in those losses ü§å
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy the dips, this is the way!!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Triple down!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You should be hedging with shorts. Anytime news about PLTR comes out, the price will fall. Target price $20."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You should not do this
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I just snatched up 5 more bull spreads and will probably keep adding to these each month.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Hope no one stopped you!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm mentally screaming ""Jump!"" like you're on the ledge of a 10 story building.

I'd never actually scream it, that would be wrong."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,4260 shares @ 29.45 here.  Glad to see me and the boys eating crayons together.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I absolutely will NOT stop you! That's EXACTLY how I want to average down from $24.10, you fucking retard.

do it... ... DO. IT. BUY. THE. DIP."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Great! I stand by you!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,How u feelin now? Lol
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"So like why is PLTR the move?  Genuinely wondering.  My focus has been pretty solely on GME, I don‚Äôt want to miss another rocket."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's a pop for PLTR, eventually coming, for sure. But what is your time horizon, friend?

Can you HODL for another year? 

If not... use it somewhere else, look for more short-term pops.

Otherwise, just buy and forget."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not gonna stop you, want to see how this pans out. Look I bought AMC, BB and GME and watched them drop through the floor. Three horsemen of the apocalypse."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Only 5000? Grow a spine and bump that up to 5 digits.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I need me a 10k
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,50@42 you're fine bro.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,No
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn 10k shares, I got just above 2k myself and tought that was a lot. Anyway don't worry buddy we are going to be rich."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,But why...? Pltr won't be moving up at all for another year or two
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"i would rather buy BlackBerry,blackberry has more potencial with its bussines perfomance"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait till under 20.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stop, don't, come back."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt do it!! It‚Äôs already down today!!

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What's with the meme drought?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU BUY PLTR WHEN YOU COULD BUY AMC?! SHEESH! AMC20K HERE WE GOOO!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,But why tho
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a long way to the top if you want to rock and roll
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Just do it sir
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Obviously I‚Äôm an idiot but I would at least buy 1 GME and pretend I don‚Äôt have it until it significantly goes up (or reaches the proximity of $0).
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why would you double down at such a small delta in price? Shouldn't you wait till it's a lot lower to affect your cost basis more, or at least average in across a wider band of price points?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Good long however I'd wait for the dip
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just stop, buy eeenf before the news comes out next week and don't fuck anymore with pltr"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy walks into a bar and says ‚Äústop me from drinking‚Äù!

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop it. Get some help. Here at MCDonalds we....
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Keep buying. $100 EOY

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would you want me to stop you from becoming rich?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Try to put into GME at a dip instead of fucking pltr
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It depends how mama raised you
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup got 300 this morning
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,To lower your average to 22.95? Nah why
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôll be fine. Just hodl.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm trying so hard to get to 100 shares to sell otm calls. Puts still scare me.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd wait until the 20 day EMA bounces off the 100 day EMA personally.  It's not a crystal ball or anything but it sure looks like a strong sell signal to me
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Only have 200@23
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You are going to be filthy rich in a couple years. No worries friend.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Throw it to GME instead!
Thank me later when we are on the moon!
PLTR does seem overdue for a good run tho"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"nooo, stop, don't do it"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait for the bounce, and then wait another day or two"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sell covered puts/calls motherfucker, you have enough to risk it to be a baller"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I was waiting for $20 to grab more but it might be done going down
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,...No... Don't... Stop....
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You like stock or something ?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stop


There I tried"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,just do it !!!!!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Please buy tlry and hold till the merger
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You sir are the gold standard
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"6100 shares at 29.5 also.

I ain't scurred."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yikes!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,^ ^ Swingin' dick right here.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought 175 at 36.99. You sir ape are fine
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs a painful way of living. Just try to look at anything but PLTR P/L
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You could adopt a lot of apes...
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn that lump sum!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I am now at 27.69 average price from 32 .... bought every dip so far ü§£ I really think pltr will take off at some point
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Pltr is overvalued. Call me when its 15 a share
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Now that‚Äôs a good position
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I think he aims for 69420 positions
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy gets it.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also - the US went to the moon in 1969, thus buying this many shares will trigger PLTR to do the same."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha 69 nice
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,noice
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Investing is fun
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,The premiums are so trash now :)
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I see this advice a lot. Is this a more bullish approach than covered calls?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only way to buy, you are getting paid a premium to buy something you wanted."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,For PLTR you could also consider buying puts as an insurance policy for your shares. On top of that sell covered calls .
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,So you have to have cash to....no wait.  Never mind.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, wait a min here (I know nothing but forgive me)...  is this really how it works?

I sell a put on pltr for $2k... and if I am wrong and the stock price goes above the strike price all I have to do is buy 100 shares of pltr (which I was gonna do anyway?)

It can‚Äôt be that easy.
I must be missing something.

What if pltr rises to $30, am I paying $30 for the shares... is that the downside?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or... hear me out- buy the shares AND sell naked puts.

If it goes against you, panic rolling is a time honored strategy."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I would like to kiss you. I love palantir
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hi i'm the SEC, you have to give me your tendies now"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"!remindme 2 months
This guy advised me to buy stock out of my risk profile üôèüèª"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,may I ask why a month or two? Something happening soon? You don't have to reply if you're busy just wanted to ask cause im curious
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,April2bd class or bust
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,That's a much smaller % of this sub now.  The last 2/3 million are millionaires with 401k's holding shares.  It was much more fun around here when whole Wendy's paychecks were being bet on 0DTE calls 300% OTM and DD was a shrimp toss.  Those were the days.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Listen to this person they know what the fuck they're doing
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is exactly what I'm doing
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Its how they trade options in communist countries like china. They have to share the calls and puts.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,He can do both.  Avg down and sell more CC.  Closer to ATM get more premium and don't feel like he's taking too much of a hit if he gets assigned.  I'm doing that in a couple other shits because some of them are taking a bloodbath.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Sold all my PLTR at %10 total loss just to buy more GME yesterday
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you're going to put (lol no pun intended) that kinda money into it; listen to this guy and cover your ass to not completely go tits up. I'm more retarded that OC, so do whatever you want, but he's giving advice that still works for bulls from what I understand."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,If he's about to drop another six-figures I don't think he's worried about recoup ING some cheap premium.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You can't just sell covered calls and win. Your shares will get called away sooner or later and it will be devastating. If it was as easy as selling covered calls everyone would win. Theta gang loses just as much as everyone else
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This fish is my financial advisor.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy WEed stonks.  Then BuY weED.  Smoke the WeeD.  Make money.  Buy mOre Weed.  SMoke more WEED.  Make more MONEY.  Unlimited tendies.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wrong, OP should sell 5x 0 or 8 DTE $22p."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I am praying there is no more averaging down past 21$ a share
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,together stronk
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Totally worth it in 2 years. Just turn off your phone and hibernate with the bears.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I already know that. The question is ... way to where
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy more now. Average down
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why aren‚Äôt you averaging down, bro?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Way to where ?

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just because wall street doesn't understand their business and compares it to splunk doesn't mean it's a bad company.

Also, why the hate on government revenue? They have no competition in that space."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not apha
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not sell 50 $22 puts expiring in a week and collect premium? And if it's above re-sell 50 more at another strike close to $22. With the fluctuations your bound to get assigned eventually in which case u won't care.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Better than interest in a savings account lol
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Barely getting anything back from any options sold.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah, with covered calls you‚Äôre selling your upside. Selling puts you‚Äôre saying the stocks going up or it‚Äôs going sideways, either way I‚Äôm fine with buying at your specified price. You can also roll the puts and keep accumulating premium."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It's like getting paid to make a limit buy order
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"you're getting a small premium for buying the stock of they fall a little bit. no reason not to do that instead of a limit order for example. 


ccs is more of you wanna hang on to the underlying but believe it will go down. then you make a buck on the down /side trend. but risk having to sell off if it goes up unless you roll"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I know I‚Äôm saying something really crazy here in the context of yolo
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"if you sell a put you only have to buy shares if it goes down, not up. 

and yes the downside is that if it crashes from 33 to 21 you're stuck having to buy at 30. 

the other downside is you might miss upside if it doesn't fall to your put and gets assigned, if that was your plan. 

look up the wheel strategy, there are probably people on YouTube explaining this one more thoroughly. it's a decent beginner strategy for options"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The downside is that you max out your gains when the stock rises.  So if I was bullish on a stock trading at 100, I could sell puts at 90, collect the premium for the puts, and if the price drops to 90 or below I buy the 100 shares.  If the price stays above 90 I  only collect the premium, I do not  get the shares. 

So for example, if I sold $3 puts with a 90 strike, I‚Äôd collect $300 as premium.   If the price goes up to 120, I still keep the 300, but I lost the opportunity to get gains from the $20 share increase.  

Similarly if the price drops to 80, I still collect the $300 premium, and now I buy the shares at 90."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,If you sell a 20p and the stock price drops to 10$ you are obligated to buy at 20. It's an undetermined amount of risk which is why I'm not allowed to sell puts in my tfsa because CRA are cunts.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,My man. We gonna be eating either at cheesecake or ramen for a very long time
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Orrrr he can get a bunch of csp and get the shares at a lower price and collect some premium. Eventually wheel this sideways moving hoe
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You are my inspiration ... I aspire to be like you one day
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"A $23 put (ITM right now, better premium than $22 despite the intrinsic value) would net him $53, so he'd get $2,650 if PLTR finishes tomorrow above $23 and still come out ahead of just buying directly as long as it is anywhere above $22.47 (current sitting at $22.75). If it finishes below that he still saved $0.28/share.

Edit: Forgot to mention, if PLTR finishes between $23 and $23.53 he still comes out ahead of the gains he'd have gotten just from buying the shares"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"How is it devastating to get called away on cc?  If you are setting a strike you are comfortable with selling the shares, then it should be fine.    Obv there is some risk, but buying more shares is not the only way to reduce your cost basis"

Is this scale able? Meaning you can duplicate the product with lower costs. Pure software coding is a perfect example, write once and duplicate infinite times.  Digitizing versus analog from vinyl records to streaming. Even DNA is being digitized for genetic coding. With Palantir? What is Gotham? What is Foundry?  Seems like each contract, each project requires customization, lots of man power consulting with technical expertise.  It looks more like consulting contracts with data analytics expertise. 

How is this any different from Erik Prince's Blackwater contracts with the US government? Just cleaner with no sweat and blood involved at least on the surface.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is what I would do. But I wouldn't do it all at once. out of all the money that 5,000 shares would cost today, I would use maybe let's say 33% of it to sell puts. And then if they were assigned, I would use another third to go down even more, because I need my average cost to come down. I'm a long-term believer in this company, but I also think that the current price sales is a little out of whack, and so I wouldn't be surprised if it gets closer to 10 before we see long-term growth"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because if it doesn't drop below the break even on his sells he will completely miss the eventual ride up. His thesis is assuming it will recover soon, your play assumes it continues to spike up and down significantly before it starts rising again. Completely different stances on the underlying. Selling the puts also puts a timing element on the play. He could just as easily sell the CC's against the shares if he wants to collect premium. This would expose him to much greater upside exposure as well as allowing him to adjust the position during spikes up to continue riding the wave."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,True
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Selling puts also caps your upside. The stock could jump $22 to $28 and you still only collect the put premium. It is nice having the added ability to roll for more premium but if a large jump like that happens it‚Äôs usually better to just find another trade unless you think it‚Äôs still worth it to buy at your next strike (assuming you roll to a higher strike).

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"All very good points. But simply saying, ""I don't understand, so sell!"" is the reason that contrarian investors have done well. You can bucket TSLA and F as car manufacturers, but as shown, the contrarian investor that recognizes the other value of TSLA will beat you out. This happens over and over, as the street fails to correctly decide what a company is, and has led to ARK doing well, GME doing well, etc. ARK has spent a lot of time with Palantir, so believing they don't understand the business is incorrectly applying the general public's lack of knowledge to their analysts.

Gotham and Foundry are pretty straightforward, and given what each product does, there is a bit of manual effort that is expected in each project. Given their dataset, this will improve over time, but can also be covered as ""consulting"" cost passed on to customers. The data powering their insights is pretty huge at this point, likely only matched by Google/MSFT/AWS, but with easier to use tools, and better support. In other words, imagine if Kinesis analytics, glue, and sagemaker were easy to use. Most companies don't care about the cost savings if the insights are significantly better, and that's where the PLTR advantage comes in."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Instead of buying the 5,000 shares, you can sell a put option with a $22 strike. If on expiration date, it's below the strike he will be assigned and buy the shares at $22 while keeping the premium. If stock closes above $22, he keeps the premium and doesn't have to buy. So the next week he can sell another put options and repeat until he is assigned on the shares."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I like to buy the stock with premium
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,yeah I'm not advising selling naked puts willy-nilly
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, you are missing the part where if PLTR crashes to 10 dollars and you sold a put at 20 dollars, you have to buy those shares at 20 instead of 10 which is a 100% increase in price and a huge loss. And the person to whom you sold the contract makes a shit ton of money of course.

The wheel is a good strategy, but you have to understand that there is risk. If somebody bought your contract is because they think they can make a lot of money like this at your expense, it‚Äôs not because they are dumb (well, there are actually very dumb people buying options so that may not be true, but you get what I mean lol)"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro, you don't make 2k. If you sell a $20 strike put you will tie up $2000 in collateral. It will be deducted from your buying power. You will be credited the premium of the put. Depending on the stock and the strike price this can range a lot. With PLTR a 20P that expires 4/1 is worth $0.07 in premium which is a whopping $7. You will tie up $2000 in collateral and be credited $7. You will be under the obligation to buy PLTR at $20 until close on 4/1. Please learn how options work before you go shorting them."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"They are getting paid because you are still committed to buy at the originally agreed strike price

make someone happy and sell a 25 put for the extra premium and small chance you won't have to buy their shares because it might get pinned to 25 or better.  The premium makes up the difference and you're less likely to miss out on the upside 
if it goes much higher then..well..you got 3$ extra x100 and didn't have to hold shares, and it'll probably dip back down, or hell just sell another put based on the new price"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes people buy them.  For example if I‚Äôm bearish I‚Äôm happy to pay the premium at the 22.50 strike because then I pocket all the money between the strike and the  price on the day of expiry.  That is assuming the price goes down

If you sell CC above your buy in and it‚Äôs a price you‚Äôre comfortable with it doesn‚Äôt matter if the CCs go ITM because you get the premium to reduce your cost basis and then get to SELL those 100 shares for the price you wanted. The only risk is CAPPING your upside. I legitimately think you think that your shares just get magically called away and you‚Äôre left with nothing. No dude.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"well not 100% effective. because if the stock keeps just going up, he only makes this premium and never actually buys the stuck for the price he wanted, which was the goal to begin with. theres always some way to lose."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mhmm I'll try to explain. If you BUY a PUT, yu can sell at tht determined strike price. If you write, or SELL a PUT, as the writer of the contract, you have to buy the shares since the other person is the one selling them. Does that make sense?. Just like if you buy a call and exercise,  you are buying the shares from someone who wrote the call, in which case that someone is selling the shares to you who exercised. 

In this case, if I have $2,200 in my account, I can write a PUT and SELL it to you for premium. If pltr goes to $20 at expiration date, you can sell me 100 shares at $22 and I have to pay the $2,200 for them, even though at tht time it's only worth $2,000. So you, who bought my put, just got $200 profit. 
If PLTR is $23 at expiration, I still get to keep your premium and I don't have to buy at $22. And you lost out on what u paid for the contract. 

>I believe what you're saying is, because he holds the shares, he can sell a put option to another ape

**becuase he holds the cash**

If you already have 100 shares, than you can write a covered call against your shares and sell to someone else. If personA wrote a $25 call expiring tmm to personB, and tmm it closes at $26, personA would have to sell the 100 shares for $25each to personB. And personB is automatically up $100 since the stock is at $26 not $25. 

Im not a genius with this nor a teacher. But if yu have some questions DM or w.e. and ill try to help. I know a lot of new people on the sub asking basic questions get heat for it, but ask stupid questions its the only way to learn."

That's the point, if you were going to buy at current price, you start selling the cash secured put really close to the market value what should give bigger premiums. 

BUT...

don't forget the time factor. Options are tied to the expiration day, you **might** get assigned sooner, but it is not that usual. 

If price goes down you will have to buy more expensive than it is at the moment of assignment, but it's more or less the same as if you had bought today and the stock tanks during the rest of the week.

The biggest issue is when price goes up before expiration / assignment as you might miss the stocks and the profits. If you buy today, you profit, if you sell the put you might or might not."

If it makes a big up move then he‚Äôs capped his upside AT A LOSS. Possibly one of the worst trades he could devise. If you buy big to sell CC‚Äôs and the underlying tanks this much, either scrape for premium at avg or wait it out."

how's that for boring/tendies? ü§™ü§™"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup, you've got it. Also referred to as a bull spread.

Also, I hope you've pooped by now; holding it can damage your prostate (if you're a dude)."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"God damn, what‚Äôs your cost basis after 3 years?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Eating the green ones helps too.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea fuck him and his number.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What on earth are you talking about? If you sell a put the contract allows the person who bought it to force you to buy 100 shares. You don't have to sell the 100 shares you're assigned.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh that sucks.
So... Er, that means you just lose money if the stock rises.

Christmas is cancelled.

But wait, if I already have pltr... can I just give him mine?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,whose sentiment
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"High volatile stonks like PLTR can go more than 25% in one day. I would have lost the opportunity to get in at 22 if the stock goes to 25 by Friday and the $$ made on the covered put may not be worth it. Of course I could always put another put in and the math may work out. I am buying and holding. 

But I might do some coward calls."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"All good homie, may you be blessed with tendies"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Risking his shares bought at a higher strike for a 10$ / contract versus selling $1 contract more far out of the money to not be assigned.

Don't look at it as a question of absolute value, see it relative to the context and in the context, I would say that my affirmation still is valid. He is risking more to get more out of the concrete situation."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Selling calls covered with owned stock, not margin involved.

In my opinion you don't have to reserve nothing, you just have to no spend it until the end of the contract, because you get the premium in advance (when opening the contract). If you close sooner, then you return part of the premium you got in the first instance with some fees added to that.

Or I am really retarded (in the bad sense) and have not understand anything the last weeks (what can be a real possibility)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I could also just roll them out to a higher strike. After these ones expire I‚Äôll probably move to selling 30 strikes
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Listen to this guy.. i shouldn't comment when I'm high at 1am ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|shrug)
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If the stock rises you win the put bet and don't have to buy stocks, but you don't buy the extra stocks so don't get the gains."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Definition of fomo and why your cost basis is what it is :)
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,it makes sense now (wsb sense not financial savyy sense)
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Margin, other long legs, whatever.  New traders always assume they're going to sell 100% of the contracts they can cover and that's really the source of 80% of their troubles selling calls.  The other 20 is probably timing."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not?  I never come here without a couple of bourbons under my belt...no wait...I'll be right back.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs why I am a retard
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I never said anything about savyy sense ;)

We are not in r/investing we are in r/wallstreetbets"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It all goes down to depend on what you want to do.

Don't forget I am speaking about **covered** calls, so I do already own the stock.

If I only want to reduce my stock acquisition costs, I am not really interested on selling my stocks, but I could still sell covered calls and get low premiums to average down slowly.

If I do that I would choose a strike I am comfortable to sell it, so if I get assigned I would still get the premium and the cash value of the stocks.

If noone buy my option, I am in the same situation as just holding my stock (or maybe I have to pay a small fee when entering the short call, but it should not be a big deal).

I don't really see the issue you are describing.

Your affirmations are true if you play on selling naked or buying long options. Then yes, you better do your homework or the loss porn might be big and for real.

&#x200B;

Please Note:

I am not trolling you, I am really interested on you showing me the error in my way of thinking. Errors are the best teacher and I better get a ""you fool"" by someone more experienced than me, than see my account on blood red to learn that it (~~maybe~~) was not a good deal. Although I know a lot of people here would be really interested in the loss porn ;)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,At least you‚Äôre a rich retard with $100K go throw at PLTR.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let's get into specifics.  I have about 600 shares of PLTR.  I'm also holding long 23 calls and short 27 calls at the April expiration, about twice as many long calls as short calls but I have more short calls than shares.  Because I've had all these positions for a while, my stock and my short calls are they only thing that's showing a green P/L right now.  

If you don't get how ALL my short calls in the April expiration are covered calls, we probably don't have anything to discuss until you get a few more months of trading."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is another situation. And now your comments make way more sense.

Just owning stocks and doing (only) covered calls is way simpler than what you are doing.

If you start combining long and short then yes, you have to do the maths, find some balance and place risk management to avoid getting in troubles.

I don't for sure know enough yet, to have a high level discussion with you. But I do know enough to not start such an scenario on my own for now (and probably for a while).

One thing is to be new and willing to play. another thing is to be willing to go bancruptcy because of not doing the homework first. It is like a baby trying to run without knowing how to walk (or even how to stand up) first.

And I appretiate my money enough to not be that naive."

If you think the price of a share will go down and are bearish, buy a put. Study and research this because it is way more complex than it sounds.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs also popular here but I continue to do well with APHA which is run by an outstanding and progressive CEO. I expect thin to take a hard look at CURLF as a targeted and expedited entry into the US post merger.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"My understanding at TD is that you can day trade 4 times per week before labeled a day trades in a day.. Anyone please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. That‚Äôs round trip trades. Once labeled as a day trader, you must have $25k in cash/equities. However if you hold overnight, it‚Äôs not a day trade. Most times it‚Äôs not a problem. For example, even though I‚Äôm labeled a day trader, I rarely do it. I‚Äôve made much more money not doing it and being patient and disciplined."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Awesome.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks. I expect some nice tendies for APHA tomorrow but holding through the merger. Also think about adding American weed like CURLF to your portfolio. They‚Äôre already licensed in 23 states and would are a takeover target for APHA post merger. There are others too but I think this one is most obvious.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks brother!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What are your thoughts on greenrose?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs an interesting and timely SPAC. Have to keep an eye on. Investors have been overwhelmed with SPACS lately so it‚Äôs all about the acquisitions they make and how well the underlying companies perform. I prefer APHA and CURLF. That‚Äôs not to say that this one won‚Äôt do well. Just need a quarter or two of meaningful progress.
2021-03-31 06:24:02,wallstreetbets,"GME Open Interest on Options - What we might see Will preface by saying I am retarded ape.

I was reviewing the options chain for April 1st, and how much open interest there is:

&#x200B;

[\(+\/-50 is the amount of open interest 50 above\/below current price\)](https://preview.redd.it/cycosgy7q9q61.png?width=320&format=png&auto=webp&s=75885002583bc47574c5060828ad5dc7068f4177)

It looks like there are far more calls in the money or near the money. It looks like there are some major pain points on both sides depending on where it ends up Thursday:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9wu99jv3v9q61.png?width=323&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cb708a31a5ea9544267dc993c22fdc999a60c2d

As you can see, it looks like $169 is the break even where there is the same amount of open interest. At the $220 mark we see a pretty massive shift, and at $250 puts are almost completely wiped out. If I were a hedge fund with lots of puts, I would be saving all my ammo for Thursday to get this down below $169.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/upr3l4u5w9q61.png?width=313&format=png&auto=webp&s=21ccaf6c7119b9772a5059e14bc523a1613592ca

It also looks like we might see some major pressure around the $250 mark, as that could really spice things up if we ended $250+ by eod Thursday.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TL;DR** Bears need $170 or below by EOW to gain the upperhand leading into next week. If it ends \~$180-$190, good chance we don't see too much of a change next week, maybe a bit of downward pressure. If we hit $250 by EOW, we **might** see something big happen.

&#x200B;

Edit: If you think this is a GME TO THE MOON THURSDAY post because of open interest I don't think you read it right. I am just expressing where I see a majority of the options rest and where  I think we might see a lot of action occur/what it might mean for next week (@ $170, $220 and $250). I've got 63 @ 151 avg, and just trying to figure out what sort of plan I have for buying, as holding is not sufficient for increasing my blood pressure.  "

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,We‚Äôd need to hit like 600 for a gamma squeeze
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it possible to game the open interest on the ratio of calls/puts to figure out if buying a stock at a specific price is worth it? It looks like a volume indicator to me.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Can retards on this sub stop acting like what we close at to end the week matters? Any point before expiration a contract holder can execute if they are ITM. ‚ÄúHow we end‚Äù the week literally doesn‚Äôt matter because all the options that expire that day have to be executed before the end of the day
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Expect a huge drop tomorrow as MM borrowed 3m shares and are holding them to attack tomorrow so a lot of puts around 170 are ITM. They have lots of ammo for tomorrow so get ready to buy the dip tomorrow 3pm guys !

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,A good Friday with meat back on the menu boys.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"What does it mean that the $190 strike is the only one with a different IV numbers?  
207.743 for the Call & 207.250 for the Put

Literally all other numbers are identical but it's the only one different"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,So expect GME to trade around 170 on Thursday?  Most likely scenario.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd say 190 going into the weekend.  Possibly floating there next week, too."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"50% chance it will go down, 50% chance it will go up and 50% chance it will remain constant"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Except in can matter. The probability is low but gamma on a Friday is how this all really kicked off.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Been thinking this. Everytike someone says this it just sets expectations that lead to disappointment on Mondays.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,shh they just learned what open interest is and they are really excited to use it.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"if its not a big deal, why does the price swing 10-15% right around an hour before the market closes on expiration days?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Everyone thinks they can predict this shit have no clue what is really going on. It's just astrology trying to predict the weather. All it is is a religion that they use to confirm their desires or manipulate others and has nothing to do with what will actually happen(except through self fulfilling).
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,If shares go up 25% in two days then something might happen!!! It might!!! !! Something!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt think you understand how we hit 483 the first timr

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,agreed!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs cool! A dip is always cool. The more you buy the more you have when it bounces back the 16th time

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Very possible.  I expect a strong push down tomorrow to 180, possibly lower."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It will probably go up and down and up and down and up and down and up and down and up and down and up and down.  Like it has all week.  So I'll just hold my bananas and watch.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Sideways???????
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I've seen the stock do loops
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"That happens because market makers are offloading shares they used to delta hedge options more rapidly on expiration day. They no longer need to hedge for the possibility of a $250 call being itm if the price is at $200 with 2 minutes left to go on Friday for example. That‚Äôs why you see these rapid price swings, usually downwards, as market makers offload their delta hedged shares. Upwards action can also happen if a surge of buyers comes in to push options itm rapidly which can cause a gamma squeeze, which we‚Äôve seen before, but is extremely rare. However, that is not the same as the logic ‚Äúif we hit $250 by Friday then we will moon‚Äù, since market makers are delta hedging shares every millisecond, not based on whether or not one specific strike price is hit."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It was a caught with pants down situation. You robbed a bank in pleasantville where there has never been a crime committed in the history of the town. Easy money right?

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,the truest of all
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks guys and gals
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you feel about the max pain theory?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,The MM's are doing that to quite a few stocks.  I noticed that in most of my holdings.  All around the same time.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're mostly explaining otm option hedging being sold, so I'd just like to add that almost all itm options will also be sold to close the positions before close on expiration day and those have much larger amounts of shares hedging them. (it's a partial explanation for ""max pain"" point too instead of the conspiracy shit)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,so if there is a ton of OI at 200 strike lets say and it is hovering above that an hour before market close the hedging should push it up not down though no?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You assume way too much
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Aw fuk. You right. That's what happens when I try to be helpful drunk. He's probably having a hell of a time navigating r/ on a jitterbug phone.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You guys are just nailing it this morning
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,then came back as the easter bunny that was just liberated from the Suez canal...
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It's either in or not.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It's both until you observe it.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was a fan of the first 2, but rockstar really fucked with the formula in the 3rd game. Sure the controls are tight, but the shift in tone from comic noir to gritty action film just ruined it for me."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre still not thinking about this the right way. Market makers delta hedging for options and offloading on expiration day occurs for every single stock in the market that has options. It is how the options market works. Market making is not an active thing, it‚Äôs just programmed algorithms that handle the system. 

Think of it like Trash day- you take out the trash on Friday because that‚Äôs when the garbage guy comes. He doesn‚Äôt choose to come. He doesn‚Äôt decide to come a different day to screw you over. It‚Äôs just how your trash company operates. 

The nature of the options market is that on expiration, the shares that market makers hedged are no longer needed so they are discarded like trash. It just happens to also decrease the stock price. 

Many people know this and strategize by buying on expiration days because the price will be artificially depressed, and rebound upwards the following week. Basic swing trading 101."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Open interest (OI) is the combined total of BOTH buy-to-open call contracts and sell-to-open call contracts. You can buy a call and you can sell a call. People on this subreddit have only ever bought calls because it‚Äôs easy to think about bullish sentiment (this is called ‚Äúbuy to open‚Äù). You can also just as easily sell a call to collect premium on the bearish side (called ‚Äúsell to open‚Äù). When you initiate buy or sell order on a call contract, that‚Äôs called ‚Äúopening‚Äù. So ‚ÄúOpen Interest‚Äù is all the currently Open contracts at that strike (including buy and sell). 

Basically open interest doesn‚Äôt tell you how much Buy contracts are open versus Sell contracts, it‚Äôs just the total of both of them. It‚Äôs meaningless to use it to tell you bullish or bearish sentiment. Just like if I told you I had a total of 10 apples, and asked you to tell me how many are rotten or ripe. It‚Äôs impossible for you to know."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Read up on open interest [here](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/options-trading-volume-and-open-interest/#:~:text=Open%20interest%20indicates%20the%20total,updated%20during%20the%20trading%20day.) and don't take other answers at face value. 

Gamma tightens as time to expiry-->0 meaning delta steepens around the strike which means shares are bought/sold more tightly with price. This can accelerate or depress movement of the underlying depending on put/call ratio and the particular OIs of the strikes and contract types involved. There's no magic rule. 4DTE is called gamma week for a reason and 3-4pm is called power hour for a reason.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're trash pickup analogy is really great. It made it very easy to understand how the system works. I thought I ""knew"" what market movers were until I read your comment, and now I *actually* know! üòÇ

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"great point, i sell calls also but guess i didnt think they were part of that tally for some reason. one thing we do know is that at least 500 of the 4/16 $12 gme OI were buy to open"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Open interest is number of contracts open. Contracts by their very nature have a bull side and a bear side. You cannot sell to open a contract with the void... You're selling to someone buying. 

They're not double counting the number of actions made with STO/BTO, rather they're counting the OPEN INTEREST in the particular strike and contract type.

Edit: Don't take it from me, [here it is from investopedia.](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/options-trading-volume-and-open-interest/#:~:text=Open%20interest%20indicates%20the%20total,updated%20during%20the%20trading%20day.)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It's very clear you don't understand how it happened if you think open interest wasn't the main factor lol. You also imply that I'm a bull in this case which I most certainly am not lol

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"My whole point of my initial reply to OP was its dangerous looking at the option chain to predict price movement. Every week we get someone who posts the exact same bullshit and they get 100 awards and retards eat that shit up because it's way above their heads but it gives them that comfy confirmation bias.

 I'm not a bull or bear on GME im just tired of misinformation being spread or data being interpreted to fit someone's thesis."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Also if you look at GME history last month or so fridays have been flat and Monday open there is usually a decent drop. What does this say when you have thousands of contracts expiring ITM yet price drops?

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Sold when it was back at around 13.50 ‚ò∫
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,So we bag hold forever right
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Over troubled waters
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,How in the world is it possible to buy a bridge cheaper than a car?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Seriously take your losses and buy the dip like MSFT or something.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought in at 18. 1000 shares. Watched it go to 12 and dumped it.

Almost bought back in this morning but  angyard Beacon rejected my order for lack of funds. Plenty of clean cash in my settlement account. 

Good thing really because while I was trying to figure that out bb went even lower."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Sold mine then put into something else that has upside. Had 1400 shares avg 15 initially

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Ouch!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Same here. Hold tight. Will buy more at each dip. Next ER will be much better.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Same

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea you are. ""No lambo, I'm homeless now I lost so much money""

Except for the fact that those are shares, and all you have to do is not sell them"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Is BB an abandoned stonk? So sad.....
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Chicken noodles are great!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I believe BB will continue to go up after all the bad reps because it can still maintain its eps which is more important than revenue for shareholders. In other words, despite loss in Revenue ""To an average person, a company's gross¬†revenue¬†is the barometer for success, but as a smart stock market investor, you have to drill down even further with your fundamental analysis when considering buying (or selling) a stock, and that leads you to the¬†most important¬†metric of all,¬†earnings per share¬†(EPS)."" Like Mr. Chen said when pandemic problems improves so will BB revenue - give it a few more quarters to mid 2022 year BB should have better tractions. At least give BB a chance to roll out its IVY to win OEM and earning. I'm extremely optimistic and can't say how much excited I am. Trust me most companies do not make in this pandemic anyway, revenue or eps are compromised."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You never wanna go full retard üòÇ
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why not write your own covered calls for those 1000 shares? You could at least *try* and make them work for your money, right?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes...the shares I already own are on sale. And I have no money to buy more.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuk dis warm my soul
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks bro
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This cant be right. I've been selling weeklies and its absolute peanuts.

Only reason it works right now is cause of earnings. After that, you're back to making 40$ per 20 contracts lol."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Mistake
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,One day we will have gain porn lol
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Heard that in 2010 at this price
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I said that too when I bought my Q10... still holding üöÄ
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Pls sir There are hard times
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,No $ROPE. Thank god I have a day job lol. Its thankfully not too high and I‚Äôm working on fixing it. Not gonna bother to average down
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably won‚Äôt see much movement until Q4 when IVY starts becoming more real
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve already quadrupled down at this point, you gotta own your mistakes"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you explain to me what the term covered calls and puts mean?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's what I'm doing. Made my first option trade with it.


1x $11.5 Apr 9 Covered Call"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,IV crush. IV tanks either way
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha sure thing üòÇ

I only have 6 BB shares (down 65%) so I'm not feeling the pain quite like you, hang in there"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs a good monkey
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha hopefully BB stays strong by the end of the year. Remember what our Midas hand Buffet said if you‚Äôre not going to hold the stock for 10years don‚Äôt even think about holding it for a day. Sooooo 10years fellow redditor. Ten Fucking years! Stay awesome!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,BB is in a good spot with AI and self drive. This is probably going to be the go to. I‚Äôve got my Eyes on BB to bankroll into.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Come join us at r/BB_Stock for your daily confirmation bias.

Avg cost 10.34 here but still hurts as we dip into low 5s maybe even high 4s."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Set aside enough to buy a bus pass when your lambo money evaporates
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea my bad, I was in a shit mood earlier.

Personally though, you reaally shouldn't put money in the market if you can't afford it. I really don't want to be a dick about this, money really fucking sucks and I'm sorry you're struggling. 

But yea, if times are tough, you're better off putting money into a saving account, envelope, Fidelity. That way you can still work on budgeting and building up funds, but if you need money for groceries or gas you can just take it out without worrying about stock price.

When I started trading 2 years ago, all of my losses were 100% because I couldn't afford to hold. I was broke, and needed money, so I either sold at a loss or stayed broke. I completely gave up trading for 2 whole years until I finally made it to my first paycheck where I had $50 left over from last check. It's a totally different game when you can hold through a loss, I haven't realized a loss at all during this new stint of trading.

Fr though, you'll be better off just saving for now. You're pretty much guaranteed to lose money if you can't afford to wait out a few consecutive red days.

Hope this helped, and sorry again for being shitty about it"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or in your case, own four times your mistakes."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way üöÄü¶ç
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably gonna messed it up royally, but the way I understand it, if you have 100 shares, you can sell somebody the right to buy them off of you at a fixed price at some agreed upon date.

Your buyer can then keep that option and exercise it (meaning: they buy the shares at the agreed price at any point in time before the expiry date), sell it or let it expire (if the actual share price at the expiry date is below the agreed upon ‚Äústrike price‚Äú).

As for put options... It's you agreeing to buy 100 shares at a fixed price."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,So sell LEAPS before earnings
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol are you TSLA gang as well?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks bud, it‚Äôs become a matter of principle for me. Not gonna sell until I see as much green as I‚Äôve seen loss lol. I think there‚Äôs good things on the horizon by 2030 for sure."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuuu 5's and 4's?? Why so low
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Then sell and buy back, perhaps....,.."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Been there for a few months, it‚Äôs group therapy for me lol."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,$4-5$  Sweet!  I can add more!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I understand your concern and I‚Äôm touched but this is a fraction of my portfolio lol. It didn‚Äôt carry across well but I was joking haha. I‚Äôm doing well thankfully (for now) and am diversified across different stocks so the other ones are saving me rn.

I mean this loss does hurt but I have been prepared for a long term hold here because I anticipated IVY maturation 2025 or later. Hoping for another epic rip though won‚Äôt lie lol.

I‚Äôve had a few wins that seemed like bags (Tesla at 282) and they‚Äôre multi baggers now. This is probably gonna be a 2-3x stock in a few years if things go well ü§û

Seriously though - thanks for your concern and advice. I think new traders get overconfident and burnt badly. These risky yolo plays can backfire spectacularly and cripple your portfolios if you aren‚Äôt prepared."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, plenty of other stocks making good money right now so I‚Äôm gonna wait for the price to catch up in time. Long terms gains tax is a nice incentive so don‚Äôt mind that haha"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,*full retard lmao üòÇ
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Covered Call: you own the stock. Covered put: you've got the money.

The alternative is uncovered calls. That would be you betting on the price dropping below your strike, so your buyer doesn't exercise their options. You're now 100 shares *short* for every contract you sell."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for your feedback. I appreciate it! Just trying to learn more
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I couldn't believe someone bought my April 1st $25 call.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I AM TSLA gang
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahah... 2030 sounds so distant hahaha but yeah stay strong!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"In the case of a good ER, BB dips. In the case of an absolute shite of a good ER, BB dips even more. But BB will bounce for no reason whatsoever. Do lets see."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty pointless if I can‚Äôt use the capital on something else to gain more. I have to reiterate, I am an ape who buys shares based on a half page DD lol. Pretty much all my position is like 25% down"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same, looking for confirmation bias but I‚Äôm pretty confident BB will trade in the mid 20s in a year or two. LTSBG"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea, I kinda figured it was a joke, but i wanted to apologize and shit just incase you were serious haha."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Vice versa for uncovered puts, which probably exist in reality, but really shouldn't because now you're just promising somebody money that you don't have, so....
That's probably dumb."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok so me buying stocks with cash I have is considered a covered put?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"His point is sell now, buy back for 5..easy profit rather than waiting for it to go down and back up

But idk why it would drop that hard."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah. Not to get too technical, but I think that's what usually referred to as ‚Äúbuying stocks‚Äú. 
l'm not sure though, I haven't been into this topic for more than a couple of weeks."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, I will keep my position for now since its a long game when I bought at 11. I will add to my position when it goes to low 5s again. 

Just not willing to realize the loss yet, ape brain here."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hopefully they don't go crazy with the selling.  And if they do, hope some funds come in and buy up the dip.  This thing is still way undervalued.

Tomorrow we should see analyst price targets increased"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You need to apply and have the right answers in your income and investment goals on your profile
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You will generally get approved in 1 business day, provided you aren't applying for margin as well. 

If you just want to add options trading to a cash account, they just ask a few questions about income and investing experience (you are an expert looking for aggressive growth) 

In a cash account approved for options, you will be able to buy calls and puts, sell covered calls and cash secured puts. 

Good luck to you"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre telling me.  I took 8:35 and 11:30 screen shots for my next update, going to grab an EOD as well.  Pissed I didn‚Äôt have cleared funds to buy more this morning"

hopefully will do like  DISCB in few days :-)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Should have sold puts instead yooooo.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,That GME call ain‚Äôt looking good at the moment.  That‚Äôs all I saw on this post
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"at first glance between the two, many indicated DISC as better company, but this looks likely mostly an IV play, so you do you"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude, but you could've gone for TME.... do you read the territory well enough?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Good play. Balls of steel.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Your puts were too far out man
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Hello fellow $VIAC YOLO-er. Just checking in to see how you're feeling about today/ the rest of the week haha üòÖMy patience was definitely tested.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"that's a lot of VIAC shares

why would u sell $45 calls tho?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve been trying a new strategy of loading up on stocks that lost significant value but retained expensive call options. Grossed $30k from the call sale, covered with some puts right away. I bought when the stock was coming back up, so its call value was rising and put value was lowering."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fucking hell, my thoughts exactly.ü§£"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Check this strategy with Canaan. If I could free up cash I‚Äôd be all in that
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôll be out by then, but good luck."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I picked up a gang of $60 calls for apr 30th at 1.5 premium.... I am really hoping we see a huge reversion in the month. If it hits $80 with about 2 weeks left that 1.5 will turn into a 30.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I did the same. $1000 at $45.105. How you feeling after today?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Why the sad face less
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Next time, next time"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats what I did. CSPs and some straddles
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol. No it ain‚Äôt
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I could see that. As much as I love Disc I like VIAC‚Äôs content more, so I chose it over DISC. Plus, the calls were more valuable at the time. Like double."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think so, I didn‚Äôt see TME but was also looking at Baidu and many other stocks. VIAC had the most favorable option pricing by a factor of 2 or more, meaning double the returns for selling calls, and lower cost for covering with puts."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I agree
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Smart cap your gains and cover your losses. If only hwang did that too he wouldn't have been blown out. We should teach wall st how to invest lol.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you access that info?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm just buying calls at this point on Can
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks you too! I just corrected my dates. I have 3 (40P,43P,45P) expiring 4/1 ‚Äî- how are you feeling?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What do you think about the selloff
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuckin Bill Hwang
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I found this by looking at the stocks Bill Hwang fucked. But generally, I have a list of stocks that I follow and track what is taking big losses. When I find one with losses that I think are due to a sentimental overreaction or technical issue, I check if the value of the calls are high, and if yes, I buy the stock and then buy calls and puts as the stock is rising"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm covered and netted 15k so far which isn‚Äôt much but feel secure. Hoping for more volatility this week so I can earn on the options I bought. Feeling ok about RKT and GSX, I think those options will do well"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think the worst may be over, at least through 4/1"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I heard he‚Äôs got a small hwang
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice! I‚Äôm not gonna lie I‚Äôm hoping they rip because I bought my 45s at an embarrassing rate
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôll buy in at 30 it‚Äôs pretty much impossible to go down much more given it‚Äôs size
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,üòÇ
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,lol. I‚Äôll be happy if they do! Let‚Äôs get to $60!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You might have to wait a while
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"60???? You mean 30! lol
I‚Äôm talking VIAC"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Normally I‚Äôd be more generous but after seeing how the last two months went I just about perforated my anus shitting myself
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shit man, $30 too. I have puts at $40 and $35 and a call for $53."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha I hear you. It‚Äôs been a bloodbath
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I saw that! GL too.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Literally on sale
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I am just an eternal BB optimist but I dont think the ticker stays down long. Nothing particularly bad about the qtr. Executing to plan.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm buying more, super discount right now!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You practically can now become a board member.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought of you at my morning piss. Big balls. Now big wait
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Wtf am I looking at here. It‚Äôs like trying to read Arabic
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Man, the amount of money that goes around this sub is crazy. I stretched it to get to 100 shares and wheel my cost basis down. One day I hope my investments allow me to roll this large."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn yo. Makes me wonder what your networth is to throw that much into one stock. What an inspiration.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You are a god damn warrior
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"On the bright side, you can tell yourself after hours trading isn‚Äôt real for another 10 hours. So there‚Äôs that."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I sold my 1k shares before earnings because last quarter they tanked to 6 dollars.  Might buy back in tomorrow
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Ouchie wah wah

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Blackberry? Really?  I bought amc and gme
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah BB needs to pop and fast. NOK too. At least give me 10 or 15% gains so i can get some juice out.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôll buy in at $5 a share
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Couldn't agree more. Most analysts are underestimating the inflection that will happen with $BB this year. They're justified due to years of underperformace, but they're wrong. Chen didn't waste all that time. He established a strategic position that will pay off big."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Consider waiting a few days/week until we fully dip down. Not financial advice but slowly averaging down tends to have a better outcome than lump sum
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol I‚Äôm deep at 15k and 10 calls
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought at $20 so I could only afford 10 shares ü§Æ I‚Äôm gonna add to my position and hold
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bought 10 @ 14, so definitely hoping my stimulus comes before it bottoms out so i can buy more and average way down."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah right. I'm deciding between like 5 or 10 shares and then there's this.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol I‚Äôm going to own 100shares @9 if it doesn‚Äôt close above $9.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Just a catchy title for a literal half a million play. Let the man speak
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,NOK may not anymore unless it gets meme juice but BB... there‚Äôs a priming jet engine
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Nok ded
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Fact is BB is a long play and a damn good one. This earnings report was never the catalyst that was going to make everyone rich. If anything now is the time to buy
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Didn‚Äôt mention 23/25 of too EV producers and 7/7 top tier car companies.

On top of that, TSLA has recently made noise about changing their O/S / ‚Äúarchitecture‚Äù as recently as a week ago.

QNX is already the de facto standard.

When TSLA ditches Linux and all its vulnerabilities (open source, what were they thinking?!?!?) for QNX, it‚Äôs just going to be the final feather in the cap.  

BB is a no brainer.

Add cybersecurity on top and explosive growth potential in app sales on IVY, this this could be a $5B annual business with massive growth rates in just 2-3 years."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Was there any news today on BB?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think one of us is reading his comment wrong.

‚ÄúUNTIL the run up happened I HELD my BB bag.‚Äù 

Dude unloaded his bags when it ran up. He‚Äôs out and handed them to you buddy"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"My patience was rewarded. And yes, I passed my bag along to the next generation. 

But to be fair, I bought in the first time at $49 and averaged down to $6,50 before I got out."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,21 over here lmao
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Godspeed brother
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's fine, there are a lot more people similar to you than to OP. But seriously what's a 400$ investment going to do, return $50 if you're lucky?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn man! Go get em!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"i disagree. i believe nok is in the same position as bb, old phone companies evolving into a niche that lays the foundation for future technology. lots of overlap between the two as well, nokia 5g/6g and beyond laying down the network, and bb providing the software/security that runs on that network. i expect them to take over the world."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Now this is the confirmation bias I needed
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn't mention üöÄüöÄüöÄ
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think you understand how open source works. Linux is probably the most secure operating system and on top of that Tesla doesn't have to pay a dime to anyone to use it.   

I'm also guessing they choose open source so they didn't have to be 100% dependent on another company's security measures. With linux they get free security fixes from everyone else developing the OS and they can have their own engineers look at the code  themselves to find security holes.   

**Also if they were planning to ditch Linux entirely I'd doubt they'd still have job posting for [Linux engineers](https://www.tesla.com/careers/search/job/embedded-softwareengineerlinuxplatforms-45034)**"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Confirmation bias aside. With what probability do you think Tesla could switch to QNX (and later IVY)? I also understand that SpaceX uses BB products.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Earnings after hour. They missed and it tanked
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Now that‚Äôs a big average down lol

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The may HAVE to switch to QNX for safety purposes....forget stability and flexibility.  

It would also help with their costs."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not a lot.  Tesla is pretty adamant about continuing with their own stuff.  The only way I see them going with QNX is if years go by and they're still having security concerns with the US government that limits their ability to get it all regulated.  As much as I'd love to see it, the chances of it are smaller than slim."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Satellite networks are only good if you have no other option and you‚Äôre never gonna get past the fact that space is very far away and always will be which is why it‚Äôs never going to be as good

**tl;dr**

**Current Business Situation**

* Last year, DELTA AIR LINES, INC. made $17.0 Billion revenue.
* They spend more than $-29 Billion with a loss of $-12 Billion.
* Investors lost $-19.5 per share.

**Future Projections**

* If they stop growing, the company will be worth $20.4 per share.
* Based on Wall Street forecasts, the company will grow at 17.7% a year for the next 5 years. That means DELTA AIR LINES, INC. will be worth $65.1, which represents **37.5%** upside from current price.

If you assume by 2025 DAL goes back to pre-pandemic earnings and P/E - then the stock is undervalued by 37.5% ...

Disclosure: I do not own"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm a fan. Bought a single call earlier in the pandemic and I‚Äôm up 400% on it. Bought some shares later. I‚Äôll probably buy more.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"$ICAGY and probably $RYCEY, I know $RYCEY won‚Äôt go bankrupt because the government would bail them out but it‚Äôs a great company with great technology, my $2k investment will go long, about 10-15 years üòÇ"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think airlines will do well. Obviously they have taken huge losses but given how much income they get from their credit card contracts that was mitigated. Additionally they have used the last year to run major early retirement programs, cut underperforming routes and shift to more fuel efficient jets. Even once they get past the pent up demand from travelers I think profit margins will be much higher."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I picked some DAL up last year when the pandemic first hit, it was my first foray into self guided investing and I only bought because I love Delta. So far, it's been paying off and I'll probably scoop more."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Delta has top notch rules enforcement, if you don‚Äôt follow the COVID process in their planes they will drag you out and beat you, you know they will.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,aren't a lot of people saying the airline recovery play has been priced in for some time
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,AAL is the best. Most meat on the bone for recovery
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Been riding this one for a while now and holding to keep riding that post-COVID travel FOMO wave.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,HA
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt own their stock, but fly them quite i bit.  Flew two times this year to Hawaii and they upgraded to first class going and coming.  Great customer service"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"On your recovery trajectory it looks like they made - $45B in 2019, why would we not return to those levels in 2021/22. Did you find anything on that?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,My United and Air Canada shares haven‚Äôt been doing well lately. Hope that‚Äôll change in summer
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Concern about fuel prices will be a headwind (get it!) unless these guys have bought fuel contracts that are stable for at least the next two presidential administrations.  Spiking fuel costs could spike seat costs, which would dissuade a large amount of travel.  
Does anyone know what the various airlines have for fuel contracts?  I'd buy in if we knew that."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Been buying more DAL since it was $20 back in May
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I will attempt to fly ANYONE else before Delta. God they suck.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm in on $RYCEY too. . . . Betting on that Boris bail ! ! !

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,maybe but they are still not trading at pre-pandemic prices.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"To your comment yes that‚Äôs been the rumbling- many airlines have already recovered from their lows last year. I think a lot of the market has priced in optimism about travel taking off once a majority of the population has been vaccinated. I‚Äôve been watching DAL, AAL and LUV. I missed the early train and when I started watching these companies in Jan, LUV seemed like the best deal of the three. Not sure currently which has the best value.

Disclaimer- I am not a financial advisor this is just my opinion, so do your own DD don‚Äôt be lazy and take my word for it.

I am long LUV- currently own 60shares @ average cost of 47.12"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,also the most debt
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Because COVID? I‚Äôm no data scientist though
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Most airlines hedge oil. I found the following for DAL on their year end financials for 2020 

DAL owns a subsidiary Monroe Energy LLC and MIPC LLC which operates the Trainer refinery and related assets, located in Phili, PA. Refinery capacity of processing 200k barrels of crude oil per day. During 2020 operated at 60-90% (that‚Äôs 120K-180k). I‚Äôm not sure if any of their competitors have refinery‚Äôs but if they don‚Äôt this would def be an advantage to lower fuel costs. I will look at AAL and UAL 10-k and report back.

DAL has  a fuel hedging program to mitigate changing fuel risks.

Some of the contracts go out to 2028"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,fidelity lets you buy it
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Some are trading over pre pandemic prices if you look at share dilution
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah that‚Äôs why they are the Best Buy. There growth will have the biggest impact

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Amc will hit its precovid peak $20 just on fundamentals
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm pretty pro reopening but do people have an appetite to go to theaters cause I don't. Theaters feel a lil intimate so unless the majority has been vaccinated not really that motivated to go.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Rofl. Remember when they were at 100% capacity before covid? What their stock was worth before Covid as well?

How much debt they have gotten since then?

They need at least four years of 2017 to happen for them to be considered in a safe place again.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"No that seems to be your hypothesis. My hypothesis is that we shouldn't cause a halting of the entire economy and mass starvation to prevent a few at risk people from dying to a disease that is about as risky as a new flu strain.

500,000 is light compared to what's going to happen in Africa and Asia due to the shutdowns. Food isn't produced in super markets it requires a fine tuned economy or massive amounts is lost and the price skyrockets."
2021-03-31 05:40:15,wallstreetbets,"AMC - A Perspective On Opportunity Investing in meme stocks alone is unique by itself. I think we all have an opportunity to invest in things that we either cared about when we were younger or things we enjoy doing. I‚Äôm might speak out of turn here, but I look at the recovery of Six Flags stock and I‚Äôm like damn, missed a 5 bagger and it was right there in front of me the whole time. Or you take any business environment that has been disrupted by COVID and some have been quicker to recover than others.

Im presenting the bullish case for AMC to be a COVID recovery play and not so much a squeeze play. Granted there are ways in which it could squeeze, but they have been speculation thus far. We have no way knowing the conditions truthfully without data or facts to back it up. Most of what I have seen borders on conspiracy and this is an effort to clear the air.

Invest in what you care about! I went to AMC Theaters last Saturday and I had a blast watching Nobody. I got my popcorn, my blue slurpee, and my sour patch kids. I enjoyed my experience. That‚Äôs what I paid $50 for. To take my GF and I out to get out of the house and engage in an activity. 

AMC presents an opportunity to not just invest in something you care about, but also actively contribute to the wellbeing of the company. In so many words you can support your investment by having fun and enjoying the movie going experience. Yes this applies to other theater stocks. But I like AMC, it reminds me of my childhood. 

AMC has debt. That is a well known factor of this stock. I don‚Äôt expressly know their current debt amount, but with people returning to theaters it can recover. I did the math and if everyone in this group on average spent $50 on one movie go including tickets, food, and drink, it would be about $450M if everyone went to the theaters on the same day. Is that realistic? Probably not, but could be a possibility. Imagine with COVID restrictions being lifted later this year what it could do for generating profits? Well you might say, the movie industry is dying. I don‚Äôt think it is because you pay for an experience to do something fun with your kids, friends, or your wife‚Äôs boyfriend.

I still think regardless of a squeeze play, it can be a recovery play. With or without a squeeze I am bullish and confident in AMC recovering from COVID and moving past the debt hurdle.

I like movies and I like the stock!

üçø üé• üöÄ"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I own GME and AMC.  I hope they both launch so high into orbit we'll be known as the meme stock tycoons, like the oil tycoons of yore.  

The ONLY issue I have with AMC is the 450 million share float and the eagerness the CEO seems to have to increase that to a billion.  I'd just feel better about the prospects of a squeeze if there were 50 million shares out there even if the stock was $100/share."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What time was this Saturday because my wife was MIA for like 3hrs..
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes this is the way.  Definitely more diamond handed when we treat it as a recovery play!  And I like the idea that while we hv fun from watching movies, we r at the same time helping it to generate profit, which boost up its stock price, and my stock profit. Simple gain for apes."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC will definitely squeeze. Its a matter of when. All we can do is buy and hold.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I want both GME and AMC to explode but with how much FUD OG WSB has against AMC, and also knowing it's been compromised, I'll just stick to AMC. The fact that OG WSB silences AMC posts is suspicious."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I show the debt over next 5 years totaling $7 billion.  B. Billion.  Not sure of interest rates but in the junk zone.  Assume $500mm in annual payments plus the balloon.   Yikes.  And they haven‚Äôt been profitable since 2016.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,So when does a stock become a meme stock? As soon as a meme is made of said stock?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought 14 shares this morning at opening and now I am on my way to a AMC theater to watch a movie.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What are your thoughts on the 75% dilution and 50% upcoming additional dilution?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Explain like i‚Äôm five please
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You dont know their debt.. but you think 450M will help? It's like a drop in the bucket
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"AMC has its balls in a vise by relying on a few large content companies for its revenues.  Its price already factors in the covid recovery.

Don't listen to me. I am a retard."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It was always a recovery play for me. Under normal circumstances AMC is and will never be a 2-3 dollar stock. Their is a strong demand for tehaters and some social media nerds without firends that are like ""muh theaters are dirty, I can watch at home with my super duper TV"" were never the target group anyways. In fact it's the opposite group that is not wasting their time on twitter dooming about how theaters are dieing. 

Godzilla vs Kong same as Detective Chinatown for chinese martket (that set up an all time box office record this year) are proofing this to me. 

As long as their are enough people that appreciate the social part and the big screen experience it's a business that will probably never die."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Y'all do realize that AMC was worth less than this before the pandemic even started, right?  And that not one thing is fundamentally different about their business?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn‚Äôt buy until after the vote on share dilution

Position: have puts"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"As someone who is long and bullish on AMC. AMC first has to fall back to around 5$ for the covid recovery and to move past debt. Also probably dilute the shares again easily making the stock around or less than 5$. 

AMC has had almost nothing but bad news. The only reason it's up is because of the squeeze play. 

I really can't wait for it to move away from the memes. Because I believe in a couple years it could start to grow again. 

I bought amc at 2.67 and sold at 16. I am looking forward to rebuying around that 5-2$ price."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, tickets, food, and drink

Is there an Oxford comma? Because that comma would literally be worth *millions*. Think about it: drink is overlooked because everyone obviously gets their ticket and usually gets their food and then sees the movie. But what if...after the movie people went to the bar in AMC, which, in my opinion, has a great name, McGuffins

Why go to a bar in AMC? To talk movies!

And even if you want a break from movies, the bar in AMC usually has a TV with sports

That's it. AMC needs to monetize its bar, McGuffins"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt agree with OP (I‚Äôm bearish on AMC) but by reading comments, OP apparently is doing his own DD  thoroughly and he argues with reasoning and logic, not with hate and sarcasm like most of other apes. Great job OP."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"But it's already recovered,  and then some.  Now they need to pivot to adapt to the streaming world. 

I think attendance will be up once people are vaccinated,  but that won't last for ever. 

They need to do something,  or they're doomed"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You took the time to write this and didn‚Äôt take the simple action of looking at their financials? ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt expressly know their current debt amount.‚Äù 
This is extremely easy to find out. The fact that you didn‚Äôt bother is hilarious and sad."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC is a penny stock in 2 years at best.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought 360 shares, saw amc was open next to me. Saw not a single seat was reserved for any of the showings. Sold my shares, they're just going to lose more money being open."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Puts on this guys health
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Problem is that amc was losing money before covid, and that's because it's biggest supplier, Disney, is now it's biggest competitor. I see that as being a huge problem for it going forward, and exactly why I see covid creating a k shaped recovery.

Some stocks recover, while covid actually seems to spur the further decline of already failing businesses, and maybe even spur the development of new stocks as well.

In this case, AMC went from losing $150 million a year to losing $4.5 billion in 2020. Not only that, but look at what AMC did during this time.

They fired all of their best employees - ones who were keeping them competitive on a product enjoyment basis - and gave their executives massive bonuses for supposed jobs well done.

All while losing almost $5 billion dollars.

Now, if those executives demanded they get little or no pay, then I'd be singing a much different tune here. It would've been a respectable move and showed a dedication to making it work.

But as it stands, this was a resource grab, one that allows the executives to walk away at huge gains during times that are otherwise a gasoline fueled dumpster fire.

If the CEO was a captain at sea, this would be equivalent to jumping ship with all the valuables after tying up all their best shipmates to the sinking ship.

It's honestly putrid and why I hate the company."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you say $50? For a movie night? Fuck that
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree, I have posted some other speculation on the amount of shares I believe retail investors hold which numbers past 300M if my hypothesis proved to be true. But I can‚Äôt know for certain. That being said, I consider the squeeze potential on AMC to be microscopic when compared to GME because of the amount of outstanding shares. It could squeeze but I don‚Äôt think it would hit GME numbers.

Edit 1 

However given that fundamentals can be ignored in certain situations, anything is possible."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Hasn't gme gone up 10x this year already? Or you bought in after years of posts and are a proud bag holder now?

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,In all seriousness though it is something I posted about before here. I voted no on the additional shares. The board needs to trust that movie goers will return to theaters to gain their profits.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It looks like they let my post remain. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but I understand the need to avoid spam posts from the perspective of a moderator. I fully support GME as well as AMC"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"They averaged $5B in gross profits during 2017, 2018, and 2019. The reason why they didn‚Äôt show as much net profit on that is because they overspent on making improvements to theaters as well as acquiring Carmike and Odeon. They couldn‚Äôt foresee a scenario like COVID happening as no one really could, or at least their risk management team thought the likelihood of a pandemic was low enough to make the acquisitions and improvements."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Imo 

Cinemark is the better stock, IMAX better still ‚Äî on fundamentals

But the studios have their nuts in a vice and want that sweet sweet streaming rev for themselves ... before banks even enter the picture; look at how it ended for their Chinese investors. It‚Äôs a metric shitload of debt that needs a lot of popcorn and soda to service

Anti trust clause is gone ‚Äî

At these prices - the squeeze, the swings or another reopening candidate is the play

I say this not as a hater, or as financial advice; I love the movies .. they‚Äôre woven into the fabric of our life (first squeeze involving AMC?.. boobs) am looking forward to the AMC reopening up the street

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I think it says to buy and hodl! üíéüôåü¶ç
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,After some more research it looks like $7B which isn‚Äôt much when you compare it to is average revenue from 2017 to 2019 which was $5B per year. The reason why they didn‚Äôt show much profit was due to acquisitions and improvements of theaters. Covid was just bad timing as it occurred directly after that.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Besides the addition of their streaming service.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,They have about $7bb due in debt over the next 5 years.  That‚Äôs a multiple of their SALES.  That debt will be a big suck on cash. Don‚Äôt have the numbers but assume $500mm in annual debt payments alone.  Plus they had falling revenue in 2019 BEFORE COVID hit.  They haven‚Äôt seen positive net income since 2016.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"$5 feels generous to me, but I would consider it at $2-$3.

As it stands their market cap is up 1000% in the last 3 months. Anyone buying right now as a long term investment is insane."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Disagree. Not sure if they will for sure dilute the shares again. I think the reason it is up is because of the covid recovery. Squeeze is another story. 

If it falls back to that range ill join you in buying up a lot more shares myself. But I think we will see slow growth as the economy reopens. I think all of the reasons you listed why it will go back to 5$ is already priced in."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,They are serving alcohol now in most US AMC theaters. It‚Äôs also one of the most expensive items they sell. Lol I‚Äôve been tanked a time or two in the theaters.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you. Haha
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"My main goal for posting this beyond my thesis, was to facilitate discussion and hopefully bring up some new topics in the conversation for AMC. I would say it‚Äôs working."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depends on what the House of Mouse decides to do. Watching Snyder Cut and WW84 (as terrible of a movie as it was) with my close group of bubble friends was a blast. Cheeper, we cooked, paused when we needed, no typical theater annoyances. OPs $50 outing is great but families won't be having that at 3, 4 or 5x the cost especially in a recession. Even with a steeper $20 pvod vs regular monthly subscription cost, Trolls World Tour pulled $200mill US where as the theatrical Trolls one in 2016 was $150mill US. Do I want to see AMC do well? Of course. But I'm afraid it will become a relic of the past like drive in theaters.

Edit- snyder and WW are both DC but Disney being the big power house will have the greatest pull."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,They have an a list thing where you pay 30 a month for 3 movies a week. I‚Äôm
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, agree.  And kids can‚Äôt be vaccinated for many months still.  CDC is projecting that young kids will still be getting 1st vaccinations into 2022."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are multiple numbers floating around which is why I said that. I think the accrued debt is some where around $7B which for a company that was averaging $5B+ in gross revenue per year in 2017, 2018, 2019 means they could have it paid off hopefully by 2023 to 2025 after COVID restrictions are fully lifted. The debt accrued from making improvements and acquisitions during these years starting with the Odeon and Carmike Acquisitions in 2016 which accounts for $2.3B. Then you have infrastructure improvements such as new seating as well as adding alcohol vending and improving screens or adding additional theater rooms which more than likely accounts $2B to $3B. Then COVID hits.. and you lose your cash flow stream and interest adds to debt and you also have to burn cash. Putting it somewhere around $7B

If the company can return to its average of $5B in gross revenue like it was in the three years leading up 2020 and focus their profits on eliminating debt, it still ends up being a company that grosses $5B+ a year. So I would put a value on its assets as well as revenue in the realm of $15B to $20B after debt is eliminated."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Looking at almost any companies financials for 2020 is going to give a skewed perception.

&#x200B;

People are acting like fundamentals matter when talking about $AMC OR $GME. Think about it, $GME had a terrible earnings report and to date has had to close almost 700 locations. There was no real word or any guidance in the earnings report on any plans for mergers or changes in business. Most people are throwing there money in on mights and maybes.

&#x200B;

Neither AMC or GME has anything to do with financials or fundamentals."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, because the theater next to iBuyHardware has such a huge impact on the market. Meanwhile, LA, NYC, and many others are sold out considerably and raking in cash. Many of which broke box office records compared to 2019."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well to be fair I think they should have treated the employees that are actually in theaters better. I think there was half the most recent bonus unaccounted in terms of allocation. I could only hope that went to employees. As far as CEOs getting bonuses, I know for sure that Adam Aron worked a substantial amount of time in 2020 without pay. So a bonus seems fair in that respect. If the information came out that so did the other CEOs then I would fully approve of the bonuses that were granted. At this moment in time I only know that Adam Aron worked without pay."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Disney is wanting to charge you $30 to stream blockbusters, plus the monthly fee. You aren't saving much by streaming any longer."

Or how Fidelity bought a FUCKLOAD of shares and projected the stock to reach $900 before hedgies started their fuckery. AMC posts have to begin on a debbie downer note in the beginning and a ""MAYBE this will work"" as an endnote to stay posted. Fuck.... Just look at the comments. Nothing but negativity. It's FUD disguised as support."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,The stock is already diluted by 75% compared to precovid - what are your thoughts on that?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You do realize that AMC doesn't even get half of the money from a ticket sale right?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Nuke nah just taking a dook but u know that already
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I think looking at previous years and non squeeze is important. Before covid amc was a failing company with no turnaround plan in sight. Claiming recovery from covid only puts it back to where it was before.. what's the upside then?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Which can't possibly hurt their theater business even more.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre pretty much dead-on with that $500m annual debt service (interest only).  It was about $350m in 2019 before they had to go to junk bond status for 10-15% interest loans (variable rates, too, so extra fun when rates rise).  Plus, they have a ton of deferred rent payments to make up.  The only path is issuing the 500m shares that will get the yes vote in May, whether straight to market or given to lenders in exchange for closing out notes."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes I am 100% familiar with the bear thesis on why amc will fail short term (this year and probably a couple years). If we look at the fundamentals amc is a bad short term play. But as we know by know fundamentals are kinda out the window too. 

Thats why im long amc. I'm hopeful for after the 5 years. 

If they get their shit together after all the debt and everything they can grow back. Especially if you buy around 3$."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The dilution is for capital so they can get rid of debt = good for the company bad for short term retail investors. 

I'm not sure if they will dilute either but it is the smart play for the company period. 

Covid recovery hasn't even fully started yet. This is 100% from the squeeze."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"5 seater families will always be down and out when comparing theaters vs. streaming, but the average household isn't 5 member families. Disney plus slapping on an additional $30 for streaming blockbusters + the monthly fee considerably favors the theater for 2 to 3 people. It also looks like from recent reports AMC might be dipping into the streaming game themselves. This will completely open a new revenue stream for them."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I am replying to a post which tries to talk about fundamentals. If fundamentals don‚Äôt matter every post should just be ‚Äúthis is a greater fools‚Äô ‚Äòrecovery play‚Äô you should own the stock because other idiots will‚Äù
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"We'll see, I still have some calls that are pretty much worthless at the moment. We'll see if that changes. But yeah they dilluted the shares a ton without even a split and the stock is at the same level pre covid. I doubt they're making pre covid money."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I'm not doing that either. I'll watch whatever's on Netflix and if there's a movie that I really want to watch I¬®ll find it on some Chinese site"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I estimate that if true there are about 100M to 200M shares above the max outstanding shares. Meaning naked shares and other potential shares that shouldn‚Äôt be there. Which is a conservative estimate.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Talk to me about your thought for GME numbers
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Este es el way.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well I have to defend my thesis. Naturally it‚Äôs what I expected, but I believe I made a good case for AMC without the squeeze. If you have some facts and numbers on that please post them. I made this post with the sole intention of discussion and bringing up new details in the conversation for AMC as well as displaying my thesis."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think the valuation of the company currently even with the added shares is undervalued. When you think about how big AMC actually is, I believe it should be valued at $15B to $20B. Why? Because when you look deeper into the decline before Covid it was more or less related to the expansion, improvement, and acquisitions the company was making. I think they overspent a little and no one was expecting COVID to happen. The hedge funds saw an opportunity to short the stock even before COVID started."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Movie theaters get on average 45% of the cost of the ticket. So you‚Äôre not wrong, but not sure I understand what your reasoning is for the comment."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Concessions more or less contribute to a good majority of revenue. I would consider myself an average movie goer in terms of purchasing popcorn and a drink each movie which is normally about $20 to $30 worth of my experience.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's an additional revenue source for the company. What kind of a point is it that it would hurt theater attendance? Of course it would hurt theater attendance, but if they expand to streaming it pulls AMC out of just being in the theater industry."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,My guess is it would help. Lol
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm saying people are already investing into covid pre recovery. 

Also I keep hearing how they already diluted shares...assuming business picks up for them and they turn it all around I can foresee some stock buybacks"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm pretty sure you just defined the entire sub?

&#x200B;

Yesterday $RKT posts were up ALL day, and the stock itself moved only a couple dollars and then immediately fell to $0.30 over a two week run sideways. They haven't even dropped an earnings report. All the attention did was create more bag-holders. Not once any real fundamentals were discussed, just random ""YOLO $RKT"" posts with an RH screenshot. Fundamentals is more Investing or Stocks sub things, WSB is all yolo this or yolo that, extreme risk vs extreme reward vs extreme losses."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not for a while, but to their credit their earnings report was better than expected, much better. They have extended from 25% capacity to 50% capacity showings in many states as well. Apparently AMC also just bought a bunch of equipment for streaming services as well through CDIM. I think that signals they're most likely going to be entering the streaming arena."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Name your price, they have to pay. Any number is mathematically possible, their losses are hypothetically infinite, the only variable is when are the majority of apes going to sell.

I'm personally betting apes will sell at $1 mil, but I intend to analyze the live data and adjust my expectations accordingly should the need arise. The price will be a parabolic curve, both up and down"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's all good, bud. You did bring up fair points. I'm more bullish on AMC and clearly you're more for GME. In the end it's the same team same fight, only time will tell what happens. Also I had no intention on making this one of those GME VS AMC things that hedgies want. Just pointing out the fishery on WSB. Welp, I'll politely fucker off to WSBNEW now."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"... So you‚Äôre not aware that their debts significantly exceed their assets? Including the $2.7B of ‚Äògood will‚Äô they own?

They took a loss last year 4x larger than the market cap it traded at in 2019. You believe the market cap is worth 15-20x the 2019 level after that loss?

I‚Äôll have whatever you‚Äôre smoking"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey, serious question. That $50 you spend, how much of that is going to go to having to keep showings open because they can only operate at 50% in many states for the foreseeable future? Challenge is that you‚Äôd need a lot of great movies coming out, and then keep everyone there to work is what was dragging the stock down to begin with pre covid. So you make more money but spend more of it because you can‚Äôt stay at capacity due to social distancing now. Normally this wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal, the problem is that the movie cycle is getting shorter. Where it was 2 weeks or 3 before release to streaming, now it‚Äôs either direct or 10 days based on an estimate I saw (not factual take it with a grain of salt)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"So your thesis is AMC declined in value because they expanded, improved, and acquired?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,So you think the company should have a market cap of $15-$20 billion despite its previous all time high market cap being around $4.5b? Please explain why you believe the equity of AMC should be worth 3-4x more this year then it has ever been worth in its history.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I had another idea too that if AMC is were to pursue also becoming a production company which is now legal, they can own a theater chain as well as a production company that this could bode very well for them in the long long run. A trifecta of theaters, production, and streaming service. The board just needs some new progressive minds to make that happen as well as time."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"What youre saying is literally why I'm bullish long term. Even if they dilute and you pick up shares after if they do a stock buyback or sell the company to Amazon or some other thing it literally is just up from the bottom. 

Long term It's a decent play. But I mean long term."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre replying to me take it up with OP
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think they have an amc+ streaming service. I'd like them to go up, but it seems meme stock status is pushing them past current evaluation in my opinion at the moment. Which is a good thing if they can use any of that net worth to invest in more things they can do to be profitable."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think the reality is when Blackrock and the whales/largest institutions with skin in the game currently pushing the price decide to sell, thats the peak for GME. Some ape who works at Wendy's who has 10 shares isn't going to get his golden ticket to willy wonkas millionaire factory imo. Mind you I would fucking love to be wrong."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You honestly think majority of people are going to hold until 1 mil a share?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt have a position in GME and 75% of my portfolio is in AMC lol
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Considering in 2017, 2018, 2019 they grossed over $5B in revenue each year, its a couple years of at least paying off debt. If they can focus on eliminating debt as opposed to doing anything else, it could occur as near as 2023. Not to mention they are fairing reasonably well in terms of movie goers returning to theaters in comparison to their competitors. I still consider the valuation to be higher than what is because I have faith in the company to focus on the goal of eliminating debt which means the stock in my opinion is undervalued. Everyone looking at the debt numbers needs to understand their ability to generate revenue. Even with some movie productions being halted, it will in my belief still recover as new box office movies are released."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You gotta think though, many major pictures postponed their releases until COVID is done. Studios make a lot more money by theatre sales than in-home sales, so they have an incentive to do theatre releases as well and make them last as long as possible."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"They borrowed to do that at high interest rates.  Now they have huge debt to pay off, along with interest payments."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I believe they overspent on making acquisitions and improving the quality of their theaters as well as adding alcohol vending to most of their theaters. Which was just before COVID hit. With COVID striking when it did, it was just poor timing. The company got caught with its pants down so to speak. I think that AMC being one of the most popular theater chains in the world gives it a case for recovery and I feel like it‚Äôs undervalued."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I posted on your other comment. Basically I believe that if the company can focus on repaying debt using its revenue average $5B+ average during the three years leading up to COVID in 2020, then I would value the company at $15B to $20B based on gross profits and current assets regardless. In Q1 I believe is when hedge funds began shorting AMC because they overspent on the acquisition deals as well their goal for the next couple of years was to continue spending on improvements to their current locations as well as their acquisition locations. Which I don‚Äôt fault them for that because they couldn‚Äôt foresee COVID happening. They got caught out in the rain in terms of what they had put all there profits towards. When risk management didn‚Äôt account for a global pandemic, I‚Äôm sure they had a road map to making the improvements as well as the acquisitions based on revenue. If you invest to grow your company and make improvements and the experience better for your customer, then I‚Äôm all for that which is why I would put that valuation where it‚Äôs at."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You made an assertion that in this sub the fundamentals drive or have any bearing on the average person's stock decisions. That isn't the case in this sub. I was simply pointing that out.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup. We are literally just going to have to see.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I do. But like I said, gonna view the live data and probably sell after the peak."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well shucks, sorry I assumed your portfolio. Anywho, keep up the good fight and have a great day, future millionaire!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"They issued more debt after paying off their current debt this year. When they were hitting $5b revenues from 2017-2019 they had actual earnings once, in 2018, of $114m. But they still took on more debt then so Retained earnings to shareholders took another $300m hit.

They haven't been profitable in a long time, they are in a worse position than they ever have been, and streaming services are now sending movies directly to stream on day 1? GGWP Amc, going to meet its brother blockbuster soon in boomer heaven"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,/shrug you need money to make money.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly I hope you‚Äôre right and a year from now you‚Äôre the next DFV, I just don‚Äôt see it.  It‚Äôs trading at/above pre-covid numbers and they‚Äôve dug a deeper hole the last year.  It was a great buy at $2-5 but at $10-12 I think most people are betting on a squeeze and not as a long term investment"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude. I don‚Äôt think you understand the difference between revenue and earnings. It can‚Äôt pay down debt with revenue it needs to have earnings. $5.7B of debt $5B of revenue and negative earnings = same debt load.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but the main point I‚Äôm trying to make is that I believe their earnings were low due to the acquisitions and improvements the company was making. The company was simultaneously paying off debt as well keeping things operational. The stock price started its decline at q1 of 2017. Until that point it was on a steady uptrend. The 2016 year was when they spent $2.3B to acquire Carmike and Odeon. Then also from 2017 to 2019 they spent $2B to $3B to improve infrastructure and quality of their theaters. The decline started with more than likely unfavorable earnings. Shorts saw an opportunity at that time and likely also contributed to further share price erosion.

The CEO Adam Aron has even commented that the shorting of AMC didn‚Äôt just start this year. It‚Äôs been going on since about that time."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"What it boils down to is how do you put a valuation on a company that pre Covid was averaging $5B in gross revenue for 3 years (2017, 2018, 2019). Is it 1x, 2x, 3x or more/less."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,The negative earnings was a factor of what they overspent on which was improvements and acquisitions.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Regardless, even at their ATH at \~$35/share if you account for shareholder dilution the current price implies a price of $90 then. That was before they were issuing notes with higher interest (10%) than junk bonds. Your target market cap implies a price of $270/share then. 

Earnings may have been low due to that, but nothing about the fundamental case has changed for the better. They are heavily debt leveraged and their operating costs are heavily fixed. Do you truly think attendance will be significantly higher, with YOY growth for the next 5 years vs the industry wide downtrend we've observed for years?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Easy- you look and see that over those 3 years they couldn‚Äôt turn a profit- they actually LOST money (roughly $5M) over those 3 years, never mind the $4.6B they lost last year"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You do realize that gross revenue is before expenses right?

2019 had **$5.33B**  in expenses lol"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude. You‚Äôre clueless. Good luck.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think it can at least return to $5B gross revenue point and hopefully attract more people with what they spent over the last 4 years improving about their business. More locations should bode for a wider customer base. If they can find some traction in generating revenue from their streaming service, that‚Äôs a plus. I think it has a chance especially with the public attention it‚Äôs gotten to survive the debt and recover. If they can get themselves untethered from debt through proper guidance, they can produce higher YOY earnings. Which is why I would put the value of the company around where I did in terms of assets and gross revenue. Remove the debt from the equation and you would see a rather significant increase in net profits.

Eventually what I would like to see is a push towards becoming a production company as well for new movies."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You say lost, but investing profits in the company to make improvements and acquisitions can‚Äôt really be ignored. They overspent on trying to make themselves better. They more than likely did this because of the the future returns they expected pre Covid were greater than what they were putting their money into."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you look at what those expenses were? ü§î
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol thanks. If it works out I‚Äôll let you know. If it doesn‚Äôt, I‚Äôll post you a picture of my losses for you to jerk off to."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, of anybody I've spoken to about AMC you're the most coherent in stating a bull case. 

But, what value should it be assigned now? This year's analyst estimate for EPS is still -$3.63 which equates to a 1.4B loss. A very generous estimate puts cash on hand at $600m. Their cash burn has been around $120m/month. So they probably will vote to dilute shareholders further on 5/4.

I doubt they have many more lenders willing to give them more cash without an exorbitant interest rate. They are teetering on complete failure as a firm. I'd value them now with the assumption that they issue 500m more shares. This could provide enough cash to get them over the hump and back into profitability in a few years, but they need to show improvements and demonstrate literally anything positive before we start assuming that they will even be around in 5 years.

From a DCF standpoint you won't be breaking even on an investment now @ $3/share for  5 years at least"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs just the license alone,  not including the installation of the source vending machine and stocking of it. Plus yes $2B to $3B on infrastructure improvements makes logistical sense to me in terms of how the money adds up."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think valuing a company under duress is tough. On one hand you have a debt bubble lingering over them. On the other hand if things return to normal even next year or this year, we could see them stabilize losses, generate profit, and begin repaying debt. In the regards to the current valuation, I would say it‚Äôs at fair value or undervalued. Which to me it is. You have a stock that people care about because of emotion which is also contributing to that. You have a potential recovery play and everyone likes an underdog.

Considering if it hadn‚Äôt taken on debt over the past 4 years, didn‚Äôt make acquisitions or improvements, I think we would have seen the stock price with inflation at where it currently sits which is about $30 to $40 pre-dilution. If you valued the future of what it could generate once debt is eliminated, I think a company ‚Äúearning‚Äù $500M to $1B in actual profits after everything has been factored in would be worth at least $15B (If debt was no longer a factor). It looked like it had steady growth in terms of revenue with a year to year peak. I think if debt was not a factor it could pursue alternative revenue sources if the board was willing. I also think why earnings were low from 2016 to 2019 was due to having to repay existing debt that it accrued from self investment. 

I think the board needs to trust the idea of people returning to the theaters. I voted no on the proxy for adding shares. That being said it‚Äôs tough. I really want to see Q1 earnings before getting all up in arms about my valuation. I think it will paint a picture for a better understanding of how long it will take to eliminate debt. As well I don‚Äôt think the board has majority voting power anymore. I think majority voting power is on the retail traders side."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Acquiring Odeon and Carmike Theaters, improving current theater infrastructure, and also licensing to distribute alcohol in theaters."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets," 2019 $5,3 billion

2018 $5.1 billion

2017 $4.9 billion

2016 $3 billion"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,That seems pretty consistent considering the Odeon and Carmike deals which were multi billion dollar deals took place in 2016. Those aren‚Äôt upfront deals either. You also have rebranding and restructuring involved with those deals. Plus the cost to get liquor licenses isn‚Äôt cheap as well as replacing millions of seats.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"""AMC Entertainment‚Äôs $1.2-billion deal to acquire Europe‚Äôs Odeon & UCI Cinemas has been approved by regulators at the European Commission.""

What?

You're telling me rebranding costs multiple billion dollars more than the actual acquisition a year?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,They also acquired Carmike the same year...
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Then in proceeding events began to add liquor and renovated seating to theaters as well as various infrastructure improvements like remodeling and new screens
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,""" AMC Theatres said Wednesday that it has completed its acquisition of Carmike Cinemas¬†for approximately $1.1 billion"""
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,And you think all of that costs more than buying one of Europe's largest theaters chains lol seats...and liquor license...costing billions a year...
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Considering AMC has 1000 theaters, liquor licenses range per state or location can be from $12,000 to $14000 per license. New seats can be expensive as hell too. Considering you have 100 to 200 seats per theater room."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay at 14k thats still only 14 million lol...

Do you really think buying new seats and liquor license costs more than buying 2 entire large movie chains.... Dude really?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Amc has 8000 screens, 100 seats per screen @ 1k each(No way they are that much) is 800 million and that is assuming every screen has those new seats which is not the case. Still not even a billion."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Plus you have disposal and environmental fees as well as labor to remove the old seating.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre still thinking about in terms of material cost. The labor cost for removal, disposal, and installation is something you are forgetting."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're delusional if you think its more expensive to upgrade seats than it is to buy two entire movie chains, with buildings screens and everything else that makes up a theatre"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,How can you possibly think that an entire business was sold at a lower cost than it is to upgrade the seats lmao....
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It wasn‚Äôt just seating lol üòÇ you‚Äôre ungodly thick. When I say improvements to infrastructure it extends beyond just seating, it includes overall architectural upgrades, redoing their newly acquired theaters to fit their company, so yes. Call me delusional for understanding the cost of labor and material that goes in to that. If you‚Äôve never priced out something like that you have no leg to stand on."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"My point still stands, my god how can you possibly think that acquiring two ***entire*** businesses are multiple billion dollars less than upgrading your existing theaters??

Those deals were for 2.3 billion. You don't sell a company for the face value of the building and everything inside... YET you think it costs many more times just to upgrade seats and change signage lmao man give your head a shake...."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I spend my normal work day estimating exterior construction work. You can keep disagreeing with me or we can just say to each their own that we hold a different opinion.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Because those acquisition theater companies also needed upgrades. Jesus. Lol AMC purchased those companies at fair value and what they had knowing full well they would have to both have exterior and interior improvements which are never factored in the the deal when buying a company. That‚Äôs why $3B dollars in renovating over all the locations makes fathomable sense to me.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,LOL do you also think that doing renovations on your house should cost double than what you paid for the entire house??
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Fair value includes that prices of all their inventory and how much the company brings in a year. Straight delusion if you think upgrading theaters costs nearly a billion dollars more vs buying TWO ENTIRE BUSINESSES ü§°ü§°ü§°
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah because you can literally do that to increase the value of your home by twice the amount. If not more. If you want to spend on improvements for what your house is worth whether it‚Äôs completely rebuilding or renovating, it adds equity to the home."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,hahahah dude hahahah wow you're ridiculous
2021-03-31 05:38:37,wallstreetbets,"FUBO Bull Case is an absolute no brainer Fellas, gather round my Fubo Subcription as I tell you why you are basically being handed free cash at these prices if you buy FUBO. From it's peak of roughly $62 a few short months ago, to it's current $22 it has been a wild ride. Fubo is an incredible streaming service especially when it comes to sports. As a user and subscriber myself what they offer for $65 a month well worth it in addition to the $18 sports package. That to me is personally enough to ever need at a much cheaper price that cable. I'm just some stoner in my 20's what more would I need? Now imagine a shit ton of us starting to cut cable and move towards these streaming services? 

There is a growing market of ""cord cutters"" that is going to be in the millions. If Fubo can grow their marketing and grab a large chunk that will help its revenue grow substantially. Revenue that just topped 100m for it's first quarter ever. It should be noted that FUBO reacted positively to earnings and then the tech fuckery began. 

With their acquisition of Vigtory, a sports betting company, their goal to achieve a single platform tv screen and betting screen is extremely tangible. Imagine the amount of guys in their 20s and 30s who'd sign up for this shit. Not only would they be added subscribers, but they could go from a $65 a month subscriber to a few hundred or a few thousand. This is hopefully going to be implemented in the fall or early winter. 

With the recent rotation out of growth stocks, FUBO will rip back, as many of these stocks have fallen 50-60%, people will quickly rotate into them again. I don't see it being a slow bleed for much longer. With these sharp drops due to the selloff, it's looking attractive with a decent short float of 35%. This could very easily trigger a decent sized squeeze. 

Institutions love FUBO as well. It's riding at 63% institutional ownership at this point despite the beatdown. You would see them have exited their positions by now if this doesn't bounce back hard. 

$80+ EOY book it.

No, this isn't financial advice, I just love the fucking stock and think this it's just criminally undervalued at the current share price. 

Plays: 400 Shares Long , 10 $50c 11/19"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I been buying FUBO shares in the 20s back in January. I could've sold, but I didn't because I like the stock and I believe in this company. I actually own their competitor DISH (no positions) and when DKNG partnered up, I have to be honest with you I was a little worried, but after seeing the draftkings app on my DISH hopper it's really not that special. The draftkings feature on the hopper just gives you a direct link to your smartphone and you download the draftkings sportsbook app. It's essentially useless! I bet just as usual with or without the hopper draftkings features. The only benefit it's got is the real time score of live games around the league, which any retard can do with internet access. Completely useless partnership if you ask me! Let's see what this live sports betting FUBO can do!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait til they add betting services
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Very oversold right now, gotta see some kind of upward reversal to get in though"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Customer and bought 25 shares today.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought in recently it‚Äôs definitely a bargain now and could see some serious growth in the next year
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Count me in over 1000 shares deep 31 avg üëÄ
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought the stock and buying more on the correction seemed like a no brainer  because how bullish I am on online gambling. Then I started digging into FUBO Gaming a bit more and found out they have less than 10 employees and only 7 on LinkedIn, they all seem super young to have positions like Director of Engineering (not nessicarily a bad thing) and I'm questioning can they really deliver a sports betting platform by Q4 2021. I know they acquired a betting company, but again less than 10 employees. 

FUBO TV reviews on trustpilot all seem super sketchy too, majority of the 5 star reviews seem to be praising support reps rather than anything to do with the actual service. Are they getting some incentive to post a 5 star review? 

The theme with the 1 star reviews are generally about how difficult it is to cancel after the free trial. A massive turn off for me since this will be artificialy boosting the sub numbers. 

Has anyone actually used Fubo TV and is it any good? I'm in the UK so can't even view the website as you need an account."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like the stonk, and I am not a cat."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I actually like the stock.  1000 shares @ 25.99.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought some stock then subscribed to learn more about it. I like the service and I‚Äôm going to keep it. 

The the stock price to subscriber multiple is higher than Netflix but the 6X subscription price plus the long runway ahead to acquire more subscribers its cheap. 

I saw somewhere that the sports betting will be incorporated on screen during live events. 

What makes this the missing link for the boomers to fully cut the cord is the ability to watch shitty local news. So between sports and shitty local news cable is dead. 

180 shares at $27.60

Buying calls tomorrow. Not sure which ones yet."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"FUBO was an absolute rocket before these tech dickings. I might jump in tomorrow at open, I think these tech/growth stonks will rip back soon"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You saved me some DD time! 

FUBO was also hit by the Archegos dump. I am early in learning about the stock but I think that now is a good time to jump in. I subscribed to it a few years ago to watch some games from other countries. Great service. 

What about being an acquisition target? As it becomes more prominent, it would be better for a big fish to take them out of the market before they grow too much.

Edit: to start I got    
5x 4/9 $25c    
15x 4/16 $30c"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Do they stream any other sports? Because soccer is for commies according to my highschool football coach.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hope so I am screwed with 4,500 shares at 40.50 and not easy to hold them watching them to go to $20 bucks , a joke and overreaction hopefully soon gets back"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bought in $21, i dont wait for no upside reversal I WILL ride the upside reversal.

Fubo moves so fast it could hit $40 by in less than two weeks."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm bullish, one thing that concerns me is the decline of price the last month? What explains this sell off? Shouldn‚Äôt a streaming service be thriving during covid?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"ape like, ape buy."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"They have 500,000 subscribers.  Imagine if you could get 100,000 WSB people to sign up for 3 months.  When Fubo reports that growth during earnings call you‚Äôd see the stock jump 50%."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What NBA and American Football games are available on this?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm a cutter!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I dont like this stock or company
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,which platform can this be bought on? ty
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Still paying like $700 for each $1 of sub revenue per user per month or something. Many good companies in this market with trash valuations we ignored bc ‚Äústocks only go up‚Äù
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"A good friend of mine tried to get me to buy at $50, then at $40, again at $30, and still thinks it‚Äôs going to the moon.

Personally, the class action lawsuit against them makes me nervous, and I feel like $65-83/month is a bit high for people on top of Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, Disney+ etc. But I‚Äôm also not an obsessive sports watcher or gambler (except for call options lately), so what do I know."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Played this late last year and it was a sad 3-4 weeks during the holiday season when it was short report attacked by the usual short mouth pieces. 

Streaming is crowded, signed up for FUBO to get an actual feel for the service. It‚Äôs not bad, great on mobile but on a 65+ screen the picture quality compared to YouTube TV was noticeable. 

At the current price (if it‚Äôs the bottom) it seems like a good entry, quite volatile and vulnerable to attacks by the short side because of the losses they generally report each quarter."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,How are their financials?  Last I checked they were still losing money despite pandemic giving them a boost.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Disney owns sports in America and also owns the majority of Hulu. Hulu streaming is the same as Fubo, and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Disney simply cut their services off from Fubo. What then?

This is competing directly with Disney‚Äôs empire, and you don‚Äôt want to be on the other end of that juggernaut. This is a small player that will likely be crushed."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Has everything always been about short squeezes or is this a new phenomenon?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Would 20 Aug 21 $60 C be dumb or big brain?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,">From it's peak of roughly $62 a few short months ago, to it's current $22

Why in the fuck did I no idea the price was that discounted"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Taking your comment one step further.... Can't ""any retard with a smartphone"" also just bet?  Why do I need to have it linked to a TV subscription?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Is that definitely going to be a thing?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fubo has the price of Octuber/November 


Bullish as well"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Devil's advocate:  You guys all talk like getting more subscribers is some simple process, it isn't.  The ""cord cutting"" sector is filling up with options quickly.    


In regards to local TV, that is a problem with most of them as well.   Offering that would help, but there won't be any ""secret sauce"" behind that and any of the plethora of other competitors could offer that as well."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Proof please.... (source?)
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,They have partnerships with many sports leagues.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Watched March Madness on here with a free trial and subscribed after, they‚Äôve got a lot so invested. I live in NY, but my home team is FL and so I get to watch all my home teams when I couldn‚Äôt before w/cable"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,NHL and MLB. Pretty much every streaming service dropped NESN. So the only streaming service to get the bruins or sox on (both huge markets) is fubo. I'm considering a switch from youtubeTV since they no longer carry it and the process keep increasing.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs the thing, there is no tangible reason for the selloff. It was a sector rotation out of growth stocks but these have dropped so much that they‚Äôre attractive again which I see as a good thing. These will rip back"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah... there‚Äôs only one problem. The product is shit.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Subscribed after football season so idk yet, but all my local teams are on there with the basic subscription for basketball and watched all March madness on here so far. Haven‚Äôt had any issue watch my local games / most national games"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let me guess, you love GameStop"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It can be bought on Roku, AppleTV, FireTV, etc."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Recent IPOs get sued in class actions all the time when the stock drops. The leeches open a class action and then advertise it to gather clients.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have fubo.tv, mostly got it for golf channel, and I'm pretty sure I'm only paying $50~ /month.  Was the most reasonable option for golf channel IMO for chord cutters.  I'm very happy with the service.  Can set programs to record from the app and watch them later at home because it has included DVR.  

Not sure what the class action is about, i'll have to look into that."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,More seasonal losses than credible decline. They wax and wane mostly based on football season. I think they will gain subscriptions as they become more established with their sportsbook as well.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I wouldn't expect an early stage tech company being profitable.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait until you find out Disney also owns a part of Fubo
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,**Don‚Äôt** fuck with the mouse
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok but there are other players out there that are surviving without having the big name clout of Disney.

For example, I use YouTubeTV which is made by some small company called Goggles or something.  

Surely Fubo can compete in this space"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Wrinkly brain move
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"if you're a sports fan you kno how instrumental it is to watch live sports when you are betting. I have betted straight through the app without watching the app and just constantly updating the my smartphone update live feed, you need to kno if there's a controversial call to be look at, a timeout, fouls, so many factors you don't see on your feeds when you see on live sports. Without knowing these information I've lost plethora of money, so I need to watch live sports, especially betting live. But I do think I see some value here with FUBO if they can implement their own gambling system where people can bet through with a click of a button, rather than jumping through hoops, inputting your phone number to sending you a link, then signing up for the app then placing a wager on the app. I say eliminate all that and just bet as live sports is happening! People will value that! I value that as a big sport fan! And I been betting on sportsbook since 2012 I could see ton of profit!"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"From what I've read on this thread alone, my thoughts are:

You don't have to keep checking/updating your phone every 5 seconds. The betting application integrated with the tv programming would allow a live feed of the game plus new bets or updated payouts of placing a bet mid game. I've never bet money on anything in my life besides the stock market so I'm not sure. 

I believe you can literally bet on anything though. Example, player A has ball that previously did not have ball, 69 new bets are available such as: player B will foul player C, player DD will fall into the crowd and a crowd surf session will commence, player A¬≤ will be called in from the bench to replace player A, bystander with 3-D glasses will go get another beer before the play is over, etc."

2021-03-31 05:16:16,wallstreetbets,"Civilization Changing Technology: CRISPR CRISPR ( clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ) is specific, efficient and versatile gene-editing technology we can harness to modify, delete or correct precise regions of our DNA. . This technology can be used to eradicate species, make designer babies, reverse extinction, cure diseases, the list goes on and on. The CRISPR mechanism moves much faster then regulators can control which allows rapid advancement within the technology. Unlike other medical advances, CRISPR RNA is relatively cheap ( hundreds of dollars ) which allows for widespread study and HUGE demand for the product. The price of CRISPR has decreased 99% and research can be done in weeks as opposed to years. CRISPR was originally discovered in the 80s but did not gain traction until the early 2000's. The reason I bring this point up is because good ideas cant be used because of the tools they have at the time. For CRISPR the time is now. Since I am not a scientist or a biotech engineer I am going to keep this DD short and allow you to research on your own. If your really retarded and skip these big words to scroll through GME memes, take away this; In 2020, CRISPR-Cas9 won the Nobel Prize, the fucking Nobel Prize. They are solving HIV, cancer, HUMAN AGING, with this ""simple"" tool. CRISPR IPO'd at $14 and climbed over $220 in January. Since January CRISPR has gotten almost halved and is now trading around $110. This isn't just another stock to make some gainz on, this is *Already* changing the world around us, they have already created human genetically edited babies.

Ticker:CRSP

EDIT: THIS IS NOT INVESTMENT/FINANCIAL ADVICE. "
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is going to be a longer post since I've been following crispr for years.

I've been holding Crispr since IPO along with Intellia, and Editas. I have a background in molecular biology, and can confirm the crispr is indeed revolutionary tech. What typically gets left out of DD posts is the [ongoing patent battle for who owns crispr](https://mk0labiotecheugl43g7.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/CRISPR-patent-licensing.jpg). Each company lists this as one of their biggest risks in their 10-K filings, and there business models rely on licensing as one of their major anticipated revenue streams. IMO I think Editas has one of the best chances since they have the an academic ""dream team"", and there has been a decent amount of insider buying as of late.

I'm personally waiting for Caribou to IPO since they'll have the rights to crispr in non-humans. I think there is more money to be made in biotech outside of just medicine such as bioengineering, agriculture, and other applications. Yes, medicine makes bigly money, but it's a very long process for approval that is not guaranteed.I also have a strong bias towards biotech. 

Crispr as a technology is a huge deal so my advice is to buy a little of all 3 claiming the patent. As a sitting play I think it's great. I see this as a similar situation as buying a share of every tech IPO in the 80's, and sitting on it. The gains from the winner(s) will dwarf the losses. That $20 in Apple would be worth $50k today.

If anyone has any questions I‚Äôm happy to answer them."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"So I actually work in a molecular biology lab and know just about everything there is to know about CRISPR. I agree with most of the things in this post. CRISPR is indeed revolutionary but there's still some work to do. Basically it is a system that was identified in a species of bacteria that evolved to help it defend from viruses by selectively targeting and cutting exact sequences of DNA, inserting mutations, and rendering the gene unreadable and therefore functionally deleted. What it can do reaaaaally well is deleting genes. eg disease causing genes. What it was thought it could do was actually selectively cut and insert pieces of DNA. Unfortunately, the latter function is highly variable and random and not feasible ATM. Current advances are now on much later generations of the CRISPR system and the hope is that the gene insertion function can be worked our in the next 5-10 years. IF/when that happens, the sky is the limit. I believe in the tech. Good investment.

I don't have any positions in CRISPR technology or related technology stocks."

I have to say, OP, you are fucking retarded. $CRSP is not the only company involved in CRISPR/cas-9 editing and yes, a cofounder of $CRSP was someone who won the Nobel Prize but it was \*NOT\* awarded to CRISPR Therapeutics AG, the company. You need to read more than just headlines my guy. I live in Boston, the capital of biotech in the US and personally know a CRISPR scientist that works for one of the top biotech companies here (and the globe I guess), and trust me there are 100s of companies all using this tech right now $CRSP is not unique at all.

If anyone wants to invest in the basket of genome editing companies such as $EDIT and others, I highly suggest $ARKG. I just personally bet on just $CRSP because at the time they had 0 debt and were only 1 of a few publicly listed genome editing companies."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have a degree in molecular bio. I'm a developer now so my lab rat days are over. But, I agree with just about everything you've said. The big thing that's left out of 99% of CRISPR DD's is the patent battle as licensing Crispr is projected to be the big revenue generator. To prove a point here's each of the companies vying for the patent straight from their 10-K's

- Crispr (CRSP): If we are unable to obtain or protect intellectual property rights related to our proprietary gene-editing technology and product candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets.
- Intellia (NTLA): The scope of protection we are able to develop, establish and maintain for intellectual property rights, including patents and license rights
- Editas (EDIT): maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio and provide reimbursement of third‚Äëparty expenses related to our patent portfolio.

[It's all going to come down to who holds the patent](https://mk0labiotecheugl43g7.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/CRISPR-patent-licensing.jpg). I'm not a lawyer so I can't weigh in on that. Honestly I'm waiting for Caribou since I believe you can get a higher return outside of medicine (specifically ag-biotech)"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea, it‚Äôs one of the biggest discoveries in a long time. I think you have plenty of time to put money into it, but it‚Äôs going to sit there for a while. I‚Äôve had huge returns off of EDIT/NTLA/CRSP, but mind you I‚Äôve held for 5 years so I got in at IPO. Biotech is extremely volatile so it‚Äôs best not to look at it for a while. I recommend every investor in crispr to check the patent status once a month, and to understand some of the nuances behind the patent. Caribou biosciences has the rights to crispr in non-humans which I believe has bigger returns than crispr in humans. It‚Äôs private right now, but worth checking in on once a month."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Whoever times the weekly when one of these companies gets the patent is going to be very very rich
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"No idea, but I keep an alert set out on it. They were planning on 2020, but pushed it back because of covid which is ironic considering they probably would have made way more if they IPO last year."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"BEAM has their license through Editas according to their SEC filings.

I don‚Äôt have an opinion on them, but I can do some research on them, and if I find something interesting I can write up a DD. I research biotech companies pretty heavily before YOLOing into them. The only other company I‚Äôd put money into is Caribou Biosciences since they‚Äôre looking for the rights in non-humans.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, this isn't a dumb question at all. To put it lightly it is incredibly complicated. Academics typically collaborate on research together. When the study was first published by Charpentier (CRSP), and Doudna (EDIT/Caribou) in 2012 (2020 Nobel recipients). Zhang filed a provisional for a patent based off of work he did in 2011.

There are 3 parties that all filed patents around the same time. Typically tech transfer from universities is not that exciting, but crispr is a rocket. Crispr Therapeutics was founded by Emmanuelle Charpentier who was one of the discoverers, and trying to claim the patent. Editas was founded by Doudna, but she left to create Caribou. 

This case is incredibly complicated because of the number of parties involved, and the scope of crispr. [There's a pretty good infographic showing the mess.](https://mk0labiotecheugl43g7.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/CRISPR-patent-licensing.jpg)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I explained this in a few replies, but I think CRISPRa a technology is impossible to fuck up. But, there‚Äôs a really long, and complex patent battle over who owns it between 3 companies (NTLA, EDIT, and CRSP). Each of their business models involve maintaining, and licensing IP. This patent encompasses work in humans. I‚Äôm personally waiting for Caribou IPO since they are looking to get the ‚Äúno-human‚Äù patent."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,How is that possible?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,what the fuck does this shit mean

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think it's viable to hedge your best, buy in on all 3 (Editas is the only good one so far today) and make Google Alerts for news on the legal side.

Caribou is def the cash cow though, broad exclusivity on all that nonhuman IP"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh I would hold 10 years no problem, I have full faith on this technology ever since I first heard about it. Can you share some of the resources so I can learn about how the patent status and nuances work?

I think you are right, use on non-humans will most likely boom a lot sooner and have wider applications too, guess I'll have to study on how IPOs work too"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The other biotech company to watch is Oxford Nanopore, they're scheduled for an IPO later this year.  Their sequencing technology is a little behind Illumina in terms of accuracy, but blows it out of the water in terms of cost, read length and simplicity of use.  The accuracy issue is changing quickly too, if the current trend continues they'll be rivalling Illumina within a year or two."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! 40 days
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The patents that myriad had were also for use in a certain domain.  They didn't patent BRCA1 & 2, just the use of a couple of SNVs and indels in diagnostic applications.  My area is bioinformatics, not IP law, but I can certainly see a lot of parallels between the two cases.

Even if the patents are eventually found to be valid the technology moves so fast that by the time it can be monetised the patents will be redundant.  Look at where companies like Celera Genetics and Affymetrix are today, both had ground breaking products but were quickly overtaken by illumina."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Actually the beauty of crispr is that it's so cheap and easy it's good for research. Definitely something you can fuck up. If not by process then by design. If the early crispr products are as cynical as glyphosate resistant food plants then there might be problems. Although much of the industry recognizes this.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The glow in the dark... did surprise me. The rest, split tongue etc.... I can deal with, I think this broke the camel's back for me."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed. DowDupont has filed the most patents using crispr at 514. The next is Harvard with 343. I see a lot more potential in non-human products. I personally don't have too much of an interest in medicine (more of an ag-biotech kind of guy) so I do have a bias.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Y‚Äôall‚Äô finished or Y‚Äôall done? I aint gon say no more
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"So this patent battle has been years in the making, and is incredibly complicated. I‚Äôm not well versed enough in patent law to really have an opinion on it. I just set up a google alert for ‚Äúcrispr patent‚Äù. 

It‚Äôs between a few researchers now, and the researched. Basically crispr wasn‚Äôt generally that interesting until it got published, and then people realized they hit a goldmine. Basically two patents were filed for crispr in gene editing around the same time. But, the founder of NTLA used it in eukaryotic cells (basically anything not bacteria), and filed a patent for it. So now you have a huge mess over who actually owns, and discovered crispr. This battle has lasted 10 years, and millions on lawyers. This is obviously bullish as fuck since you don‚Äôt throw money at lawyers for no reason. 

And I do agree. I think ag-biotech is a way bigger market with less regulatory hurdles than medicine. The US population will double within our lifetimes, and people have to eat ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

Accuracy is king so I‚Äôm a bit weary, but I don‚Äôt know their business/products. Illumina is a behemoth so if they can compete with them there are plenty of tendies to be made."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You make some really good points. IP law is really complex, and I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm qualified to comment on it. You should shoot me a DM. There needs to be more biotech in WSB."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess I was more readily applying ‚Äúfuck up‚Äù to encompass gene editing as an industry. You do make a good point though about public perception being key. This is listed as a risk for all 3 companies. People get weird with biotech.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Med can just be so risky and volatile. I majored in neurobio so I'm in the know too, but fuck me I'm not spending all my free time reading through all the R&D press releases looking to get in early on a hype new drug or whatever. 

I'll take my slightly lower returns on sure things like glow in the dark corn and transparent steak"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"> and people have to eat

I read this as buy lots of Soylent.  Then I realized you didn't say people *to* eat"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,">Accuracy is king so I'm a bit weary...

This isn't true for all applications.  Point of care testing and other diagnostic applications often only need to know the presence/absence of an organism.

The long read, single molecule sequencing technology PacBio and Oxford Nanopore have solves two major short comings in Illumina's short read sequencing.  Short read sequencing cant adequately detect structural variation or copy number variants, so while it is currently better in terms of accuracy of individual base calls it performs much worse when it comes to alignment.  Illumina, and similar amplification methods, have issues with amplification bias that are completely avoided with single molecular sequencing.   The accuracy problem is only a matter of time for nanopore sequencing, and a lot of it can already be solved bioinformatically.  

I'm not aware of Illumina having anything on the market, or even in development, that can do long read sequencing.  The closest thing they've got are a few bioinformatic tools that stitch together their usual 250bp fragments.  This is why they tried to buy PacBio, they've fallen behind in the technology race and cant catch up.  You can see it in the way they market their 'synthetic long read technology', they try to dress up a bunch of *in silico* methods as a sequencing technology. Oxford Nanopore is going to do to Illumina what Illumina did to Affymetrix.

I would wait on NTLA until it drops a bit since it's up 10%.  It's biotech it will come back down. But, seriously though just put in a calendar for once a month reminder for Caribou Biosciences.

Below I will place all the potential cannabis catalysts and why I think TLRY is poised for a run this upcoming month. 

#Catalysts: 

‚Ä¢ New York recreational cannabis legalization (4/1/2021) 

‚Ä¢ New Mexico recreational cannabis legalization (this week) 

‚Ä¢ SAFE Act - banking act for cannabis companies (brought to senate floor last week) 

‚Ä¢ CLAIMS Act - insurance act for cannabis companies (brought to senate floor last week) 

‚Ä¢ APHA earnings call (4/12/2021)

‚Ä¢ APHA/ TLRY merger vote meeting (4/14/2021)

‚Ä¢ Proposed merger date (4/20/2021) 

‚Ä¢ Mexico recreational cannabis legalization deadline (4/30/2021) 

#Share Price Information:

Current shares outstanding: 171M 

Current institutional ownership: 15%

Current share float: 144M 

Current short float: 20% 

#My Thoughts:

Currently sitting at 22.04, right at trend line support. As everything in the Nasdaq, the sell off in share price has been due to the Nasdaq sell off. 

Now that we are entering a new month, we may see tech recover, and especially the marijuana sector, which has a lot of news coming. April, historically, is a good month for the stock market. 

I am mainly focused on TLRY though due to that merger with APHA that will make it the largest cannabis company in the world. 

Aphria owns Sweetwater Brewery while Tilray owns Maritoba Harvest (hemp). 
Once merged, the two companies will trade as Tilray and will headquarter in the US. 
They will no doubt use their massive cash position to acquire US cannabis companies. 
Aphria dominates not only the Canadian market but also the German one. 
Tilray currently has the Spanish market as well as New Zealand and UK. 
Not only is this a US cannabis play but also a European cannabis play - the two most profitable cannabis markets in the world. 

Let‚Äôs send TLRY to the fucking moon!

My thoughts is that positive APHA ER will cause the MJ stock fomo then the merger announcement the next day fomo will get even worse. This will be the first time Sweetwater will be in a earnings call, and figures estimate more than $200M in revenue. APHA is the most solid Canadian cannabis company in terms of fundamentals."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,213 @ 21.12   This is what I have been waiting for.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm all in on APHA.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I've been holding a handful of each since the beginning of February.  Interested to see how April plays out!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve got a APHA 4/23 20.50C - given the merger would happen on 4/20 what happens to this call? Is it based on Tilray‚Äôs value after the merger or does the whole process take time to go in effect? Best to just sell prior to 4/20?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,TLRY $ APHA üöÄü§ëüöÄü§ë
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Been in on APHA since July!  66 @ 5.43.  Waiting for legalization baby!!!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have 5000 at 26!  I‚Äôm not worried.  Just impatient!
If you do the math, that‚Äôs a lot of money on the line!  üíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµ"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope you are right my options are bleeding with this sideways shit
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What happens to call options for either company after the merger assuming it happens? Just buy shares?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sometimes in an emerging industry the companies that can never get their financial house in order are still the major players 10 years later. The momentum of unearned success.

That's why I own a lil Tilray!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,If TLRY‚Äôs price isn‚Äôt $420 by 4/20.. I will be very disappointed
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,you might want to add to your DD that only  25.90% out of 100% of the shares is owned
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I am a big TLRY believer. I gotcha fam.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Great DD fam. Love the post. üçÉ
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,No way the merger is on 4/20
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,110 tlry @ 31.50 and 377 apha @16.70 ...let's see where this can go ..
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I remember when this sub did this shit with ACB for 4/20 last year and it tanked, only to fly up like a month later"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Bag holding since it was $40. Been selling ccs on this pos. Hope this blasts off!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Ill do a $50 call. Let‚Äôs go baby!!!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Enough of the ‚Äúif you look at the mathematics, APHA is a better buy‚Äù pussy shit.. WE ARE RETARDED! TLRY is the meme not APHA! 

If you‚Äôre buying APHA over TLRY you‚Äôre simply a rat. GG"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahah - moon ! ? - what the fuck you taliking about ?!? - let‚Äôs try to get close to the $39.28 I bought this useless junk at first of all before we start talking shit like that.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"NY and NM cannabis legalization has literally nothing to do with Tilray or Aphria and will not impact their topline in any way for years if ever. US Multi State Operators not only already have licenses in those states, but built out cultivation & processing facilities, and stores. US multi state operators are already roughly 2x or more the size of their Canadian peers in terms of topline revenue and EBITDA."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I own 60 APHA so by all means, TLRY up! Excited for the slingshot on 4/20. 

If anyone gives a fuck what I think, the current TLRY price is $22.38, which means if they merged right now, every APHA owner would get .8381 shares aka around $18.75 per. APHA is currently trading at $17.85, meaning it has 90 cents or 5% of difference to make up and likely will by merger. 

Either way, both stonks going up makes me happy."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"1250 shares of APHA with 20 Calls at $15 strike for October. Been bleeding like crazy the past two weeks, but we‚Äôre just refueling for the moon mission. The moon wants to get HIGH"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You are not alone in your thought train! I bought in @ 24.8 almost a month ago and even through the dip I am holding in preparation for legalization!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Let's get weird.  I'm in!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Deja vu anybody?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Weed and GME. Name a better combo.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm torn between buying weed and buying weed stocks, guess I'll split 50-50 lol"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh hey you guys are finally back! Cool now support the shit out of Tilray and Aphria please because this train is only going up over the coming years. Yes, years. You could sell post merger but you‚Äôd be an idiot I think."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,100 @ 22.30 Let's go!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Going in. I better see you guys on fucking Pluto
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Im holding TLRY since last year Im currently around -13% still hdling it
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Legalisation = got https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2021/03/31/new-york-legalize-recreational-marijuana/
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is cool man,can wait to see what price we get in 4/20 and if is worth to hold till ...the moon"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Uhhh.....

Y‚Äôall do know that TILRAY has no active license in ANY US state, right? 

You need to be buying CRLBF CURLF GTBIF TCNNF

For the love of god stop buying companies that have ZERO exposure to the US Market"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Love TLRY/APHA, own both, but love $MSOS more"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn't legalization and APHA merger already priced in? APHA dropped like a bitch with market and did not recover.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Medmen. Big outfit in Nyc and New Jersey. Actual store locations in NY. This one needs to be recognized. With NY on the verge of finally legalizing this has to go up.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"TLRY/APHA dont have US exposure... Dont invest if youre not willing to do any work, you will underperform over your lifetime. Go own an ETF.

Everyone who manages cannabis money or has invested in this industry longer than a few months is laughing at this thread. We are all sharing it and dying. 

Literal US companies exist, and youre buying the ones w no US licenses/revenues. You all deserve to lose money on whatever stupid fad stocks you buy into."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If TLRY hits $420.69/share on or by 4/20/2021, I will get a 1-inch by 1-inch WSB tattoo in a location of my choice on my body."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Good options bad stock?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a crap weed stock that has a daily volume greater than AMC and is only barely over a buck. Anything will be appreciated to make all chronic stocks head towards the moon.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Was hoping for a lot more dd.. Not convinced
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah it'll tank 10%
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Market cap is huge some of it is definitely priced in.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hope yall make money , but their products are just garbage"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Marijuana is c00l
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Any thoughts on Schumer on more act? He said soon
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Just put in an order 100.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I grabbed some 4/23 calls today to add to the 2000 shares I already own.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you're invested in APHA you have to think about the merger cutoff. Your shares will be transformed with a 0.8381 to 1 ratio and every fractional share will be lost. So if you own 100 APHA you will get 83 shares and lose the .81 shares leftover. This might impact your arbitrage play, especially if you don't own a ton of shares."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got a few TLRY and a few MJ ($ETFMG), to diversity. feeling good about it.  MJ has APHA and TLRY as it‚Äôs top 2 stocks plus about a dozen other weed stocks. When the market opens up it will be a race to fill it, so I like the idea of spreading it out a little"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I just put in a buy order for $420 worth of stock.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm in! 2c 4/23 @23
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"K, immediately shorting TLRY today.

(Jk, but tbh doing the opposite of WSB‚Äôs infamous DD‚Äôs usually gets you a shit ton of money hahah)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,MSOS gang where you at ? ü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶ç
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Legalyze it!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buying TLRY is a dumb move. Buying APHA is the same thing,only you get the benefit of essentially owning 1.83 TLRY stocks every time you buy 1 APHA."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You guys know that APHA and TLRY are Canadian, right?

As in, zero exposure to the US market... nothing in NY... Safe doesn't help... etc.

There are companies already operating in the US.. you haven't heard of them because they are stuck on the OTC boards until NASDAQ says its ok to join the party.

Curaleaf ($CURLF) for example has revenues higher than APHA TLRY and CGC *combined* and is already up and running in NY.

Other examples of massive USA pot companies- all bigger than the Canadians and trading at lower prices:

$TCNNF - Trulieve Cannabis
$CRLBF - Cresco Labs
$GTBIF - Green Thumb
$CCHWF - Columbia Care
$AYRWF - Ayr Wellness

Still money to be made on the APHA swings - just don't be caught holding them when the market figures out the US companies are the ones to have!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,So what should I get Apha or TLRY
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I finally got the shareholder package, all for a vote to agree to the merger."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Not to be a liberal hippy but the production of weed is terrible for the environment... Will we see regulations on this in the future?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,When do they plan to vote on the safe act ?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Most of this is probably priced in already. It's not really new news, especially the legislation part"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What are we thinking about the effect of US weed companies joining in the market once legalization moves across the US? Will there be big time competition for Tilray?

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,hempcoin (thc) to the moooooon :D
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Only two of the catalysts that you mentioned are actually catalysts for them right now... which are their earnings and the merger. there is nothing for them in the US yet and there‚Äôs a high likelihood that there won‚Äôt be anything because the US legislators are focusing on social equity components right now and that does not bode well for foreign entities coming into the United States. If the legislatures are worried about social equity components with minority groups within the country it makes it even less likely that they‚Äôre going to allow big foreign weed companies to come in and take over. Even if they are allowed to come in wouldn‚Äôt it be a better option to buy the operators that already have a presence there?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,#gme forever
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,STAY THE FUCK AWAY FRIM MY WEED STOCKS YOU DEGENERATES. WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAOPENED LAST TIME YOU FUCKRD WITH TILRAY
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Until this week I was in APHA at 3.45 share, but now I'm at 13.40 average.

I'm hoping to buy nothing fun with my profits cause I live in the Bible Belt."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Your wife‚Äôs bf is getting a fucking lambo
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I've got a crap ton of APHA
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just thought I would put this out here incase someone is interested.  If you are in with TLRY and APHA you might want to check out BUD.  according to this website [here](https://investingnews.com/daily/cannabis-investing/american-cannabis-stocks/) BUD has a deal with TLRY for beverage infusions. The price also dipped because of covid.  But, it has a good price history.  It also might be a more secure investment than TLRY/APHA because it does not rely on Weed entirely.

But, as always do your own DD and stay out of my cage."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Riding the rocket until legalized nationally, then dumps in half because the legislation isn't friendly enough to cannabis companies lol. Look what happened in Canada after legalization"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,literally!!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs up to congress...
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Biden and Kamala have been flip flopping so much in all their issues, but the Georgia thing was huge in January. With dems in possession of house and senate I really do believe shit will be done very soon. Even fucking Bernie posted his support after NY passed today on Twitter"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,At some inflection point it will be comical that the majority of states have passed medical and recreational and will force the Federal government's hand.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I want hit that Hopium hard too but I fear that he won‚Äôt, considering the recent firings in the White House‚Äô staff for some staffer having had smoked weed before."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah this is massive, New York is a big deal."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"tilray or aphria, you're good in either if you want to hold beyond the merger. If you want to take advantage of a huge run before the merger, tilray is your best bet."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy Aphria.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"SNDL

lol"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,These dips are gifts. We are right above the ascending wedge. Wish I could post picture of the chart on Reddit
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I got in 300 @$22.03 just before close. I was flip flopping between TLRY and BB. TLRY had the better possibility of good news... very happy with that choice.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This might be a good move.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Aphria share price is harder to move. What I am talking about is taking advantage of a huge 4/20 rally. At the end of the day, your aphria shares will convert to less tilray shares once merger goes through, and they will probably be the at the optimal ratio required by merger date to even take advantage of it"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe, but if the price of APHA is more than .838 the price of TLRY at merger, then not so much. It makes most sense to own both. More of TLRY and a bit of APHA to possibly take advantage of the arbitrage which has been shrinking steadily. Owning APHA is riskier than just owning TLRY, but per usual also comes with the possibility of built in arbitrage gains.

So.... own the horse TLRY, and bet on the race APHA.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,i like that number
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It also ironically seems to convert pretty damn close to a whole number, coincidence?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,how high is it expected to go lol
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Your call becomes worth 84 shares and probably has some decreased liquidity.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Sir we are retarded
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Elaborate more pls? I would love to add as much as I can to the post. All i see is 14% Inst ownership, 144M share float out of 171 shares outstanding???"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What does this mean. Sorry I‚Äôm an idiot
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,thanks!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,4/20 is the proposed merger date. Go to r/thecannalysts and search for the post with the Aphria CFO
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,So wait until 5/20? Got it
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for your service
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay üòÇ well thanks ahead of time for making the gap between Tilray and Aphria larger because once the merger happens my Aphria stocks will convert to .83 Tilray shares. Last time these two stocks blasted off, at their height, Aphria reached $26.30 and Tilray reached $63.91. That‚Äôs like buying something with paying taxes but then they pay you back nearly 3 times over."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,The is the fucking way!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I getting there too soon ..
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's a shame you can't post dd on msos on WSB as they're all otc stocks. Obviously they're all better value in terms of P/S, with greater margins, greater profitibality, greater growth than LPs, but just no institutional exposure (with the big catalyst being SAFE act, that this guy thinks will effect lps for some reason)."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"LPs are going to have a hard time entering the market because let‚Äôs be honest, LPs are cash poor. What $ are they going to pull out that will gain them a major footing in the space? lol"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,fact this got downvoted is so sad lol
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Tilray‚Äôs price will still jump with any news of US legalization... but whether or not is stable and long term growth is another story.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,but a 0.2 fucking div/yield
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nope. Not priced in. We have been getting nothing but good news these past three months. From Biden winning to both chairs of congress being democrat, new states legalizing, Mexico legalizing, partnerships, etc. 

If anything this dip has reopened this opportunity. 

And with the meme culture we are in (4/20) and Tilrays small share float and inevitable increasing short float as price increases, this is a perfect stock for an actual short squeeze."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. And go look at how the ""4/20 RUN FOR ACB"" thing worked out last year. Then they all finally dumped and it tripled in price"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Bankrupt..... holy hell this thread is terrible. You suggest MMEN?!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, Medmen is just a shit company. At this point just needs a buyout, and they know it. Past leadership just destroyed that company"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Medmen sold off their N.Y. ops
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Curaleaf as well. 

These fools have no idea who the big players even are in the us. There's us medical dispensaries waiting to just open the doors. Apha has to build the doors before they can even start to catch-up."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"My thoughts exactly. NY is not officially done yet, announcement either today or tomorrow! 

Huge market right there. 

Already have CA as well. It‚Äôs only a matter of time"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What does have us exposure?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Canadian cannabis stocks are the only cannabis stocks listed on the Nasdaq/ nye exchanges. Thus they have the biggest upside of a run because of that retail exposure and also they will buy out US MSO‚Äôs anyways since they have the money to.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Wrong
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Apha sells Broken Coast which imo is among the best legal weed out there.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I never use the stuff lol, and don't care for it but buying TLRY might still get me to the moon!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve been monitoring for the past few weeks. It‚Äôs been sitting pretty steady where it‚Äôs at, and we are back up to pre-Covid levels. Even if you came away with some profit from shorting it, it would be very small."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,100%. Correct
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"No it wouldn‚Äôt be a bad idea because if the operators want to scale, partnering or allowing acquisitions to occur would benefit them in the long run. TLRY is playing the long game and I can see operators hoping on board"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Which is exactly what he wanted.  I will tell him when they get done fucking.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"APHA or TLRY, we all going to Valhalla bro.  I‚Äôll see you there"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,If you are buying shares it mathematically makes sense to buy apha. The conversion rate in the all stock merger is for every apha share you have you get .83 tlry. You do the math on current share prices...
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same congress controlled by Democrats?   It‚Äôll pass, literally."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,When was Bernie ever against legal weed?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, I agree.   I think the Feds recognize this (finally) and get on board soon.   My bet is within this year some legit, serious federal legalization traction gets going."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,If you read the actual reporting on those issues it was NOT just smoking weed. There were more issues beside just that.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What happens when/if they merge? Will one stock be affected differently than the other?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You may actually get better value from APHA if your buying now and planning on holding beyond merger. But it‚Äôs pretty close
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Surely sndl will go up as well as other weed stocks.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I grabbed some at $21.66 and a buddy got some today at $21.25.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Good price!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not trying to start an argument as I am truly trying to make sense of this rationale but your statement seems contradictory. If APHA is harder to move and TLRY jumps, yes I would be getting less shares after the merger but I'd make way more money from holding APHA and getting the merger price."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"420 of apha, ogi, and fire.  i not only am a shareholder i am also a customer"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Appreciate the explanation!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Higher supply means the price won‚Äôt jump as much, theoretically.

Low supply means the price could moon at any moment with a jump in demand."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs the little things
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You dont know how to value companies.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,lol yeah ok
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,U.S. companies. The MSOS etf is the basket. Curaleaf/Green Thumb/Trulieve/Cresco/Terrascend/Columbia Care/etc.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok if this is your thesis (dumb as fuck btw) surely you want SAFE banking act to fail then? Which canadian company has the money to buy a top us mso? Talking about the top 5 msos
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,lol dude this is such a bad take its sad. How exactly are they going to buy the MSOs? Lol
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,They absolutely do not have the money to buy out the big MSOs. Curaleaf‚Äôs market cap is 10 billion lol
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe not me, in on TLRY @ $50 üòï"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"For now. I bet that will even out closer to 4/20

.8381"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"BUT don't forget to buy as close to the conversion rate as you can because it will get rounded down to the nearest whole TLRY share, so if you had 50 APHA shares you'd get 41.905 TLRY shares which gets rounded down to 41 TLRY shares, essentially losing you a whole share. You might as well sell an APHA share and hold 49 for the conversion to get 41.0669 which also becomes 41 TLRY shares. So either buy more or sell a few as the price gets more stabilized near the merger date to get closer to a whole share conversion."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"On or close to merger, apha will be at the 80% mark of tlry.  Question will be if tlry will drop to match that value or if apha will climb to get to that ratio."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"No worries. 

What I am talking in this post is trading the momentum of the 4/20 merger in culmination of all the catalysts. 

If you want to hold it for years. Sure, buy APHA. But at the end of the day, before merger, the prices of these two will get closer because wallstreet won‚Äôt let a loophole like that happen (market inefficiency), algos will close the gap 

Because tilray has the shorter float and higher short float, it will be easier to run higher, that‚Äôs why I see tilray as the better choice, but that‚Äôs just my opinion"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought I was the only one. üò≠
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, those shares prices will likely track at almost that exact ratio due to high frequency trading and algorithms. (This is speculation, I have not observed a merger arbitrage situation before, so grain of salt)

That being said at time of posting my statement is correct, apha has to rise or tilray has to fall to remove the merger arbitrage opportunity."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are fundamentally failing to understand merger arbitrage. If you believe tlry will moon, then apha is the play. Apha is the play whichever way you go because it's merge value at current price is less than their converted tlry value. 

Read a fkin book man this is hard to watch."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"IMO......This should have more upvotes......APHA might offer a few extra % points.....maybe....but it also could possibly cost someone a few % points with the .838 merger.

What you have stated is just reality. That's how I've seen most of these mergers go as well. Market tends to sort out the arbitrage gain to minimal if any.

IMO Tilray is the safe bet, with room to run just like you said, per float and outstanding shares. If someone wants to gamble some, sure buy a few APHA shares for possible arbitrage, but TLRY is the sure way for the near termüí•.

Plus....if someone wanted to gain arbitrage, they would want Tilray to make a big run now and breakout, so that there is a better chance of there being some arbitrage left.

I'm buying both, but a lot more TLRY like 5 times++ as much.

ü¶çü¶ç We're just two random apes with a similar opinion on TLRY. lol"

If Cannabis becomes legal that makes it a lot easier to start actual work on real fully tested medical products that can be prescribed to help people get off things like opiates, big pharma I bet has a big hand in stopping an easy pass of legal weed. I guess though the bigger the cannabis industry, the easier it will be to legalize it, kind of disgusting."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"There has been support for legal pot at the federal level since before i graduated high school in 2006.

Anyone remember when Obama got elected on that premise and it *never happened, nor was mentioned again after election?*

Same when *Clinton* was elected.

They'll pass it at the federal level after all 50 states legalize it in... Idk, 2050?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why would legalization in the U.S. make a difference for a company in another country? It's already legal in Canada, and Sundial has still never made a profit. Its shares are too diluted to cause any demand/supply imbalance that would drive the price up significantly.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Right? I‚Äôm getting a lot of responses calling me dumb and that APHA is the better play bc arbitrage but what will likely happen is algos will make the ratios almost equal right before merger so it won‚Äôt be that much of a difference
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Uk here so no idea on federal stuff. So US is better but you can't invest in it? Ook?

The question is who has the deeper pockets and that has historically been big pharma, but old guards and winds they be a changing maties.

Also......recently Motley and others have been pushing to short TLRY heading into merger as a safe bet, so I'd be willing to bet the short interest may be higher than reported, as those articles have been pretty recent.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Because many of these companies  service other countries. Maybe the companies will be symbiotic where when one succeeds the others will.

2021-03-31 05:04:49,wallstreetbets,"My thoughts on BB ER Will cross post to r/bb_stock.


I'm the one that originally posted BB DD back in November a week prior to aws announcement, in that thread, I predicted a eoy pt of 12-18, I still stand by that. 


215m rev, expected 245.


BB's downfall has always been lack of revenue growth, and the reaction matched the results.

**However let's dig a bit deeper.**

They said that they're currently in the process of selling a large portfolio of **messaging** and communication patent profile, to a **north american** buyer

And hence under that stipulation, they stated that they were unable to generate revenue using those patents. That explains why they missed.


2. I did not expect a settlement from Facebook, however I do think this buyer could be Facebook, it would make sense if you look at the lawsuits that occurred between Facebook and BB, one of them was the ability to switch from having games inlay in a messenger ( FB messenger) which BB won. 


3. Expecting 9-15% GAAP growth in cyber sec, yes this isn't as much growth as CRWD but BB is worth 4-5b vs 40b for crwd.


They mentioned USPS, looking forward to more details about that. 


Notes:
I think even the fact they mentioned the patent sale on ER would indicate that they're in very advanced talks, or they would lose their negotiating power. 

The patent was said to be a lump payment + tail of multiple years which is amazing.

Ivy partnerships will be announced later this year and be in cars by 2022, I already predicted this but a confirmation is nice.


Overall this quarter also saw one less competitor in McAfee

They're also putting more of an initiative in marketing and brand awareness. 



They have 800m in cash, 800-900m in revenue, valued at 4-6b. With potential for explosion via IVY and more cyber sec growth in the coming years.



I think there will be more negativity to come, especially from analysts that will want to flaunt their previous price targets, they will double down on that. 

I think this will present a nice buying opportunities for anyone that wants in the coming days.


Edit:

**Things changed from ivy when it was sitting at $7-8 announcement in December:**

*Autonomous charging patent(huge)*

Baidu confirmation of partnership

Ivy news and fund of 50million

Huawei patent sale, worth?

Confirmation of sale of bigger patent

 Some new customers(including
 subsidiary of Volkswagen & Sony) for qnx and     athoc

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Down almost a dollar a share since open.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol I hope they are in advanced talks. Chen and co. may be bad but if they were messing with IP revenue because they had somebody with a slight interest in them I'd be pretty pissed. They still probably would have missed revenue with the licensing but it would have been better. I don't have much hope for USPS as a customer. Next time the Republican party gets into power they'll slash funding again some how. Don't get their hate for it but is a reoccurring theme. Also like the 4th or 5th marketing team under Chen so I'd be cautious of that as well. Overall still massive potential. Can't figure out if it's leadership or simply the market not being ready for what BB has on offer. Will hold my 400 shares and possibly add if price gets cheap enough and shows some strength.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"don't let revenue loss fool you. 
I believe BB will continue to go up after all the bad reps because it can still maintain its eps which is more important than revenue for shareholders. In other words, despite loss in Revenue ""To an average person, a company's gross¬†revenue¬†is the barometer for success, but as a smart stock market investor, you have to drill down even further with your fundamental analysis when considering buying (or selling) a stock, and that leads you to the¬†most important¬†metric of all,¬†earnings per share¬†(EPS)."" Like Mr. Chen said when pandemic problems improves so will BB revenue - give it a few more quarters to mid 2022 year BB should have better tractions. At least give BB a chance to roll out its IVY to win OEM and earning. I'm extremely optimistic and can't say how much excited I am.

2021-03-31 04:06:15,wallstreetbets,"Supercycles - one possibly upcoming Supercycle - a term which is gaining popularity these days, applies to commodities . Basically what happens is surge in demand, which current supply struggles to cover, causes prices to sky-rocket from being under-valued to highly over-valued.
In my opinion some coin and its' four-year cycle is the best example. The main event of the cycle is halving (halving the rewards of mining the coin ), which is causing supply-shock and aftermath in the form of speculative bubble.

I strongly believe we are about to see a supercycle in Uranium in the following years. Spot price of that commodity is right now under-valued to such an extent Cameco ( one of its largest global providers) is buying it from the spot market in order to meet the contracts and keeping some of its mines closed (waiting for the prices to rise). Currently there are about 440 active nuclear reactors and 50 being constructed (more than 10% of the actual number) mainly in China and India (respectively 16 and 6 as of March 2021). Interesting pair, isn't it? If the rest of the world does not want to stay behind they will have no choice but to follow that direction.
Nuclear energy is not opponent of wind and solar energy. It is their carbon-free companion versus the coal.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the info. I had a quick look at the financials and the last 3 years are showing a falling top line and GP which does not bode well unless this is a turnaround story. So I also looked at uranium prices here:

https://www.cameco.com/invest/markets/uranium-price

It appears margins have worsened for Cameco while prices decreased so it doesn't look so good. Either I'm not understanding the play here or I have missed something..?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, I am going to say how can this happen?

It take YEARS to build a new nuke plant, many existing are slated for closure without a replacement.

So, just how is there going to be increased demand for uranium? 


Now, look, I WISH we had way more nuclear power. It is far better for the environment than fossil fuels, wind turbines and solar panels. And, sometimes you get a free nature preserve out of it.

But I just don't see how demand will pickup without a mass building spree of plants, which is a decade away at best."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Nuclear engineer here. The great You ess of A will never regain its world leadership in nuclear power. (Not to be confused with nuclear power üí£) Too political. Developing countries will lead the way as construction costs come down with an increase in plants being built. Aside from Australia a lot of those countries are where the uranium (also Uranus) is coming from anyway.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's a sub called r/UraniumSqueeze

For those who doubt. Check the '07 market where a flooded mine caused a full blown bull market sending the worse U stock 22x. This setup is so much greater. We have increased demand, less supply, fewer long term contracts, carry trades instead of LT who scooped up all supply after Fukushima in '11, now that's not much left. We got mining companies buying their own product from the spot market so there's nothing left for utilities. Mines are closed, like 8 of the 10 largest and won't start producing untill 40-55 $/lb.  

I'm 90% uranium stocks atm so heavily biased, it's a long term play at least 2/3 years to see the real fireworks. Do your own DD and check some of Mike Alkin interviews.

As marketing ramps and their full suite of integrated products is on display, they expect double digit growth in the back half of the year.  

Note: COVID particularly affects BB's cyber suite as it is geared toward large governments and enterprises, not small business or consumer.  This requires a long sales period and benefits from in person engagement to secure customers."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,A lower stock price makes it easier for small retail investors to pile on. It's less scary to buy and hold a $20 share than a $200 share.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lower barrier of entry for people that don't get to trade fractional shares and a psychological effect on pricing. Much easier to say ""Why not throw $20 at it"" and we've seen stocks do a split and then grow tremendously because of this. TSLA was overvalued at $900, it then split 4(?) ways and went back to $800. Lower number on screen make ape buy more!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Because some old bagel eating boomer told them thats what they want
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I think it‚Äôs so people get more shares but yeah I guess fractional shares are almost the same thing
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt think they completely understand how splits work. The value remains the same, and new people can buy in at what looks like a smaller price. But there are also 10x more shares, so in the end there really is no difference"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,1:10 split would hurt the shorts a lot. Right now with a $1 up move they owe another $1.  Post split they would owe $10 with a $1 move. It‚Äôs psychologically cheaper for more retail buyers to buy more shares or perhaps a full share.  Pressures from gamma would be increase as well.  It would be the hammer to the shorts.

2021-03-31 03:03:05,wallstreetbets,Doubling down on RKT when it was on sale today 
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,The sale that never ends
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Why does this thing keep going on sale? There's like a special every week.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Your portfolio diversity is broken. It‚Äôs supposed to say 100%
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Good luck!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,The force is strong in this one.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Your folio is partially RKT
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Got 26.89 calls and 24.89 calls for 4/16
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just out of curiosity, what do y'all see in RKT? It's been mostly level around $23-$24 for a year, with the exception being that one day spike at the beginning of March. Trying to learn why this seems to be so popular on this sub."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Good ape. Him do well.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Smart ape
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Anything under 24 is a goddamn steal
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Why are you still on Robinhood though? Like everyone on this sub should know to get out of there
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm at exactly half your position. Cost avg almost same too
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol never ending sale meme stonk
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,LOL
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You are right! Got to sell my ETF and go all in on RKT. Go fully retarded and smooth brained
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Other half is in an ETF. Deciding whether or not to go fully retarded
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are multiple points that stick out on RKT. The first is the CEO, Jay Farner. He is a driven and out spoken CEO who truly cares about his company. He has publicly warned against anyone who is taking a short position against RKT. Many other reason why I like him, but that is mainly opinions so I will leave it up to you whether you agree with me or not. 

Second, and more importantly is the diversification of RKT as a company. They have been buying stakes in app development companies and actively developing better platforms for subsidiary companies of RKT to use in both the home mortgage and car loan markets. This is why a lot of people are make the arguments how RKT is on the way to be classifieds a Fin Tech company. They are actively try to develop an app to directly compete with the app platform Zillow (another plus). This would allow RKT to have a stake in the entire process of buying a home (searching/research, acquiring a loan, purchasing and closing). 

Thirdly, RKT has announced and gotten approved a 1 billion dollar share buy back last Nov (which has not taken place yet). This would decrease the share float and could trigger a short squeeze If there is a large enough percentage of the float shorted (haven‚Äôt checked the most recent numbers). 

Finally, RKT‚Äôs have been blowing earning out of the water. Interest rate will most likely remain low and the most active time for home to be bought and sold is during the spring and summer months, which will most likely increase earning evening more for the Q1. 

These are a few of the reasons why I am buy RKT for the long terms I also like the stock so that too... hope this helps!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its a modified YOLO.  Often times I've seen bio-tech stocks spike then drop back to their pre spike price.  Then, afterwards there will be another spike, as institutions get into it.  Or, nothing, and the stock will continue the downtrend from the spike.    


RKT has shown buying pressure supporting the pre-spike gap of around 22.50 +- 50c.  IMO, assuming no Covid-type risk-off market, the downside is a low of \~18.  The upside is a squeeze above $40-45.  


Ultimately, the play is against rising yields and the number of refis.  If rates continue to rise, despite the feds push for lower rates, RKT will see less refis and will drop in price, relative to it's revenues.  If rates drop, due to either fed reserve yield control curve or just the market rising to ATH's again, the price of RKT should rise.  


Again, IMO, betting on RKT is betting that TLT (and other bond funds) will rise in price, due to either YCC (yield control curve) by the fed, or by the natural function of stocks always going up, and bond yields will continue to decline.  


As for a refi.  I'm waiting til bond yields go negative.  And then, I'll refinance.  Using RKT's app."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It could be the next meme stock
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed! Going to keep buying to average down
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,RKTs fair value is around $60 - $65 even without squeeze potential. This company is a banger
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Would you mind posting a source on this?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I know I have been putting it off. I will do a share transfer to fidelity at some point when they update their app interface.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice! Nice to know there are fellow apes out there!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lets look at the 1 year chart on both stocks


Gme: $3.5 to $195

Rkt: $20 to $23.27


What a dumbass lol"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Why say stupid shit without providing any reasoning?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,If your decide to go full retard I'd suggest buying CSP with a strike close to the share price on red days. It's a solid way to lower your cost basis right from the start.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You son of a bitch, I'm in."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bullish on RKT, definitely a long term value play."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Pays a dividend too.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure that‚Äôs a bot
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,fintel $ yahoo
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You gon be waitin
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs funny. When you look at the first year when GME went public it looked pretty flat as well... GME is not even a close comparison in terms of looking at how the stock has performed over the last year. RKT has only been public for 7 months. What‚Äôs actually comparable is how the shorts are manipulating the shit out of RKT just as they did with GME, which I‚Äôm sure is part of the reason you got interested in GME. Just food for thought, from one dumbass to another."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Got ‚Äòem
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,For sure.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,If you truly believe that then you would be buying puts because it would be easy money.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Not gonna do that shit on highly volatile shit.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol so you think it will go up then? Because if you‚Äôre so sure in your analysis you‚Äôre leaving free money on the table if you aren‚Äôt buying puts
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"So you're only gonna buy options where there's no volatility? That doesn't seem to be a very profitable strategy to me, in all honesty.
I could be wrong though... So, how do you make money on options when there's little to no volatility?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It can be highly profitable to buy options at low volatility if there is an event causing high volatility that happens after you buy.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt buy many options, but I‚Äôm not going to touch meme stock ones with super high volatility. Have you seen the price on GME options? I can do my actual gambling on Bovada"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I... Guess it is! Yep, that 'll probably work.
How do I did out about such volatility-introducing events beforehand? Crystal ball? Tea leaves?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,And here I thought \*this\* was a casino...

Yea this is what most people tend to not understand when they're first looking into joining thetagang, and it tends to turn people off. 
 People want big gains and fast. But small consistent gains will outpace most retail traders, and if you're doing it with stocks you already want to be owning anyway - it's just adding a bit more to the value of holding it anyway"

Edit- like say you sell 1 contract of something and the premium is $1 a share. When you write a covered call and it goes through, you will have $100 added to your account that you can use for whatever you want if you wanna buy shares with it or whatever. Or just check your order history and it will the you if your covered call processed. I‚Äôm on TDA so I‚Äôm not familiar with how etrade exactly looks and works"

In other words, despite loss in Revenue ""To an average person, a company's gross¬†revenue¬†is the barometer for success, but as a smart stock market investor, you have to drill down even further with your fundamental analysis when considering buying (or selling) a stock, and that leads you to the¬†most important¬†metric of all,¬†earnings per share¬†(EPS)."" Like Mr. Chen said when pandemic problems improves so will BB revenue - give it a few more quarters to mid 2022 year BB should have better tractions. At least give BB a chance to roll out its IVY to win OEM and earning. I'm extremely optimistic and can't say how much excited I am. Trust me most companies do not make in this pandemic anyway, revenue or eps are compromised."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd hope not. They signed a couple hundred million $ debenture contract in September. You gotta leave some room between dilutions.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel the same way but at this rate I'd be better off dumping it and buying more GME and then buying more BB next month when it's even cheaper lol
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol long-term. You sound like the guy in 2009 who bought at $50 after dropping from $140.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I think I was just angry yesterday. The DD remains the same. I will buy this dip
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fair concerns, however, I'll say that revenue doesn't necessarily tell the whole story. That aside, like i said if I don't see significant traction gained by the end of the year (calendar) then I'll start to worry. I think they have some great things cooking right now that require more than a short term perspective.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Around $6. So a 20% haircut from here and I'll probably add a bit.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I get that. If I I sell $10 covered calls 2 weeks out, it will probably go up to $10.09/share and I‚Äôll have to sell.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ya, it'll be choppy for a bit. Hit the first level I was looking at. Next is $7.50ish then $6. See if it bounces off any of those."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nobody will exercise a call for .09 X 100 potential profit and risk that other call exercisers had the same idea.. That is why options get pinned at expiration.  If it goes too high, someone exercises and sells, which drops the price.   Don't worry about it, very very few of the pinned options get exercised."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably pulling numbers out of thin air but in that particular example, buy to close for the .09 (or whatever it ends up right before EOD). You should still finish up and you avoid getting called away.

That being said, I hear you about selling strikes below your cost basis.  I'm in the same boat and it's scary af."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"i mean whats the deal if you have to sell at $10 and the price is $10.09 just buy the shares back right after and continue selling calls. You dont actually have more shares / money in your account than what the actual price is, no matter what your current purchase average shows lol."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hold on tight! If it could go up $10 over night, down $3 today shouldn‚Äôt be a worry. Ride thru it"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Why?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,RC isn‚Äôt even the CEO anymore... you belong here like the rest of us.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Called up RC to let him know.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,He cancelled a recurring order and explained his pet had died. (He‚Äôs talked about this on the GME megathread before.)
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I had Autoship set up. Told them to cancel for the greenies and dog food while disclosing the news my dogs has passed. They do keep a list of pet names when they email to you, so I was surprised they mentioned my puppers names when they asked for customer feedback. Apparently they also love collecting pet photos."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,they have shares in PLTR
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Microchips in customer's pets
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's funny, I wouldn't be surprised if they had a system like that just to fill that customer service feature. But nonetheless its still a nice plus on the customer side."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,My point is that he put together the company in the first place. Mostly a meme because I'm rock hard for Ryan Cohen.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,a play so retarded he makes money when he should lose it
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I read an article a couple hours ago that used this little comment here and the one above it.   I‚Äôll see if I can find it.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably not. Chewy‚Äôs growth and profitability is on another level. They‚Äôve literally dominated their market. GME has to up their game bigly by offering unique incentives to customers if they want any chance at real growth.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Best buy has also almost gone bankrupt a few times and has much higher cost.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"i like my dog

my dog likes the stock

hence, i like the stock"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol. Nice
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn‚Äôt GameStop brick and mortar retail & chewy is online retail???
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Who the fuck is dumping. Huge volume was sold
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Thoughts on $PLAY yolo? Just read on seeking alpha Wells Fargo telling investors be wary. Which means it‚Äôs a definite buy.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You have been reading the stories about what is like to work for AMAZON? Chewy is like that but without all the groovy benefits.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,My God I would literally cry and keep buying the food just to support their business. That would make me tell all my friends to start shopping there
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea. Turns out I don‚Äôt like a stock that is trading on the fundamentals. Fundamentals are for railroad tycoons. Me want moon
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Same here
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I used to work in animal care and you are severely underestimating the spending power of lonely old people who have 30 cats and 10 dogs because their grandkids dont come visit them

It's an industry that's been absolutely booming, especially since younger generations seem to be having kids less and treating pets like children. Which means spending LOTS of money on fancy specialty toys, clothes and other novelty accessories, specialty treats, raw whole diets that cost more a month than you or I probably spend on groceries, etc etc

and edit to add: I feel that while yes Chewy and Gamestop are both companies that operate their own marketplaces within a specific industry, unless Gamestop can REALLY change their game plan and step up, Chewy will be on top. There are a ton of gamers as well as pet owners, but honestly Gamestop just isnt where most people buy their games or consoles anymore. But with Chewy, they were easily the biggest name in the online pet supply game, even to the extent most vets Ive worked with had some kind of professional partnership or promotion with them. That's HUGE, especially when it comes to them getting the prescription food orders. And they are owned by PetSmart now, and they are one of the two biggest retail pet chains in the country. Plus with the pandemic people are adopting pets more than ever, which means buying more pet supplies than ever

that being said, Im still salty over Ryan Cohn selling out to PetSmart and havent used it since, so I could definitely be biased"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure, I'm not a dog."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Additionally, if you receive pet food you don't want/need/w.e, they will ask yo uto donate it to a shelter rather than send it back. And they refund you"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"They also send personalized, handwritten birthday cards on your pet‚Äôs birthdays. They‚Äôre the best."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Can I interest you on my good friend Jimmy? (GME)
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"> that being said, Im still salty over Ryan Cohn selling out to PetSmart and havent used it since, so I could definitely be biased

This is the bit that has me worried about Chewys future. Their moat in the SEC filings is basically ""we provide amazing customer service"" and actually lived up to that. With Cohen & co gone, and being owned by a generic corporation I'm not sure if that'll continue."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean they broke even during this pandemic and increasing online sales by 300%, idk what else you want. They‚Äôve got like 2 or 3 Amazon Wiz-kids and 5 or 6 Chewy hot-shots, they‚Äôve literally got the Dream-Team. If they‚Äôre gonna do anything huge, they‚Äôve got the people to do it. AND the publicity."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,FUCKIN LOL
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Please confirm you are also not a cat.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep! I can confirm. I cancelled an order and had them place the same order with the holiday discounts. They refunded me the first order but both orders came in so I had double. I asked them what's the process to returning them so it's not like I'm stealing their stuff. they responded it would be better to donate then to a local shelter. Made me do research on shelters too, which I should've done but haven't if it weren't for that incident"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"> donate it to a shelter 

Makes a ton of sense.  You're already in a mindset when you head down to the shelter.  Odds are probably better than 0% that a number of these ""just dropping off some extra food"" trips turn into ""new doggo"" and thus continued customer."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"They'll refund you no questions asked for virtually any pet related item. I like chewy too, but they're just like amazon - pet products can't be returned because they have a high chance of coming in contact with animals, and the warehouses that receive returns can't deal with potential contamination of fleas/ticks/etc.

Please don't abuse this though!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,More like Gimmy that banana
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah, I remember when the buy out first happened a few years ago, there was quite a rock in the companion animal boat. well, certain parts of it

I think out of most of the pet food companies that cut ties with them over it, losing brands like Orijin and Acana are the ones that some people were the most bothered about. likely because brands like them are specifically known for only selling through retailers that meet their certain quality and ethical standards, so losing them made a certain groups of pet owners lose trust in Chewy over all. I know several of my coworkers in the kennel along with myself stopped using them mostly because PetSmart's a pretty shitty company, from breed banning to selling sick animals to getting supply from breeding mills. And Petco honestly isnt better by a whole lot, but at least they stopped selling shock collars while PetSmart refused to

HOWEVER, it ultimately comes down to what direction Gamestop is going to go in to determine which would come out on top, but I still think it'll be Chewy. While I did talk about brands and owners leaving the service, it's not the MAJORITY of owners, or even a large amount. It's probably only like <5% of customers that are very passionate about the commentary and morals around it, like a niche community within the pet industry. Most owners are just happy they can have pet food automatically bought and sent to them every month and dont need to leave the house to get their dog some new toys. for every one unhappy person, there's at least a thousand customers who are still shopping as usual. they've been doing extremely well since 2017 already"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"They were one of the businesses that benefited from stay at home.  That's also why online sales skyrocketed for them.  Look at Macy's,  they had 40% of their revenue from online,  but the majority of it was for curbside pickup."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,">just too easy buying the games straight off the respected console

And also too expensive, the leasing part is nice but in the end not everyone has the money to buy everything new off the shelves, GameStop is still biggest in second hand and for the people for whom games and their new prices are still a luxury to afford there is an ongoing and huge market for second hand. You just can't sell a download linked to your account and creditcard neither take it to use at someone else's console.

I believe GameStop with their monopoly with big vendors in gaming industry for being only seller of certain titles, with their experienced team of people who want to work at GameStop and with RH and transition into digital market (like recent introduced [2 hour delivery](https://i.redd.it/f4g99q2zn9q61.jpg)) have great potential to increase their current market cap even above current price"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh but digital download, Amazon, steam, all those reasons gamestop is the next BloCkBusTER? Those reasons wouldn‚Äôt just go away because of the pandemic. The company is shifting, and with nearly no debt, a literal dream team of business geniuses, and publicity of Wall Street, they‚Äôre gonna be big."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Except they can‚Äôt create that app unless a bunch of rules change and Sony / ms wants to lose revenue.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm not saying they'll fail. I'm just saying wall street is going to make them prove they can do it before letting them fly. Shifting to online is moving into a much more competitive space than they had in brick and mortar.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Microsoft already provides Gamestop revenues from downloads without creating an app. Microsoft wants to lose revenue:

https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/microsoft-will-give-gamestop-a-share-of-xboxs-digital-revenues/"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think there's a self-fulfilling prophecy aspect of it as well. With the eyes of media, wall street and retail watching, most of the board members starting fresh and not chained to old ideals, knowing they have something to prove... it would be hard to imagine a company with a more motivated executive team right now"
2021-03-31 01:23:49,wallstreetbets,WSB discussion so far today

Institutions are gobbling up shares the last 3 months. And yes, massive potential to to pressure shorts. Morningstar was reporting 40%ish of the shares shorted.

All cards on the table, they are unlocking 15,000,000 shares that were locked down since its IPO today.  But with the massive buying pressure, I don't know if there is going to be a rush for holders to sell them.  It would asbolutely be in their best interest to hold with how much pressure is building.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This was hours ago so I'm not going to be 100% accurate word for word on what they wrote. 

The gist was they were saying posts about amc were getting deleted. So they were calling the post fake news.

And my reply was that this was for the daily discussions and market threads. Not for posts. So that would make their comment fake news right? 

I should've asked what they meant about amc posts getting deleted though."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I love the two finger salute they gave analysts
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,GME should drop 10% today but is not doing that and i like it.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Best rollercoaster ever. Canada‚Äôs Wonderland doesn‚Äôt hold a candle to GME.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME should keep physical stores sure but if they create an online downloadable commerce that'll be smart. Host games and media online, cut the cost of microsoft store, PlayStation store, steam, etc. Storage is cheap but eliminating those costs from the big chains would be in their interest as well to focus on technology. It'll be hard but I think it'll be in everyone's budgetary interest."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,The real question is; why everyones so pessimistic about gme
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,All the right moves are being made but this is a casino need that lucky hand!

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,They need to get some fucking series x in stock and they'll go to the moon on those sales alone
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It will still take a very very long time for GME to actually be worth the current price.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh that‚Äôs why.  I thought it was hedge funds and ladder attacks.  Thanks for clearing that up.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is absolutely no way the shorts can win now. They will be margin called and blood will spill. I'm excited for us apes but the aftermath won't be pretty for some of the HF apes.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The reason $GME is my entire $95k portfolio is because it is no longer a meme stonk. With the digital transformation underway, it is officially a growth company. Yes, the stock price has rallied significantly, but it is only a matter of time before fundamentals catch up. Just like what happened with Tesla. Tesla was always considered overpriced until suddenly it wasn‚Äôt."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Aww Isn't that nice?  They're going to orchestrate this as a HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL company whose stock value is just simply skyROCKETing due to a few good hires and higher sales. That's fine. I don't care what the tell the masses .  We'll wait while the talking heads paint the pretty picture. My price goes up as my longs go down.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Well I guess this is squeezed out. While I‚Äôm waiting for it to go back up... $AI is about to hit a short squeeze
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I don‚Äôt get all this love for GME. I like that the hedge funds got fucked over. That‚Äôs awesome. 

But if you look at the fundamentals, GME is shit tier. 

For everyone that is all diamond hands and to the moon, what the fuck does that mean? Really? 

The stock is currently at $194. What‚Äôs the fucking moon? $300? $400? What happens then? Do you hold for eternity? 

I‚Äôm nowhere close to a professional stock guy, but this thing is a $30 turd. r/WSB has done an admirable job of propping it up, but GME is the Bernie in ‚ÄúWeekend at Bernies‚Äù. 

I know I‚Äôm going to get downvoted, roasted, etc"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"if me manages to do a good business model then the company could explode, and then besides the value that comes from the shorting you could have a lot of value that comes from growth.

The GME thing has gotten mad amounts of press, ask anyone who knows about business how important advertising is. You basically can create a huge amount of profit ONLY by being known, you don't even need a good product, but it so happens that they do have good products"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Random thought that will go highly unnoticed. I think it's great lots of people made life changing money through this stock. I do dislike it saved this company. As a former employee of roughly 15 years ago, this company treats it's employees awful. Expectations to work off the clock, hiring from outside instead of promoting within because they it's cheaper, doing everything they can to prevent employees getting benefits..... Just an awful environment that ruined gaming for me and others for years."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Despite best efforts
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Well neither are longs then?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"As long as it's in this holding pattern, I'm going to buy below 175 and sell above 200. I'll keep one share in reserve as my moon ticket but there's money to be made on the volatility."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,They have to sell their subscription somehow.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"They do that with every single ticker symbol. I don‚Äôt even know if there‚Äôs a person writing those article, it seems computer generated."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've never gone out of my way to shop at gamestop. But they're placed like fast food restaurants, so it's just simply convenient to go there on my lunch break or after work to buy a new game."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"They didn't ""think"" it would die, they decided it would die. That's how the game works. They knew how incompetent the exec team was, wouldn't be surprised if they have connections tbh. They spread the dying brick and mortar mall-based retailer narrative with the help of their media buddies. How many times did you hear ""the next Blockbuster""? Then they tried to naked short the business into Oblivion, banking on never having to return those nonexistent shares. They got caught with their dicks in the cookie jar."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"that's the argument every person i've talked to (maybe 5 people) about my position in GME.  they looked at me like i'm a fucking retard (i am), and then i adopted gorillas.  (and i will continue to adopt gorillas from space)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,But... Why? What is your long term plan? I thought the new WSB crowd was waiting for the epic short squeeze to $100000. Now you're waiting for...?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,keep going
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,My pants would implode that‚Äôs for sure

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I would like some freak flash crash to 100 again then back up to 200 but sadly ill have to hope for grabbing more at 180.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Been there. Add over time. I‚Äôm up to two shares lol
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I have the other .55 of your share. We are one ape together.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Having the potential of a short squeeze based purely on HFs short position is one thing, adding the extra pressure of retail buying based on fundamentals just adds more fuel to the fire.  

This can speed up the process due to more potential catalysts that could tip the stock price over the edge into MOASS territory, triggering the MOASS much sooner that waiting for the HFs to simply bleed out slowly over time"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Retail have bought in and anyone who has money has probably spent it. Whales are buying and running the price around somewhat but the endgame for them is unknown. As the company gets more positive press however , there is a new batch of possible investors who might know very little or anything about the squeeze or reddit, people who might invest just because Cramer says it‚Äôs good for example. This will all drive the price up which tightens the noose on the hedgies. Which in turn makes the whales possibility of triggering the squeeze cheaply much better."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I think the reason news is hyped so much is because at this point anything can trigger the catalyst. We don't knew when or how but we know it's going to happen. I just want my sweet sweet tendies.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"A price increase of 40-50x in less than a year does not happen because of a slight improvement to fundamentals. But, you do you."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Just fucking buy some shares already and stop being jealous. It's not too late to get in on this.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy some puts if you‚Äôre so sure.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Full disclosure, I own a lot of GME and I totally agree with you on what the future of gaming looks like. Physical copies are going to disappear. I don‚Äôt wanna hear all this bullshit about the sentimentality of physical copies. That‚Äôs not how GME is going to thrive.

It needs a major fucking overhaul to become a one stop shop for everything game-related like chewy is for pets. Which means way more than just games. Consoles, high end PCs, accessories, etc..."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Where does Humble and GOG add value? Why not just buy games on Steam? It's a different market place with different and perhaps deeper discounts for the customer and a different negotiated cut of profit with the publisher. 

There is also the idea of a customer loyalty network that rewards customers for buying not only digital game code but also physical media, pc parts, consoles, and peripherals.

Essentially you can think of it as a competing environment to shop in outside of Steam or the PSN/Xbox stores with more products, a physical location, and trade-ins. My guess is that customer service will be much better at Gamestop than either of those three other places. Aside from the ""2hr no questions asked refund policy on steam"" the other three stores have abysmal customer support.

On top of this ecommerce platform you *also* have 1-day delivery for dope peripherals/parts/consoles and the idea of an eventspace/pc cafe going on. As someone that hung out at cardshops and arcades a lot in my pre-teens and teenage years, people spend a fuck load of money when they're there; they want to buy a new toy and then play with it. Hell, they could even get into MTG and Pokemon events and start an ecommerce platform dedicated to these two games; trade-in programs for card games print fucking money. And the current ecommerce platforms for TCGs are not amazing by any means."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"In the UK, our major game retailer stripped out their storerooms and converted them into gaming rooms that you can book, filled with high-end equipment to host events etc. I think a lot of people expect Gamestop to do something similar. 

Also, in the latest console generation, given the choice between a physical and digital edition, gamers overwhelmingly chose a physical console, despite it being much more expensive because people know they'll save money buying disks in the long-run. 

Not to mention, many people want to buy their video games and video game merchandise from a video game store specifically, just like how many people like to buy their beauty products from a beauty store or their jewellery from a jewellery store. Especially people looking to buy gifts for a loved one. The in-store assistance and being able to visually browse your options is much better than shopping online. 

Gamestop is not Blockbuster and video games are not movies."

I started following the GME thing because I thought it was cool that a bunch of redditors fucked a hedge fund over. I don‚Äôt agree with shorting a company into bankruptcy.

Tabletop stuff would be awesome too."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"While this is true. Most of us older gamers, pc gamers, and even older console gamers buy our games, and download them online. But keep in mind kids. I have kids. Small kids who also game. And while I do download games for them a lot I also buy them physical copies. So do other family members. Grandma, and grandpa, other kids at parties. They get gift cards then use them to buy games. They buy pokemon cards. They like to buy Mario themed cases for their switch's. Hell I have bought them each 2 switch cases Mario, and Zelda. While I agree that downloading games is the future I don't think physical copies are going anywhere. Also I think a subscription based model for new and used games accessories and swag would be a cool idea for a kids gift that grandma or Grandpa would go for."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"They're already moving into the PC parts markets. There's a lot of money in that since PC gaming has exploded. I remember they used to do digital sales of PC games where it was just a drm-free download of the game.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Discs aren‚Äôt going anywhere because of the free market imo, if it‚Äôs strictly digital then the console makers can charge whatever they want and you‚Äôre screwed."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Exclusive licensed collectibles is a ripe market right now
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Discs only hold a smallish percentage of the total game download. For some of your bigger games you‚Äôre still downloading 40+ GB off disc for online play and DLC. Not to mention the constant updates on games like CoD. I think you (and others) are vastly over estimating the longevity of physical discs.  
  
On your other points, GameStop has always been selling gaming parts, accessories, merch, collectibles, etc.. why is this all the sudden going to be a game changer now?  
  
Esports is a valuable area, but GameStop making a transition into esports would basically be like Target going into esports. They have no real foundation in the esports market and it can be a tough area to get into.  
  
I think you guys are a little too caught up in the hope aspect. GameStop might make some great changes but it‚Äôs going to take quite a long time."

There's something better than my American 1Gb fiber internet? It's consistent with very little to no downtime. What is it your country has to offer?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I want to see dfv buy so many stocks he becomes majority holder. Starts stearing the ship towards VR and then essentially becomes the creator from ready player one.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks.  So when that happens, does the client have to pay the entire amount or just enough to get back under the threshold?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"We're hovering at my cost basis.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Happened last year.  It was for an April 20 2020 vote
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"According to Texas laws share, recounts starts 60 days before the Stockholders meetings. Stock holders meetings for GME usually in the first week of June. They have few weeks to collect the shares. so it's very possible that it will happen around April 16th. (DFV option expiration day)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,6
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Went from around $4.25-6.25 which at the time was huge. We are in MOAS territory now
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"They only filed for a $100M capital raise. At $200 a share that 500k shares. About a 0.7% dilution.

Mainstream media FUD."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't that be a bitch
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,That sounds like what will happen haha pay off the top guys then they sell unless they hate them.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,4/16 here too!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I think the 11th or 12th and the $2->$6 squeeze followed on the 14th as I was corrected
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"My b feb 14. Well there's 300% caused by a recount of shares, a pretty run of the mill squeeze. I believe they announced it on the 10th or 11th but my recollection of dates obviously isn't perfect. I'm just going off old DD, I don't need anything else really."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Technically yeah, just on low SI. Look at the iborrowdesk graph around there. Huge borrow fees and a price double/triple"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Supplementary Leverage Ratios.  They're calculated by taking a bank's capital and dividing it by the bank's exposure.  There was a temporary policy due to Covid of not counting treasuries and reserves in the exposure.  Starting tomorrow they will be counted in again.  Banks have to maintain a minimum ratio of .06 (6%).

Starting tomorrow the exposure gets higher (as treasuries and reserves are added back in), so banks may have to either raise capital or reduce exposure to stay above the minimum ratio.  This could have some wild runoff effects with liquidity already an issue."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"What are you talking about? What does covering have to do with exercising calls?

Also, why do you care?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"True. As chair he‚Äôs just looking after his money, checking in, saying here‚Äôs where things should be going and making sure everything stays on track. Minimal time and minimal pay, but the company should give him return on his investment. If he became CEO that‚Äôs a full-time job where he‚Äôs doing all the work and getting a great salary. He probably doesn‚Äôt need the money so to be CEO he would need to like doing the work. With the hiring that‚Äôs been going in the C-suite, changes are well underway now."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don‚Äôt like his face and he‚Äôs the first exec to leave GameStop 
If he leave by himself, why ? GameStop he‚Äôs on a turnaround and he doesn‚Äôt want to be part of it ? I don‚Äôt think he left by himself but the company asked him to leave instead of firing him and reveal how incompetent he is."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This has already been the reality for over a decade in Asian countries. Just look at PC cafes in Korea and Japan. There are countless franchises and they are a solid industry - minus during covid they were hard hit. It's also the secret sauce behind why Korea is a powerhouse for esports talent. Every kid has access to top gaming PC's and games within the comfort of their own neighborhoods. $1-$2 per hour.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I could see that as a possibility with alcohol but that‚Äôs a lot of overhead to cover otherwise. I think losing brick and mortar almost entirely is their best shot at actually thriving though.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Their best course of action for online retail imo would be to become a platform like steam or epic games, they are already known for resales. if possible they could add licenses imbeded into games that you could sell back for store credit, without the license you'd lose access to the games. then add some exclusive content to their store like add-on content or whatever, if they could manage a deal with Sony/Microsoft (which I doubt, since it adds a middle man,potentially cutting their revenues)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm also massively into the idea of them being the ones to launch E-sports as THE new actual thing. It‚Äôs been long enough, we need massive international competitions being broadcast with these cafes as support (basically think of these cafes as ‚Äòbars‚Äô) and think of e-sports as well ‚Äòsporting events‚Äô).  I also would love to see GameStop start an e-sport team roster with jerseys and players (making a big deal out of signing them, etc.).

Big name gamers as the new e-sports figures, merch out the wazoo with trading cards and such, etc."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Saw a can rack on their site the other day
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,all of a sudden
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The median American internet speed is 124 mbps. Not everyone had 1Gb. Some rural Americans don‚Äôt even have the median I just mentioned, but will still want to play games, and can either travel out and get them from a store or order them online."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Shit tell me that when I had 1.5 mbps when I was living 0.9 miles outside of the city limit.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You moron.

""Hey I got fiber over here, what's the problem for the rest of you on shit connections with data caps?"""
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol. Rich guy doesn‚Äôt know that poor people exist in his country. Typical American
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but Epic also fucked that up when they decided to poach games already set for Steam releases. Was it the fastest way to get what they needed? Yes.

But it burned a lot of potential customers and a lot of good will. I adamantly refuse to use Epic, even for the free games, because of that. And yes, I am irrational. Still holding GME shares after all ;)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs a very small scope you are looking through. EPIC has absolutely won over some of the  maker share, and personally I now use both platforms. It took a year or two of free games for that to happen but I bet with younger audiences the long term impact is much greater"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I am keeping some shares on hand too because of this lol. I kinda hope that the cc I sold tomorrow expires worthless tbh...... It's price is 195 so I could always just buy a call to even up the one I sold I guess
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Everybody holding untill the dip keeps dipping
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,When's Gensler coming in? He's absolutely not gonna bend the rules to save hedgies.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Im asking for a link instead of blindly believing it, and I have done extensive personal DD on GME"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,No i think it‚Äôs they can announce a recount 60 days before the meeting it doesn‚Äôt start 60 days beforehand
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, I think The motley fool issued an article calling on Gamestop corp that nows the perfect time to sell the shares.

Which would dilute the share, completely fuck everyone, and would sour support for their brand for decades.  If they dilute their stock right now - that would kill them as a company due to the bad press."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Do we know how much it was shorted at the time? surely its more shorted now right?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,420 by 4/20!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks homie.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Based off what happened with Archego this might‚Äôve already started to happen...
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the solid answer!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Over the last 2-3 trading days it has been 10mil avg, and 150k shares could absolutely  make a difference on low volume days like that. Some hedgies don‚Äôt even have 150k shares"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,">What are you talking about? What does covering have to do with exercising calls?

You said exercising them should do ""it"", but it does zero for anyone but DFV. The shares will be transferred to him from whoever he bought the call from when he pays them the money. That's it. 

>Also, why do you care?

I don't like people hyping dates based on nothing."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"And some of us bought a few at $350, woohoo"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait def jam fight for ny is valuable?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup. I've lived in Shanghai, China for over a decade. In fact, the first place I went to to use the internet was one of these places. I can confirm those cafes are everywhere, at least in this city, and they're usually open 24 hours. I would hope the GameStop ones are nicer but yea, employ a similar idea.

On a somewhat related note, gaming is actually a really big part of the culture here. Malls are everywhere. For example I work about 2 km from where I live. On the way to work, there are 4 malls I pass, two of which are massive.  The big ones have multiple arcades with all sorts of games from the classic pop-a-shots, to those old school fighters with a big stick and 6 buttons, to modern interactive games like SSX snowboarding or a Speed Run type game adapted from the mobile games.

Not a big point here, just think it's interesting there is a new generation of gamers being cultivated within the monster that is Chinese consumerism."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I live in the rural mountains of the Appalachians. As in it takes 45min to an hour to get the closes decent city and/or Walmart. Guess this area is an outlier when it's internet talk then.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You'll be waiting a week or so for the link. But I'd watch out for it. Maybe you can find something anticipating it but Id rather get my news from the source.

Look for the 2020 April 12 news on it and check out the charts."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,A stock split would be a nice option.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,That shelf offering was pushed through by the old board. It divided the board and helped Cohen take control (according to domocapital anyways). Not saying a share offering is off the table but the current one approved was opposed by several of the large shareholders including Cohen at the time.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,No clue
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"What happened with Archegos probably wasn't a real margin call, because Archegos probably never owned any of the positions. They owned all of them through derivatives like total return swaps on capital they actually held. The reason they were doing that is to hide their insider trading from the SEC. The SEC will have a harder time monitoring your trading if you aren't the one actually doing the trading.

How Archegoes managed to get so heavily leveraged was to back those derivatives with the same capital to multiple investment banks. It would be like taking out 20 mortgages on your house with 20 different lenders and none of them talked to each other so they didn't know you were doing that. If you'll cheat on one side, you'll cheat on the other.

What eventually probably happened was these banks got wind of what Archegos was doing and it was a breach of the contracts for those Total Return Swaps, and just started liquidating Archegos positions in block sales like the RKT block sale from MS on Monday or by just dumping the stock, like with DISCA and VIAC. They just want to be out of those positions and get theirs now before things get any worse."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Last 4 days have been 17 / 10 / 37 / 50.

I‚Äôm not trying to poopoo this but being realistic.

The real effect will be DFVs actions on or before Apr 16, starting a potential wave of purchase from others, not just his actual trades or whatever."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Is 50k shares but yeah
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,A lot

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm in the middle of a modern city my home only has a single internet provider because the way the neighorhoodnis ticked away in the city and it's hot garbage. I can't tell if you're being intentionally dense. This countries internet infastructure is hot garbage. That's why there are literal companies built around trying to solve just that.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Uhh, okie dokie. I mean, it‚Äôs a decent speed at 124mbps, but not as advanced as some other countries speeds. Plus, I would take a guess that there is a swing in the data from major metropolitan areas and suburbs. It‚Äôs the median, it doesn‚Äôt apply to everyone.

Technologies going to advance, games will get larger, what people demand will get larger, in terms of speed. And I also forgot, many internet companies are starting to implement data caps. My ISP can‚Äôt because they had a contract where they bought an older company a few years ago, and it stated that data caps couldn‚Äôt be implemented for 7 years after the buy out. But what about after?

Your rant about 4K being to much, eh? The future is now old man"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I live about the same distance from a major town. (my town has a population of 350 with no stores or gas stations) And I have what is thought to be fast internet at 25mbps.

There‚Äôs a game going on at the moment of ‚Äúpass the shit can‚Äù. DTCC don‚Äôt want to get caught holding the shit can when the hedge funds start getting margin called. Problem is that that they are so deeply in the shit, margin calling hedge funds of this size will make major rumblings in the market. ‚ÄúTo big to fail‚Äù is more than a little appropriate in this situation. 

We let them keep on trucking after 2008. Europeans cleaned up their shorting rules after VW. Hedge funds didn‚Äôt want to see those profit margins be threatened so they made damn sure that didn‚Äôt happen on Wall Street. 

Now they‚Äôre rolling up the same kind of shit they did with mortgages in just the same old style. Shits going to hit the fan this year and it‚Äôs going to hit bigger than 2008 and 2001. Calling it now.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I have personally been waiting for a full-time CFO position. There has been an interim for the month of March. A new CFO will commonly recall shares.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Id normally say yes, but with the current value on gamestop based part on merit and part on hype (similar to tesla) its tough to say if a split would result in a bump in share price post split too."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cool.

While the proposed offering isnt large, as we all know panic sets in on wall street easily, so even a small bit of news of the 100mm selling of shares would cause a fuckin stock meltdown."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,My average is $189. It‚Äôll all be worth it though. I think there are more of us that have stuck through the last few months and aren‚Äôt phased by the bs scheming. Newbs just need to believe in the cause!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"People are really looking at this the wrong way. Gamestop buying games is more like bringing in a few $5 off coupons when you buy a new game.

Can you bring in 2 or 3 old games when you buy a Game at Bestbuy or Walmart and get $15 off the game you're buying?

No?

So what's the problem then? At least Gamestop even offers it, otherwise you're stuck trading them with friends or selling them at a yardsale or Craigslist"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Why?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Runs through the electric company, so I'm not entirely sure who may be the contract holder with that. I need to research it some more. But yeah I agree, BFE out here but maybe we are an experiment. Haha"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Black Swan Hole
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You think international shares will get recalled as duplicates or something? I've seen that argument a few times, that international holders are making this deal different with more severe consequences"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"you are right.

I am just a john doe european average ape, but I know a couple of invested people that are owners of busines or relative high in the economic scala, and they would for sure take consequences.

One thing is to play with a ""normal"" corrupt system (every system everywhere are to be included in that list) and another thing is to shit on the middle of the main street in rush hour, wipe your ass with the book of regulations / laws and then start to throw the dropings all over the place.

I am pretty confident that the hedge involved don't care at all and the only thing they want is to ""beat"" the situation and don't lose everything, and that probably don't give a crap about burning the house down if they can't get out.

But if they are allowed to do it, the image of the US Market / regulations and even the government will really get a huge damage and many countries are just waiting for it to start the mother of the disacreditation campaigns to show how bad ""democracy"" and ""free market"" and ""west culture"" are and strength their agendas.

The biggest problem I see... It looks like many of the people that could and should step into this situation and take actions, are not really seeing all the possible repercussions of their acts, or are just so deep in the shit that won't do anything out of fear of consequences.

I don't know if this will really change all our lives.

But I do really hope it will create an inflection point, although I don't actually expect it.

The only thing I know for sure... is that I will hold my small amount of shares until this ride comes to an end in one way or another."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean think of an entire generation of investors aka ‚Äúretail investors‚Äù who are dipping their toes in for the first time. If they‚Äôre screwed by corruption Wall Street pays the consequences. You can‚Äôt lock out a generation of investors.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This bit does confuse me a touch though, there are only a few million shorted stocks if I'm correct. Is that enough to fuck the entire crumbling tower(s)?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,remindme! 9 months
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,!remindme 9 months
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wonder what itll be in 10 years. Seems like once a decade, Wall Street completely skull fucks our economy and suffers zero consequences as tax payers bail them out."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,If it split I'd buy a shit ton more. Wallet gets tapped fast at current pricing for a low number of shares. And if I'm buying a ton at a lower price I think a bunch of sideline folks would jump in as well. And that's even more fraudulent shares that need to be covered because all of the available float is already spoken for.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,If they split 1:10 making it 20 a pop i would definitely buy more stocks and I know quite a few people that would do the same!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao what? At $200 per share that's only 500k shares. If there are 70-100M+ shares shorted that is nothing. Apes will not melt down and certainly wall street would not melt down. Shorts would use it as an opportunity to drop the price and run the media in a lame attempt to create panic but apes will just buy that juicy dip all day long.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"In all honesty newbs aren‚Äôt gonna be able to give us the volume we need to push the price higher. The 1 and 2 share investors are just along for the ride, the whales are the ones that are battling hardcore right now..."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,fazed
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This was the point I was trying to make. Something is better than nothing. Plus from a business standpoint it‚Äôs an intelligent move. Getting people in the door is half the battle, now your essentially trading discounts for used games that you can turn around and make a bucks off. Win-win."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs a beloved game. Seriously when that game came out it got awesome reviews. It was fun and pinnacle local multiplayer. Took the wrestling game formula to a new level, and it had this wicked vibe that made people feel gangster. It had style. In the golden age of gaming no less. When Icon came out, the 3rd game in the series, EA and the dev team fucked with the formula trying to reinvent it. Leaving a massive hole left unfilled. With the lack of license and Def Jam refusing to remaster it people want to play it. When a game is so well done, people will play it nearly 15-20 years after its release. Look at D2 or Starcraft. Still have fan bases alive and breathing today."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"That makes more sense, actually. Setting up new lines for maintenance, might as well throw better internet cables up to. Like they did with railroads in the past, might as well throw some cable along with this network of rails."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Black hole swan, won't you come, and wash away the rain?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think the consequences are very real in this situation.  And the Government would be wise to make it right.  The spotlight of the world is looking over this with prying eyes.  As far as what exactly could happen, I‚Äôm not that smart.  I just hope they realize how bad this would hurt America‚Äôs economy if they fuck it up after 2008."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"nah, that would literally put them in conflict with the EU, and those guys have a lot bigger pull tahn a bunch of hedgefunds."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm just so cynical these days I think that they are actually, could, can, and will, do exactly just that. :("
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"In theory, yes. But in reality, probably not."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Tits
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Tesla did stock splits. Original shares were worth $4k at one point.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The theory is that the real short interest is being hidden. 

My theory is that the hedge funds are separated into a few key ‚Äúhouses‚Äù like in Game of Thrones. Citadel is like the House of Lannister. They went in big on the assumption that they could bankrupt GameStop and make huge profits. They have a number of smaller underling houses connected to them, often run by people that spun off their own hedge funds after working there, and they wanted in on the band wagon and bet hard too. 

The opposing houses of Blackrock and Fidelity bet against them. You can see this if you look at the declared share ownership information GME shares by institutional investors (someone posted a link to this the other day). 

The Lannisters will start to pick off the weaker houses connected to the opposing sides, attempting to get them margin called and bankrupt so the float increases as those shares make it back into the market. They need to reduce their exposure and need actual shares for that. The opposing side are likely to do the same.

Retail haven‚Äôt budged that much so weaker institutional investors are the next target. 

That‚Äôs my ape brained theory anyway."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know, I bought 6 today at nearly 200 bucks a share."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,For sure this is true. Psychologically retail investors prefer to buy more of something that's perceived as cheaper...even if their percent ownership of company would be the same ie 10 shares at 20 vs 1 share at 200. Very few people are thinking about the market cap when deciding to purchase.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thing is, after the hype subsides, the price will come down and then what's the share value until the new company can finish reinventing itself."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You and I know that, but you put a news piece about gme diluting shares, regardless of how small, and people freak out.

Apes will not melt down.  The other 92.5 percent of share holders will.  You know, the banks and institutions."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The average investor like myself might only hold a handful of shares but they're all pitching in to do their part.  
  
Don't discredit anyone for jumping on. 9m people all buy 1 share is still 1/4 of the daily volume or more."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This made me laugh so hard ü§£
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here lad, wipe your tears with my upvote"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,All awards are wasted. Unless you really like giving money to the Newhouse family.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have the first two for GameCube sitting upstairs in my game room, I had no idea they were worth anything.

I always liked the first one because it was fairly close to the old wcw games for n64 mechanics wise and then fight for New York changed them."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Plus the government would finally get all their tax money.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean the best outcome for everyone (besides the shorts) is literally for us to win. You‚Äôd think that these people who are just basically taking open bribes could do some basic math and realize that by letting it run it‚Äôs natural course will benefit in the long term
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hope so. Bit worried we'll get screwed, but holding just in case it all works out!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs to be expected. History shows that screwing over the little guy for short term gains will almost always be exercised by the bastards.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What does this look like?  Because every time I ask HOW they manage to avoid paying I get downvoted.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok got ya, was looking up historical pricing and didn't see it over $900 so thanks for responding :)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I'm hearing you correctly, then WSB is the Wildlings, just drunk and idiotic and trying to pillage some shit from the great houses so they can keep going on fighting each other"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice explanation,

Only one ""But""

Retail should not to be so underestimate.

Please correct me if I am wrong but right now is GME (data from [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME?p=GME&.tsrc=fin-srch](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME?p=GME&.tsrc=fin-srch)) 13,6B MC worth, at 181.3 $ yesterday close... what would give (if I understood things correctly) more or less 75 million of shares?

Looking all the YOLOs and assuming a pretty low estimation of 0,25 share pro WSB user... that makes a couple of millions shares. I can accept that retail is not a big player, ok. But I would say that being pretty conservative retail own more than 2,5% of the shares and I would even say that retail could actually reach 8-10% of the shares.

Retailers might not have a vote per se, but retailers do sure as hell have a voice."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You underestimate the Apes. The hype died with the paperhands in January. The willingness to buy and buy and buy some more and never sell because we believe in the company will create tremendous amount of slow upward pressure over time. Like an iceberg, slow and inevitable...our immense mass will crush everything in our path."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You think institutions find out about a share offering by reading marketwatch? The fluff news pieces are meant to influence dumb money sentiment. Wall Street feeds those stories to the media in the first place.  The ""consensus"" price target according to wall street genius analysts is $16 right now. Institution or retail if they are smart they see through the bullshit...if they are dumb, they aren't in this trade in the first place."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks dude. It helps with the sting.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,where do you live? i want my tears to rise not run.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didn‚Äôt pay for it. I shit posted and got 12k karma, a plat and 2 gold awards for it. I‚Äôm not wasting money on Reddit."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Well idk what Vendetta is worth. But NY is worth a pretty penny if you want to sell it.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,And then proceed to spend *at least* 140% of the tax money they get
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, there is nothing better than for the government to let us win. It is a lot of tax money and real stimulus to the economy, as people will not sit on acounts with additional zeroes, as hedge fund people do. We will invest it in housing, cars and generally just consumer items. If this is timed well with Corona getting defeated by vaccinaction, this could have real positive effect on the entire economy."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Didn't the Wildlings return from Westeros united under their new king ~~DFV~~ Jon Snow?

&#x200B;

I do love this analogy though. After all, **Chaos is a** **ladder**"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Did I ever tell you about how I fucked a bear?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,o I can see it now! it's BEAUTIFUL! ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|scream)
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Omg I got dumber reading that.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm honestly shocked, it‚Äôs about time I made out owning vidya, I traded a ninja turtle game for sega to a friend when I was a kid that‚Äôs worth crazy money now and got a game that‚Äôs worthless for itüò≠"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,short squeeze the dollar?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If they do bail you out (I'm in the UK, so it won't affect me, directly), then they can't go for more quantative easing, that's for sure. That's a modern concept. With other, previous burstings of bubbles, they've had to, literally, build their way out. That meant building roads and shit, improving the infrastructure of the country, instead of trying to buy their way out. It didn't work last time, it just created this new problem with GME, because the hedgies were allowed to fuck it all up again.

This might have a good effect on the economy, because it'll get all the unemployed covid workers back onto the streets and doing some hard graft"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I hear you. I threw out the Ultimate Spider-man #1 years ago when I was about 12. A few years later found out it was worth 500 bucks. I shudder to think what it‚Äôs worth now.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm in on leaps. Palantir is a long term hold and good investment. The software will be widely utilized in the future.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Skynet, obviously."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not just buy shares at that point
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm in on 50 JAN 2023 LEAPS of PLTR @ $25 strike. LFG
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it takes until july to boom, what is your break even on those calls? The premium must have been crazy."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure you are!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What date/strike are you in? Was thinking about doing the same
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Leverage. Because if this rips like I think it will then the returns will be much higher
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm holding a few less but at a $22 strike.  Hope this thing pops off for both of us
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,38.75
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"hah noobs, I only buy the dip of the dip of the dip of the dip of the dip of the dip."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same, and still down a considerable amount"

Its a dipping company - no shame in that"

may is bad month, it'll be good July"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I have 2.5c 15c 22.5c 2022/2023 strikes.  Then I‚Äôll bounce using about 6k in and out of 23c June-November expiration selling for a profit until this goes in a clear direction.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a series of buy orders in at $8.00 down to $7.00 for the 22 strike and if IV drops or the stock drops more I‚Äôm hoping to scoop more up.  Two years is a long time so I‚Äôm forcing myself to stay patient but once this thing rips I think it‚Äôs going to really go
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah those of us who got in palantir early don't see it that way maybe your just a salty bagholding fk
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice. People on this sub throw away money buying so far otm..... delta .5 or nothing for me unless I'm really feeling like gambling.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Finally getting some decent volume today
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,um no
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Truth. But, secured 11k gains is better than coming back and dropping loss porn tomorrow. Again, glad OP and anyone else that got paid on this stock got paid, I‚Äôm merely taking my shot, as I think this think will drop enough to make the cheap 4/16 Puts worth it."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This, but minus the 11k profit.  That will be used as wiggle room if the stock starts to go south you'll still come out with profit"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I get it - I don‚Äôt entirely trust it myself. Obviously not everything can be the next GME (or RKT in this case), but I‚Äôd kick myself if I missed the opportunity after feeling so good about this one."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, then let‚Äôs hope for both! It can launch to $69.42 by noon, and then drill to $12 by close."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,\^i guess this kind of did happen. hopefully you got out of your puts this morning. ASO AIN'T GOIN NOWHERE!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did! LoL though of this comment too. Sold my Puts at 9:31am for a tidy profit, glad it recovered for you! LoL if I had daytrades left I would have bought calls again."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I paid estimated taxes for 2021 and I‚Äôm honestly scared to see the official calculation next year. I ran $26,500 up to $733,000 on Robinhood in a few months with hundreds of frantic, impulsive trades with no regard to anything really. I eventually cashed out about $528,000 and sent the IRS $225,000 this weekend. Owed money from regular income taxes too because my wife somehow was only taking 2% out of her paychecks. 

Be careful trading in taxable accounts and stay out of California"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I filled out my taxes and it said I lost a quarter million. I had forgotten to put in my wash sales. When I plugged those in, in actuality I had realized losses of $3006. Just as planned."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,So I‚Äôd have to bang my IRS agent in charge of my audit? And my mom would have to bang him too? Tha fuck?!

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,My cpa does.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You guys file taxes?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Just put all this stock stuff under gambling winnings or losses on your schedule a.  Problem solved.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just don't make profits, simple"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I DECLARE BANKRUPTCCYYYYYYYYYY
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Tax dumb
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,or just trade futures and lose money the proper way
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Basically no claiming losses within 30 days of selling and then buying the same shares.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh shoot, when gme crashed from 350 to 170  in 30min, I sold and re bought, (didn't work out as cooly as it sounds, lost 1 share, ouch!) and my shares on Fedeility got tagged with a cute little W for doing a wash sale.

  I have just been holding since, and not trying to do anything fancy. Cuz I'm not fancy enough to understand wash sale, so I don't wanna over complate this GME saga any more than it is!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,So am I going to have to pay taxes on my stocks when I've literally made no money on them?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is just a case and they will use as an excuse to protect retail from trading...
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Solution: Only trade options because the wash sale rules on options are nebulous. Or just don't be retard and eventually settle down and claim your loss.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"TLDR
That‚Äôs all.  I opened the article, saw waaay too many words and closed it.  Looks like it‚Äôs for people who actually think before trading, so I‚Äôm out."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,The wash sale rule is fucking bullshit!!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,there‚Äôs no way he owed 800k... clickbait title ? that‚Äôs not how washsale works it‚Äôs a lot less scarier than ppl think
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Just don‚Äôt lose. Easy peazy.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You only have to worry about that if you turn a profit at the end of the year, thoughüòéüòé"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,So would this guy have been better off losing the 45k and reporting a loss on the year?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Hmmm Is this why ML allows you to choose the exact shares when you put in a sell order? It has a little bubble next to it that says choosing each share to be sold could save you in taxes...
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,First time I learned about a wash sale was when I did one.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"What happens when you dollar cost average? For example, I buy 100 shares of A at $10. It drop to $5. I buy another 100 shares at $5. I sell the entire lot of 200 shares at $8. So the net is +$.50 per share. When I look at my TD statements, for any ticker that has multiple open positions, it has a down arrow with the cost basis. It shows the first position as -$200 and the second position as +$300. If I were to open another trade would the -$200 be considered a wash sale?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,In short: if you sell shares at a loss just wait 31 days before repurchasing.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,3rd comment ever to make me laugh out loud
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Neither does Fidelity, they f*cked up my 1099."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got an icon on a couple of my stocks the other day saying that it had a wash sale and I was like ""what the fuck is that?"" It made it so my buy history list looked weird and when I called them to ask about it the sell that I did too make it a wash sale was because of some accident anyways so it was bullshit. I still don't understand it at all."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol the old ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt me‚Äù defense
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait‚Ä¶.is that a real defense?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You do taxes with stocks?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,If he was smart he‚Äôd claim Day Trader Status with the IRS and the wash sale rule would not apply to him. Provided he meets requirements.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, üíéüôå"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,">Wash sales net out at the end once you sell. Any losses from previous purchases of same stock will roll into cost basis at time of repurchase. If you have realized gains the previous loss will reduce amount of gains you report. I don‚Äôt know what this idiot did but If you‚Äôre in and out of trades the loss or gain keeps rolling into the repurchase until the final realized gain once you sell. He didn‚Äôt plan well what a dummy

Also, from /u/Spanky_Stonks"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy fucks.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Just close any wash sales 40 days before EOY to be safe.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude.. that‚Äôs some crazy gains! What did you trade ?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine sending in your tax money a single day before it's due.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,The same stock. I think we'd all be in tax hell if it was for any stock.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"40% is definitely a lot more than needed (most of the times), but a good number to keep on the side for taxes."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"There‚Äôs no cap gains on the first one because it was a loss. Wash Sales were implemented to discourage people from purposely selling for loss and getting back in the position. 

Imagine you buy 1 share AAPL for $100 and then it drops to $50. You sell, then buy it back for $50. What changed? Nothing except you now have $50 loss you can claim to IRS. They hate this so they made a rule. Wash sale rule. 

More realistic example: same AAPL shares that dropped to $50. You panic sell realize that loss but then a week later, at $40 you have an epiphany that it‚Äôs a good value and buy it again. **Wash sale violation!**

Then let‚Äôs say you buy AMZN and sell for profit of $10. No problem there. Come tax time AAPL is $100 and you haven‚Äôt sold because you Diamond handed that sucker. So you try to say, I made $10 from AMZN but I lost $50 on the first trade so I don‚Äôt owe taxes because my net profit is negative. IRS says, I see..but no. You violated the Wash Sale rule. So instead, they say you can‚Äôt deduct that $50 against AMZN. Instead, add it to the cost basis of the new purchase of AAPL. Thus, you have to sell it to get the deduction, aka ‚Äúdeferred loss‚Äù. Now your second time selling AAPL will be like selling a $90 stock for $100. But you Diamond handed it into the new year. So on record for the last year, you have AMZN gain for $10. No losses. You pay the tax man. 

Those who are good with math will see, the big picture resulting profit is exactly the same. 

Buy 1 AAPL for $100. Sell for $50.

Buy 1 AAPL for $40. Sell for $100.

Buy 1 AMZN for $10. Sell for $20.

**Net profit $20**

Buy 1 AAPL for $100. Sell for $50.

Buy 1 AAPL for $90 (wash sale deferral). Sell for $100.

Buy 1 AMZN for $10. Sell for $20.

**Net profit $20**

Imagine you didn‚Äôt violate the Wash Sale Rule. 

Buy 1 AAPL for $100. Sell for $50.

Buy 1 AMZN for $10. Sell for $20

Buy 1 AAPL for $40 (2 months later). Don‚Äôt sell.

**Net profit -$40.**

The Difference is you pay taxes on the AMZN $10 gain and can‚Äôt use the AAPL losses that year. When you sell that AAPL the next year you‚Äôll get gains, but maybe you have losses on something else that can lower your net profit. 

This is why if you sell that second batch of AAPL in the SAME YEAR it‚Äôs also fine. Just don‚Äôt buy the stock again for 30 days. Wash sales are an issue of ‚ÄúTiming‚Äù. Your profit is the same at the end of the day, but because of the timing of when you had gains and losses, you might rack up a big tax bill on a year when you made little or nothing. 

Options (any strike) do count as the same stock because they are defined as securities. Brokers won‚Äôt consider the diff strikes as the same securities on the tax form they send you because they use diff symbols for each strike but IRS doesn‚Äôt care, so it‚Äôs extra work for you/your tax person. ETN prepaid forward contracts, cryptocurrencies, precious metals, forex, and swap contracts apparently don‚Äôt matter for wash sales because they aren‚Äôt ‚Äúsecurities‚Äù. 

At the end of the day, the Wash Sale Rule isn‚Äôt a big deal for most people because they don‚Äôt trade in and out of a stock that often. But if you are trading the same stock over and over and have losses then it is a big deal because you want to be able to use those. But all you need is to sell your final position and not buy again for 30 days. 

There are 3 times it is a MAJOR deal. 

1. When you do end of year tax harvest and get back in the position in January - don‚Äôt do it. 

2. You have losses and then get back into the stock in December as a wash sale and diamond hands into the new year.

3. You sell for loss and buy same stock in an IRA. That‚Äôs the worst. You don‚Äôt get to claim losses or add it to the new stocks cost basis. All you have are massive gains.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think once you sell that second time, you close and have a net profit/loss that is reported versus if you hold it at the end of year or potentially keep rolling it over or something that the rule applies. I could be wrong though"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,45M is the total over the year. If you day trade like 50k worth of securities a day it adds up fast. buying and selling for example 50k -> 52k -> 48k that‚Äôs already 150k in only 3 trades and you have a net loss of 2k at the end

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Got convinced with the GME DD‚Äôs and started buying shares at the end of November, kept buying dips on margin and just dumped the whole account all-in after-hours with the announcement that Cohen was joining the board. So I was buying under $20. It was fucking crazy and I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I told my wife once I was up $100k. It then ran-up all the way up to 800k then we really didn‚Äôt know what to do! It started dropping and we decided to sell it all at about $662k. Dropped to like $60 and I thought I dodged a bullet. The following day or two if we would of held it would of been something like 2 million."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I originally had this attitude and was going to enact the safe harbor rule but I lost too much on SPAC‚Äôs and tech and I‚Äôm done trading in taxable accounts for the year, I‚Äôm in the process of buying a house, savings rates are shit, and we‚Äôve already been fucking up our withholding owing like 13k last year and 20k this year before the short-term gains. Just being careful because the house is new construction and if it doesn‚Äôt appraise well I‚Äôm going to have to come up with the cash and I‚Äôm worried about wash sales I may have incurred leading to an even bigger tax bill."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,why not just let everyone sell on dec 31?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Because a dumbass guy now owes 800k taxes on a 45k gain for being ignorant. That's fucked.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you have to sell every single share of that stock for it to count?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Can't have losses if I don't sell
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"good to know, stay away from GME after I sell."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks man I appreciate the response.  I guess I can‚Äôt figure out how this individual in the article managed to end the year with a net profit of $45k but still owed more than his total profit in taxes - by a lot.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty much. You also need to have another 30 days after the sell of the second buy for it to all count and if the second buy was a loss you‚Äôre back in the loop. Example: If you buy, sell, buy a week later, sell for loss and then buy again a third time a week after that, then your wash sale misery continues and you need to wait 30 days before buying for you to claim those losses. And since you‚Äôre adding the loss of the first buy to the cost basis of the second, you actually have an increased chance to get another loss. Which is fine if you just wait 30 days before doing anything. That‚Äôs the lesson."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This sub is literally (or was until the recent influx) literally a CASINO.  Big bets, big losses, big gains, solid DD sprinkled in here and there.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The rule is not stupid or complicated. Maybe, just maybe, the guy making $45000000 in trades should understand taxes first."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"$45M is thousands, $45MM is million, fyi."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"No it‚Äôs just if you have a wash sale, if you look at your tax lots in your broker interface it should say"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only if you sell at a loss. If you sell at a profit and decide to go back in at a later time, you're welcome to do that."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm not an expert on this - so I‚Äôd do your own research to be certain, but my take is that you can rebuy to your hearts content, but you can‚Äôt realize that loss on your taxes until you‚Äôve sold your rebuy and have been out of the stock for 30 days. 

Example: you buy gme at 200. It drops to 150. You panic and sell. It drops to 119 that day. You decide to buy back in that same day. You are no unable to realize the losses incurred when the price dropped from 200 to 150 and you sold at a loss... until you sell the shares you purchased at 119, and haven‚Äôt touched GME for 30 days. Once it‚Äôs been 30 days, you can realize those losses. 

If you time it poorly like the schmuck in the article did, you can find yourself in a situation where you owe a fuckload of taxes for one year and don‚Äôt get to realize the losses until the next year. 

Is my understanding of how it all works. This isn‚Äôt tax advice."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The guy is facing a possible 800k tax bill on 45k profits, seems like the kind of story you read about here, or at least I remember reading similar stories a couple of years back.  It's a news story, that's flaired as news, about a massive tax loss because of retarded plays, seems to fit to me."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ha ha ha this is so true!  A few years back my wife and I always went to this lady to do our taxes...  she was recommended by a friend of my wife.  I hated the service and the lady.  always thought she was just entering data...  the i got into the stock market and I gave her my forms for gains.  In short, Uncle Sam and Gov Newson gangbanged us.  The look on the lady was priceless as she could not interpret the numbers for the life of her...  all the time I kept looking at my wife (think scene when the wolf of wall street goes to the Swiss bankers to hide his money).  As we were walking to the car I kept looking at my wife and not saying a word.  She just looks at me and tells me ‚Äúyes, next year we are changing the way we file taxes‚Äù..."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can, just have to get rid of the new position. Tax loss is deferred and averaged into new position."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes I did. I was trying to respond directly to your example, though I may have replied in the wrong section?
I was trying to further add how I believe those trades would look like in terms of *net* profit."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,So basically he had gains in 2020 and losses in 2021 and they didn't cancel out each other because it's a new tax year?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,">because assholes didn't want to pay taxes

If you aren't cheating on your taxes, you are cheating on your family...asshole"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not excusing his stupidity or disagreeing. But holy shit that risk is huge. He owes the IRS the next 20-30 years of his working life savings now because he didn't understand the tax code.

Early withdraw from my 401k they pay the taxes immediately before I get the money. A hold or a flag or an auto witholding on your brokerage account around December 31 each year seems like something a brokerage could add to help risk management for their retail customers."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I guess that‚Äôs a valid perspective.  Touch√© my friend. 

Just been so sick of all the bullshit posts here in the last two months.  Overall the sub has digressed a lot from where it started."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,90 days?!?! Its only 30 days? I too got shit scared after reading the forbes article. Checked my GME trades cost basis and it was 6 figures. I thought I was truly fucked until I researched
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, that's not how this works.

Sell stock, lose $3.50

Re-buy stock within 30 days, gain $3.50

Should be net zero, right? -$3.50 +$3.50?

Well, you triggered wash sale on the -$3.50 part so it doesn't actually count. You owe taxes on the $3.50 gain.

Now bump up these rookie numbers to $350k in both directions. You owe potentially $105k on the gains but cannot claim the losses due to wash sale. That's my interpretation of this fuckery, anyways. Your example does not factor in the special rules applied to wash sale day trading."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is basically it. He made a ton of money in 2020 and then lost it all during the wash window and now owes 800k
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,If you aren‚Äôt cheating on your taxes you aren‚Äôt trying. Taxation is theft.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think a lot of people hate this particular comment thread, lots of down notes. Lol"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,The guy traded $45 million without looking into it. And he isn‚Äôt fucked. He gets to realize all of his losses in future years. Everyone wants someone else to babysit their decisions these days.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree, I'm glad that it's starting to get some variety back.  I read the article earlier elsewhere and fucking lost it, I knew it was going to get posted here eventually.  Have a great night"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I think it's 30 days following the sell of your last wash sell. But I would wait 60 days or so just to be sure for tax season.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is a net zero once you resell though, assuming it's within the same tax year.

That's what the other guy is saying. It only fucks you if you don't sell a second time during that same tax year (plus 90(?) days after the second sale)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Not this Ayn Rand bullshit
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"He owes 800k in taxes this year that he potentially does not have PLUS interest. You can only realize 3k losses per year and that is simply reduced from your income that year.  So if he makes 100k he will report 97k of income and pay like 1,000 less in taxes per year for the next 266 years ü§¢. Can't declare bankruptcy,  only hope is that IRS will negotiate a reduced amount."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, you're wrong, so stop quivering and accept that this is just absurd ruling so stop defending it.

Whether there's a rule or not doesnt make this retarded american system any good. This is absolutely fucking stupid and helps nobody. The punishment does not fit the 'crime' you think this guy is guilty of, you fucking idiot. God..americans."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You too my friend ü§ôü§ôü§ô
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Partially correct. The 3k is if your negative. Look into it. If he made 100k next year he pays zero in taxes. And now his liability would be 700k. So if he makes you 100k he would realize the losses in 8 years. Trading is a serious business not some hobby. Any business person moving that much money should understand the tax consequences first. That‚Äôs just basic.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The rule prevents fraud. Plain and simple. Trading is serious business. If you start any business without first understanding the tax consequences you are an idiot. The law has no negative consequences for those that follow it.

Edit: seems like you are the one quivering. Lol"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're the same kind of guy who throws a tantrum in the bank after you try to modify an account and they ask for proof of identity, aren't you? You're not being fucked by *basic* checks and rules to prevent fraud.

This is a stupidly simple rule for 99% of people, why are you having so much trouble with this?

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Love the enthusiasm
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"To make matters worse, he can only write off $3k worth of his loss next year. The silver line: he has another 266 years of deductions!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Were you born this stupid or did they throw you at the floor a few times?

No, there isnt a rule like this in my country, its American garbage.

The guy made 45k. paying 800k in taxes is outright idiocy, and even accepting that that is 'right' in any way shape or form would you need you to be absolutely fucking stupid."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well sort of. That‚Äôs 3k deductible from your ordinary income. So if he makes 100k in stock proceeds this year, he can claim the losses against that- provided he pays attention to the wash sale rule this time around"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh my god
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Canada has it. It's called the superficial-loss rule there.

C'mon, which backwards-ass country do you live in where the government hasn't heard of fraud?"

Unfortunately, the more secure something is the more hassle you'll have accessing it so it's a classic tradeof.

I already could get out my initial investment and let the rest of my puts run maybe till end of the day or the whole week. Im still unsure. U think the severity of the breach is similar to solarwinds and might lead to something similar price wise?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn‚Äôt they already? That was my understanding
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd say that you could use that nifty little auto password generation feature in chrome, then I remember that it's a keychain and is stored and easily accessible if you get access to the root machine."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The sad thing my early years in end user IT taught me is that so many people are susceptible to installing anything that a random page on the web tells them to. Meaning that aside from the method you described (which the average user that falls victim would likely never do), it wouldn't matter even if they stored it somewhere. It sees you type it just one time and some keylogger/rootkit will just store that nice and neatly for someone to find."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Ubikeys have worked well for me.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the way.  Also LastPass can itself have 2FA and that can be a different key than the services for the passwords stored in LastPass.  That said, I basically have root access to a shitload of AWS stuff and even if my passwords were compromised there's a limit to how much damage that someone could do with them because I don't trust myself either, so I have guardrails in place around my own access (at least for the credentials that I use on a daily basis)."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same here, and change the password often.... also make sure you don't download pr0n with viruses or keyloggers... else the trojan they injected you with gives them access to your login password and remote access....."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Terrible advice. The xkcd here is a good lesson on choosing a passphrase for your password manager. It's terrible advice for choosing a password for every service you use. I've got about 150 accounts in my password manager, there is no way I could remember a unique passphrase for each one of them. The only way you could hope to do that would be to pick one good passphrase, and apply some predictable modifier to it to get a unique one for each service, which is essentially the same thing as using the same password for every service (aka, real dumb). The very best password management strategy your brain can support is to get a good password manager, use 2FA with it, choose a good passphrase for it, use a long randomly generated password for each service, and enable 2FA on every service that supports it. Lastpass and 1Password are actually very high quality products that use end-to-end encryption, meaning even if their databases are completely disclosed, your passwords won't be compromised. If you don't want to take my word for it, you can see what [Tavis Ormandy has to say about it](https://twitter.com/taviso/status/1167311357957435392?lang=en), a security researcher who has probably disclosed more password manager bug than anybody else on the planet."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"""They were able to get cryptographic secrets for single sign-on cookies and remote access, full source code control contents, and signing keys exfiltration,‚Äù Adam said.""  

It's even worse than just the passwords. If they can forge the single sign ons (probably for firmware updates), it's honestly game over. It's just a matter of how many devices already have back doors put into them. Firmware reset and upgrades across all devices (or throw them away) if you're using them for anything enterprise that is exposed."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know. I think that is really stupid to do. Me, personally I store all my passwords in my head, luckily I have a super-good memory. However, if you are going to have PW in the cloud, which I don't recommend, Why not have 2FA? I used to have clients that would freak out over 2Fa, and ask me to shut it off..."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I would never shut off 2FA on anything. Will agree, not a fan of Lastpass, or any consolidated PW keeper."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"True, their problem was using a service like LastPass for such sensitive information, and I think that for an everyday user cloud based password managers are secure enough."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"""The S in IoT stands for security!"""
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's even worse than that though, they found the secrets for their single sign on cookies (for temporary access for sharing or probably for firmware updates).  So it's even worse than that.  Single sign on cookies would bypass accounts set up and MFA."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude was using lastpass. Not exactly the height of competence.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"They did to an extent, but didn't go in to details nearly how bad it was.  A true IT professional would not be OK with the response from them, and would want to blow up and rebuild the entire stack.  This will hurt the brand name forever to a point I personally don't think they will recover.  The stock stopped sliding, but I think as time goes on it will only go down still.  I may be wrong, they ,may be able to do some amazing PR spin and everything is great, but with my experience in networking and cybersecurity, this seems like a huge deal, not just a little database breach."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes but with the method I described it doesn't matter. If an auto-generated password is ""lsdfjks;ljfslj"" and is stored but you always add something like ""cat"" from memory it doesn't matter if someone gets access. All they will see is the prefix. They don't see ""cat"" and good luck brute forcing it."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct. Which is why everyone should always use 2 factor authentication. Getting the password doesn't mean much if they don't have the RSA key. Nothing is 100% secure and the average person still uses the same password of ""breadCat123"" everywhere."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Hell yeah brother.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also you could get a keepass app on your iPhone.  If you keep your phone updated and only use the standard App Store, your phone is much more secure than a windows/Mac computer."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"100%. This is game over. Delete everything. Throw out all your servers and start from scratch. They can‚Äôt even guarantee customer devices aren‚Äôt compromised already. They have to recommend customers throw away devices. 

What I was talking about would try to prevent this. No user should have read write access to that DB. That should be a service account that is monitored and only used on specific devices."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit he got their private keys.

I only like the rsa 2fa method. I hate when they use a cell number and text message as an authentication method. Sim swapping is definitely a thing and beginning to be a real problem for phone providers"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm pretty sure storing your passwords in a notes app page is more secure than most other common forms (saving it in chrome, etc etc)"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This actually isn't a terrible idea, assuming your gun safe is also rated for fires as well."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not sure of the specifics but it used to require someone at a wireless carrier spoofing a sim, now there software that makes it stupid easy."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Are puts at open the move? I feel like the potential for customer class action suits and the accompanying baggage will make any holders dump it.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Physical key > RSA > Text Message > No 2FA.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is. We have an additional case that is rated for an additional 30 minutes specifically for deeds, titles, passports and passwords"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,The real question lies here. How tf his LastPass account got compromised? It‚Äôs used by a lot of professionals and seems like an important question.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"So I understand the Greeks and how they influence each other for the most part, but one thing that has eluded me is how vega changes with volatility. I know that vega goes down with time, and that vega represents the dollar change per percentage change in the IV.

My question pertains to AAPL calls. AAPL has incredibly low volatility right now. I believe that AAPL has found its bottom, as it has bounced off of 119 repeatedly while the rest of tech continues to drop. I believe that it will return to the 125-135 range between now and the end of April. 

Trading sideways for a week and a half has caused IV to die down to around 30% on most options. I'm looking to buy some june/July calls while IV is super low and I think the price has bottomed out, then sell into the IV spike when earnings come at the end of April. The last two earnings IV hit about 60% on AAPL. My option I'm eying has a vega of 15, we'll say it drops to 10 by earnings. That would imply that an increase in 30 points in IV would spike the options price by 300$. 

I know that's too good to be true, and that IV going up has some effect on vega, but I don't know how much. How can I figure this out, and also, is my reasoning sound as far as getting the options now while IV is dead and selling into the pre-earnings IV? Is there anywhere to calculate what a 30% increase in IV would actually do? Would greatly appreciate the help!"

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúSir, you need to pay for those first.‚Äù At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the calls and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually ‚Äúto prevent any electrical infetterence,‚Äù and then turned around and winked at me.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have a hypothesis that will be tested tomorrow based on NEW stocks that grab our attention. For those who failed science hypothesis is an educated guess.

If you look at the pattern of stocks such as ZOM, SNDL and RKT you will see they moved the same way over 3 days. 

Tomorrow is day 3 for Viacom and Discovery.

Here is the pattern:

Day 1 - stock suddenly gets major attention on  Reddit threads. Yesterday is when we started seeing posts about Viacom and Discovery everywhere. 

Day 2 - stock is green with high volume. Typically a small gain.  Viacom and Discovery were up today. Up in after hours as well. Retail a main driver of price increase. 

Day 3 - stock explodes. At this point institutional money is driving the price increase. Tomorrow is day 3.

If there is any validity to this hypothesis we will see a major spike by end of day. Jump in early. It isn't too late. 

WARNING: There is a downside to this pattern. If this occurs stock will drop in after hours and will plummet on Day 4. 

If we see a big spike tomorrow sell before close. Otherwise you risk holding the bags. Day traders and institutions sell after hours. 

Again this is just a pattern from previous experiences we have witnessed. It could be coincidence. 

Just something to watch. Let me know if you think I am missing anything. Thanks"

So if I'm trying to buy an option trading for 0.08, Robinhood will make me pay 0.1, immediately losing the 0.02 value. Likewise, If I try to sell an option trading for 0.08 , Robinhood will force it to 0.05, effectively selling it for less than its worth.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not a believer in the never-ending squeeze that's supposedly always just around the corner (originally bought in in Jan and sold during the first run-up), but yeah there's a good chance you make decent money in the short term

There's also a good chance you lose money. But you can probably just baghold and recover worst case scenario. Just don't get engulfed in the cult and sell when you're comfortable & don't get too greedy.

Maybe wait for it to cool off a tiny bit tho, although it's possible that ship has sailed after the post earnings recovery"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,it doesn't matter. it's calories in vs out. and protein is just food. unless you are severely overweight it gets very hard to build muscle and lose fat at the same time. that's why every serious person does cut and bulk periods.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"On the right track.  Get some good fermented bcaas and drink before/during your workouts.  Protein shake after.  Keep cardio intensity lower if concerned about burning muscle and do it after you lift,not before.  Also keep in mind that muscle burns calories at rest, so as you build muscle, the amount of calories you burn just existing increases a bit.  Small meals throughout the day will keep metabolism up.  Aim to eat ever 2.5-3 hours."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I like sieving through all the shit posts to find those gold nuggets of advice here in WSB.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the stocks but I'm a GME ape but dont post about it in this thread. I know better. I also like the banter and the community as s whole. I don't get upset when I'm downvoted or shit on its just arrows and strangers on the internet. I'll give my shit posters awards for being assholes to me. I feel like they need it. It's my time and money I'll spend them both how I want. I enjoy my alone time in the mornings while my family is asleep. WSB is my family this early in the morning. It's all fun and games with so much free time in the mornings I choose to spend it here. Some of the comments and replies are super funny and I don't get alot of light hearted fun during the rest of the day when my crotch goblins wake up. I spend alot of time out at university hospitals with my parents. They both have unique needs. Right now I'm focused on my mom she was hit by a car ran over and they left her there to die. I had to move her up to Chicago with me for medical care or she would have died. They have medicaid for all here and I knew I had to get her up here and on medical or she wouldn't have made it. She needs about 18 months of OT and PT and we haven't even begun yet. So while I'm usually always out with someone in my home doing something I have my phone with me and enough time to still check in on the sub and watch the ticker. Some weeks are heavy and I can't some are just a few things to do for the week. My calendar fills up pretty quickly though and this sub and the posts keep me going. I especially like the silliness in the GME thread. I know it annoys alot of people but some of the comments crack me up.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Me too man she's struggling but she's stubborn as fuck and refuses to die. When I got her she was 86 lbs now I got her up to 145 and she's looking so much better. Her arm still is of little use to her but they really didn't want to amputate it and decided that while it will never work again for the most part they want to try and rehab it aggresively to see what function she can regain. It's shitty though she has to go to pain management for a full nerve block before her ot appointments because the pain is to great for them to even lightly touch her arm so and any manipulation for treatment isn't possible without them killing nerve function to her whole arm. I feel bad for her but I'm doing all I can to help her recover. It's kind of bizarre I've been kind of taking care of myself since I was about 16 and she hasn't really been in my life but she was going to die if I didn't help her and there is no way I could have lived with myself if I would have just let her die. I knew what kind of stress I would be bringing into my life moving her up here but it was really my only option and the right thing to do. Since she's been with me since October and I don't tolerate drug or alcohol use she's been 100% clean since October and she did it cold turkey. I had to make her stop I can't allow that shit around my kids I know full well how it affected me as a child and I won't put my kids through that.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oof, sorry to hear.

As soon as I buy, trend changed, just like my other stocks I buy.  I hate this curse.. :("
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, intense solar flares could damage the conventional power grid, however those with solar panels and wind turbines on their property are making millions selling power to their neighbors. And somewhere in a darkened basement of an old building on Wall Street, an elderly trader records the skyrocketing price of ICLN by hand in an almost forgotten ledger by candlelight."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I love your commitment. However a solar flare would be very damaging to earth. A non stop barrage of giant solar flares for two weeks would probably destroy our atmosphere and kill us all. Including that old guy in the basement.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Eventually it very well could kill us all. But it wouldn't be overnight, heating this planet with solar flares would take time. And what are people going to do with that time? Invest in clean energy of course - they all know it's a massive bubble, but who's really the greater fool when all life on Earth is going to end in a matter of months? A Russian Cosmonaut, that's who. Flying solo in the International Space station, years after witnessing the fiery death of his home planet and his fellow Astronauts & Cosmonauts who eventually succumbed to illnesses and accidents aboard the space station - he realizes the massive influx of power generated by the solar panels due to the constant barrage of solar flares has given him an option no one had previously considered - and why would they? The tiny thrusters on the ISS normally fire in very short bursts to keep the station perfectly in orbit, or possibly dodge a very large amount of space debris - but with this much extra power available, the Russian uses those tiny adjustment thrusters to set a course out of Earth's orbit. The last living human in the solar system then sets off on a final journey to somewhere he'd always wanted to go: to the moon on clean energy."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but its his trade. Some people look at the IV and take a shot in the dark. For all we know, the short squeeze has already happened and the elevated price in GME is due to call sellers buying stock to hedge and those holding propping up the stock price. Maybe the squeeze is yet to happen. It's not a team sport. I'm not playing GME, but if I were, I'd be throwing a couple of dollars at FDs hoping for a quick 10 bagger. The odds would be low, but the payoff worth it. What if the squeeze hasn't happened and it tops off at 600? That's a lot of risk for a 200% gain. To each their own."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you believe the squeeze will happen down the line, why would you risk selling CCs for a couple k per week?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"\> Dude can make $2k+ per week off 200 shares until the price either drops or the squeeze squozes. 

That's still a $40,000 initial investment for the opportunity to make $2k a week for a short period of time, until the IV and/or the underlying price dies down."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"...

I don't know if you're serious. And I don't know if you're seriously asking about buying ITM calls in general or if you're asking about specifically for gamestop? In general because you expect the stock value to increase and by buying an ITM call you're giving yourself a better position, and you'll see more gains? That much seems like common sense. You can also use your ITM call to sell covered calls... And I guess I can touch on how that can affect something late, too...

Overall when you're buying calls you're buying them with the expectation that they will end up In the Money (ITM) so that you can either exercise the shares and collect shares at a discounted price (let's use DFV as an example: his 4/16 12c. If he wants to exercise those 500 contracts, he's only paying $600,000 for 50k shares of Gamestop. With Gamestop's current price (we'll even say it's $190) 50k shares would be $9.5 million. 

So he bought out of the money calls... But he's DFV and you're not. Let's say you're Jim Cramer and you're tired of WSB laughing at you and want to get in on the action and want this thing to squeeze! 

How would you invest your money to make the biggest waves in the pool? Well, by making the price move the most, right? Duh.

So let's look at gamestop's options for this week. Options are expiring this Thursday instead of Friday. If I bought a $180c 04/01 for 2.3k(?) when it was at $178ish yesterday, then it would have had a Delta of about say .56. That apparently means that whatever market manager is handling your newly bought call is already buying/hedging your call by purchasing 56 shares of the stock so in the event that it does close well enough above $180 (say that nice $195 we're at right now), they have enough shares available to give you 100 in exchange for an additional 18k. But, look, now that Gamestop is at $195 that .56 Delta is now .70... Which means they ended up having to buy extra shares to hedge your call without you even exercising or buying more. Congratulations, you now have the market makers working for you. Surely as it gets closer to 04/01 they will have to buy the rest of the shares to give you the 100 shares (should you choose to exercise). The Delta also estimates how much your premium increases per dollar the stock goes up. So if you have a .70 Delta and your contract is currently worth say $2200 (pretty much the exact stats on a 04/01 $180c), if gamestop goes from 195 to 196, your contract will bump up in value to $2270.

If you're buying OTM calls your Delta is very little to nothing, which means your option purchase has literally no effect on the stock price. So we'll use this smooth brain's 04/01 690c as an example. Go on pull robinhood up and look at the option: You can see it's dirt cheap at $12 an option! Absolutely incredible! But when you look at the Delta... It's a laughable .0049, meaning you'd have to buy 2 of those contracts for a MM to even think about buying a share to hedge that call. But in the mean time you're pretty much making it rain for whoever sold you that stupid OTM call. 

So if you have 10 million in cash and you want to see gamestop go up... Sure, you can buy just the shares themselves. You'll get about 51k, and the dust will settle somewhat quickly. Or you buy 10m in calls and you're now holding 4,500 ITM calls, which is forcing market makers to buy up 315k shares to hedge your (whale-sized) bet. 

Considering that Gamestop's volume today was 17m, and the highest volume at any time was only 750k... You could either be the cause of 50k in volume or 300k in volume.

Tl;dr: I'm higher than a giraffe's tits. Don't know shit. Probably going to go broke as fuck paying taxes. Probably not the person you should be listening to, ever. But, overall, if you want the biggest bang for your buying buck, buying just getting into the money calls, or slightly out of the money calls, affects the entire stock in ways that buying shares and OTM FDs just won't.

Oh, last thing, if you're wanting those price movements to stick, then you're better off exercising ITM calls rather than selling them and taking the premium."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Because I will always choose guaranteed money over maybe money. That's just me though.

So if you have a .70 Delta and your contract is currently worth say $2200 (pretty much the exact stats on a 04/01 $180c), if gamestop goes from 195 to 196, your contract will bump up in value to $2270.

Or I could just buy 100 shares at $195, and if it goes to $196, I would have made $100, instead of the $70 with the un-exercised option.

I don't see a situation where spending the premium to buy an ITM call and then immediately exercising for the shares actually gets you ahead. If anything, it puts you behind, because now you need the stock to go even higher before you break even, due to the cost of the premium."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Would feel sour about that decision if gme breaks out to 50k+
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"A consistent 5% a week would be cool, but I don't want to pay $200 a share for stock that will go back down to below $100 a share after this craziness is over. It'd take you a long time to dig yourself out of that hole."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,He already has the shares.
2021-03-30 22:54:35,wallstreetbets,"Lets talk about SPACE baby - the next wave of companies ARKX will pick up By now we have all seen the things Cathy put in her new space exploration ETF from obvious inclusions like KTOS and LHX to head scratchers John Deere to Netflix and her own 3D printing ETF. Obviously the fund is actively managed so new companies will be acquired, reweighted, and blah blah blah. What follows is a few companies I can see being added at some point.

**Northrop Grumman (NOC)** \- I was admittedly surprised not to see NOC in the holdings for ARKX. They are LMT's little brother who has their own impressive portfolio of government contracts and military vehicles. They have also been making acquisitions to pivot towards Space. In 2017, they bought Orbital ATK and used that to form NG Innovative Systems. With that acquisition, NOC acquired multiple rockets, engines, and Space Payloads. Government contracting is very West Virginia-y and NOC already has existing ties to every defense company in ARKX. Notice, LMT just bought Aero(tyne)jet Rocketdyne to furhter build out their space capabilities. If you look at their earnigns release, NOC grew its Space Systems division 18% from $7.4B to $8.7B from 2019 to year end 2020. Those numbers should continue to grow as the government seeks a number of space capabilities.

**Raytheon (RTX)** \- Another classic American company connected to the teet of the USG. Raytheon Missiles have been sending people to the Gulag long before it was cool to do in Warzone. Like NOC and LMT, RTX has also made strategic space acquisitions, acquiring small sat company Blue Canyon Technologies in addition to owning Collins Aerospace. In its first year, RTX Intelligence & Space division had $10.8B in net sales and 9.4% profit margin while Collins Aerospace had $19.2B in net sales and a 7.6% operating profit margin. Feels worth noting, Collins Aerospace literally makes fucking [space suits](https://www.collinsaerospace.com/what-we-do/Space/Space-Suits) along with other critical spacecraft components. the Intelligence and Space division will continue to rack up prime contracts with the USG and sub contracts with all the other players in the Space sector and revenues will grow.

**Maxar (MAXR)** \- This company can best be described as LHX-lite as they have pivoted from a satellite imagery and consulting provider to becoming a company that makes boxes and things that will enter Space. MAXR actually has [some of its tech](https://blog.maxar.com/space-infrastructure/2021/inside-perseverance-how-maxar-robotics-will-enable-a-historic-mars-mission) on the Perseverance Rover exploring Mars right now. Additionally they are providing power and propulsion elements for the NASA Lunar Gateway project. Their 2020 annual hasn't been released yet, but the 2019 report highlighted contract wins and their development of their Space Infrastructure business in the mil/gov space. The company is still finding its way as it [reported a loss](https://investor.maxar.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Maxar-Technologies-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results/default.aspx) on 1.7B in revenue in 2020.  Growth in the previously mentioned Space Infrastructure division helped pair down the company's overall losses. Its most notable bit of news lately has been the [failure](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/sirius-xm-satellite-sxm-7-fails-built-by-maxar-and-launched-by-spacex.html) of it's satellite built for Sirius XM that was launched by SpaceX. If you invested in zero and pre-revenue EV companies, this is the play for you.

There are additional speculation plays you could make in a number of SPACS with BlackSky, Momentus, and SpaceX junior (Rocket Labs). Not going into further detail cause they have <1B market cap.

I would note that these companies along with the other ones like LHX, LMT, HO, BA, KTOS etc will have big revenues but slimmer profit margins due to the complexities of putting shit into space and government contract restrictions on contract profits so you won't see the large PE ratios of software/tech companies. None of these are get rich quick stonks so patience will be required.

**TL;DR: ARKX has some questionable holdings now. Buy shares of these companies that could see an ARK boost.**

DISCLAIMER: I do not have any ARKX holdings. I work for one of the companies in ARKX on a space systems program. I hold that company's stock. I am retarded spreadsheet masher, not an engineer."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,$NFLX??? Cuz you need to watch Space Force in space...I guess
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was reading a lot of disappointment and confusion about a lot of the top picks

But what if, these seemingly less space focused picks, stay with me here, plan on using/purchasing some sort of satellite tech? 

Point being, is it really that disappointing of a roster or is there some 5D chess move most people are missing

I'm a dumb ape idk shit but that's my perspective

Can we think about it for a few days before saying it's a joke is all"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I think the picks make sense although it‚Äôs kinda scummy their own etf PRNT is their second biggest holding. That‚Äôs just being cheap and doubling up on the fees when they could just buy the underlying holdings separately. Hopefully it‚Äôs just a placeholder while they gather more funds. It was surprising to see how small of an allocation went into SPCE but the bigger holdings seem to be outperforming SPCE anyway.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"So... instead of buying Ark's shit ETF just buy these names yourself. 

You'll get actual space exposure instead of whateverthefuck they are trying to sell with ARKX, still not sure what those holdings are supposed to represent, but it ain't space exploration that's for sure."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This ETF is a hot bag of terrestrial bullshit. Where‚Äôs the rockets? I‚Äôm not buying without rockets...
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,For the love of god please pick up VSAT I am balls deep in leaps

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Their justification for NFLX was that approx. 40 million Americans dont have broadband yet and that this will benefit Netflix if they have access to satellite based internet.

Problem:

1. Satellite internet will still cost significantly more than cable broadband.

2. Among those who DO get satellite service, how many will become Netflix subscribers?

And how much will those few subscribers *really* contribute to Netflix's bottom line when they already have hundreds of millions of subscribers?

I don't think it would make a noticeable difference.... so again.... why is it included here?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,my thoughts were it may be in the components or supply chains. and...this is serious not in gest.... when we get to mars electric John Deere tractors are going to pull everything around
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,had forgotten about them but another good pick IMO
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôll take the downvote but I‚Äôm literally too retarded to select a picture haha
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,i mentioned that!
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"lol great write up . truly. 

I am in deep on TRMB and SPCE.

SPCE is the showy WS type. Who cares that its sitting at 28 psotion or whatever... they are the first and the most known. thats all WS cares about... so I DD on it today. was in since Monday lol. a whole day ago. Im holding yolo style on this. Wont hold it longer than thurs (i think). expires next week.

TRMB have two months out. I expect a run.

TSM is both yolo weeklies and longs. This the play. with the drought (literllay no fn water in indonesia) and with the chip shortage... this will rocket. I love that this is not China per se. So they are compliant. I played last ER made a fortune in Jan. sold since becuase I know WS don't like chips to have fun if its not merican. played it right got lucky. 

INTC should be an amazing play rn (this can be arkx)ish that will par nicely in the coming weeks. Merica and chips. should be golden."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's hundreds of years worth of carbon fibre experience at Rocketlab, they've employed practically every carbon fibre boat builder in NZ, to the point that boat yards have closed because they're all working on rockets. Same goes for Southern Spars which made carbon fibre masts and rigging for the yachting industry."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Carbon fiber is not inherently hard to work with, especially if you are simply making tubes (i.e., rocket chassis) where you wind fabric around a mandrel and infuse it with epoxy resin, or the like. Lots of experience even with making more complex parts, but certain parts are likely very simple."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought about putting chip makers in there especially given the shortage of them right now but that is a whole different area with all kinds of things to consider. I was focusing on Space companies since ARKX seemed to be lacking actual space stuff
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"X(SPA) is the play tomorrow ER yolo.
Can't post this ticker for obvs reasons.
What do you think about this yolo lol?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Elon spent a year working with carbon fiber on starship then abandoned it completely because in his words it was taking to long and costing too much. The variant of steel he now uses cost 5% of what carbon fiber was costing him and now he‚Äôs producing starships at an incredible pace. Rocket lab is very smart. They are likely to come to the same conclusion as he did and will make the switch to steel. They likely haven‚Äôt yet because they have soo much sunk cost in the 3D printing tech they used to produce the carbon fiber tubes.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,She‚Äôs bought many spacs that have not completed merger.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's really not what OI represents. For every call bought, there was a call written. More call open interest means as much that there were more people writing calls because they're bearish as that many people buying the calls because they're bullish. Conversely, lots of OI on puts could be interpreted a lot of people are bullish because they're selling puts. But really, these stats mean nothing other than lots of people are betting on the volatility of these stocks."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Eh. Open Interest includes orders that were placed but not filled. So there could‚Äôve been more buy call orders vs calls being written. That can increase OI

DD:

1. VIAC  owns Comedy Central. Think Chappelle Show, \*\*\*SNL RE-RUNS\*\*\*, spongebob square pants, rupaul show, show time, reno 911,  MTV, and many more. These are  classic shows that are here to stay and they make bank. [http://ir.viacomcbs.com/static-files/3909104b-f8d1-4d51-8afe-14af18d6b98b](http://ir.viacomcbs.com/static-files/3909104b-f8d1-4d51-8afe-14af18d6b98b)
2. Selling  $30 billion of shares in 4 days is too much too fast and a 50% correction on VIAC is not justified.  It takes a few days to weeks for most \*less than the brightest\* to do math, communicate, and realize the price is super low. Wells fargo says it has finished liquidating to meet the margin call.

3. VIAC did a $3 billion offering while it was over extended up at $100 per  share and they now have \~$3 billion more cash than DISCA does. This is a chad move and a rare opportunity for them to acquire or build something  incredible--I'm not going to speculate as to what, but I'm confident they will do something dank.

UPDATE: apparently E! does SNL now and comedy central does re-runs of SNL. Currently looking to roll my may $50 calls to june $50 calls to buy some extra time if I can get a nice fill. Risk to reward ratio long still seems great, but might take a bit longer. "
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you'd be better off buy $VIACA. The outstanding share amount on $VIAC is 502 millions shares. It's more difficult to effect that with buys. VIACA only has 52 million shares. Slightly more expensive, but it's easier to influence that share price with buys. We can look at DISCB as an example. They only have 6.1 million shares and it shot through the roof the last 2 days."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The shorts aren't done with it yet either, they're trying to get less than $40 but that only happened once and it got slapped back up and $43.89 is as low it it went since then, that was with 10x average volume; today, barely more than 4xV and they couldn't get it under $45. I mean, there's still short positions open, so that's ultimately going to raise the price too. So, I know they want their calls to print, but, I doubt this goes back under $40; if it didn't retest sub $40 with 10x average volume, what's going to make it retest that price; because we had well under 5x today, so, the volume is going to regress towards the mean too. And the mean price for VIAC has been above fifty and nearly over seventy from 13'-19' that's where I think it goes back to and higher, because, it's been green weeks for VIAC 72% of the time over the last 52."

2021-03-30 21:12:11,wallstreetbets,"GME is about to breakout and I think this is why Hello Apes and hedgies, this is my first attempt at a TA and i will be utilizing technical indicators. 

So for those of you who do not know what the MACD or RSI are, strap the fuck up, put on your got damn helmet, tell your wife's boyfriend to bring a banana smoothie and lets see if we can put a few wrinkles in your brain.

&#x200B;

**THE MACD**

&#x200B;

So the MACD stands for Moving Average Convergence Divergence. It is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price. The **MACD** is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. I'll explain this in a much more simpler way later on in this post with nice lines.

&#x200B;

**THE RSI**

&#x200B;

The RSI or Relative Strength Index is  a momentum indicator used in technical analysis that measures the  magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold  conditions in the price of a stock or other asset. This is generally measured between the numbers 70 and 30. The higher the RSI gets to 70, the more overbought the security is considered. The lower to 30 it is, the closer it gets to being in what is called oversold territory. 

&#x200B;

Now i know some of you might have some crayons in your nose rn preventing some wrinkles from forming so this is where you are going to want to pay attention.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[current RSI and MACD](https://preview.redd.it/qurwnd2x57q61.png?width=546&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b11dabddb3c430d4a7be6b9fd6a9ed8dc110dd6)

So in this pic above, is the current MACD and RSI on the 1 day time frame. The RSI shows it is about 50, which is neutral. meaning it is not overbought or oversold. The MACD on the bottom is the real important kicker. You see how close those lines are together right now? Got damn that is what makes an Ape cry. This is indicative of a breakout. It has been consolidating around the same price, which deflates the RSI from overbought to neutral. In the bottom the bars going up and down below the midpoint shows the momentum of the security. Obviously red downward means downward trend, and green is vice versa. What is important is the far right how close the lines are.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xxc0xape67q61.png?width=328&format=png&auto=webp&s=10f67f9e4a093ae8d67ebf00095811fbd4b43522

This image shows you the MACD and RSI on the \*last\* breakout that we had. Back in earlier March it broke up to 348 before being absolutely fucking dumpstered harder than Lebron when he yammed on that one white guy. As you can see, the lines again right before breakout are practically touching. When the volume is almost not even visible above the neutral line, and it's alternating back and forth, the stock is getting ready to either fucking rocket to got damn mars, or tell you what the earth's core is actually made of.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This is yet again another example of the MACD showing great consolidation, and little to no major movement, and then fucking \*BAM\* that shit shoots up faster than a smack addict getting a free score. The close lines and minimal volume is \*KEY\*.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This is when it broke out at the end of January. LOOK AT THIS GOT DAMN MACD AT THE BOTTOM. Do you see how fucking close the lines are? Can you tell what happens next? Of course you know what the fuck happened or you wouldnt even be here reading this trash ass post right now. 

This is not financial advice and i'm just a crayon eating ape trying move up to fucking markers. 

TLDR: MACD and RSI says moon soon

Edit: The yellow line is the MACD line and the red line is the signal line. When the MACD line crosses it upwards the momentum is up meaning price increase. Obviously vice versa on a downward cross."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What's a stock?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"No offense, but why is a post that‚Äôs just talking about momentum indicators so upvoted?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hello. I too am a ape with crayons. 

You need to used the MACD and rsi indicators on multiple time levels to be accurate of a sure fire breakout and not just a daily break. I use robinhood (I know it‚Äôs a sin to even say now) and they offer charts from 1day, 7day, 1month, 3month, 1yr, to the 5yr. IVe been using these to trade successfully for a long time now. GME looks primed to run but not quite yet on a monthly level of the MACD. Once it‚Äôs ready there, the weekly and daily charts will show it too. 

THATS when we‚Äôll see a nice move. You have to have multiple crayons showing green dildos inbound."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Based on multiple TA indicators price is showing that it could make an upward move and also down. So my advice is pretend like I didn‚Äôt post anything and continue taking your best guess.

JUST. HODL. Everything will be taken care of in due time"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I think what he's saying is: hold and buy more.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,No sideways??
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,*Yes*
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It could also go sideways

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mr. Racoon Man, that is what our indicators are showing us. Since the probability is 50/50 (either goes up or goes down), therefore, I recommend to the board to go all-in with 10x leverage. This could be a return on bananas of 100x"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Indicators are just that, indicators.








Like the indicator on a car (or blinker as it's commonly called in the US), it can imply a car is turning but doesn't always mean it is. If you're trying to decide if it's safe to pull out as you believe the car is going to be turning depends on your confidence in the other car (the asset in the market)

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol this got me
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,If I was looking at GME like a normal stock I wouldn‚Äôt have had anything to do with it. What we want is a squeeze. Not a quick throttling. That‚Äôs how we end up with a ton of bag holders. IV is what I‚Äôm looking at. I want whales to figure it‚Äôs worth a punt on the squeeze.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"What? No lol. I don‚Äôt give shit what you do. But when I see someone being a useless dick bag, I‚Äôm more than happy enough to point at them. A little compassion goes a long way, my man. 
Rather than telling him his TA is a joke, why not just tell him why or link to a resource to help him learn. Bad TA doesn‚Äôt hurt you at all and if you help people learn how to do good TA, there‚Äôs a chance someone will point something out that you didn‚Äôt notice. The market isn‚Äôt the only thing you can invest in."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed.

Obviously I know nothing, but watching GME move today for about an hour this morning, there were 2 solid little pennant shapes that happened (so I drew my little shapes for the first time) and like it was planned they both broke out like the ""fundamentals"" said they should.  Blew my mind!!

I understand that there is very little left in the fundamental bucket where GME is concerned -- doesn't mean they don't exist.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look no further than the LTCM resolution or how AIG played out in 2008.

Long before GameStop‚Äôs stock destabilizes the market the SEC halts trading for 2 weeks, all parties sit down in a room, including lawyers and reps from your broker.

You‚Äôre buying this for that price is decided and it‚Äôs done, you don‚Äôt even get a yes/no dialog box popup.
Your account is adjusted and everyone moves on..
You don‚Äôt really think regulators are going to let GME destabilize folks retirements so your 5 shares can make millions do you? Does that sound reasonable or something that gets you re-elected ?

But we will never get there, if the price spikes up high again RH and other bargain brokers are going to tap out in the deposit again (loooooong before 1k a share) 
And then the price crashes.

As far as the other thing you mean the hedge?

Easy if I‚Äôm short 500 shares I just buy 5 long calls, my max loss is how the spread between the price I shorted at and the strike of the call. No more infinite loss and no chance of a margin call no matter how high the price gets."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly!! Is everyone mad?!? This sub is pretty much just a circle-jerk to encourage bag holding.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I didn‚Äôt buy in Gme until after it fell to 38.00 now I have averaged up to 160.00. Hmm sounds like I am doing it right this time.lol
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,315 to 176
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I can relate. From 111>77>148  gotta love a good sale even if you're averaging up ;)

I think day traders and some large institutions are swinging this stock and that‚Äôs why you see these 15-50$ moves in both directions. There‚Äôs just too much money to be made to not do it. I‚Äôve done it myself, a lot.

Anyway that‚Äôs what makes this hard to predict the end to, because everyone would love for this to keep swinging like this, myself included. I‚Äôm happy to buy to cover at 150 and ride an upswing for a bit. I‚Äôm here for $$$$ that‚Äôs it."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"So in the scenario I don‚Äôt think ever happens ? 

I mean I think the SEC steps in after breaking 1k a share.

If that were to happen, you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd take the value of the short holders liquidated, divide by number of shares needed and pay out the longs. 

The reality is those funds hold teachers pension, government municipal debt, 401ks, airline and other public union funds.  There‚Äôs no way they‚Äôre liquidating those, it‚Äôs just not happening for GameStop lol..

So I dunno man, but if you did a median over the life of the stock this transaction doesn‚Äôt work out in any of your favor."

We have issues with offering rural Canadians the same level of care as urbanites, and the issue can be magnified by the vast distance of some of those rural areas from the nearest big city, something that I think is a uniquely Canadian problem in its scope.  But overall, the issue of long wait times hasn‚Äôt been true since the massive budget cuts of the early-mid 90‚Äôs to balance the budget hamstrung some systems for a few years afterwords.  It‚Äôs laughable to think that an American would be so knowledgeable about Canadian politics as to to remember a 4-5 year stretch of budget issues from 25-30 years ago."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Getting an X-ray the day of isn't something that is difficult to get in most modern countries. A ""family doctor"" isn't a specialist. 

The wait time for most specialists in the US is several months. Take it from someone who has chronic health conditions. I also already have one medical bankruptcy (that I got despite having insurance), and my health insurance premiums are almost $1000 a month. The US healthcare system sucks. Give me Canada's (or any decent country who provides affordable healthcare) over the US any day."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also Canadian. I don't know where people are getting appointments the same day, but two years ago I had to go to a urologist for an 'urgent' matter. My family doctor was the one who referred me to the general hospital. It took them more than 45 days to book an appointment for me. By the time I went for my appointment the condition was not as severe so they couldn't find what was happening because they couldn't see anything. My girlfriend had to see a gynecologist and had to wait more than 2 months. They took some tests. And got back like 3 weeks later. A friend got a surgery done for a serious liver condition and the follow up appointment was like 8 months when in fact it had be less than 2 months. My girlfriend's grandma was in the hospital recently. We had to make sure that she was getting her Parkinson's meds. We called the hospital like crazy to get hold of the doctor who was dealing with her. It took them 3 days to get back to us and poor grandma was shaking like crazy because they didn't give her her parkinson's meds. The wait times are crazy. Whoever says otherwise are lucky for never having to deal with it. And I don't blame it to the system. There is a clear shortage of healthcare workers in Canada. But for now and so far, I have had to deal with these aforementioned wait times. However, I can't also help but say that I've seen everyone get treatment here. Literally everyone. It makes me proud that the system is equally accessible but yes the wait times is a problem that remains to be solved."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,">I always hear that you have to pay over 50% of wages in tax to pay for free healthcare. I never believed it but it is often said by republicans like Donald Trump

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because things like wait times mean nothing to the millions of Americans who literally forgo medical care for lack of insurance coverage and money.  A uniquely American problem, because citizens of countries with universal healthcare can‚Äôt even imagine not going to the doctor or ER when sick or hurt.  It defies logic how many Americans just gloss this over or explain it away as nothing."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Compare failure rates, infant mortality, surgical errors, hospital beds and doctors per person, and overall quality of care in universal systems in other developed nations to the US system and the US system for many aspects ranks mid-level or lower. Yes for some things the US system has good rates but overall the quality of care as measured by more objective stats like failure rates is mid-level at best. And that is insanely bad due to how much more the US is spending than other nations to have millions uninsured and underinsured and the vast majority of the population paying insane out of pocket costs despite having ""good"" insurance."

I'm sure there are many others. I haven't even started on skilled trades such as plumber, electrician, etc. Most of those require that you start as an apprentice, but as long as you learn you'll be making decent money after a couple of years. I also left out construction - that's usually double the minimum wage, but is also seasonal work.

Just a fragile little ego trying to convince a room full of people who know better that your glorious country is the pinnacle of human civilization. While we live in places with healthier, better educated citizens who are capable of learning from other places that do things better.

And the greatest irony of all: The many Americans who actually see the room for improvement and actively work to achieve better things get held back by blowhards like you."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait times are infinite or until something goes seriously wrong for the tens of millions uninsured or underinsured. Canada spends about 5,500 per person for healthcare. The Us spends just under 11k per person. Also Canada isn't the only system and many Canadians can spend under the table to get access if they want it quicker but poorer Canadians still don't go without care or bankrupted by high costs. There is no value to having a private system. Medicaid pays for a lot of poor people to get coverage while the middle and working class get bad care and think that because they don't have to wait a few weeks that they get better care than Canadians.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have been uninsured and been charged 5k for a hospital bill (ambulance services plus pain killers and an X-Ray administered . I negotiated it down to 1,800 dollars which was a significant discount but still massively more than the services were actually worth for a non-overnight stay where I wasn't even seen by a doctor. The point I am making is that the amount you are able to negotiate down to is still absurdly high compared to what the services are actually worth. You said you could talk a 5k bill down to 300 or less and that is plainly wrong. 

The USA spends 14% of its healthcare costs on administration. Compare that to the next highest country at 9% and most countries at 6-7% with some like the UK at 4%. The reason the US has such high administrative costs is due to hospitals, other providers and insurance companies having to have large staffs dedicated to just billing (which provides almost zero actual value.) 

Your company has to waste money haggling with a insurance company over benefits, the insurance company has to haggle with tens of thousands of doctors, providers and hospitals. Each insurance company has different billing codes, each policy has different levels of coverages, and providers can't get lump sum payments as they have to bill patient by patient as each patient has a different plan. 

High administration costs are the main driver of high pricing. Countries with universal systems have one set of billing codes (the governments) and one set of pricing. People also have access to a lot more preventative care which drives down costs as catching things early tends to make things a lot cheaper to treat."

Then why don't we remove the law that prevents interstate competition on healthcare and insurance

Yes some outcomes are better but the US system overall usually is given a mid-level ranking overall when it comes to objective health care measurements despite the US spending vastly more money on the system.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"sensor failure mid-flight is devastating to human pilots too. human pilots fly by sensor when they are in clouds, at night, fog, etc. sometimes the horizon gets... confusing, and if a pilot isn't looking at their sensors, they can accelerate right into the ground or a mountain."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm not sure how this new type of aviation is different from past failed attempts to create city helicopters lines which mostly failed in the past. Although those failed mostly because were not enough cost efficient. And noisy. If eVTOL could improve on that maybe they may have chance.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree that there are better short term plays atm, but I dont think they need to have a unique product to be uber successful. All they need to take over an industry is a good setup and to that end a charismatic ceo and great deals with good customers is fantastic for future potential. As long as they play the right cards and dont fuck up to bad. I see this becoming another tesla. After all, electric cars are nothing to special, but tesla still got ahead through intelligent buisness decisions and a memetastic ceo."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Remember, it was the WSB play prior to Citron calling it a casino. And then, WSB shifted all its attention to Gamestop which is the biggest WSB play to date.  Selling CCs should be the play at this time to lower its cost or puts to acquire more shares."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Existing safety tech fails sometimes.  Now let's multiply flights per year exponentially and the intervals between incidents would increase too.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Most sensor failures only lead to disaster because the pilots were retarded. See AF447, and that Turkish Airlines flight that crashed just short of Amsterdam Schiphol Airport."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"All I'm saying is that the general public is not suited to piloting aircraft, especially not helicopters. 

>I just wonder what was the public sentiment when internal combustion became all the rage. Were people saying the public would just crash them into buildings willy nilly?

That's an interesting way of saying things without actually saying anything. Is it possible that posing rhetorical questions like that is just a way to avoid having to be correct or having to commit to a position?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,A vtol aircraft is a fuckin helicopter if I've ever seen one lol. Gotta have helicopter training to fly one.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"no this is false, even the most seasoned pilots can die if sensors are broken. you can't always see the horizon clearly. and if you start accelerating towards the ground, you don't have much time to react. 

also saying the pilots are retarded isn't going to bring dead passengers back from the dead or make defending yourself against wrongful death lawsuits any cheaper."

Helicopters can take off and land vertically...but are much slower in flight...and much more difficult to pilot...you actually need a pilot license and a helicopter pilot license."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude I know what an Osprey is. Taking it off is like flying a helicopter on hard mode. Flying a helicopter is like flying a plane on hard mode.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,In what ways does a vtol aircraft differ from a helicopter during landing and takeoff?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It literally fits the definition of helicopter when in VTOL mode.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh...I get it now.

A Zebra has 4 legs for walking/running and a Lion has 4 legs for walking/running.

So...THEY MUST BE THE SAME ANIMAL."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It doesn't, you are correct."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs not my point.

My only point is they‚Äôre different aircraft.

VTOL aircraft can also do STOL...no helicopter can do that."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Obviously they aren't identical. Neither is a chinook vs a blackhawk. 

In what ways are vtol aircraft different from helicopters when taking off or landing? Don't they have similar difficulties in control and stability? A VTOL aircraft is a helicopter with extra steps."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I love your name
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Look up the definition of helicopter. The V-22 is a helicopter. It's ability to transition to airplane is irrelevant.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I get what you and others are saying but I think the problem is some people use TA in this way.

At the end of the day indicators well, they indicate things.  Candlesticks provide valuable information.  It's just data.  How you decide to use that data is up to you, but having more information has helped me and I'm sure many others make good trades."

TA doesn't exist in a vacuum. Don't buy every time RSI hits 30 or sell every time it hits 70, but momentum trading is real and like it or not TA can help inform those plays. 

Conversely, if a stock goes up, down, up, down, don't just draw the most bullshit cup and handle and call it a day. This is just another tool in your kit and not gospel.

I‚Äôm just here to tell you a fact. Dowsing works, it is commonplace, and has been used for centuries. She may be a scientist but sometimes witchcraft just works. Sometimes TA works as well, though I prefer darts to pick my tickers."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Does the dig authority know she does this? Avoiding utility lines is too big a deal to relegate to a horoscope instead of the standardized tools. Ignoring this makes her a hazard.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The dig authority? Lol. Ok my dude. When I say it is commonplace, whatever authority you think doesn't use it, they do. Private contractors use it. Government contractors use it. They all do it, and they all know they all do it, because it works. They use it to speed up the process of finding things underground. They don't do it exclusively or without confirmation, because that would be ridiculous. Almost as ridiculous as how angry you are about the concept of dowsing. You have way too much faith in the accuracy of the maps you would 'look up the exact location on.' They are notoriously out of date and inaccurate because they were made by people, and people are lazy and make mistakes. You don't know what you are talking about. You speak like someone who has soft hands. It's way faster to use dowsing in the field to find things, and then confirm them physically. Dowsing works. It is a fact. And you are a bell end."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm convinced this thread is propaganda to get me to look up what dowsing is and to eventually pay into some pyramid scheme.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right. It is used all the time in the field to great effect, even if it doesn't under scientific method. If it still works, does it matter?  It isn't science, it is witchcraft, it is weird, but it works."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"actually, most worksites use no dowsing at all. they call the dig line like a normal person."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I get what you're saying but the extent to which it ""works"" isn't actually the dowsing, it's user input. That's why it fails scientific testing. You're either a bloke who knows where cables are because you know where the cables are usually run or you should have been using ground-penetrating radar or current detection or something.."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,">  even if it doesn't under scientific method. If it still works,

no it doesn't. it categorically doesn't work. it's been studied to death, been the subject of a randi foundation prize, been attempted for various bomb finding and contraband detection without success, and more.

there are thousands of years of evidence that dowsing does not work."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"She tells me usually the drawings she's given aren't reliable, and they'll use dowsing to help find a target more quickly than dragging the machine around, and then when they have the target they point the machine at it and go, 'yep, there it is.' Im not arguing with you, it's not scientific. Regardless of how it works, or why it works, it does, and that's all that matters when time is money."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah, you beat me to the Randi reference.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,There are two channels related to volatility that are closing tight around the current price. When this happens if the price breaks through these channels it usually signals a significant change in price action. The Stochastic is an oscillator based on the relative strength index it being basically 0 means over sold. Pairing over sold with these tight squeezing channels could mean a possible rise in price and if high enough it would break through these channels and that is usually followed by a big move.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks to you, my ABCL $25 calls that I bought at 6:30AM for $400 per contract are now worth $1100!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Abcl is a bit misunderstood sometimes I think. It‚Äôs not a typical biotech company. They use their proprietary tech to help biotech/ pharmacy companies discover antibody therapies (humira is a drug of this type). They get paid upfront, which offset the risk of failure, and get royalties if the partners succeed in their discoveries. So it‚Äôs more like a pick-axe play imo. Most risks / speculations are shouldered by the partners and not Abcellera. Because of this, they can scale very well too - as of now they have over 90 partners (or more by now), including some big names!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Personally, I'm targeting the 40's short term. I really want to see 50 or higher but with the volume it averages and where its at now it might be a reach. Expecting an announcement on approval for bmav in europe soon so there might be a nice gap up when that does occur."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Im glad it worked out! Hope the train keeps rolling and you can realize the gains
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"No worries! It‚Äôs good to have a counter voice, I play negative Nancy in plenty of other scenarios just to hash out alternatives. As enthusiastic as I am about ABCL there are definitely risks to this company and their recently filed 10k goes in depth into them. It‚Äôs just hard to get into all of the pros and cons of one particular company. One prime example they have sued BLI for 12 patent infringements (BLI is part of cathie wood‚Äôs ARKG), their tech is quite similar to ABCL (and well getting sued for it now)."

I mean if you don't believe in the manipulation at hand look at our beloved gamestop. Gamestop is also a solid company that got manupulated down to just under 2.50, I bought 250 gamestop for $750 XD"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"What a bullshit show. Hertz is bankrupt. This company is nearly dead. They have old cars, only tried to maxize their profits for years and didn't bought new cars.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"First, I‚Äôm not to side with this guy, because I don‚Äôt believe there will be another GME for sometime. That said, I feel like every market crash there was someone saying ‚Äúwell, at least that won‚Äôt happen again...‚Äù

10 years later....CRASH. Same thing different name. Insane margin, hedgefund gets margin called, other hedgefunds follow and we start over. So I could see another GME happening in 10-20 years."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,But why? How much higher can it go if it‚Äôs already trading at 6x 2028 revenues?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"dude I think you're right

maybe I was trying to buy 200 contracts! holy shit!!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think it is wildly unreasonable that they'll be at $4 bn in revenue in 7-8 years if the number of states with sports gambling ramps at the expected rate.  That's less than 20% market share of the sports betting/igaming TAM.

I also don't think that the $3 bn initial SPAC valuation matters that much.  From my understanding, there was a lot of upside for the major shareholders to not have a wildly high valuation the way the deal was structured.  They're enjoying the ride up and didn't cash out immediately.

I do think it is rich, but that's an optimistic case at their current structure.  My guess is that there is also going to be industry consolidation and additional vertical and horizontal expansion."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably honestly get up to like 15-20x like the rest of them. They will/are pivoting to having the sports live stream directly in the app so you can bet with 0 friction. I think UFC and esports is gonna start that up for them. So then you have to price them like a media disturbing company on top of the gambling.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay so they are at 4bn revenue after 7 years. So we are currently trading at 6x 2028 revenue figures?  I just don‚Äôt see when this investment pays off. I mean I think it‚Äôs a fine holding to have if you want to have exposure to the industry, but to YOLO on? There‚Äôs probably more thoughtful thesis out there. But I mean if this king makes bank and made the call of a century, then he‚Äôs right and I‚Äôm comfortable being wrong here."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean they are currently trading at 25x 2021 revenues.... I just don‚Äôt see it. Y‚Äôall have fun with this one though, happy to be wrong if you guys get your trendies. I‚Äôll stick to the lower valuations ‚ù§Ô∏è"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,E-Trade should be 65c per contract and if you do more than a certain amount it's 50c.  Ru sure it isn't 5 bucks for all 10 contracts?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh I should have added that, yea i agree, not a YOLO lol.  

I actually think 2028 revenue will be significantly higher because america is full of degenerate gamblers - I'd model it at more like 6 bn, but that is even outside of DKNG's projections."

Given how AAL is performing today, I'm inclined to think this is the case.

What's more likely? AAL up past 26 and rising by over $2billion in market cap? Or falling below yesterday's high by a buck and losing about $600mil in market cap.

It will actually make money by giving money (if the short squeeze is to be believed). Billions!

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah he was kind of a treasured meme outside of finance until he shit on GME. I personally am all for coked up TV hosts yelling about ridiculous things- imagine how fun coked up golf commentary would be?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Like, $185 is the fucking floor now for it. It dips past floor, I grabs some more. 

Love it when these out of touch boomers who should have retired after the housing crash say it‚Äôs a $5 stock while it breaks $200."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel this. Every talking head on TV is 100% certain of their correctness despite being constantly wrong.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,TO BE FAAAIIIIRRR
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree, but I'd also add that it was kind of a dying company due to limp dick management despite it being in such a growing space. It's like they had an actual money printer but the management was too incompetent to just swap out a new ink cartridge. Throw that printer in someone else's hands...

But yeah, I'm not expecting the general public and especially boomers to understand it until everything's in place."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's a bit more complicated than that. He's giving advice to people who buy once per month and sell once per year. and in that scenario, GME is awful. I mean imagine if he had given a buy rating at 40 and people bought it at 330?

Sure if you're a kid or a day trader you figure 40 ->450 -> 40 -> 330 ->120 ->200 -> (160?) is awesome because if you time it reasonably right you can make a few K to a few mill.

Imagine now you are forced to buy it at 330 (due to a buy rating) and hold it for years? You may have to wait a full decade to break even assuming you ever break even. Try buying yahoo in 2000 and see where you are today.

I can guarantee you GME will take many years to be WORTH 330. It can be priced 330 in two days, but if you don't follow the market you want something that climbs $5 per month and never really stops. Not something that does +50 -70 +20 -40 +70.

It's a different way of investing and statistics so far seem to say it's better to make 10% each year than to make 50% per month till you blow your account. 

There are some exceptions of course, but to go to battle assuming YOU will survive, is dumb."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"A lot of boomers are just young people that were dumb back then and stayed dumb.

Your age isn't a badge of intelligence. Odds are you're as smart as the average investor, i.e. not very. 

Being old is just icing."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Until you see their short attack track record... If someone touches a hot surface and gets burned and avoids it then that's one thing, but someone who repeatedly burns themselves twenty times before finally thinking it might not be a good idea deserves some criticism."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"To be fair nothing has changed YET.

The whole ""we'll take gamestop online so it's now worth 100x"" is openly stupid. Taking it online is an excellent idea. It's also just an idea. The execution can make or break the company. Since when is taking a company online some sort of guaranteed success? Is it 1999 already?

Running on fumes is fine if it lands you somewhere safe eventually.

Running HIGH on fumes while going towards a mountain will make you happy but you won't see the gain before you crash.

We are at the mercy of institutional investors propping up the price to the current level because they love farming retails/smaller fish (which tend to buy high and sell low). Once that hype dies down, they will drop the floor and run for the exit faster than retails can activate stop losses. Ask those who bought at 330 what they think of GME having a strong floor.

It can literally go to 50 tomorrow and spend the next month achingly climbing back to 100. We saw that happen from 230 to 120 literally 4 market days ago. Where was the retail might doing then?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"They don't have to even get into those markets. they don't need to build a platform like steam. Use stores to host e-sports events, sell merch, sell consoles and gear, sell computers and parts, maybe pc workshops, exclusives etc. cash in on growing e-sports in general, sponsor/make teams, pay per view events, maybe even a gambling platform to bet on those games, there are soo many possibilities. They'll figure it out. They have the right people they have the infrastructure, the fanbase and they just received tens if not hundreds of millions worth of adcampaigns for FREE for 3 months now.

The people selling you the narrative have a vested interest in you thinking it's more than what it is, because it means you'll pay more for it."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"To me, that actually poses a value add. While the lot of digital offerings has been around for a long while, gamestops finance infrastructure of people could be a good leverage to distribute games. 

Example. Valve and Nintendo could dump the sales to gamestop. At this point probably without much of a hitch. Valve and Nintendo could dump their finance departments down a LOT. Instead of dealing with 1000's of sales per month, they just have to process 1 monthly consolidated invoice to gamestop. For them this opens up office space for more developers etc. Gamestop finance at headquarters grows back into its old space by hiring more people to process single games sales and paying the monthly invoice to a couple more vendors. Wait, one more vendor as I'm sure gme already has Nintendo setup as a vendor. Sounds like a shift in people without necessitating new real-estate deals. Of course this is assuming gme hasn't changed locations or added Corp locations. And same for Nintendo USA and Valve."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit, the beginning of that is legitimately impressively wrong! His level of incompetence never fails to surprise me."

Which of these two groups of people don't need to report to the SEC regularly?
  
A) Archegos...and other family funds
  
B) retail investors in general
  
The answer is both. Both is the answer. The people in charge of the economy can and will make the ""connection"" between ""retail risk"" and ""leveraged family fund risk"".

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's legal for the simple construct that they make it more complex and hide it behind jargon than what could be legally enforced. Laws, especially in the US and to a lesser extent in Europe, typically get interpreted literally. This means that an action has to be specifically called out, or within the realm of interpretation, to be illegal, there is no counter factual so it's not that it is legal it's that it's simply not illegal. Banks and their counterparts know this, and so have made massive sums of money making the picture so murky that it is essentially impossible to write legislation that can control this behavior which has allowed them to then control the rule writers to not only prevent themselves from legislation that they don't like, but also protecting them by denying entry to others."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Generally the bank gets long the underlying and then sells the upside or downside or both sides of the movement of that security for an interest rate on the face value of the swaps.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Disagree on the metaphor - renting is a right to use an asset, not benefit or suffer based on changes in it's value - you can't ""use"" a stock. A mortgage entitles the borrower the rights to the value of the home asset the same way that archegos benefited from the value changes in the stock. While the bank structured the financing like a rental, the economics were more like a mortgage. 

Realistically, there isn't a great metaphor because derivatives are more complicated, but equity swaps sound a lot me like something created to prevent tax and reporting to be properly assessed. 

Ah, risk management. The gold standard of excellence. This story is pretty crazy!"

Rich people go to better schools, have less stress(which can be good or bad), have more toys(and children that have fewer ""toys"" generally are less intelligent since their brains develop differently), and have better health care(lack of medical care such as dental or checkups more likely lead to mental issues due to the biological ramifications). You just want to believe that you are just like rich people. You are not unless you are rich. You yourself have a superiority complex. Get over [it.](https://it.You) You are not as good as the rich in some ways and better and others. But don't be a moron that things growing up or living rich doesn't have it's intellectual benefits, it just reinforces that you are a moron."

The big banks including the central banks have the markets rigged tighter than a twelve year old virgin.  Profits are privatized, losses are socialized.  It's always been that way.  Washington and WS are in bed together and they ain't getting a divorce anytime soon."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure, it's more comparable than it used to be though. 100 or more years ago if you were reach you could actually go to school and be educated when if you weren't then chances are you would be a moron. Things are more ""balanced"" because knowledge has become so much more fluid... but the imbalance is still there.

Since morons can still become rich(e.g., most movie stars or entertainers) and have kids in which the kids end up being just your average moron but with a lot of money, they can end up even dumber than average. (e.g., look at your average TV star's children and chances are they are spoiled idiots) 

&#x200B;

I'm not saying things are so simple. Things are changing. Wealth can make laziness and ignorance, but poverty generally puts in far more barriers to achieve such things. A person that has to work a shit job to survive because they are poor does not have the time to educate themselves like a rich person who does not have to work. It's not so much about if they will do it but that there is more opportunity/less resistance for the wealthy to become more intelligent, not that they necessarily will capitalize on that."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Wells Fargo also reported exiting it's position without taking a loss.  It seems the American banks were in the know while the foreign banks were left bag-holding.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Who said I was enlightened?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't need to keep it in mind, I said that already in my posts in several different ways. There are obviously many kinds of intelligence. The fact of the matter is though that some intelligence is more important than others(weighted wise). Mathematical intelligence is very important because is related to the ability to generalize/abstract which is basically what intelligence is. What makes humans intelligence compared to animals is their ability to generalize abstract so anything that improves that is very useful to increase intelligence... but abstraction and generalization in a vacuum is pointless. Mathematical intelligence amplifies what is already there.

Rich people generally did not need ""street smarts"" and most ""street smarts"" ruins people because while they might gain valuable skills they also gain psychological disorder. (e.g., a woman being raped on the street might learn valuable skills but generally is going to end up with some mental issues also... or someone ending up homeless, or whatever. Same goes for rich but it's just far rarer. E.g., them being hunted down in a revolution, etc)"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Assuming an enforceable agreement, probably more of a quasi- contract.  Hwang wasn't disclosing his positions so it's possible some of his bankers were unaware of their exposure until it was too late."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,They didn‚Äôt actually execute this in writing. It was a gentleman‚Äôs agreement via conference call.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Precisely.  Mortgages failing aren't a huge problem if their risk is rated properly.  The system has mechanisms for dealing with risky investments.  And that mechanism is rating them poorly so things like pension funds and the like that are legally forbidden from engaging in risky investments don't bank on them.  But the ratings agencies just broke everything.  And I know one of them got fined or something, but they seemed to bear no responsibility.  It was just too much easier to say 'poor people welched on their mortgages and that was the problem!' and the American public just love to hate on the poor... despite the fact they ARE the poor.  Because they've been convinced they are all temporarily inconvenienced millionaires."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,They're gonna have to up their retail space. I don't really see this as their route imo. Home VR setups are becoming more affordable overall. I imagine they're more going towards a Stadia style streaming service. Probably one where you don't have to directly pay for the games on the service.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,A VR experience with a full haptic suit and room to move around?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"GameStop is not a tech company.  They don't have any tech to sell at the moment.  

The physical distribution and trading of games is  done mostly online by Amazon and others, but physical distribution has been on the way out long before Covid.  Steam and others own the PC market. Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft own the sales for their respective consoles. All via digital distribution.  This is what GameStop used to do and now it's been taken away from them.

Now in a bizarre twist of fate they have a load of new money to play with and they've hired a lot of 'top talent'.  It's hard to see what they can do to save GameStop that leaves it as anything resembling GameStop though.  Why not just start a new company since the business must be totally different. Getting involved in E-sports fine... But in what capacity and why do they need their chain of stores to do it especially in Covid times. Renting out VR systems is a temporary at best business.  And again, why not do it online. 

That's why I'm pessimistic. If you have another angle then please explain.  I think the C Suite at GameStop are more likely buying their next jobs by scratching some other C Suite backs.  Apes scratch each others backs."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Since GME became a thing I've been waking up with a pretty nice candlestick of my own
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Gme is what I started my stock life on and I literally can‚Äôt imagine investing in a stock that doesn‚Äôt move 30% a day. I‚Äôll probably end my investing life after this
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Im not rich, and i unfortunately didnt get into GME until about a month or so ago. But I have followed all of the advice. Read my DD and diamond handed every share I've purchased since the start. Like many of you I have become extremely unproductive at my job, luckily I have that luxury and my future will continue to afford me that luxury after this explosion we are all waiting for. I have a small number of shares only 20 and I will buy more as I can as im sure you will all be doing as well. I fantasize about the possibility of retiring when this is all said and done. 
The real point of this message is this. With sooo many apes holding and while reading it sounds like globally there are even more apes. It could honestly be that apes own 2x or even more the entire float. I decided that I will even at the very tip top hold on to at least 1 share forever. Just think of the effect that would have of every holding ape never let go of just 1 of their bananas. What if this float could NEVER be completely closed on? I am forever Holding 1 share."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What up my favorite apes. Congrats on price going up again today. You proved again I know nothing given my past shit talking. Chad‚Äôs for everyone tonight.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone else still think AMC is a distraction? I still have not found any quality DD on their sub and I feel like half of them don‚Äôt realize the reason GME squeeze potential is so much higher because of how small GME float and outstanding shares are (6X smaller than AMC). I feel like so many people are just buying AMC because it‚Äôs cheaper per share but in terms of market cap it‚Äôs only 2.6 more expensive than AMC. I feel like AMC could be a good play and may even have a decent squeeze but GME is the MOASS and I feel like AMC apes don‚Äôt realize how much better GME is because they think since AMC is cheaper it‚Äôs the better play.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably not the global economy. People and businesses would probably seek those services formerly provided by wrongdoers from other competitors, who are currently much smaller but would become bigger through the flood of new customers.

There would be lots of pain and lots of mistakes and most employees would just be poached, but the same customers would be served by a company with different leadership, different culture, and maybe new laws. 

But that won't happen because they'll tell everyone ""the world will collapse""."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Because of the lumber price going up?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"They're still a thing, yes. But also if rates go up the sticker price goes down because people can't borrow as much (and they buy based on monthly payment anyways). Those who bought at low rates will lose money if they sell."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I had an argument with some ransoms over on r/stocks a few weeks ago about this. Turns out some markets such as in the US, mortgages are usually fixed for the life of the loan. So a rate change won't effect you in that case unless you move or refinance. Other markets fix rates for only a few years at a time, so a rate increase will push up everyone's repayments after a while.

Edit. *randoms, not ransoms. lol"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree with that but it works both ways if interest spikes so does your monthly payment so even if the house is cheaper you‚Äôre still paying out the ass monthly into interest payment instead of back into the house. The housing market is a lose lose and it‚Äôs set up to make the banks money. 

Just like the stock market there are exceptions to every rule and there will be people to make money of the housing market but the majority of us are left holding bags. 

Sorry for my pessimistic outlook."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Lumber seems to be at a plateau rite now. It's sheet goods that are going to cripple everything. We will see atheist another 25% increase on top of where everything is now by the end of next month. Manufactures of vinyl products and windows can't get the raw materials to produce anything so prices will climb and lead times on orders will push out even further. Most window manufactures have cut off smaller retailers all together because they can not meet the demand.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Variable rate mortgages are a thing, and were a big part of the 2008 crash."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh that's fine, I want to watch it all burn."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the all the info
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,No problem if you have any specific questions ask away.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. Honestly if there is another decent-sized crash, I'll probably look into buying a new house, but I'll keep the one I am currently living in.

It will rent for enough to cover mortgage taxes and insurance, and I could upgrade to a bigger house in a nicer area.

Only way I know of to avoid eating shit in a housing crash is to avoid selling, and buy if you can, so holding on to a previous house until the market recovers and possibly selling it then seems like a safer bet (provided you can get decent tenants, but that wouldn't be a problem around here)."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a solid stock coming off of a great year during COVID. I expect them to continue to beat earnings as we continue to open up post COVID and for the strong summertime sales.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Think it will hit $28 (today)?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,RKT also had the special dividend as an extra catalyst to attract retail and cost the shorts 5% extra borrow fee. Let's see how the lockup effects the price in the coming few trading sessions.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Any new thoughts? Still interested but SCARED TO ENTER!!! OoOoOo
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,For those looking for ammo - you should go to your local Academy and ask them when they get their ammo shipment in (as all stores are different).  They should be able to tell you.  Then you should start lining up at the store at 5:30/6am on the day they receive their shipment and they will go down the line and take everyone's order.  Just a pro-tip.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Executives can and often do serve as board members in multiple companies at the same time.  Even CEOs of companies are sometimes paid to be board members of other (non-competing) companies while they act as a CEO.  Steve Jobs was a board member of Disney while he was Apple's CEO.

Amazon executives joining Gamestop's board doesn't mean that they've cut ties with Amazon.  At their level, the multi-year non-competes and NDAs they sign 100% guarantee that their two jobs cannot and do not overlap (eg, they won't be able to directly port over trade secrets that they were privy to in Amazon into Gamestop even if they quit Amazon now), so being on both boards and collecting two paychecks is a completely feasible option.  The only real reason to cut ties on taking a new board spot would be 'to spend more time with the family'"

And apparently zjz visited.

And Fanny isn't allowed to look at Remy pics anymore.

And there was an AMA of some sort that I can't figure out.

And Cramer has testicles below his knees.

And something about a cramer AMA but I can't figure out whether that's theoretical or what. Or whether it's related to aforementioned testicles comment.

And we have 3 rat fuckers now.

And something about mods giving people piss martinis. I *need* context for that one plz.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"u/GoBeaversOSU gave it to me, not sure what it is but it did the trick"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm not watching new, probably zjz or sdevil or idk who‚Äôs on new rn.  Or maybe a bot."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Normally yes but we have a legit bracket with the guy crushing us and he has UCLA vs Baylor. He‚Äôs only ever watched an Olympic sports game. He‚Äôs going to have so many points he might win if he loses
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Never mind I forgot I had a free $10 bet and threw it on them. I want them to win too
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs a close game but no points have been scored.  I wonder if it‚Äôll go into overtime like the UCLA Alabama game.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre still losing to me, yes"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"That would have boosted him pretty far, Ngl, so it was only to regain Canadian bonus points. u/competitivebunny will be happy at least"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I already got busted by Memetron for plotting to abuse one of zjz's bots. They're lurking everywhere!

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,You were not. u/GoBeaversOSU has never left #1 spot. I just forget if I moved you to 3rd because u/memetron9000 is really sneaky and whole the soda water thing.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,BUN WHAT DID YOU DO
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,The community bank is sitting at almost 3 million coins.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I was using shreddit since I don‚Äôt want to kill my whole history.  I wonder if there‚Äôs a way to edit the part of the code editing comments out so it just deletes.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly. I wouldn‚Äôt feel insecure about this at all.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,His nuts probably hang past his knees at this point
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,i would do that for sure
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol yes.. I also unlocked it now otherwise I will get tagged all over Reddit
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Nothing. Losing rich would not help me. He‚Äôs my fizzy co-mod and that would only give me more work

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you use ThinkorSwim, you can add ATR studies to charts if you want to get this info a bit easier."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"But if ATR gives me a better-than-chance prediction that the stock will be volatile, and other data (eg recent price history, candlestick patterns, changes in fundamentals) tell me the stock is on its way up and will continue to do so... how is that not a better-than-chance prediction that the price will accelerate upwards?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Try a tarot reading
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It doesn‚Äôt predict, it tells you what‚Äôs already happened... think I‚Äôve explained it enough it‚Äôs not that difficult to understand"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,That's what I'm getting from this conversation.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Now I'm starting to think you're the dumb one.

What is the value of a descriptive statistic of past data if it gives you absolutely no information about the future?

Either the ATR can inform my future moves (has predictive value any amount greater than flipping a coin) or it doesn't predict and only tells my what already happened. Pick one."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fucking smooth brain Jesus...

I‚Äôve already made it very clear it doesn‚Äôt predict it tells you the average range the stock moves (up or down) given a specific time frame. Even if the number is positive that can still mean a move down! 

It does give you information, it tells you the most likely scenario so you can put probability in your favour. If a stock moves up or down 10% on average per month then if you set a stop 5% out chances are you will stop out and if you set a target of 20% gain for the month chances are it won‚Äôt hit

It‚Äôs very simple... it‚Äôs not a predictor of a stocks moves its a look at the stocks historic range so you can plan a trade accordingly. It tells you the most likely move up or down but the direction could be any... if you thinks it‚Äôs bullish get bullish and vice versa. The data helps you to structure the trade so you are more likely for it to play in your favour"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"... did you think I was saying High ATR = price goes up, Low ATR = price goes down? Because I wasn't, at any point. Damn, my brain's not that smooth üòî."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,üòÇ
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What are your positions?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Research studies are prepped to begin the blinded cross over event, where all research participants will become vaccinated.. Novavax is anticipating have their EUA by the start of next month."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I have some  call options for 4/16 and some for 5/21
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm all in at this point, but do you think the approvals are priced in as well? Since the data from all phases are good, you think people are already expecting that it'll get approved? It being priced-in and not lifting off even with approvals is what I'm concerned about."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think some level of approval is baked in yes. But no way all of it is.im not 100% certain of approvals, and i certainly wasnt before final data and all the recent news, and the price has actually dipped amongst all the stellar news lately.
Id say it was priced in  2 months ago now.
Now its oversold.
The data readouts caused some approval pricing to become baked in , or even most of it. And now it has fallen a bunch
 Stellar entry point still here.
Ive had same worry but at the same time novavax has 0 products right now so id be amazed if an approval didnt bump us real good.
Theres gotta be a whole class of bio tech investors whos strategy does not involve pre approval biotechs.
Also right now pricing seems entirely focused on covid vaccine.
Rsv and nanoflu and covid/nanoflu combo and future variant boosters seem to be lost in the mix and serve as potential not baked in future catalysts.

Not to mentiom, what disease will they try to prevent with vaccine next, this time with tens of billions in their coffers?

I hold 100 shares with 170 cost average. Im biased. Idk if im overly optimistic or not. I like the stock.
People who bought prior peaks and didnt average down may not end up happy. Or they may.
Anyone who has a good entry average however imo will benefit greatly."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Same thing you ate today if 4 grand makes any kind difference in your budget.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I‚Äôm gonna need to see the current update....

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Any though to de-risk by watching the OTM call premium well above your current strikes and shorting when they guarantee a profit from spikes over the next 2 yrs .  Takes some off the top end and can guarantee a profit and free bull spread position when conditions are right.

350 on 3/16/22

Already blown up 650, 600, 550 and 500 on 3/17/21 - they were on track until the 20% day. Oh well."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you don‚Äôt mind, what‚Äôs your thesis on why it‚Äôs going to 350?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"My thesis is that it is hugely overvalued with not much to back up. I like Tesla, but Im also realistic. First, this year, the European manufacturers won't need the CO2 pooling, so that's a huge chunk of revenues going away. 

Plus as an EV driver, I follow the market closely. There is a chunk of great EVs coming out that are frankly as good or better. Take Hyundai/Kia - they have the Ioniq 5 and Kia EV6 as well as a Genesis one. Lots of room, cool designs, efficient and charges back to ,80% in 20 minutes. Tesla is limited by 400 V architecture, while they have 800V, which means they will be able to charge faster and with less wear on the battery. And best of all, they cost less. 

Similarly Volkswagen, while not making as good EVs as Hyundai or Tesla, are producing massive amounts of EVs that seem to suit the average taste in Europe, he most important market. Tesla has an edge in China but there are domestic competitors plus you are always at the mercy of this totalitarian government. 

When it comes to charging infrastructure, Tesla has an edge in the US and in parts of Europe. But not in some big EV markets in Europe (Norway, Germany etc.). Similarly the open Hyper Charging networks are expanding rapidly.

Lastly, it's not only Tesla enthusiasts buying Teslas anymore, but Tesla still hasn't gotten the QC issues fixed. Which leads in a lot of disappointment. Case in point was the beta testing fo LFP batteries on customers in Europe. The batteries weren't calibrated, the charging speeds limited to snail pace. Tesla enthusiasts might be forgiving, but not the average Joe who spent 40000 on a car and then it's a lottery whether you get the crappy LFP battery or a functioning one. 

So these are my thoughts. But I'm aware that the market isn't rational."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy fk bro you seen Tesla today? You bought the fk out of that dip. Damn good call
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cool, thanks for explaining"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks homes, we should find out tomorrow that Tesla grew ~100% YOY, then V9 Beta comes out, we find out how profitable the Shanghai Model Y is... this is a long term play but there are plenty of short term catalysts that are gonna be quite pleasing"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Stupid question because I don‚Äôt do options - but if your first call at 850 comes in the money in the next few weeks (however unlikely) can you hit the execute button and take them tendies? Or is this play only cashable on the due date in 2023?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"So you can sell the option at any time but executing early, especially this early is a bad idea because you‚Äôd miss out on the ‚Äútime premium‚Äù of selling the option. It would still have say 18 months to keep going up so the value of selling the option would be much higher than the amount you would make by exercising it. My plan is sell a few at future peaks to hopefully have enough cash to exercise the rest at the end"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Balls of steel man best of luck to you!

From other sites:Shs Outstand **115.37M**

That what I was curious to understand. That's a huge difference...

Given the market cap is being reported as 40B on virtually all sites, the share count must be 2B number. That is why the >100% float number appears wrong. There's far more shares than being reported by some sites although market caps are correct."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,104 million  shares in the float. The rest are class D and owned by Dan G.

This one little statement is calling whoever was in control before are not a significant person . Also it‚Äôs showing anger and hatred for the person who was temporarily in control.
Whatever has happened has infuriated this person so much that it‚Äôs the focal point of his life right now

I believe someone has taken money away from him in some sort of way.

I was just asking because honestly my dream is to be a pro golfer.  Im already signed at a top d2 school for it and truly believe I can make it. But I'm pretty smart and my parents want me to get an engineering degree and to me it just seems like the safe option tbh. I really don't like school at all and I love golf more than anything else but idk its tuff"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"but like you said, i think when Im older like you (lol) i will regret not going for my actual dreams a lot more than wIill regret not taking the ""Safe"" option"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"For sure. 
Probably something you will always regret and think about. 
Possible to give yourself a timeline and a goal?

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,How much?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs your price target for it? Seems to keep going up like .5% per day no matter the market. Do you expect inflated food prices? (That‚Äôs why I bought in)
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao why and how mate. Why and how.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I plan to hold it. I see all the internet prepper people pushing storable food lately and it keeps going up. Might diversify into other food companies though I heard Heinz has a production issue rn
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,wow. have you tried fidelity or schwab
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Prod issue could be good yeah?  Keeps the price low if you want to buy more, if prices inflate they inflate regardless of production"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am thinking about going to go with Fidelity, maybe WeBull. WeBull starts their pre-market trading at 4am ET instead of 7-8am like most of the other brokers."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well if they control enough of the market production issues could inflate the food price even more. But does that translate into stock price? Wouldn‚Äôt it drop if it couldn‚Äôt produce as much.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"So let me get this straight:

Another group of geniuses, over at another hedge fund, run by more 'Masters of the Universe', decided that a brilliant way to trade in the current chaos was to lever up 5:1 and are shocked when things did not go their way, blew up, and caused all kinds of loses on anyone unfortunate enough to be invested with them or fronting them money; BUT ITS OUR (r/WSB) FAULT?

It is not like anyone had any warning or idea something like this could happen, like when Melvin Capital did a real 'gangbusters month' in January 2021 of being down 'only' 53% (in one month)!"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why do we need to point fingers? It's clearly obvious, isn't it?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Booyah!   Hahaha
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Follow up; Did Melvin Capital get a letter for their wonderful performance for January 2021 of being down 'only' 53% in one month?

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I seem to recall there was one brokerage firm (E.F. Hutton?) that in the early 1980s was as a matter of policy overdrawn on all their checking accounts. They would invest the money short term and collect the interest on it with the overdrafts being interest free.

The whole web fell apart one day when someone at a small bank refused to let a check for something like $50K clear the account, and that decline to pay setup a chain reaction default and they got caught.

The firm tried to claim 'it was a mistake' but then investigators found out they were doing this all over the place, and even had meeting with branch managers where one of the handouts on how to do this included zip lock bags of Monopoly money to show how much larger their bonuses could be if they did this routine real good."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Originally it was supposed to be a trust, a fund that is never touched. But then our money that we put in there was borrowed for wars and other expenses. The government left an empty file cabinet filled with IOUs. The program itself was sustainable all on its own until the government started borrowing from it. I can list sources but the info is pretty easy to get. But it was originally set up to be sustainable"

I know, it's no excuse and everyone who has been mistreated by their caregivers deserved better. Just think about the generational trauma that our parents had to endure and how they did not have any tools to deal with it, so they just perpetuated what was familiar... It sucks, big time.   
But once we hit our mature age we really need to see it for what it was and stop the circle of blame, shame, abuse, you name it. If you do better than they did you won the battle!!"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is guaranteed, but the problem as the defaults grow, who and how is it going to get paid. So far there are a number of people going into retirement still with student loans that can never be paid off plus eventually when they pass away that will be the end of any hope of repayment. 

Something like 15% to 20% of the one trillion or so in student loans are in trouble, but no one really takes much notice since we are spending an extra 3 or 4 trillion per year over revenue. Once that stops people will start to notice and then the 'real screaming' will start about 'how did this happen'.

It use to be that people would pay off their student loans early (less than 10 years) because things were going well in their career and they could easily afford it. Now we are lucky if someone can pay them off within 25 years on the extended repayment plan; and some people are on an income based plan with no payments currently owed since their income is so low but will get forgiven in 20 years. That will trigger a 1099C form for debt forgiveness and be taxable; so the person who took out a loan they could not repay at 25, will have it forgiven at 45  but then get hit with a massive tax bill on it."

Based on what I have heard from tradesmen I know, it seems like the beat play is to start in your early 20s, save money and really learn what you are doing. Then in your 30s start your own business doing it. Hire other 20 year olds to do the physical part while you focus on running the business.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,So an boomer doctor was telling me back in the day the play was go to med school and then declare bankruptcy right after graduation. Then in the 7 years you‚Äôre slaving away through residency and fellowship you get that bankruptcy all in the back of the fridge lol

People don't understand that you learn a lot of the advanced concepts of any related job through your degree. On-the-job training is entirely different and if you don't get a job in your field, then yeah you won't fucking use it. 

But, it's literally a proven fact that STEM degree holders are more employable with overall higher average wages and lower average unemployment.

Again - if the comments leading up to my reply were all bringing up ""experiences"" then it's fair to say that mine has to be legitimate too. As I've said a number of times now. I can take anecdotes to be irrelevant but can still put one forward for those who clearly think they are important. Which I've explained a number of times now. 

>Because this is a public forum. I sincerely hope you get your apparent anger management issues sorted out.

Lmao man, the purest distilled reddit response."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Please correct me if I am wrong, but I think the only way this can happen (i.e., tax bill WAY higher than both your profit and, I assume, account value) is if he rolled the same securities many, many, times in the same year for losses, increasing his cost basis WAY above the actual price of the security. So, as long as you aren't trading the same stock multiple times a day, you are probably going to be okay, and even if you do trade the same stock, just sell your position before December to actually realize the loss and don't buy back until January."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Article is confusing. The guy had 1.4 million dollars gain for the year. The IRS does not give a damn how he lost 1M+ of that gain, he still owe taxes on the 1.4m gain."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude had 45k realized, obviously millions unrealized. All he has to do is liquidate a little bit of his wealth. This article is dumb."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,So if I sell the shares with wash sales icon on them and don‚Äôt buy within 30 days I‚Äôll be alright?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you even avoid paying a huge tax bill if you end up making 1-10 million
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äô possible. From what it sounds like this person was trading a small set of popular/meme stocks over and over. He likely accumulated losses at your end but continue to trade the same stocks into January and that‚Äôs not allowing his lost account in the prior year. 
Bear with me - hypothetical Scenario: on December 20, 2020, 1000 shares of Tesla at for example $600 per share cost $600k. Tesla drops to $550 same day and this person is $50k in the hole. The next day tsla goes back up to 620, guy gets fomo and buys another 1000 shares of Tesla for $620k and add the $50k loss that his base price is likely around $680 per share or whatever. His total position size is $620k plus $50k from the prior day loss. Tsla again nose dives to $580. The guy is down 90k (50k From prior day and 40K from today). Rinse and repeat for 10 days, let us assume the guy is 250K in losses by December 30 end of day. Since the person is addicted to Tsla, he decides on December 31 to go out it again right before year end. He buys 1000 shares of Tesla at $700 for $700k in proceeds and because he is buying it within 30 days triggers a wash sale. His new position is $700k plus $250k wash sale loss for a cool 950K. Even though he bought at 700 a share, his base price is somewhere in the 800s given the loss add-on. Before the year finishes his loss is part of his overall position and not closed on the books. When his 1099B was issued in Q1 2021, the loss was not registered in 2020 since on December 31 he bought back the loss and it was open. His closed position in Tesla for 2020 shows a huge temporary games, and as such, will be taxed as is.  hope this helps."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"So a hypothetical situation:
Bought stock A then sold for a -$1000 loss, bought again at a lower price, some sold for $500 profit but retained 10 shares. Wash sale triggered. If by year end the position is not closed, the -$1000 loss carries over with the remaining shares and is NOT counted for tax purposes for the current calendar year. Taxes filed, have to pay taxes for the $500 profit. 

But had the position been closed before the end of the year, say for another -$250 loss in the final transaction, that would allow the -$1250 total losses to be counted and instead of paying taxes on $500 gains, you have a net -$750.

Did I get that right?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes as long as he didn‚Äôt repurchase for 30 days after the sale.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Selling in December is only the first step. You can‚Äôt repurchase those stocks for another 30 days
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes and don‚Äôt buy back for 30 days.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Short term capital gains are taxed like regular income. Look it up. The rate for the top tax bracket is 37% which he fell into with 1.4 mil. If your annual salary was 1.4 mil you would be getting a similar percentage taken out of your check. It‚Äôs a progressive tax system. You are in the second lowest bracket so you are getting taxed 12%.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,A lovely example here of someone spreading FUD because they don‚Äôt understand the tax system. You are shitting on the system that allows the little guy a leg up out of poverty. This guy didn‚Äôt take the time to educate himself before trading. All he had to do was close the position before year end and not buy again for 30days. And he will be able to realize all these losses in future tax years. He fucked up but only temporarily. Just because YOU don‚Äôt understand it doesn‚Äôt make America trash. The wash sale rule is to prevent the ‚Äúbig fish‚Äù from tax fraud. You are shitting in something designed to prevent fraud from wealthy people. True ignorance. America and this sub has an real education problem.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,To prevent tax fraud. Without the rule you could just sell positions at year end for a loss and repurchase on January 1st. That would lock in a taxable loss and allow you a lower share price. People would create fake losses at year end to offset gains. The rule prevents tax fraud but most on this sub don‚Äôt understand it.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only an idiot wants to congress involved in trading. The wash sale rule prevents the rich from tax fraud. For EDUCATED traders it has zero negative impacts on taxes. A bunch of idiots decided to become ‚Äútraders‚Äù this year without doing their homework. I love how ignorant people need congress to babysit their financial decisions. Also, this guy will be able to realize all of his losses in future tax years."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Any purchase in an IRA after realizing a loss in a taxable account triggers the wash sale, it just happens in the applicable taxable account.  For example; my spouse sells stock A for a loss in an individual account on Schwab, then I buy stock A in a TD Ameritrade IRA within 30-days... that's a wash sale per IRS guidelines.  Schwab and TD won't recognize it as a wash sale, but your accountant should."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am not American firstly.

I am from the UK and I live in Singapore.

I have American friends in Singapore who are getting hamstrung in life by the American tax system. They are paying taxes on their jobs here plus capital gains.

In Singapore, you pay zero capital gains tax, and the income tax rates are one of the lowest in the world, as a UK citizen I am able to take advantage of both of these benefits, while my American buddies continue to get shafted by uncle sam. The fact that the American government taxes you while living abroad tells you all you need to know about your relationship with your government, you are owned.

It won't let me speak about it here without auto moderating me but in terms of getting into the digital currency game Americans yet again get the raw end of the deal because of a controlling government who wants to make sure they retain control of your cash.

At every turn my American friends are being financially disadvantaged for being American, all the while you have a shitty social security net, healthcare, and everything else compared to other first world countries. You are basically paying a premium in taxes to prop up systems that benefit mainly the ultra-wealthy.

It was not long ago that Americans had it better than anyone, but these days you are falling fast on the totem pole and some of you are so busy drinking the cool-aid that you can't even see that being American is more of a burden than a benefit these days.

If you REALLY can't see how screwy the American system is there is just no helping you."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure I understand how that'd be tax fraud, can you elaborate more?  I'm kind of new to this.  Like, if my stocks did mediocre for years, then suddenly have a great year and I want to sell, I don't get to pro-rate those capital gains over multiple years to reduce my tax liability, but if I understand you, this law punishes a person for the other way around?  Related to this, I wish that tax law would generally be reformed to be more fair to people with highly variable income."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"So the guy in the op essentially made and lost a shit ton of money, but his losses only carry into next years cost basis, while his gains require taxes this year?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"True. Not sure what his situation was. He could have owed more because of prior years, health care credits, etc. But not exactly sure why it was so high."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I totally agree with everything you said here. We are sliding the wrong direction fast. America has lots of flaws and the tax system is probably near the top. That being said the wash sale rule is a basic rule to prevent tax fraud that is easy to follow. Trading is a business and too many jump in like it‚Äôs a hobby not looking into the tax consequences. It is overall a screwy system but the wash sale rule isn‚Äôt the problem. It prevents fraud.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Side note. You may want to look into how much foreign aid Singapore receives especially from the US. Your citizens may not pay capital gains but the rest if the world is propping up your country. Your own tax system can‚Äôt support your country. So all your US buddies are paying more to fix your countries shortfall. Please educate yourself about your own country before you act like Singapore has it figured out.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm no expert but the IRS explains it. If I intentionally purchase a stock to take a loss for tax purposes, that is fraud. The rule makes it so that you can‚Äôt create false losses to help with taxes. Under the wash sale rule, traders aren‚Äôt effected negatively at all if they follow the rule. All losses are claimable if you simply stop trading the stock for 30 days. It‚Äôs not that hard. Everyone seems to want to allow tax fraud in order to make their taxes easier on thus sub because they are to smooth brained to educate themselves on the subject. Experienced traders trade the same stock all the time with no tax hassle."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. They are. But we don‚Äôt need more regulation. We need more education. Without this rule, the US would lose tons of money to tax fraud by the wealthy. But I guess we should just let them get away with tax fraud because you don‚Äôt understand. Congress has a great track record of fixing things. /s"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right .. so if he was Canadian he could have simply treated the net profit as business income and paid 100% marginal rate (call it 37% if he is in highest tax bracket) .. otherwise if treated as ""investment income""/capital gain it would be subject to a similar tax rate as in the article.

.. and it wouldn't really have been shady at all because the frequency of trading aligns more with day trading than investing.

Question for you: if I trade SOME stocks more frequently than others (e.g. some are more buy-and-hold whereas others are frequently bought/sold) .. can I claim some as business income vs. others as capital gains? My understanding is ""yes,"" as it's more about the asset being traded."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You may pay a bit more, but you get a lot more of that money back in the form of healthcare, etc. We just get to watch big companies, banks, and hedge funds get bailed out after making awful decisions while our military has 1,000x more funding than it needs to bomb people that haven't done anything to us."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. Because he was not careful with wash sales at year end, he had to recognize all of his gains from the current year, but inadvertently deferred all of his losses to the next year."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is my understanding you can apply all 32k carried over capital losses to your 32k capital gains.

> Remaining capital losses can then be deducted in future years up to $3,000 a year, or a capital gain can be used to offset the remaining carry-forward amount.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If one buys a stock and it loses money, wouldn't the reduced tax liability always be less than the money lost?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah we definitely get a lot out of it, and I'm happy to pay it. Though I will say it adds up to more than you think, despite just being a few percent difference (13 vs 7 for example)."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This 1000%!! Wash sale doesn't really rob you of any additional money, it doesn't make you more poor, it just affects WHEN the losses can be utilized against gains."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you have multiple wash sales,  you may as well use an accountant.  You have to enter every wash sale manually.  You can‚Äôt just do proceeds and costs and find the difference."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. That‚Äôs correct. Not sure what you mean. That‚Äôs how investing and trading taxes has always worked.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Then what's the fraud, gaming-the-system part?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"So does that mean this guy basically has $75k worth of assets with a coat basis of 1.4 million? Thats fucking crazy, feels like you'd have to try to fuck your taxes that hard"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well also make sure you don't buy it back in the next year if its less than 30 days.

For example selling Dec 20th and buying back on Jan 10th. That is still a wash sale and you cannot claim the loss on your previous year taxes."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"The people who are able to take advantage of this kind of scenario already pay heavily reduced taxes through one loophole or another, so who exactly does it target?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Not sure how to help you here. Google: wash sale tax fraud. It‚Äôs pretty basic. If you artificially sell at the end of the year with the intention of rebuying you are committing fraud by trying to claim artificial losses. The losses would be ‚Äúreal‚Äù if you weren‚Äôt rebuying. Buying in at the lower cost for a new tax year is a scheme used to lower your tax bill. Before the law this scheme was used constantly to avoid paying taxes on gains. It‚Äôs not a real loss if you buy back in at that lower price.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"They were all this year, will plan on selling them eventually. And not touch gme again"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I still don't see the problem.  You have to lose tons of money in a trade to get that write off.  Even if you buy back in, that's still money lost, and the tax write off should apply.  You still lost that money that year, and you just realize that loss by selling, even if you intend to buy back in immediately.  Just because it covers any potential taxes on the other stock is irrelevant.  You had a loss.  You realized that loss.  You had a gain.  You realized that gain.  The loss offsets the gain.  Done.  The IRS doesn't need to touch the money, they need to fuck off and deal with actual problems like maybe stopping big ass corporations from having massive tax write offs to avoid billions in taxes despite progressively treating their workers more and more like slaves that should be on welfare to survive.

Point is, just because the IRS gets less in taxes *now* doesn't mean that the rule should exist.  Tax law is beyond fucked and needs to be simplified, otherwise we end up with these scenarios where people can't trade freely without potential huge penalties.  That's just wrong."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Google results are just showing explanations of what it is, based on the titles (I fully read one).  If my OP wasn't clear, I'm asking the logic behind why it's illegal, not simply what the law is."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree the rule is ridic if applied to some average joe. And it definitely complicates the entire thing. I'm just trying to _understand_ it and the rationale.

> stopping big ass corporations from having massive tax write offs

This is kind of what i was getting at. Realizing a loss to offset a gain, but really you are long on that position and now that would-be tax money is tied up for as long as you want it to be. Is the idea behind the rule to try and curb that?

Again, anyone know if i'm way off in my understanding here? I'm not talking about if it is right or wrong."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"When you intentionally rebuy in less than 30 days you are creating an artificial loss on your taxes. That‚Äôs the crime. The loss isn‚Äôt real because you rebought at that lower price. You could create artificial losses by taking losing trades at the end of the year. The losses are fake because your cost basis didn‚Äôt change. You are artificially lowering your tax bill knowing that your intention is to rebuy to capture the gains the following year. That is fraud. It‚Äôs about intention. Knowingly making bad trades to change your tax liability is fraud and is bad for creating trust in the markets. I hope this helps. Taking strategic trades to lower your tax bill is dishonest business. We‚Äôve created many laws to prevent businesses from cheating the system. That‚Äôs the crime, cheating on your taxes. That is why it is illegal. Hope that helps."

As part of that economic build up just consider the effect of CCP influence on index listings and ratings agencies, where the PRC can simultaneously place in both the big leagues for AAA bonds and stocks in international indexes: while also placing in ‚Äúemerging‚Äù market indices. That duplicity not only adds another revenue source for China during their buildup phase, but in the case of emerging market indices their inclusion siphons off large portions of money explicitly allocated towards the development of economic competitors to China. the CCP is opportunistic, while the goose is laying their aim is to take as many eggs for thenselves as possible. however, should other opportunies present, then they will most definitely twist the knife on every front to maximise our disruption economically, socially and politically."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you're iffy on Nietzche for the Reich-ties, as unfair as that may be to the man himself - Alan Watts is a very good ""contemporary"" thinker on the ideals of ""Love life and appreciate existence."""
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think any great thinkers get appropriated by ... almost everybody. Nietzsche also has a lot of appeal across the political spectrum. I don‚Äôt think it helps that he could be esoteric enough to be broadly interpreted, and that his sometimes blunt rhetorical style could inspire destructive tendencies. Language is also a highly manipulated form, especially by those in power. If Nietzsche painted his ideas they may have been safer from misappropriation. Maybe he would have been a musician today now that music is recorded. 

I personally think that he ‚Äúforesees‚Äù the developments that lead to the 20th century orgy of violence and hypocrisy in the name of ideologies (communism, democracy, fascism). He warns of the oncoming age of nihilism. To these ideologies millions sacrifice their own humanity and reality. They fight bloody wars. They think they are in the end of history. I think he makes a point of addressing the individual to look to art (creation) as inspiration and not subsume oneself into an ideology. 

Nietzsche would look upon Nazism as the very worse form of ‚Äúslave morality‚Äù (how the oppressed learn to want to escape reality, ultimately through its very destruction).

If Nietzsche were to favor an ideology I suppose it would be one that genuinely emphasizes growth and development. I like to think he would favor modern futurism and humanism. He did criticize equal rights and democracy in some of his writings, but I think he did so because it would make society believe it could not improve further and become complacent. The herd would find a green pasture and think it needed nothing more."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah, Alan Watts. We are all God playing ‚Äúpeek a boo‚Äù with ourself. Yes, how can one not love Allan Watts?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"You have a deep understanding of Nietzsche, promoter of Eugenics and the Master Race, thank you. I‚Äôm aware he was a deep thinker with plenty of value, so I‚Äôll simply chalk up how the Nazi‚Äôs twisted his philosophy to horrible ends to ‚Äúmisappropriation.‚Äù Give the guy his credit."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"As this guy just said, RKT is a solid company that just got caught up in the memes and emotional traders who sell low and buy high. Huge short interest still, but the company has been hitting on earnings and should be trading higher than it is now imo."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,What do you mean?
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I interpreted that as ""start with 10m, lose 9.5, YOLO!"""
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well shit, I didn't expect to get wholesale sold on going all in on RKT just as soon as I gain some funds...but, here we are."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"What do you think about when, about 20 min in, he explains why they should not be a publicly traded company?"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that's true. The original DD was based on the one time catalyst of a large Dividend re-investment. For some reason, however, the dividend payout was broken up over several days at different brokers. Who knows why right? That's just the nature of WSB these days. 

RKT stock price is being suppressed, most likely due to the amount of calls being bought. Under normal circumstances people would buy the stock and the stock would rise to it's fair value. In this case, however, the stock is being pinned down because letting the stock rise would mean a lot of money lost for the option sellers.  I personally think this creates a great opportunity for new investors who just want a safe stock with less down side and more upside and who aren't trying to gamble on the next biotech or EV or earnings or whatever.

That's contingent on you seeing what I see in this stock. If you (or whoever) disagrees and think it's just another mortgage stock and will crash with the market, then obviously it would not be a  good buy. 

What I'm trying to do is to get more and more people to see the potential in this stock, as more people see that then  it will be harder for Citadel or whoever to keep it pinned down. Of course when earnings comes out and blows away estimates then the stock will rise, but by then it's too late for a lot of people. 

I think what makes this stock special is that the more people that believe in it, the more likely it is to succeed against shorts because those people will also then become borrowers and repeat customers of the company, which the company does deserve given their high customer retention and satisfaction as well as their responsible lending practices. Here's a quote from u/CMscientist :

>""RKT actually pride themselves in responsible lending. Their 10-K even shows avg customer credit score of mid 700, with a delinquency rate of 4% even with covid forbearance. Other mortgage companies like PFSI has 12% """

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"missed the dip haha, thought it was tanking due to lockup expiration sell-off"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro it went up 10%. It‚Äôs sitting at $27 and my man has 30 and 40 dollar options. He‚Äôs still down thousands of dollars. It was a retarded YOLO and I did in fact laugh at it.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,I think it was.  The volume exceeded the 10day average by 20 min after the market opened.  Mad I couldn‚Äôt buy discount options.  They would all be in the money now...
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,My real debate here is do I take some profit this afternoon for a potential morning dip again from any further sell off...
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"He still has some time, could go up to 30s. I'm not sure about the 40 though, depends on how much premium he paid."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you think this will just keep going up from here or will there be more dips? I think I might buy some calls that expire after the next catalyst (next earnings maybe?)
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Since this stock is already heavily shorted, absent any positive news/catalysts, I think short sellers will continue to short this stock going forward. It's always good to lock in some profits imo."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Well looks like he will gain a bit back from the 25 calls but being the dumbfuck he is he bought 100 of the 30 calls which went down in price and will expire worthless so I'd say the verdict is he's a classic WSB retard.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,The premium kinda screwed me on my buys as they were 33 days before expiring... I could have bought the same calls after earnings report for half of what I had paid.   Definitely a learning experience.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn't it generally safer to buy calls that expire a month out? Maybe the IV was high when you bought those calls?

I'm not aware of any misrepresentations or breaches of duty relevant to me other than maybe failure of management to monitor share ownership, but I don't think preventing share price volatility is part of a director's duties. Hwang probably broke disclosure laws but that's criminal and between him and the SEC. There's a case called CSX corp. v. Children's Investment Fund about exactly this kind of effort to hide an ownership stake in a company. Hwang didn't do it for voting rights so its not exactly analogous but I'd bet dollars to doughnuts he violated at least a few SEC rules based on the holding there."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,How much money did you lose from buying puts on them? You seem very salty. I can provide large sums of DD why it‚Äôs going higher but I don‚Äôt think you would be able to comprehend it. Sure they can miss earnings. Any company can. Heck they can meet it and it can go down.

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"They make parts for internal combustion engines... sorry gramps, but I'll be investing in something else."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Was kinda wondering the same thing. I should check these DDs more often than I do.
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well,
you have to remember, that were 'so brilliant' that they had constructed this beautiful portfolio, that in theory, would only lose money if there was something like a 6 sigma event, and thought impossible because many of the items in the portfolio have negative correlation; if one thing went down, some else was negatively correlated to go up as much or more.

And they leveraged up so they would make more. If the portfolio was 100% invested with no margin and the expected rate of return was 5%, if I leverage up 2:1, now my rate of return would be 10%. For a while this worked very well, I seem to recall that the first three or four years the total return was on the order of 400%. (Invest $10K, and had $40K)

The problem is the currency crisis around 1998 started to mess up; and that is when what goes wrong with these things ALWAYS GOES WRONG. The market gets messed up, liquidity starts to have problems, and things that are not supposed to be correlated becomes correlated, and things that are not supposed to move together do. (Basically, everything starts to drop in value.)

Now the 125:1 portfolio that is supposed to have offsetting positions within it all starts to drop across the board, and LTCM was done."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate you calling me a retard, but the money was not held in a ‚Äòsavings account‚Äô and was not liquid cash. It was fully invested in stocks and who knows what else. This IS how margin works, you get the full amount and you can invest it in whatever you want.

When they need to call you, and if you don‚Äôt meet the requirements or they sense extreme risk, they are free to liquidate your positions. This is what they did.

However, this isn‚Äôt like selling $10k worth of stock. The act of dumping so many shares drives the price down a fuck ton, and they lose cash all the way down. See my other reply below where I explain further. You can‚Äôt snap your fingers and assume it‚Äôs possible to move billions of dollars in stock in an instant, and without impacting the share price."

I don‚Äôt have a great explanation for what happened other than the market seems disappointed with today‚Äôs deal, though I‚Äôm not sure why. AMRS management delivered on their promise, raised a ton of new cash, improved its liquidity position, and the company‚Äôs balance sheet hasn't been cleaner in years. 50% of management's full year guidance was delivered in first quarter just from this transaction alone. New recurring manufacturing streams were solidified for the next 15 years. AMRS retained a participation interest in the non-core molecules they monetized, so they really haven't given up that much. And there is still another, smaller deal coming that we know less about

I believe in this company for the long term so still holding all shares, all long-dated options, and most of the April calls. Hard to predict where things will go from here, but I remain bullish

This company is subject to wild swings, often times unexplained ones, so we might still get bailed out - time will tell"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Now that didn't age well üòÜ. Could have worked, but got in and out at more or less 0 result, so....that's fine. Looked more into it, not going to be a conviction play for me though."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"This company kind of looks like a story of a ""cool product"" that nobody gives a fuck about.  There may be a bull thesis here but you should all understand how *insanely* risky this play is.

* They've had to dilute multiple times at this point just to stay afloat.
* The guidance they've given in the past borders on an SEC violation.
* They're currently dumping revenue streams.
* They constantly fuck over public investors with PIPEs and debt exchanges.

The bull thesis is essentially that there's enough people who give af about sharks to pay for their fancy yeast. Which, don't get me wrong, sounds like a cool af product.  The same way VR *sounded* cool af 30 years ago or EVs *sounded* cool af in the 80's.

Do you really want to gamble that *this* is the company that brings this product to market successfully or is it more likely this overvalued, revenue starved, poorly managed, diluted to oblivion shitshow is going to be raided by HFs into oblivion at which point a larger competitor will buy the company for pennies on the dollar and sit on the patents till sharks go extinct and the world actually needs their fancy yeast?

The alternatively bull thesis is that OP has done a good enough DD that this stock becomes meme'd and the injection of smooth brained money will actually allow them to start scaling and investing in worthwhile management (see GME hiring former AMZN execs.)

GME has had the good sense to not dilute and bend over and PIPE their public shareholders.  Imagine if that goodwill didn't exist between GME management and WSB smooth brains who saved their jobs and you've got this company."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"In my opinion, it's all about the strategic transaction announcements. Management only has two days left to keep their promise - let's hope they do. Look for a press release at 8:01 AM either tomorrow morning or Thursday morning. When that hits, I expect the stock to fly

Two deals are expected - they may be announced separately or concurrently. One is $500mm+ and the other is probably around $70-100mm - not many details about them are yet known

The $500 million deal is obviously the most important. If they announced once each day, goddamn that would be epic. But we shall see"
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. I was at least hoping to see a 5% bump
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"IMO, retail selling the news / short sellers pushing down the price. Institutions have been picking up shares after the initial drop, we are already back to $19.84 as I write this. Don't forget, this is only one of two transactions - will see what happens"

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure, we have a nice exemple on our reddit. You can go check the thread on Goldman downgrading Nomura, then go check Nomura's weekly timeframe chart. Does it seem like some sort of pattern is at play here? What does Goldman do when they want to buy something? They downgrade it. What do they do when they need to dump a position on dumb money? They upgrade it."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,Pure luck.  If I could have anticipated a 30x return I would have bet the farm and retired.  I was just looking for a possible 100% return.  That's the max I anticipated

While I joined in February after the first squeeze, I've quickly become very interested in investing, especially as a way to help secure my financial future. Hodling AMC and GME currently, and know about averaging down and buy the dip, the usual. But I've love to get more in depth knowledge and skill in doing this on a grander and more long-term scale.   


Thanks folks!"

Investment background: Saved $8k in 401k over 3 years and cashed out for brief unemployment pre-covid. Just became eligible to contribute again and have $500 or so in a far away target fund.

Oh and $40 in AMC.

I am a young car saleswoman and had a 6 month gig transcribing for financial advisors. I feel like I *know* a decent amount but really want to put it to use now that my income is going up. Just had my best month ever and am ready to get started on retail investing outside of Cash App lol."

03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"eh.. wouldn't be so hopeful to see a quick recovery. it was a straight up sell off, and there isn't much catalyst to encourage any significant buying volume imo. but best of luck to you."
03/31/2021,wallstreetbets,"I disagree for several reasons. The sell off was due mostly to that hedge funds dying star implosion followed by shorty doing what he does and panic selling. In addition the EPS the last four quarters has beat expectations. Lastly it‚Äôs a iconic brand for cheap and most analysts have it at a median target price of 60.00$ I think we will see that bounce back in the next few weeks. Full disclosure my brain is smooth, I eat crayons and I‚Äôm not a financial analyst and this isn‚Äôt financial advice. I do however like the stock and anyone that can stream Beavis and butthead and star trek products isn‚Äôt Someone I want to bet against.

Have a good one."
