2021-04-14 19:38:47,stocks,Most brokers allow you to invest in both.  You don’t have to be on a specific platform to invest in their specific ETF either.  I use Schwab and can/have invested in mutual funds and ETFs with them no problem.
2021-04-14 19:50:57,stocks,Both are any broker but some give fees to start or redeem a mutual fund. I use fidelity where many of their funds are availible free and etrade has good options. Etfs trade like a stock so should be able to get at just about any broker.
2021-04-14 19:47:50,stocks,You should be able to invest in then on any platform but I wouldn't avoid Robinhood
2021-04-14 19:59:35,stocks,Doesn't matter what broker you use. ETFs can be bought at pretty much any broker
2021-04-14 19:49:33,stocks,What do you mean it looks due for a run? Price decline by itself is not an indicator.
2021-04-14 19:27:35,stocks,Buy low sell high
2021-04-14 19:28:53,stocks,Lmaoooo

I hope this helps you get your first date."
2021-04-14 19:33:25,stocks,I have no clue what that means
2021-04-14 19:34:50,stocks,Buy stock around 10:30 when you sometimes find a post market open lul and you can see where it’s headed for the day and then decide if you want to buy and then sell when it’s higher and you’ve made some profit. Simple explanation
2021-04-14 19:36:11,stocks,"I didn't understand it much but i think i kinda understand.  i have no gains from any of my stuff, but they all have decent market value"

2021-04-14 19:40:10,stocks,"The EU was paying $19/dose for Pfizer and $22 for Moderna, not $50. Pfizer has to split with BNTX. They have some leverage to raise prices now, I guess."
2021-04-14 18:59:53,stocks,I find the timing with the JNJ situation awfully interesting. They were already expecting to reduce distribution this week by 85%. My guess is that they had a production shortfall and called it quits. We shall see
2021-04-14 19:50:48,stocks,"With more vaccines coming up, JNJ might fulfill any outstanding contracts and end it there. Their vaccine program is a drop in the pond for them and it doesn't look like the production issues are lighting up."
2021-04-14 19:08:10,stocks,"and EU pissed on UK w the AZ vaccine over BREXIT.  looks like travel to EU may not happen this summer, or next.....  EDIT.  its a cheap bet...   bought 50.  PFE 210416 C37.5 for 8 cents each....   I just couldn't resist.  EDIT 2: add https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/state-to-receive-545-000-extra-pfizer-vaccine-doses-under-eu-deal-1.4537139.

2021-04-14 19:20:43,stocks,"Travel to the eu is going to happen. Greece and spain aren't going to turn away the tourism revenue that the uk brings to them. It'll just require uk travellers to undertake additional testing which they really need to bring the pricing down on as the uk tests are really expensive. 

Though even then a covid test being 3x the cost of return flights isn't going to deter people from their getaways this year. 

Our workplace is in full gear mode for the greek and spanish flights from the 17th may. Completed countless online training tests this past week in preparation."
2021-04-14 19:14:17,stocks,Az vaccine is pure shit + they are bad liars and breaching contracts hard pass for me edit: people getting butthurt about facts lol . 1. It's a fact az delivered 25% what they promised. 2. it's a fact they blatantly lied about the exclusive deals with the uk and delivering behind our backs to them 3. it's pretty proven that their vaccine is the least effective with the most side effects compared to moderna and biontech/pfizer. So hate all you want
2021-04-14 19:30:39,stocks,"Greece is slated to open for Americans, UK probably will - Italy and Spain need the money, but they might do something stupid and open only to Shengen and/or UK.  but w the BREXIT fight, I'm figuring on Scottish whiskey and Ouzo this summer"
2021-04-14 19:18:02,stocks,"know 6 ppl who got first dose of AZ, laid up 3 days...  worse than most I know in 40yo age range when they get COVID.   still think the decision is part political"
2021-04-14 19:50:46,stocks,"Whisky isn't a bad call at all. I believe the us stopped the additional tarrifs on it since brexit so no doubt there'll be a push for additional export revenues, doubly so if the snp get behind it as a means to further push the independence agenda.

If you're ever after buying any to drink I've gotta recommend Highland Park whisky. It's fairly cheap for the 12 year old and it's great. Been my go to for the last few years."
2021-04-14 19:56:59,stocks,"Calls on SCOTCH, although mine always seems to run into severe liquidity problems.  I have every intention on acting as my own logistics/supply chain and go get it myself.  Also agree Highland Park is good value"

shocking i know"
2021-04-14 19:15:43,stocks,"If you're shocked with a 0,35% move, I don't recommend the stock market for you lololol"
2021-04-14 18:54:09,stocks,"So you're trying to ""investigate"" why the stock dropped by 0.35%.....lol?"
2021-04-14 18:59:51,stocks,Probably day traders taking their gains.
2021-04-14 18:58:11,stocks,"Usually happens when there is some sort of pending news. In this case it was the feds beige book numbers, which last time wasn't that great. Mixed with any one of other many catalyst. Usually people don't trade stocks they don't understand the movements of, which I personally recommend."
2021-04-14 18:58:47,stocks,Stocks go up and they go down with no reason they just be
2021-04-14 19:54:18,stocks,A 0.35% drop can only mean one thing...... a crash.

2021-04-14 19:35:18,stocks,Ноизе
2021-04-14 18:59:00,stocks,I know that’s not a lot for a typical stock but this is SPY. That level of move should be multiple days of movement for it and to do it in a 15 minute period is a lot.
2021-04-14 19:09:17,stocks,Most likely gamma starting to roll over after opex. Look at the gex(gamma exposure) dropped off today after staying above 20b for 3 days which is actually the first time it has acted like this.
2021-04-14 19:10:00,stocks,Stop it. I’m in public and I almost fell out of my chair laughing.
2021-04-14 19:43:46,stocks,But 0.35%?! I NEED AN EXPLANATION!!
2021-04-14 18:55:53,stocks,"spy plummeted to a historic low, not seen since two days ago"
2021-04-14 19:11:43,stocks,Buy the dip!!
2021-04-14 19:39:38,stocks,"Ok that was awesome! Definitely going to watch his channel! And ya, definitely corresponded with an overall drop in my portfolio.

All of this said, I’m not worried about the movement, just trying to become more educated. Ultimately I’m in this for the longer haul but like understanding the process."
2021-04-14 19:12:19,stocks,“SPY too high”
2021-04-14 19:01:22,stocks,"You are aware SPY has dropped multiple % in any one day and has continued for days. Zoom your chart out, have you noticed SPY has been going up a lot lately, it’s due a pretty decent correction."
2021-04-14 19:14:09,stocks,"It was a reaction to J Powell talking, it's not the first time that it has happened but a 0.35% is definitely not a lot anyways. When it goes up that same percentage any other day at opening no one ever question why lol"
2021-04-14 18:57:06,stocks,Mad stuff.
2021-04-14 19:00:22,stocks,"Lol first happy cake day! Next I know it isn’t big in the grand scheme of things, more so the speed it did it and the rapid change in volume."
2021-04-14 19:11:18,stocks,"SPY is on discount!

Buy the dip!!"
2021-04-14 19:04:47,stocks,I definitely agree it is due for a correction! My point was the speed it made that change when it was mostly flat the rest of the day.
2021-04-14 19:03:13,stocks,"This was very ordinary. There really wasn’t anything remarkable about it, and certainly it wasn’t people “trying” to influence the stock price for the sake of puts. You’ll see things like this happening pretty much on a daily basis. That’s just how the market is, there isn’t always a rhyme or reason."
2021-04-14 19:07:54,stocks,It’s random for sure. But sticking to solid numbers for support and resistance can often be magnets for things to fall around and to. I had SPY call credit spreads at 415 expecting it to not break that by Friday. Let’s see if it holds or pulls back down from these levels.
2021-04-14 19:06:27,stocks,"Vanguard is my favorite brokerage company. I buy and sell mostly index funds over individual stocks.

I hate Boeing now."
2021-04-14 18:51:53,stocks,If you want to gamble your life savings on calls for a single stock there’s another sub for you
2021-04-14 18:43:06,stocks,"> We still haven’t completely opened up, but with more people becoming vaccinated every day, things seem to be going back to “normal.”    

You're talking about Boeing though, not Chuck E Cheese.      

Boeing may be a great long term investment, but it definitely isn't some re-opening play. Boeing has two main sources of income:    

 - USG/Military contracts (aircraft, space, missiles, etc): 36%~.       
 - Commercial aviation: 50%~

Some of their commercial aviation sales are completely unimpacted (e.g. freight) from travel slowdowns/airline profits. The problem is that you're running with the theory that COVID over means an immediate jump in sales, and that Boeing starts pushing aircraft out immediately. That won't be the case.      

Problem is that COVID disrupted suppliers, supplies, and staff/factories, plus there is a global chip shortage, and of course the 737 Max is an ongoing nightmare for them. So even when COVID is over, it isn't over-over, you'll have months of lag on the back-end and also airlines who have built up tons of debt who may try to delay replacing their aging fleet just a little longer than they had planned to (even if it is less fuel efficient they can push back costs they cannot afford today until tomorrow).   

I'm bullish on Boeing to be clear, but calls specifically require a date, and I don't know the date. Your theory about this is so thin neither do you. Boeing as a play is super complicated, and a lot of it is about looking at their externalities (suppliers, international trade, customers, etc)."
2021-04-14 19:19:14,stocks,You'll be better off with shares.
2021-04-14 18:27:26,stocks,How much of their previous share price was due to week in week out business travel that simply won’t return due to the technology available?
2021-04-14 18:29:49,stocks,Boeing didn’t really get hit just from reduction of travel it got hit because of 737 max issues. The question is when does production resume and airlines take ownership of Jets or order more Jets. Probably longer than the economy reopening but agree great long term investment. I’m long Boeing shares.

2021-04-14 18:46:44,stocks,"> How much of their previous share price was due to week in week out business travel that simply won’t return due to the technology available?

that's not necessarily a reasonable prediction  that business travel won't return. business travel tends to be higher level people who are trying to make a deal (in which case the WANT to physically be there, not on a zoom call) or skilled people who are going someplace to physically set up a piece of equipment.

day to day rank and file people might end up doing their jobs from home instead of commuting to the office, but business travel isn't going to disappear."

2021-04-14 17:36:45,stocks,The hell are you renting for 600$ a month?! Yeah I mean your losing 600 a month I guess but that's damn near free.
2021-04-14 17:33:50,stocks,"600 a month on rent is really very little.

If you do get a house, there are some programs to put very little down for first time home buyers.  Also, I think with rates this low, I would max out the amount I am borrowing and focus on investing over the next 30 years vs paying off more of my mortgage.

It is a good problem to have for sure!  Well done."
2021-04-14 17:31:29,stocks,"Leave it in the market unless you actively want a house. A house is a big investment and comes with its own downsides and opportunity costs. The cost of a down payment is money that can be actively invested not to mention you have to budget for home repairs, home insurance, property taxes, and other misc home costs.

Buying a house should be more of a lifestyle decision rather than purely financial. Renting offers a lot of benefits and the money you are 'losing' compared to owning a home isn't that big when you consider at roughly 2/3rds of your mortgage payment goes into interest payments."
2021-04-14 19:57:56,stocks,"OP, you're an investing superstar. The amount of impulse control it takes to put money into this deferred (till retirement!) gratification and not to touch it is an accomplishment in itself

You started at 18, must have saved half your paycheck every month, and threw it into passive index funds. 

The number of people who do something like this is vanishingly small. But they win, big time. Like you have. 

Pat yourself on the back. And keep on keeping on. Don't touch that money. Only add to it as you've been doing already. 

If you want to buy a house, and you think you can get a better deal living in a house than renting, then go for it. Use your savings to finance it first. Whether it's a good investment depends entirely on where you live and for how long.

If you’re not looking to actively trade or invest, it’s probably a better use of time to figure out how to increase income instead of how to optimize your current investments, which are arguably already in a very good place.

As a younger person in a low cost of living area which you indicate below, you can take full advantage of first-time buyer programs or FHA loans that only require 3% down payments.

Oh and the AC is probably gonna kick it soon - previous renters hadn't changed filters since 2017 SMFH. That's another 10g right there.

Oh and that's ignoring the 10 grand of furniture.

I gotta water plants, take care of the pool, and worry about shit I never had to as a renter.

Don't do it. I got lucky and my parents gave me a house in San Jose, but even then it's a mess.

2021-04-14 18:17:36,stocks,"To a point....equities vs real estate doesn't really (in my opinion) include your dwelling. Yeah it might appreciate in value but so will everything around it so if you sell it you are either getting a similar house/neighborhood for the same price, a better house/neighborhood for more money or the only way to ""make money"" on it is by getting a shittier house/neighborhood for less money. Now it does negates a negative. You no longer have rent you have a mortgage and eventually your mortgage may be less than what rent will be and eventually you might not have to pay anything at all.

2021-04-14 18:36:07,stocks,Yeah dude just start saving independently for a house don’t touch your IRA your friend is wrong. It won’t take long to build up a down payment if home values are $150k. If you go FHA that’s 3.5% down on average meaning $5250 so save $10k and you’re mint. I’d recommend waiting and saving up the 20% to avoid PMI and go conventional but that’s up to you.
2021-04-14 17:49:57,stocks,"Think of it like this. You buy a house and then you pay taxes. Ours are $600/month...and it's gone like rent. But then we have to spend money on maintenance, repairs, and updates. So figure $1000/month gone and that's before your mortgage."
2021-04-14 17:58:10,stocks,"If you're happy renting, stocks are a better investment. Owning a home includes closing costs, mortgage interest, property taxes, repair costs and physical work for upkeep. You have to pay anywhere you live - a home does provide happiness which is priceless but if your happy in an apartment this doesn't apply to you."
2021-04-14 18:10:26,stocks,"You've not been wasting money.  Further, $600 on rent is super cheap.

Right now (IMO) is the worst time to enter the housing market.  We are on a bubble with prices pretty much across the US.  If you want a house, wait for the market to crash or inflation to catch up with current home prices and keep socking money into your IRA."
2021-04-14 17:52:18,stocks,"Can't relate to that.

But if it makes you feel any better, you can see how much renting ""saves"" by adding together your water bill estimate (or other util if it's included)  + potential home insurance + property tax."
2021-04-14 18:36:42,stocks,"not everyone needs or wants to buy a house and thats ok  renting offers convenience. owning comes with its on costs and maintenance and then worrying about the market when you want to sell. most importantly you said it yourself--you don't want to buy a house. if he wants a house, he can buy one."
2021-04-14 19:49:26,stocks,"A really good calculator:

Can adjust all sorts of things, including inflation, rate of stock market returns, etc."
2021-04-14 18:46:48,stocks,House prices aren't in a bubble - supply of new housing has not matched demand for close to a decade combined with increased material costs has led to high demand for housing which has caused upward pressure on housing prices. Especially when combined with record low interest rates. I wouldn't hold your breath on a market crash.

2021-04-14 18:37:55,stocks,"Yeah, I'm holding them too, and I'm not sure why they're still so lowly valued. Maybe investors are waiting to see their earnings as we continue to open back up? I admit that there's still some uncertainty there, even though I'm optimistic."
2021-04-14 19:07:26,stocks,I think that’s an excellent entry point. From the price targets I’ve seen the minimum is $72 and max is $102 so there’s a ton of room for upside. I got in initially 01/2020 at $73 and it’s been a wild ride. Bought back in hard last October at $59 and have been patiently watching since lol
2021-04-14 19:04:12,stocks,I can appreciate there’s still debt and there’s a threat to the business model from the likes of Amazon or other online competitors. But I think the full stack solution of the payer through Aetna and provider through the minute clinics and pharmacy is so strong and brings in a huge customer base for the retail side too. I’m just hoping the market steadily catches up and the price keeps slowly but steadily rising

2021-04-14 17:17:46,stocks,"Hey buddy. I've researched walmart to no end fundamentally, and everything points towards the steady growth and transition into a more profitable company.  The CEO has goals to see walmart with 3x profitability compared to the 2-3% they get now. With advance in inventory control tech thru surveillance and automation it eases issues that walmart deals with.
Theft, mis count, etc etc. With they're massive presence around the entire world you can pretty much count on their supply chain being supplied. It kind of saddens me though..... because to me a world where we see justification in contributing to wal-marts bottleneck like economy which only continues to reshape consumers and repurpose their profits to self interested campaigns of more profit. Capitalism is so dead, like what the hell are we going to do in 40-50 years at this point?
Hell even 10 from now,  will mf society still have room to press the gas and drive sales and blah blah I mean its incredible how this stuff works.  I just don't fit in today's world I guess"
2021-04-14 19:51:26,stocks,"Nice DD. One question does your thesis consider market share? Because it looks like your thesis is based on the fact that walmart will gain more market share from the competition. Am I understanding your thesis correctly? Because in my mind, for one company to be in line fundamentally with its competitors they would have to gain more market share from them. Or at least increase their footprint in  the sector with a new business model. Please correct my view on this."

Traditionally, WMT's earnings multiple is usually under 15. I don't see 40 as being viable long-term.

Edit: not criticizing, just don't think it;s good for discussion to say ""here's my DD, don't comment on it""."

I'm actually -4.5% on them right but I'll buy more because I feel the same about it. Dividend yield is nice, the runup over the last year hasn't been too explosive to where I feel like it can't go up anymore, and the fact that it's significantly down from ATH (without any real news that I know of) gives me confidence that it can hit those values again."

2021-04-14 18:33:01,stocks,"Risks are boundless.  Most would say increasing bottom line due to increased COGs and the over-exaggerated impacts of increased min. wages.  I think the largest threat to any company is the counterbalance to their largest opportunity.  In this case, online presence and maintaining hold of retail sector.  So in my mind, the largest threat/risk would be the flop of Walmart's multi-billion acq. of flipkart."
2021-04-14 19:22:10,stocks,"Yeah, nice job! We need more of this.

One risk / gripe is the idea of a P/E ratio of 40 as being conservative for a company in this stage of growth. That strikes me as definitely not conservative.

My thesis is that to be fairly valued, Walmart would have to reach a PPS of $176.93 for its fundamentals to be in line with its competitors while factoring outliers such as the multiples of Amazon.  My theses never include a timeline because I do my best to value the asset at its fair market value which is different than the current market value. Hopefully that answers your question."

I think there will be a lot of buyers on this from folks who regret not getting involved with bitcoin years ago.

2021-04-14 16:49:04,stocks,Not often but will occasionally with some DD and I intend to keep and hold long term. I went in on the $U Unity IPO at 70. It went up to about 140 held for a while and has now stabilized at 100 so it was a good bet. Most I avoid like and I think $Coin is overvalued. I will get some though when it drops a lot more.
2021-04-14 17:43:30,stocks,I bought PLTR a few weeks after it DPO'd last year. First week is too volatile in my opinion.  I might miss out on gains by not jumping in but there will always be another company that I can do well with.

You need to build up capital. Once you have $100k+ earning 10% a year, that is more than your $10k every year, and your loss will feel like nothing."
2021-04-14 16:14:02,stocks,"I feel you. My call options on big tech destroyed me today. I thought things would rally on the hype of an IPO like COIN - but it was easily the worst day I’ve ever had.

My advice is advice I need to take myself. Only make options trades you are okay with going to 0. Because they do it a lot.

Also - money is just money. You can always make more later. Don’t let losses ruin your mental health or personal wellbeing. If you find yourself addicted or feeling unhealthy about it, talk to someone about it. As a college student you have SO MUCH time to screw up and still come out completely fine."

2021-04-14 17:10:57,stocks,"Thank you guys for all the advice, it really means a lot"
2021-04-14 16:17:59,stocks,"First recommendation is to avoid options until you have a more solid understanding of the market, a more solid understanding of how options and their pricing work, and a better understanding of how you can achieve your goals on the whole. 

As another person has said, just take your money and invest it all in a total market index fund. It has been shown that doing so outperforms a vast majority of investors and active professionals. It’s not sexy, it’s super boring, but I’m not sure when people decided investing was supposed to be super sexy and exhilarating. Go to the casino for that experience. We want to build real wealth in the market. 

If your goal is to build up a portfolio to eventually transition to buying real estate, my approach above will give you peace of mind while you work towards it. Don’t beat yourself up over the money you lost. You didn’t know what you were doing, and now you’re trying to learn from your mistakes. Turn the page and do it right this time. 

Also, as a side note: the market gives a better average return than real estate does. Real estate just has the potential of a lot of upside because of leverage. Theoretically someone could lever up to invest in broadly diversified index funds and you’d likely outperform real estate on average. Just food for thought and an argument in favor of staying in equities and letting compounding work it’s magic."
2021-04-14 17:17:28,stocks,"You need to understand that part of why you did so well last year was because of an unprecedented bull run that didn’t have much economic growth to support it. 

Sadly, you learned about options just in time for the small market correction we had back in February. 

You already know the answer, securing your money in big cap stocks that will make 5-20%. Hell, 20% year over year growth is fantastic.

Stop making wagers with more than you’re willing to lose. Go back to the slow and steady way you were investing before."

\- start learning and reading as much as possible if you still want to trade full time, work in a paper account or play with a very small amount of capital as practice until you gain your confidence back.

2021-04-14 18:02:29,stocks,"There are so many different ways to be trading. You need to stick to what you know with real money even if that means just keeping it in a saving account. Than use paper trading making plays you would actually want to do or try, watch your entry and exits and if you can create a profitable partner using that strategy try with down size position with your real account. You have a different mind set with real money so its important to make sure your emotions don't mess up what you were able to do with paper trading so down sizing your position will help with that. And stop trying to get rich quick you can't make the market move for you.

I lost about £600 a couple of years back and considered it 'the cost of my education - that I suck at investing - it's not for me' and since then I purely monitored Tesla and FAANG from afar.

After lots of monitoring (and saving) I decided to get back in, and made about 30% last year. 

So just consider it 'paying for your financial education' ... Take a break / get some perspective and / or consider looking at longer-term, more hedged bets, or build a portfolio of companies you believe will give you strong gains.

(Btw for context I have £30k in a very broad pension scheme which seems to be doing 5 to 10% annually so I make sure I put a large amount of my pretax earnings in that too. I ""invest"" in TSLA and PLTR and others for fun, and to learn)."

IMO dividend investing is snake oil. 


> My friend told me to learn about options


Oof. 



> Well, since I did not realize the downside of options, 


Everyone learns the downside to options rather quickly. Glad you learned with only $10,000. 


> Basically, every time I think about the money I’ve lost it makes me discouraged in investing in big cap stocks that will make me 5-20% because I will still be far behind compared to where I was before. I feel sick to my stomach thinking about the money I’ve lost and wished I had someone to tell me to take some profits when I was doing so well. I did learn a lot from losing all this money, but I have so little now that I feel like it doesn’t even matter. 



You’re not emotionally ready for investing yet based off this. 


Go invest in an index fund. Learn other skills. Grow your income. 


> Also I know the amount of money is peanuts to many, but I am just a college student and wanted to use the money I made in the market to invest in real estate, 


I’m sorry but this was a pipe dream. No bank will approve a loan of that size to a college kid with no good solid income, I’m assuming a bad credit score, and other factors. If they do approve it, you’re gonna get ripped off. 


After taking a loss the best thing you can do is learn from your mistake. The worst thing you can do is not learn from it."
2021-04-14 17:41:21,stocks,"You will always have to burn out before you start trading and investing. Im the same age as you and Im in a similar spot, but I had more principle(and I learned from the last time i was kicked) Save your wins! put them in cash or common stock. And when you get the size for it, go ahead and learn about selling covered calls or cash secured puts. 

I too more than doubled my portfolio but am now down 40%. But because I took out cash to save myself Im still up on the year and outperforming the market.

But just 2 years ago I lost everything. Everything. Its definitely a learning experience Im sorry you had to lose so much. 4,000 is definitely not a small lump of cash though you can still see at least some returns.

We are young, time is on your side it is the time to FUCK AROUND AND FIND OUT. balls to the wall. I lost 11k, I made all that back and then some. In 2 years"
2021-04-14 18:48:15,stocks,"OP, I almost replied to some people in this thread who said you were emotionally immature but realized I didn’t want to get into a spat with internet strangers. You’re not emotionally immature. And you don’t have to invest in only index funds (although it wouldn’t hurt to have a good chunk of your money in them)

I made good money in January too and lost a bunch of my gains in February and March. It happens. The market was pretty rough for a month and a half depending on what you were invested in. It sounds like you were swing trading (not day trading like some people assumed) and overleveraged. I’ve learned that lesson too, and although it hurts now this is probably one of the best lessons you’ll learn. Could be worse.. you could’ve pulled a Bill Hwang.

I rarely do just calls or puts anymore bc I’ve been burned before like you have. Spreads are great.. not sure if you were doing mostly calls or had some debit spreads in there, but theta can chew up your premium pretty quick even with multiple legs.

I’d use the next month or so to focus on the better weather and the covid situation improving a bit. Enjoy yourself a little bit, see your friends if you can. But also take some time to learn... r/thetagang and r/1percentmax are two subs that I’ve learned a lot from—especially if you want theta to start working in your favor. Tastytrade videos on YouTube are great. So is kamikazekash, who goes over a lot of spreads and theta strategies. Consume all of these sources. You can learn so fucking much if you want to stick with options. You’re not gonna have explosive gains like you probably did with just calls but you can make some steady gains with options. What I’m trying to say is.. you don’t have to give up on swing trading and stick to etfs like this sub likes to advise. Maybe look into credit spreads, I like them more than debit spreads. Buy on dips, learn solid FA and TA (even tho I’d say TA is a self-fulfilling prophecy and can be leaned on too much)

I’ve been where you are and felt really discouraged. It sucks. But you’ll get it back and a lot more if you take a breath and learn what you did wrong :) Good luck homie."
2021-04-14 19:48:31,stocks,"Don’t invest in the top 5 gainers in hopes to turn a quick profit. There is often more risk than reward here, and even if you make a decent profit, you have to actually sell for profit before it quickly falls to a loss. Now, if you make a bad investment decision, don’t panic as soon as you see red. Sell if it is a small loss, but you can almost always make your money back if you hold the loss and remain patient. It could take months, but once you sell, your loss if permanent. 

The market is unreliable right now, but I am a fan of UUU. It runs consistently, but be sure to buy before it begins. Never jump into a stock you haven’t researched. If you end up losing money, you will feel far better if you are confident in the company you are investing in. Impulsive trading is gambling- period. 

Take the entire $4,000 you have left and put it in one company you trust will make you money. Ignore comment boards, and let it ride for longer than a day, week, or month. However, please don’t put any money into penny stocks, regardless of how “promising” it seems.

I am 34 years old and have learned many hard lessons in all aspects of life. I have found that bad financial decisions are much harder at the start, but there is always a solution to make things better. Mistakes in love, friendship, and career are much harder to move past than a financial loss is. Don’t beat yourself up. Some people blow thousands at strip clubs. Others have spent thousands on a car with more problems than it’s worth. People start businesses that end up failing. Or spend money on lawyers in a court case they end up losing. The whole saying about wisdom coming with age is 100% true, but it isn’t the age, it’s the experiences and the mistakes that actually count. Consider this your first adult experience that you can add to your wisdom bank."

2021-04-14 16:49:03,stocks,"\^ This. Statistically, you are not going to beat the market.

Even the average professionals struggle. And even the top 25 percentile of professionals struggle after fees and taxes (cause no one works for free) when investing in a risk adjusted manner. It's to the point that professionals are desperate to trade on inside information (and even that's not enough).

The average redditor to have outsized returns will need to take ridiculous levels of risks relative to the market. And when so much risk is at stake, a trade that goes 'wrong' can just empty the principal.

Learn to have better risk management. If you need the money immediately, stop speculating with it on the stock market.

Stock market has always been advised for most to be an investment tool for long term holding (in terms of decades), not weeks or a year or two. Short term money should be in safer instruments.

Risk management is a thing.

Anyways, more mature redditors here will have their 'serious money' on broad market ETFs like VTI and VXUS for equities while the single pick stocks are mostly on a 'fun money' account.

And don't buy into anyone in Youtube when it comes to stock trading. If those people were as successful as they claim, why would they need your money (e.g.: sign up to their discord community -pump and dumps-, their 'free book', their courses, etc.) instead of making billions in Wall Street.

I don't try to 'compete' against professional artists in art. So why should I feel confident enough to 'compete' against professional stock traders in Wall Street filled with Phds from Harvard, Princeton, MIT, etc.. It makes no logical sense. You are competing against math Phds from top schools willing to grind 120+ hours a week to 'beat the market' long term. In the short term, anything can happen. But do it long enough and probability will eventually work against you. Now, if you believe you are that < 10% of retail investors, then go ahead. But at least know the risk/reward ahead of time. Risk management is key."

2021-04-14 18:13:57,stocks,"Honestly hard to put a bead on it yet. The biggest cloud over it for me is whether bitcoins volatility is going to start to subside with institutional investors creating selling pressure on the runs and buying pressure on the dips. I think we’re starting to see a bit of that already,  not all that long ago many people thought the run was likely over once again, but then instead of the big drop, we had *tons* of support which was later revealed to be the likes of Tesla and other institutions 

So, we’re at all time highs right now. great time to IPO, maybe not the best time to buy. I do believe they’ll add more cryptos to their exchange, which will be a large increase in revenue (this is where binance has the edge currently) but ultimately bitcoin is going to be the largest contributing factor. The next bear market is going to be the most interesting to me, I’m really interested to see how it evolves with institutions involved now rather than just the emotional retail side alone we’ve had in the past. I’d love to see the next bottom be a less violent retraction with strong support from these institutions, that additional confirmation that the institutions are here to support the price would be more than enough for me to jump in. By then, market discovery takes its place, hype dies down a bit, and you can be sure you’re getting a mostly fair price with a higher ceiling to run up to. 

What I’ve learned dealing with crypto related things is it’s not so much about price as it is about the emotions surrounding the market. If no one is talking about bitcoin you can literally close your eyes and market buy and you’ll make an absolute killing. it has been a highly emotional market dominated by retail thus far. Right now everyone is extremely excited. That alone gives me pause regardless of what their financials say right now.  

To put on a bit of a tin foil hat about speculation, the biggest long term case is obviously bitcoin continuing to grow in adoption, but I’m also really interested in seeing this type of exchange done for actual securities as well. Imagine something like ERC20 tokens representing shares of AAPL I can actually take private key ownership of. damn that’d be really fucking cool. We’re talking about the ability to transact 24/7, peer to peer if desired, and in used more ways than just simple stock market exchange. A serious reduction in the fraud on our exchanges. Look at all this crypto out there that isn’t even meant to be “currency” but rather equity in some type of development platform, but people can use them as currency because of the simple utility of the technology

Of course, you’ll have other companies like TD and fidelity and Schwab doing the same thing at that point- but honestly feels like if anyone is going to front run the new age of value ownership and exchange it’s probably going to be coinbase

So in short my take is; keep an eye on it, let the market digest, see what bitcoin does next time it pulls back, then reassess. Right now it’s as risky as buying bitcoin itself so gauge your tolerance accordingly"

Neptune Digital Assets is also on track. Now unlike Voyager and BIGG Digital...Neptune isn't a trading platform..its bitcoin mining and Defi...again long term...Lotta growth."

2021-04-14 16:56:05,stocks,bought at 384 and sold at 418. Unfortunately not many shares
2021-04-14 17:55:58,stocks,"They sit there with a somewhat fair price at the market open, if everyone could get it. Then they sit there with the brokers and jam up the price even more, slam it all out to retail investors at 10 AM or 11 AM eastern time at even more inflated prices. 

IPOs in the first day don't make much sense for the retail investor. I feel like I just have to start going through the complexity of buying off-market pre-ipo shares that are offloaded by employees because the retail brokers and markets sure as hell aren't going to bother giving you any value."

2021-04-14 19:05:24,stocks,I bought at $381 and sold as soon as it passed $410is
2021-04-14 19:07:51,stocks,"Valuation was higher than the company that runs the NYSE at open.

2021-04-14 17:02:55,stocks,got lucky
2021-04-14 17:10:53,stocks,I did the same with a $381 entry... and then I bought it back at $320. I'm going to watch closely for a few days and see what happens. Maybe there's enough hype to scalp a little more.

2021-04-14 17:57:14,stocks,I meant this from more of a fundamental perspective. Having 5 years of annual reports to look at gives you a good idea on how a company’s doing and would then justify potential investment.

2021-04-14 19:26:10,stocks,"It's the fact you just don't know. You know every IPO is massively overpriced in today's age and that's just how it is. You have to take tech companies at a massive overinflated premium and just hope they relatively justify it.

I find buying in a few times in smaller positions works much better. The first day just always makes me rage though, the demand gets worked out without any actual retail trader input. There is already a ton of value sucked out of early company stock, and one more middleman is trying to take it as well in the last 5 hours before the plebs get access."

2021-04-14 17:58:43,stocks,Oh I don’t look at annual reports and neither do you.  No offense.
2021-04-14 19:45:28,stocks,uhh it's like a 50/50. I wouldn't call that as foreseeing the future. Any IPO or DPO is going to be volatile the 1st day of trading.
2021-04-14 19:11:45,stocks,"I think a DPO will be even more volatile since the investment bankers aren't there to manipulate, I mean stabilize, the price.  There's no greenshoe and I don't think the management even signs lock up agreements."

2021-04-14 19:33:44,stocks,"Price is a big reason. You never know where a stock will stand after its IPO, it’s just not possible to predict. Plus, over the years as earnings come out, price corrections happen in either direction to try and reflect a more fair value. 5 years usually gives a good assessment point and allows for many of these corrections to happen in a shorter window while still being a long enough period for you to assess the company overall."
2021-04-14 19:45:55,stocks,This one was pretty obvious.
2021-04-14 19:40:18,stocks,It was a DPO though...
2021-04-14 19:56:46,stocks,My question is... how do i get access to an api that will let me do this.
2021-04-14 15:48:16,stocks,Because dividends aren’t free money. The stock price will decrease by the amount of the dividend on the ex-dividend date.
2021-04-14 16:15:47,stocks,"Dividend sniping, as you are inferring, often won't work, at least in the very short term.

the share price is automatically adjusted by the dividend amount on opening bell of the ex-date. On opening bell, you are literally net zero. 

However, depending on the stock, this can be recovered in short order. I have seen shares recover dividend value on the same day and even exceed it. It just depends. 

As a very general rule of thumb, this isn't a great strategy. If the stock itself is hot and growing, it can work in your favor... sure. but the dividend payout will be a minor benefit to an otherwise hot stock that is growing, so like... what is the point here? you'd just be holding anyways."
2021-04-14 16:31:13,stocks,Efficient market hypothesis says the stock will drop by the amount of the dividend as now it is technically worth exactly less by the dividend. Often times it doesn’t exactly close down the exact amount of the dividend because stock market is wild and emotional but also accounting for the fact that you will have to pay taxes on the dividend it’s usually not worth it to do this.
2021-04-14 15:47:27,stocks,The stock price must be reduced by the dividend price. This stops ppl like you from doing this.
2021-04-14 16:58:40,stocks,"If you are going to do this, do it in you IRA so there are no immediate tax consequences."
2021-04-14 15:45:57,stocks,"This is a great idea! You buy a stock with your after tax money, sell the stock after the ex-div date, the stock price decreases by the amount of the dividend, AND you get taxed on the dividend. Smart way to loose money."
2021-04-14 15:48:26,stocks,You’ll pay plenty of taxes in this strategy. It’s just a lot more worth it to enjoy holding a company.
2021-04-14 16:09:15,stocks,"What other people said, but adding onto this i believe most companies require you to have held the shares for atleast 60 days to receive dividends. Maybe someone can correct me on that or confirm."
2021-04-14 15:46:51,stocks,"Make sure to do it 2 days before ex-div. From my understanding divs are paid out to settled shares and it takes two days to settle a trade. 

So you’ll have the shares for 3 days minimum. If it dips then you lose?"
2021-04-14 18:48:02,stocks,"What's stopping you? Absolutely nothing! It's just not a good idea because you'll be taxed on the dividend and the stock will (likely) drop by the same amount as the dividend, meaning you'll end up at net zero minus taxes on the dividend"

2021-04-14 15:46:55,stocks,"I’m not too sure myself, but I think it’s primarily due to having to take into account the volatility of said stock and it’s pricing ? Namely will the dividend payout be worth the gamble and potential loss.

Curious though as I’m not sure on the actual logistics of doing such."

2021-04-14 17:32:49,stocks,"You could also do it in a tax advantaged account and there are no tax implications.

You could also be in a situation where the price of the stock has rebounded or increased compared to the price you purchased it at and you haven't lost money on the trade.

It's not a good long-term strategy to try to constantly buy dividends, but you cannot assume that you're always going to lose money doing it."

2021-04-14 17:24:59,stocks,"As long as you hold the shares on the record date (which is usually the day after the ex-dividend date), you will receive the dividend even if you've sold the shares before the payout date.

Ex: Ex date 4/15, Record Date 4/16, pay date 5/15. As long as you own the settled shares on 4/16, you would receive the dividend on 5/15, even if you sold the shares on 5/1 (or any time after the record date and before the pay date).

So, in the above example, you could buy them on 4/12, sell them on 4/20, and receive the dividend on 5/15."

2021-04-14 17:32:56,stocks,"Brokerages must be different. At mine, I often “top up” two days before the ex-div and it records it correctly in time. If ex-div is Wednesday and I trade Monday, I’ll get a statement saying it will record Wednesday. Then when div payouts out it’s there."
2021-04-14 18:39:24,stocks,"I'm not saying he's stupid for personal validation, the truth was it was hurting my eyes to read the nonsense, him feeling good or bad is valueless to me and maybe he get's his butthurt and reads before he asks stupid questions.

The market is in a peculiar spot, climbing without any decent pullback on lighter and lighter volume. That divergence could easily result in a correction akin to those we‘ve seen in late feb/early March. 

Furthermore, the geopolitical situation wrt China doesn’t exactly instill much confidence in Chinese stocks so instead of risking the stock tanking to a level where I‘d have to either average down and increase my position or hold for a longer timeframe, I decided to throw in the towel today. Might revisit it should the environment be more favorable."
2021-04-14 15:47:34,stocks,"There is a shortage going on with NIO, and they are not producing at the level they need to be. This led to the stock dropping several percent.  It had rallied back up to about 45, and then traded sideways for a while between 40-45 when the shortage info came out, it tanked and has not recovered since.


Charts only mean so much when there is valid proof and reasoning as to why the stock is trading the way it is, as opposed to things that make no sense like Gamestop's stock.

>NIO estimated the production shutdown could reduce its first-quarter deliveries by up to 1,000 vehicles, to 19,500. Investors responded by knocking shares down more than 5% the day of the announcement. Subsequent to the end of the month, however, NIO reported first-quarter deliveries of 20,060. This was within the company's original guidance range, and represented growth of 423% over 2020's first quarter. 
The stock has rebounded off recent lows, but is still more than 36% off highs reached in early February."

Upside of a DPO is its  not as expensive, downside is there is no lock up so share holders can dump if the price goes up....its going to be very volatile company and you can probably buy it at $250 if your patient.  I think this company value was/is massively inflated doubling in value in the past 2 months."
2021-04-14 13:56:54,stocks,IPO and DPO is not for us commoners. Sometimes these things pump and dump so maybe we can get them at a later date for a reasonable price. Don’t hole your breath though. The stock market is set up for the rich. We get the leavings.
2021-04-14 13:46:43,stocks,"Yes you’re understanding of it is wrong. It’s much different than an IPO, but in coinbase case the reference price 250 was just a reference price. There is a premarket time where they coordinate bid/ask spreads of early buyers and sellers, once a price has been set then it gets listed at that price. You as a regular investor can’t get in until it gets listed"

I know it's boomer talk, but it matters more so for these stocks than the meme ones. Anyone who took a look at it could see that there is growth potential here in the short term, but that 1. It's volatile, 2. It's likely to be overvalued based on hype 3. It's still very early and 4. Coinbase itself is not necessarily the best product in it's market, it's just the first to go public.   


TLDR: Meme logic doesn't apply, it's important to do some fundamental and traditional research. I want to hodl as much as the next ape, but if we're to learn anything from all that it's that research is key and every stock is different. Strategize accordingly."

2021-04-14 16:21:22,stocks,"> what is the advantage of buying stock in Coinbase?

There isn't one. Coinbase makes it easy to buy crypto today. Given its success, other brokers will speed up their crypto-buying capabilities, and within 6 months Coinbase will drop like a stone. 

Coinbase is worth < $10-billion, and even that's only because of their huge customer base and first-mover status, rather than any sort of moat. 

The stock's a loser."
2021-04-14 18:13:32,stocks,"There isn't, bitcoin is massively stronger than other cryptos because of the size of it's network and how no org controls it. Coinbase charges relatively high fees and doesn't come close to the volume Binance facilitates."

2021-04-14 19:44:45,stocks,"What I've witnessed today is that nobody really knows. Nobody knew yesterday the intro price was being raised. Nobody knew at $424+ the shareholders dumping would overrun the incoming buying. We can speculate and hypothesize.

Research suggested the upward would take traction, but the behavior in the first 5 minutes suggested danger signs. I believed it would start at $250 and possibly touch $750 by closing, with a 38% chance of losing 25-30% value. But, that was based on the $250 price we were given. Starting at $380 may have sparked selling from current shareholders."
2021-04-14 19:34:51,stocks,Definitely tank as well. I bet the price of Coinbase will follow the price drops/climbs of the broader crypto market the same way other public blockchain companies do.

Snapchat is at 93.5B

AMD is at 95B

Zoom is at 96B

Airbnb is at 107B

Uber is at 110B


Not saying a lot of these are overvalued or not. Just that it puts Coinbase in perspective. I think CB should be worth more than all of these in a pandemic (maybe not AMD) and that it especially has a higher ceiling too (again, besides AMD). Although Airbnb and Uber will do better after the pandemic should a huge recession doesn’t arrive. 
Coinbase however might be more inflation and recession proof if the average person is turning to cryptos to edge against inflation.

Edit: added AMD and Zoom market caps to the list for frame of comparison."

2021-04-14 16:44:07,stocks,"Holding BTC means if its value goes down so does your investment. Coinbase makes revenue off every transaction, regardless of the direction of BTCs move."

I’d give it a few days or a week, the price won’t skyrocket as fast from FOMO like how crypto does since coinbase is still unknown to the public (globally speaking). Closing at 4PM will also give investors room to think about their investments."

2021-04-14 17:36:14,stocks,"My personal reason: decentralized execution environment for code - ethereum virtual machine presents a competing web app platform to that of the centralized cloud industry. There are a few compelling traits of decentralized encryption, but they boil down to this: For fault tolerance, availability of information, and integrity/non-repudiation, distributed ledgers offer a significant advantage over centralized systems. 

It took nearly 20 years for internet infrastructure to reach the 2-5 Mbps speeds that enabled products like youtube and Netflix in the early-mid 2000's. Cryptocurrency investments are cool and great and fun, but they are a byproduct of the invention of the ""Internet of Value"". You might not find it useful right now, but there are a hell of a lot of people who do. Plenty more are pouring time and money into making the Internet of Value easier to integrate with.

Car Deeds could be NFT's. Tickets to a concert could be the same type of tokens used for ICO's in 2017. The Internet of Value doesn't mean investments. Before it, there was no way to stop copy/ pasting in the digital realm- now there is. It is up to our imaginations as to how we can seize that opportunity to improve our daily lives!"

2. Because you can create different ones with different features and specifications.
3. They don't use them, it's speculative.
4. It's speculative.

Sorry this was not the full answer.  People *think* we will use them because they can't be messed with by a central bank.  Right now the US Federal Reserve is printing money, which makes the value of every dollar you hold go down slightly.  This is called inflation.

With Bitcoin and other cryptos there is no central bank, and the supply is capped.  That means the value of Bitcoin cannot go down because a central bank or entity decides to make more of it.

Nobody actually uses it to buy stuff though."
2021-04-14 17:59:00,stocks,"I have to agree here. 1) if an outage occurs, you can’t use it lol 2) ever heard of a fractional share? They can continue to fracture bitcoin if there are none left, and the fraction can continue on and on for an infinite period of time. The whole “theres only so much!” Is a psychological selling point meant to make you think it’s more valuable than it is like Adidas Yeezy’s back in 2012-2017. 3) it costs a lot of money and energy to use and transact bitcoin than regular currency especially at these prices.

Personally I think considering there's people that got into Btc when it was in the 3-digits, only a couple years ago, how much higher it can sustain. I can maybe understand smaller alt coins, but surely, for having the most popular coin to double from here, it'd have to reach $120k, which is a 120-150 folds increase from people that just bought it a couple years ago. Seems absurd to think it's possible to turn such a popular investment from $1k to over $150k within a couple years. The money has to come from somewhere, or maybe it doesn't, thinking about bconnect if anyone remembers that."

The people who are doing this increasingly have no idea what the fuck they are doing.  The chance of a huge bubble bursting is nearly 100% in my view.  

While this is almost certainly won’t bring down coinbase, it will bring tons of press and regulatory pressure on them.  It probably grows in the long term - but this company in particular is going to be a wild ride.

I could see it going to 10.  I would probably buy it at that price.  But you’d have to be insane to buy it at 100...just because of the risk.  People aren’t seeing it right now.  But leverage in the crypto community is a major problem."

But then, after months to years, you get to see the real growth.

FB took a few years to 2x the IPO price, but it did.  And ROKU only took a few months to 2x.

I'm not saying COIN will 2x ever, but we need to see more info, get more reports, see how much trading volume will even go through coinbase now that it has the exposure of being publicly tradable.

Another IPO like SFIX had a lot of potential, it got better and better, was stagnant for years until it exploded in price, but it's been falling (50% from ATH) because the fundamentals aren't that good."

Reciprocal gift giving among families was common, and from there currency arose.

Then you have this exchange Coinbase that has been established to have essentially acted like an uninsured bank lending out what should supposedly be worth huge sums of money but is in reality the same dollars multiple times and suddenly you have the very real evidence that the whole thing is an unsustainable bubble at current valuations.

From china's point of view, they want to get… they don't like the US having this reserve currency because it gives us, you know, a lot of leverage over Iranian oil supply chains and all sorts of things like that…

…Even though I'm sort of a pro-crypto, pro-bitcoin maximalist person, I do wonder whether at this point bitcoin should also be thought in part as a Chinese financial weapon against the US, where it threatens fiat money. But it especially threatens the US dollar, and China wants to do things to weaken it.

So, it's sort of 'China's long bitcoin' and perhaps from a geopolitical perspective, the US should be a little bit… be asking some tougher questions about exactly how that works

We both have a contract saying we will give the middle man, the escrow company, a small fee to facilitate the transaction. Once both parties fulfilled their obligations in terms of asset allocation they release the assets... again for a fee. This is important because publicly traded companies shouldn’t be able to do this type of transfer. However, bitcoin and a lot of other cryptos can obfuscate that because owning a crypto is like owning a car... right now... easily transferable"

You can have that person directly send the bitcoin to your wallet and you can send them the cash. This is LITERALLY the point of decentralized currency. Escrows as a middle man are for a layer of protection but if I had 10k BTC I could send them to you right now without going through coinbase or kraken

It is non existent, Coinbase has already mentioned they are working on lowering fees, how? Maybe they take the lead of Binance and create it's own chain so active traders can cut down on fees. 

Coinbase has room to grow still by a large margin and there is innovation throughout the field. I see it as a loaded spring, their selectivity in which coins they list is one indicator of this in my opinion. We all know the coinbase effect, and I think the stock will grow everytime they add a coin by transitive effect."

We have institutional investors now though, so although I agree Bitcoin is volatile, I don't believe it can be as volatile as it was during the previous bull run. Bitcoin being a store of value, 2nd generation chains building on that, and the new generation of coins coming out are going to be looking at providing micro and macro services. There's room for growth, it's being realized as we speak, and we have enough real world systems that need block chain services to increase efficiency."

But I see your point now!

But also, what you're describing is what other cryptos do. You can do that with exact same thing on stellar for cheaper and quicker than using an escrow service."

2021-04-14 18:38:21,stocks,Not the point dude.
2021-04-14 19:57:03,stocks,"Then why would they get into crypto?

To provide a niche service and compete not only with coinbase but the crypto as a whole all while providing a slower, more costly, and less secure service?"

2021-04-14 13:22:48,stocks,"I’m not trading, I’m investing. Prices are random in the short term but over the long term you’d expect them to on average reflect intrinsic value. A smaller percentage of my portfolio is in high conviction stock picks but otherwise I’m broadly diversified because only a small fraction of stocks drive market gains over a long timeframe. I’m not smart enough or clairvoyant to see which stocks will be in that subset so I’m content for the market to figure out and I just ride that discovery."

2021-04-14 13:57:39,stocks,Definitely! Sprouts caters to the Grad Hospital/Point Breeze area but no one in any other part is going there just to go there. I think they are building a Whole Foods on Washington and like 20th so that should change things one way or another

It's carbon copy of actual building inside their software which makes it easier to manage and maintain buildings/infrastructure.

South African consumer Internet company headquartered in Cape Town. Its principal operations include online advertising, fintech, payments, and food delivery. Majority stakeholder of Prosus ($PRX.AS). Prosus recently made headlines with the announcement to sell 15bn of its Tencent shares. 

Bull thesis would be that they put the money to good use. Buying shares back, some blockbuster acquisitions and to invest in their other companies.
Also you’re able to buy Tencent through Naspers at a huge discount, if you wanna buy Tencent.

Bear thesis is that Tencent was just a one time thing (they acquired a 30% stake for just ~25M in 2002 worth billions now). 
Any thoughts?"

The person he worked closely with who was supposed to take over, passed away. Together they are the ones who bought Tencent and made a lot of smart investments. 

The new CEO Bob van Dijk was working at EBay as some general manager of Germany and Europe Emerging Markets. Which seems to me he is under qualified, but I don’t really know what makes one qualified, honestly. Maybe they think he has the tool. Hasn’t done nothing wrong, nor nothing particularly exciting. He is just plain boring, that’s all. All I’m saying it’s like losing a great CEO for just a decent one. But time will tell. 

I’m heavily in both Prosus and Naspers."

3. Finally and most interestingly, I suggest you look into Mike Green and his theory of the impact of passive investing.  Very interesting and suggests that companies are decoupling from ""merit"" as they're buoyed up by mindless passive dollars

Good luck!"
2021-04-14 12:00:51,stocks,The only thing that changes stock prices are people buying and selling. Having good fundamentals is a good indicator people might want to buy it in the future. It’s not a guarantee though.
2021-04-14 17:07:16,stocks,"Stock prices and stock value are two different concepts. They’re closely related, but not the same.

Stock prices are determined by what a buyer is willing to pay for a share of stock in a given company. There are many different factors that can influence stock prices.

Stock value is never point-in-time accurate with stock prices. But in the long run, they do tend to accurately reflect the value of the company."
2021-04-14 13:13:09,stocks,"The market is inherently irrational. Stocks usually either fall into momentum stocks that rise due to them rising or value stocks that have good fundamentals. The former was the correct choice in 2020.

That said, over time, value always prevails. Companies that have revenue, good P/E, and low debt increase in price over time. It's why Warren Buffett is as rich as he is.

But that doesn't mean you can't profit from momentum or overvalued stocks. Who cares if Tesla has a p/e ration of over 1000 if that's what the market decides it's worth. Just always be prepared for quick and sudden snap backs when the market also goes, ya, this is overvalued."
2021-04-14 15:06:37,stocks,"Stocks move on people buying or selling stocks. That's it. Nothing else influences the price.

2021-04-14 14:38:37,stocks,"Most of the volume you see is algo trading, actual people buy and sell rarely in comparison. That's why most moves in the short term make little sense."
2021-04-14 12:15:11,stocks,"Lol what you said is so contradictory. Hedge funds don't borrow a stock to dump and  drive the price down, they want the opposite when they borrow a stock. Archegos was forced to sell by its lenders the last thing they wanted wa stheir holdings to go down"

Smaller companies are playing in this space too but this is an industry that is over-primed for regulation. Please watch the recently released film, [Coded Bias](https://www.codedbias.com/).

Using technology alone is contributes to a violation of your freedom. Preventing countries in the EU from utilising one of the novel computing advancements of our time is ridiculous, I'm sure the EU will next propose to not use state of the art cancer treatment because it uses AI as well...

2021-04-14 14:12:06,stocks,"The level of data we are able to collect is massive, too large for it to be directly useful for a human observer.

Instead hundreds of thousands of AI systems will observe these data points. From there they'll determine correlations of behaviors and patterns to both exploit large scale social behavior in nearly real time as well as provide avenues to target specific people based on generic personality profiles.

Next any one who wants to run against the current political party or upset the current industry partners/lobbyists/etc. will have an abundance of data mined from them over a lifetime. Knowing their weaknesses, behaviors, and more will make them more easily dealt with.

Provide enough time and centralization of these data collecting/parsing operations and we'll start to see whole efforts to fabricate reasons for the public to dislike X person who is a threat to established group B.

We already know the state can't be trusted with that level of unilateral power, this is also true for any entity that becomes a significant part of our societal lives."
2021-04-14 16:00:25,stocks,"I think maybe further down the road it could be used for predictive policing. This could be looked at as a ""cost offset"" to the government by ""saving tax dollars"" through ""public private partnerships"" that could  ""mitigate"" a problem/burden someone/sociey faces. Let's say if all of their schooling records, past police encounters, medical history, internet usage, etc. were all kept on an online ledger of some sort then the AI could scan the face, match it to the records on the ledger and possibly stop a crime before it happens. 

I guess a kind of extreme example would be if a man named Joe has had mental health issues in the past, spends lots of time in ""extremest"" online chat groups, and has been arrested before, tries to enter a movie theater. The AI can scan his face, pair it to the records and possibly prevent him from entering the building under suspicion - maybe he recently purchased a gun. This would possibly save the gov prison costs and lives.

This tech could be used for many things - health care, education, housing, etc. 

To clarify, I do not agree with AI surveillance at all. I'm formulating this opinion based off my own research."

I think making people aware would help make the parks safer by scaring away anyone wanting to commit a crime.  Personally I don't care since I'm not a criminal. On the plus they use it to add ride photos to your photo account. With AI and computers running it there is so many people and so much data nobody could possibly look at all of the footage so it means pretty much nothing most of the time. The only time humans would actually look at it is if there was a crime or something specific they were looking for. So if you went to Disney world with your girlfriend instead of your wife you are pretty much safe. Lol

If you have the option to drop $100,000 on a stock that will go up over 20+ years, or put $500 a month in the same stock, yeah putting $500 a month will result in lower returns.  But if you don't have the option, it's a moot point, and it ignores that stocks also go down.

# Ford’s ‘Mother of All Road Trips’ Tests BlueCruise Hands-Free Driving Ahead of Over-the-Air Push to F-150, Mustang Mach-E

  

* Following 500,000 miles of development testing, Ford embarked on a  110,000-mile “Mother of All Road Trips” across the United States and  Canada to prove out BlueCruise hands-free highway driving technology in a  wide range of driving and weather conditions
* 2021 Ford F-150 and 2021 Mustang Mach-E vehicles equipped with the available Ford Co-Pilot360™ Active 2.0 Prep Package can receive BlueCruise later this year through over-the-air software update.    
 
* BlueCruise will give drivers the comfort and confidence of  hands-free driving on prequalified sections of divided highways called  Hands-Free Blue Zones that make up more than 100,000 miles of North  American roads  
 
* Additional Ford vehicles to receive BlueCruise technology in coming  years as Ford continues to add additional highways and deliver new  hands-free driving capabilities to F-150, Mustang Mach-E and more

**DEARBORN, Mich., April 14, 2021** – Ford will begin offering its  new BlueCruise hands-free highway driving system to customers later  this year after 500,000 miles of development testing and fine-tuning the  technology on a journey across the United States and Canada.

Last year, Ford sent a fleet of 10 test vehicles – five F-150 pickups  and five all-electric Mustang Mach-E SUVs – to complete what test  drivers dubbed the “Mother of All Road Trips.” The trek covered more  than 110,000 miles through 37 states and five Canadian provinces to  challenge BlueCruise against a wide range of road, weather and traffic  conditions.

“There are highway intricacies and driving conditions that you simply  cannot replicate in a lab,” said Hau Thai-Tang, Ford chief product  platform and operations officer. “Sending these vehicles out for  real-world driving experience is just one of many ways we ensured that  BlueCruise technology offers confidence and convenience for drivers all  across the continent.”  

Via over-the-air software updates, BlueCruise will be offered later  this year on 2021 F-150 and 2021 Mustang Mach-E models equipped with the  available Ford Co-Pilot360™ Active 2.0 Prep Package.  Over-the-air software updates allow owners of select Ford vehicles to  update software from the convenience of their own garage.

Ford is targeting to sell more than 100,000 vehicles equipped with  BlueCruise in the first year, based on company sales and take-rate  projections.

**Mother of All Road Trips becomes the ultimate Ford test drive**

All 10 test vehicles – one departing from Palo Alto, California, the  others from Dearborn, Michigan – spent much of last November and  December winding their way across the United States and Canada. Test  drivers searched for every conceivable road condition and highway  driving scenario, monitoring the system’s performance, collecting data  and highlighting areas where improvements could be made.

The trip marked the final leg of a development process that ran up  more than a half-million miles in a series of shorter test drives, each  designed to evaluate a specific aspect of BlueCruise. As real-world  validation of those earlier tests, road trip enabled the system to scan  for variances in road signage, lane markings, exit ramps, traffic  patterns and weather.

“I drive long-distance quite often, whether out to Boston or down to  Florida to visit family or friends, and usually I mentally tire out on  drives that far,” said Alexandra Taylor, BlueCruise feature development  engineer, who logged more than 3,000 miles in an F-150 on the trek. “The  one thing that became clear is that, when using BlueCruise, long drives  aren’t nearly as mentally taxing to me.”

Taylor and fellow BlueCruise engineer Shruti Gotadki set out on an  eight-day journey that wound through the southeast United States,  targeting driving differences between Jacksonville, Louisville, Atlanta  and other major urban areas.

Back at the Ford lab, driver-assist technology supervisor Justin  Teems monitored the progress of the entire fleet, corralling important  data that will help shape BlueCruise driving experience in the months  and years ahead.

“It was like mission control,” Teems said. “We really wanted to push  BlueCruise to its limits. Every state builds roads a little differently.  When you include factors like lane line degradation, weather and  construction, building a hands-free driving system becomes extremely  complex. Those complexities are why Ford has the best team of engineers  in the world working on it.”

**BlueCruise, the evolution of Ford Co-Pilot360 Technology**

Using both advanced camera and radar-sensing technologies and  building upon Intelligent Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop-and-Go, Lane  Centering and Speed Sign Recognition, BlueCruise adds a new level of  convenience for drivers with vehicles equipped with Ford Co-Pilot360  Technology. The feature allows a driver to operate truly hands-free on  prequalified sections of divided highways called Hands-Free Blue Zones. A  driver-facing camera in the instrument cluster monitors eye gaze and  head position to help ensure the driver’s eyes remain on the road.

Currently, more than 100,000 miles of highways across North America  are dedicated Hands-Free Blue Zones in the Ford GPS mapping system.  BlueCruise uses blue lighting on the digital instrument cluster to  indicate when the vehicle is in a hands-free zone.

In addition to the full hands-free mode, equipped vehicles will also  feature Lane Centering mode. Lane Centering works on most roads with  lane lines and can help keep the vehicle centered in its lane but  requires drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel. In either  mode, a visual prompt on the instrument cluster notifies drivers when  they need to return their attention to the road or resume control of the  vehicle.

BlueCruise is an SAE Level 2 driver-assist technology, similar to  Tesla Autopilot but with the advantage of offering a true hands-free  driving experience while in Hands-Free Mode that does not require a  driver’s hands to stay in contact with the steering wheel, unless  prompted by vehicle alerts.

And unlike other approaches – such as GM’s Super Cruise, which uses  red and green lighting, or Tesla’s Autopilot, which requires a driver  keep their hands on the steering wheel – BlueCruise communicates with  drivers in different ways. The instrument cluster transitions to  communicate that the feature is in Hands-Free mode through text and blue  lighting cues, effective even for those with color blindness.

**More highways and features to come**

Beyond the 2021 F-150 and 2021 Mustang Mach-E, additional Ford  vehicles will also receive BlueCruise hands-free driving technology,  while current owners continue to receive over-the-air software updates  to add new features and capabilities in the coming years.

Future enhancements are planned to include Lane Change Assist that  will let the vehicle change lanes with just a tap of the turn signal  indicator, and Predictive Speed Assist that will adjust vehicle speed  for road curves, roundabouts and more.

Ford also plans to offer regular mapping updates for the technology  to recognize changes plus thousands of miles of planned new road  additions.

**Affordable** **hands-free highway driving technology**

2021 F-150 and 2021 Mustang Mach-E customers will be able to purchase  BlueCruise software – including a three-year service period – for $600  in the second half of 2021, when it’s ready to launch. Hardware pricing  varies by vehicle.

For F-150, BlueCruise is available as a part of the Ford Co-Pilot 360  Active 2.0 package for a total of $1,595 – $600 for the software and  $995 for the hardware. The Ford Co-Pilot 360 Active 2.0 package is  standard on F-150 Limited and available as an option on Lariat, King  Ranch and Platinum models.

For Mustang Mach-E, BlueCruise comes standard on CA Route 1, Premium  and First Edition variants. It’s an available package on the Select trim  for $3,200 – $ 600 for the software and $2,600 for the rest of the  package – as part of the larger Comfort and Technology package, which  includes features such as a 360-degree camera, heated front seats and  heated steering wheel.

It’s therefore less of a capability issue and more of a preemptive move to reduce need for regulation"

It does not turn a Tesla into a self-driving car nor does it make a car autonomous. ... If you repeatedly ignore these warnings, you will be locked out from using Autopilot during that trip.”

Ford is more akin to what GM is doing, where you do not have to have your hands on the wheel at all unless prompted. GM does this by having a camera face the driver and will alarm if you aren’t looking at the road"

2021-04-14 09:05:24,stocks,How can you disagree with something I didnt say? Where did I say Ford is going away soon? Ford is so far behind in EVs and autonomous driving that if you think they are relevant you're just ignorant and fell prey to their advertising efforts. Level 2 hands free highway is easy. Getting to level 4 or 5 takes years of data collection and code writing. While Tesla is nearing the finish line Ford is just starting. Ford will ultimately have to license their autonomous driving.

2021-04-14 10:40:34,stocks,"I test drove a Mach-E and the work Ford put into it was outstanding. It was an amazing drive, had good storage, and is a real competitor for the upper-middle class market. My mom and Grandpa were with me and they loved the Mach more than the Y. Even their friends who had a chance to test drive the different cars agreed that the Mach was their preferred vehicle. I'll be shocked if Ford doesn't capitalize on that interest from that prime financial group of people and beat Tesla to a sub $30,000 EV even if they have to take a partial loss on those sales.

The Mach and Y are being pitched towards 30-65+ peeps with solid financial standings. I think the reason my mom and gramps loved it was because of the familiarity with all the buttons, gauges, and traditional driver cockpit layout. The Y is much more of a GenZ type environment, but it's incredibly confusing especially when you are told to watch videos on how to drive it instead of a tech walking ya through it at pick up (covid precaution).

Edit: One of the really unique things too about the Mach is unlike every other Ford vehicle, the Mach's price is hard set by Ford.

Perhaps you should let him in on the secret.

"" While the current pilot version of City Streets is still in a validation and review stage, we expect the functionality to remain largely unchanged in a future, full release to the customer fleet. We are analyzing the data obtained in the pilot and using it to refine the feature’s operation and customer experience. We will continue to make refinements as necessary, and only after we are fully satisfied with performance, integrity, and safety will we release the feature to the customer fleet. That said, we do not expect significant enhancements in OEDR or other changes to the feature that would shift the responsibility for the entire DDT to the system. As such, a final release of City Streets will continue to be an SAE Level 2, advanced driver-assistance feature. ""

Price drops to $133. Your checking account remains at $2000. Price surges to $145. Your checking account remains at $2000. 

Money is truly gained or loss at the point of sale, when the sell price is added to your account. 

Example, you sell at $133. Your account adds $133, making it $2133. You lost $1 on your $134 investment."

People could buy infinite shares for no money, and without money being put into it, the price can't go up. This is extremely rare and if you keep up to date with that company, you would realize this before it happens. If it hit $0.0001, then yes you could recoup your money, although it would be hard.

A more realistic example would be buying 1 share of a company for $100. This price could go up to $150, then down to $20, and back up to $80 and so on. So long as you don't sell this share, you aren't gaining or losing money. Your share is gaining and losing value. If you sold that share at $150, then you would have made $50 (Sell price - Buy price). If you sold it when it was worth $20, you would have lost $80 (same formula)."

Two drastically different situations.  I don't know a damn thing about options - except that they have expiration dates.  Maybe that's what you bought. And the reason it's 0 is because it expired.  If that's the case then yes, the money is gone.

FWIW - a share of stock is a share in the future earnings of the company.  The prices goes up and down based on how many people want to buy that share from you because they can't get them from somewhere else.  There are companies with no earnings and their stock is not 0."

JPM, under Jamie Dimon, have become stalwart and constant earners, the BRK of banking if you will.

And we wouldn't know for sure how committed the government was with the fiscal stimulus checks to pop up the economies. There's nothing wrong with him and team took the proactive measure to reduce perceived risk, and at the same time, they probably need to build up cash reverse for claims..

I meant riskless in relativity to other potential investments. JPMC quite literally has a fortress balance sheet, they've made themselves, via their credit activities (chiefly CDS') a vital aspect of the global economy, they've hedged themselves against inflation, hedged themselves against high volatility, etc. I don't see a scenario, asides from a complete global meltdown or fraudulent reporting, where JPMC fails."

2021-04-14 17:11:54,stocks,If they deploy the cash on a safe bet like JPM then they can’t use it strategically.

2021-04-14 12:38:28,stocks,So some people have been wondering if price will drop to two digits. Looks like not this week.
2021-04-14 15:01:05,stocks,"I bought in at $166 today. I think I might've bought on the top of the wave, once again. Damnit. $172 might've been the peak and now maybe it's going to dip down to the 140's or lower again. I was thinking this spike looks similar to the last one so maybe we'de be going to the high 100's again. 

We'll see what happens tomorrow. Hopefully it charts upwards and not downwards."

2021-04-14 00:00:00,stocks,"Trading advice Hi, I would like to start trading internationally, just a bit here and there. Initially no more than £5k.

I've opened up an Investment ISA with Barclays but this is just for UK trading. I'm looking to invest in international stocks but am not sure what platform to use?

As I've opened up an ISA this tax year, what's my best option for a little bit of trading internationally (£500 here and there)?

I have read reviews on the major platforms and there's always some scary reviews about not being able to access money, large fees, lack of customer support, etc etc. 

I'm new to this and that terrifies me. I'm OK with the risk of the volatility of share prices but I'm just worried about the actual platform being 'dodgy' so to speak.

As I say, I'm only talking £1-5k of investing so nothing major. 
Any advice would be much appreciated!"
2021-04-14 06:48:45,stocks,"I use DEGIRO. Platform isn’t great, it’s definitely not good for day trading, but it’s cheap, I’m paying like $0.50 for Nasdaq trades. I was previously trading with my bank charging about 15x that per trade. 

There’s a lot of hate out there for DEGIRO but I don’t get why, for a casual investor looking for a cheap broker it seems fine to me."
2021-04-14 06:32:59,stocks,it's not the best but if you're just starting out i'd use freetrade
2021-04-14 07:27:03,stocks,Personally I use etoro and quite like the UI. Depends what kind of trading you want to do. They’re certainly not dodgy.

2021-04-14 09:17:39,stocks,"**Daily Stock Market Forecast**

Today's a good day to trade in stocks that are usually terrible decisions. I have a hunch that some of our favorite meme stocks are going to see green days today. The rest of the market, however, is going to be pretty boring.

**Bull Case:**

* Earnings season has started and banks reported better than expected earnings. This resulted in big boosts for all three big banks -- which were then promptly erased and put back to normal.  
At an unscientific glance, this seems to be par for the course. It looks like, historically, earnings haven't been a big deal breaker for the big banks, which are already fairly valued.

**Bear Case:**

* J. Powell is speaking today, but it's not a particularly important speech and the market doesn't really seem to care.

Two big things are happening today, but I don't really think the market is going to care about either one. Today's going to see a slight pullback from yesterday's excitement, but should, on the whole, be fairly flat.

I'm forecasting a NASDAQ **high of 14,045** and a **low of 13,965**, with the market closing **red**, but I think it's going to be one of those so-close-to-neutral that it doesn't make a difference days.

It was a company I liked and thought it was a good entry point below 9 dollars.  I usually go through stocktwits and I know it's a bunch of cheerleading, nonsense,  and short attacks.  

Everyone keeps saying it's shorted a ridiculous amount.  That was part of way I stuck around for a while.  I have 1100+ shares.  

QUESTION: how often do squeezes work.  I've been perusing other stocktwits (I take everything with two grains of salt) and realize a lot of people are screaming the same stuff about oversold and shorted to oblivion. If some news is dropped by Canoo that should drive the price normally to say 12usd, will it actually go much higher because of the short float? 

Is my money in a solid place? I sold out and back in at 9.41 for 1138 shares. Not really asking for advice,  just is all the ""WHAT IDIOT WOULD SELL THIS WITH A 40 PERCENT SHORT INTEREST"" someone manipulation?

2021-04-14 10:00:02,stocks,"So for Coin, I’m being asked what the most I’d  be willing to pay per share then asked how many shares to determine my max cost. If I have 1.2k to invest and want as many shares as I can for the 1.2k do I just put my willing to pay price at like 600 and then say 2 shares to get to the 1,200 max? What happens if the open price is like 400? Does it still automatically spend the 1,200 and just get more shares or will it only give me 2 shares since that’s what I input for the shares count. 

I’m using the app that shall not be named and apparently my account doesn’t have enough comments karma to post there...been working on the switching to a new platform process, but still want to try to get in on the opportunity for today. Any help understanding this would be appreciated!"

But now is an absolute horrible time to buy IMO.  I know it's that same old dumb advice ""be fearful when others are greedy"", but really.  This just looks insane right now. I'm out and sticking with my boomer stocks until I see what happens with this thing longer-term.  If it truly is going to be a bona-fide asset class for diversification then it won't really matter when we get in.

If it's just riding a wave then what goes up must come down.  That's how I look at it at least.  You could profit off it but I'm in this for the long-term.  Speculative buyers beware."

On a personal mental level long term i struggle with the volatility and the 24/7 trading. The whole dropping 10% in one day being normal is a lot for me to handle and accept"

2021-04-14 15:22:52,stocks,I think what is happening is that is a stock attracting short term traders. Saw it with people saying the conference would send the stock to $30 and that they were buying weekly options that it was a clear pump and dump in the short term.

2021-04-14 10:15:34,stocks,Infinite shares at 7 would never get your CB down to 7....
2021-04-14 10:56:51,stocks,"This equation cannot be solved for. Your cost basis will never reach 7. If you say you wanted your cost basis to be $6 (basically anything below 7), then that's possible.

&#x200B;

\[(10 times Original Share Price) + (X times Current Share Price)\]/(10 + X) = 6

X = 30 shares"
2021-04-14 10:25:19,stocks,you can use goalseek in excel to figure out how many shares you need at a certain price to hit the CB you want.
2021-04-14 10:43:16,stocks,"If my math is correct, you would need to buy about 70 shares at $7 to bring your average cost down to near $7/share

[10(10) + 7x ] ÷ (10 + x) = 7

Simplified as:

10+7x = 7



(10 + 7x) ÷ 7x = (7 ÷ 7x)

10 = 7 ÷ 7x

70 = x


To check my work I averaged [10(10) + 7(70)] / 80 =$7.375

You'll never be able to get your average  cost to $7 exactly if you're buying at $7/share, because your average cost per share is already higher than that"

Just see what you think is legit and will continue to grow and sell what you think are not going to grow. Reinvest the money into VTI and forget about it until the next round of earnings and see the current stocks that you had conviction in. If you still have faith in them keep them, if not just sell and reinvest in VTI. Re-do this until you get to 6-7 positions you strongly believe in. Not financial advice though I am fucking stupid"

Best I can tell is a lot of earnings being posted today, so a big sell off right before makes sense. Traders selling off from the recent rally to ATH's so they can digest the earnings reports and decide where to park their money next."
2021-04-14 10:15:21,stocks,"Is it still worth getting LTC? Feel like that's skippable these days.


I did basically do this strategy in 2017 and it turned out nicely by now. Looking at all the craziness going on though and trying to prepare"
2021-04-14 15:02:22,stocks,I plan to buy crypto for my parents next year. Gonna wait for the dump either this September or EOY. By then I would have more money for crypto. Right now I want to focus on stocks.
2021-04-14 09:37:55,stocks,Pineapple power has done really well recently too
2021-04-14 11:23:12,stocks,Bloomberg just updated again. Now 355
2021-04-14 13:05:03,stocks,When will it be live?
2021-04-14 15:35:09,stocks,"firstly, it's not an ETF. secondly, the man is 90 years old. his demise is priced in already and there surely have been contingency plans for a while already."
2021-04-14 16:45:13,stocks,It’ll rise by 10%. New management in charge of hundreds of billions to unleash?  Yep!
2021-04-14 17:37:20,stocks,Is this true? Where did you find this on bloomberg?
2021-04-14 16:50:43,stocks,That makes me kind of happy. Generally these flash crashes are followed by some positive days. But we gotta wait and see
2021-04-14 08:54:37,stocks,"WFC - has lagged the rest of the banks due to federal restrictions imposed some time ago.  Good earnings announcement this morning combined with easing of court-imposed measures bode well for their future.  

JPM is an all-star among banks."
2021-04-14 10:02:55,stocks,"Damn, I'm afraid to jump in now lol"
2021-04-14 10:06:11,stocks,34% why does that bug you so much?
2021-04-14 11:53:28,stocks,"there was some dude talking about it a ton in here like a month ago, haven't seen him around anymore. I'm guessing some people bought in, never really saw the appeal."
2021-04-14 11:54:53,stocks,"Well it did great for me for a ride from $33 to $47. But I didn’t sell and knew it would dip a bit, but didn’t expect to see $25.

And it’s my one speculative “play”. I think the company has a great concept, they’ve been smart with the companies they’ve bought (imo), they’ve expanded well.

And I’m new to this and this stock has definitely taught me a lot so far, didn’t plan on that but it did."
2021-04-14 11:44:26,stocks,It's possible that the selling continues so institutions and big players that are interested can get in on COIN.
2021-04-14 11:55:38,stocks,Tech is still trending up overall but is taking a dip today as growth oriented money is freed up for COIN
2021-04-14 13:04:38,stocks,"Tokenized versions of the stock are in mid 400's right now (low 600's this morning). Who knows how well that correlates to what it will be at market, but I kind of doubt we will see $700. Maybe back to $600."
2021-04-14 14:58:34,stocks,now its down again
2021-04-14 15:04:42,stocks,He spoke last week and spy went greener. Can’t catch a fcking break
2021-04-14 14:57:59,stocks,Do you want an award or something
2021-04-14 07:55:15,stocks,The exuberance around COIN and cryptos is scaring me idk.
2021-04-14 19:10:53,stocks,what a reasonable and intelligent response.
2021-04-14 08:24:05,stocks,Tesla got multiple rating and target upgrades most above 1000 in the last week. Based on them becoming an energy platform.
2021-04-14 07:56:17,stocks,"Didn't Tesla buy like $1-2 billion in bitcoin a couple months back?

Their stock movement will be linked to bitcoin for a while longer"
2021-04-14 07:50:15,stocks,Ya idk but I guess that’s a likely possibility
2021-04-14 09:20:07,stocks,Tsla was oversold
2021-04-14 10:37:46,stocks,Welp time to change my position now
2021-04-14 10:42:45,stocks,How can you see what it is?
2021-04-14 07:44:02,stocks,"At what price?

How come you changed your mind? I can see some quick profit buying the dip, it's likely to bounce back if this Crypto surge continues."
2021-04-14 07:35:51,stocks,You're not a believer in crypto then?
2021-04-14 09:22:43,stocks,"It's 2:22pm in the UK right now, lol.

I will presume you meant Eastern time."
2021-04-14 09:47:41,stocks,Try 600
2021-04-14 11:48:13,stocks,"+1


But i'd estimate its going to be closer to 10% when including dividends."
2021-04-14 11:39:45,stocks,Ah I never thought like that. I would assume all customers are rationale and pick the lowest fees.
2021-04-14 12:56:50,stocks,Avenger's Campus (which is a land inside of California Adventure at the Disneyland Resort) - not a new theme park.

2021-04-14 14:14:31,stocks,I bought a total of $606.47 and sold for $617.85. Right before it started to crash.
2021-04-14 13:57:39,stocks,lol. celebrated too fast.
2021-04-14 13:57:53,stocks,Was just sitting here contemplating the statement “I wish I had bought more”. Because now given the opportunity I’m like nah I’m good.
2021-04-14 14:01:56,stocks,Good news is my sQQQ just went 📈📈📈
2021-04-14 14:16:22,stocks,okay then.
2021-04-14 14:50:38,stocks,"Yea, what I might do is but in to TSM at the current price of 121, see how the stock goes with the earnings report and make decision on if I'll hold or dump then."
2021-04-14 15:00:06,stocks,"Definitely feel like an ETF is the right answer for chips, the winner changes every week"
2021-04-14 19:10:44,stocks,"I share the same sentiment. You'd think beating earnings would drive the stock price up, but I've been noticing the opposite. Do you think it's smart to hold off on TSM/SMH until after earnings?"
2021-04-14 15:13:36,stocks,"I agree with you, I was gambling because my plan was to enter at the initial pump & dump and sell at the first sight of the dump just to make a quick buck. But I got lazy and bought in too late, then it dropped very quickly and I just had to sell."
2021-04-14 15:31:16,stocks,It's a great company with a ton of exposure in fintech. IMO it'll get there over the summer
2021-04-14 15:41:43,stocks,I'd be weary it might drop a bit more because of coinbase chaos fucking with fintech. I love the company though so I've bought multiple times today
2021-04-14 15:40:33,stocks,On individual stocks not just SPY and VTI. Many have not
2021-04-14 12:51:38,stocks,Why does having a shit box car and a smart phone exempt you from poverty ?
2021-04-14 07:54:07,stocks,So is Ethereum and that’s not stopping people in any way
2021-04-14 07:01:54,stocks,I love how salty people downvote this. Haha. If people wanna make their money in crypto then so be it. Tbh I’m fascinated watching from the sidelines. People are becoming millionaires overnight. Dogecoin (which was created originally years ago as a joke) has gone 50x in the last 3 months.
2021-04-14 15:53:46,stocks,-7% down after 2 months of struggling on several catalysts on demo day is not normal retracement. just lol.
2021-04-14 09:33:55,stocks,big rip
2021-04-14 09:37:04,stocks,Im gonna see what it actually opens at then go from there
2021-04-14 10:02:01,stocks,Well shit I don't have that much money haha.  Thanks for this.
2021-04-14 10:54:58,stocks,This is not correct. You cannot solve for X. His cost basis will never be 7. You could buy an infinite number of shares and it will still be above 7.
2021-04-14 10:31:13,stocks,They just have just added after I posted. I see it now too. Thanks!
2021-04-14 15:44:21,stocks,RemindMe! 2 weeks
2021-04-14 16:20:52,stocks,270’s
2021-04-14 17:42:51,stocks,Thanks for the reassurance and as far as I know nothing about has fundamentally changed.
2021-04-14 11:32:20,stocks,Someone said that once about blockbuster.
2021-04-14 13:17:41,stocks,The same I'm only going to buy three
2021-04-14 15:38:19,stocks,I’m not talking about the indexes
2021-04-14 10:06:09,stocks,Its largest holding is Intel which tanked on Nvidia news. SOXL is most influenced by INTC
2021-04-14 13:49:45,stocks,Sold at 420 but sure
2021-04-14 10:27:39,stocks,That's my point though. The current climb isn't sustainable.
2021-04-14 11:41:01,stocks,It just hurts being down 20%
2021-04-14 15:35:00,stocks,"People need to realize that buying crypto should be like burying your money in a coffee can in the backyard. It's gone, forget about it, check back in the distant future or a rainy day."
2021-04-14 09:37:42,stocks,"GS is up for now, could change fast though."
2021-04-14 10:45:10,stocks,Barely. I might should’ve waited on WFC but they’re not going much higher than they are right now. Already priced in beating on earnings.
2021-04-14 09:53:44,stocks,"The platform they have created is pure genius in my opinion. Restaurants can use it to manage all their delivery providers in one place so all orders end up on the same platform, whether its ordered through UberEats, Doordash, the restaurant itself, delivery or collection. They can then get detailed statistics on how each is performing etc... Probably didn't explain that well at all but would recommend listening to ChitChatMoney podcast about it"
2021-04-14 09:57:30,stocks,"1.5% now. For an index, that's insane, is it not?"
2021-04-14 09:54:19,stocks,"Got it. So I'll likely wait for a dip.. If it happens lol. But let's say I'm bullish on Coin to be 700+ by end of week.. What would be the order I'd place to get in early as possible, and I guess just miss out on the opening price."
2021-04-14 09:54:22,stocks,"With bitcoin selling so high right now, I expect shares to mirror that."
2021-04-14 10:03:21,stocks,Does anyone know when it actually starts trading? I still can't see it at any price. Market's been open for 30 minutes now.
2021-04-14 09:58:44,stocks,Yeah sigh
2021-04-14 10:06:55,stocks,"Intel is like in 7 days, and its down lol"
2021-04-14 11:03:48,stocks,"Can you explain your reasoning? From my perspective an electric Mustang, F series, and Transit vans have much stronger brand pull and sales prospects than the Bolt (mediocre sales even when discounted to ~$20k) and Hummer (always niche and more expensive than ever)."
2021-04-14 10:40:11,stocks,"i was thinking of moving out of ford and into GM - i have small amount in GM started this month and its up ~3%

where as my ford holdings the most they go up is .5%"
2021-04-14 15:32:24,stocks,"I like the company but my cost basis means I can walk away with a nice profit anytime. I could make it $14 and double my investment. Really trying to find reasons not to do this and its difficult. 

I don't see F going above $14 this year with chip shortage impacting revenue etc."
2021-04-14 17:51:18,stocks,"It's a small position, only 134 shares. If I'd known how much the stock would ride I'd have put down far more."
2021-04-14 11:48:51,stocks,They said the same for TSLA. And yet here we are. COIN will be a trillion dollar company.
2021-04-14 11:59:23,stocks,I just wish that Binance had Coinbase's UI for their Android app.
2021-04-14 12:04:21,stocks,[deleted]
2021-04-14 12:07:45,stocks,Nerf guns as well 🤣
2021-04-14 12:03:51,stocks,"Chauvin is going to be not guilty, prosecution did a horrible job"
2021-04-14 15:23:57,stocks,"Nope. It's ok, though, because like all risky buys, I only bought it with money I had to lose. Maybe this will bounce back, or maybe I'll give up and sell it at a small loss. I'm not too upset. This game isn't for anyone who can't stand an occasional miss."
2021-04-14 10:35:54,stocks,This
2021-04-14 10:05:21,stocks,I already sold 2 of them though.
2021-04-14 11:42:13,stocks,"I already own crypto, and my intention for today is to buy at open and dump for a profit. I’m a new trader so just testing the waters and learning a bit. Gonna get away from RH soon and into a better platform and set up a more stable profile too."
2021-04-14 15:32:35,stocks,"I’m not saying I do. And I’m aware of that, but there are big rally days that end up giving you a big portion of those year over year gains. So if I decided to have DIA now (even though it’s corrected now) I would have missed one of the larger rally days. Over enough time it doesn’t matter much at all, I’m just bored enough to watch and stress myself out by comparing what could be. My portfolio is just VOO QQQ and VIG, every day ends up being an incredibly small Green Line lol"
2021-04-14 11:03:45,stocks,Jesus.
2021-04-14 14:09:39,stocks,People’s neighbors were saying that to people’s wives when it hit $20k in 2017 too. 🤷🏻‍♀️
2021-04-14 07:24:33,stocks,"Every single January first, bitcoin has been worth substantially more than the past year. It's designed to beat inflation, and while I don't consider it primarily as a currency, unlike gold people will actually buy things with bitcoin. You should probably read investor advice on bitcoin instead of just going along with what sounds good to you. I wouldn't bet a cent on gold beating inflation compared to bitcoin."
2021-04-14 07:41:09,stocks,"The theory is that since the supply of BTC is known and capped, central banks can't simply print more of it.  Printing more causes inflation.  BTC is inherently deflationary, actually, because some BTC will be lost over time.

It makes sense, but almost all of the value in BTC is because people *say* it has value.  Sure, it has utility simply because it can't be tampered with by central banks, and because you can make transactions off the grid.  But you could do the same with any crypto currency, and some are even better at it, arguably.

People say BTC has value today, tomorrow they might decide that it doesn't.  That's the danger.

In order for us to test our hypothesis that BTC actually works as a hedge against inflation, we'd need to wait several years or even a couple of decades.  We don't know right now, and all we can gather is that it's as good as Tesla stock in that regard.  Ie, anything that goes up in value is obviously good against inflation.  That doesn't mean that Tesla's place in a portfolio is as an inflation hedge."
2021-04-14 11:20:26,stocks,"No, it is most likely related to the big IPO because this is not a new story here.

I saw this with Snowflake, and I saw this with DoorDash and it became VERY noteworthy in the case of the latter. 

The Nasdaq had been in a very strong uptrend and it ****ing dumped on the day DoorDash debuted.

There isn't **** that we can do about it."
2021-04-14 11:19:15,stocks,"With a DPO, are they able to just decide the time it's listed? With IPO's they have to list at 9:30 am (EST) correct?"
2021-04-14 10:57:22,stocks,"If you were to see what was seen with the debut by Dash to an extent, COIN being put out there is not going to do what you think it will."
2021-04-14 08:09:30,stocks,"They are running 35% capacity but it still felt busy. Lines were like 30-45 min at most. Kinda hard to imagine how they ever ran full capacity honestly. 

They were psycho about masks even on the little kids. Was actually super annoying. 

Still was fun tho."
2021-04-14 13:57:42,stocks,"I opened the link and then closed it when I saw his face and motorcycle jacket.  

This company has no moat."
2021-04-14 14:12:05,stocks,The absolute state of DDs.

They've been leaking since then but finally are seeing some movement"
2021-04-14 10:06:56,stocks,"I got a bunch of Unilever when it dropped to £38. Dipped further to 37.33, since then gradual rise. Impressive for a slow moving dividend stock."

2021-04-14 16:21:08,stocks,"> his demise is priced in already

Wow"
2021-04-14 09:15:48,stocks,"Thanks for the insight! Will definitely take a deeper look at WFC.

And like you said, JPM is just an all-star so i figure you can never go wrong there."
2021-04-14 10:07:58,stocks,"If you are long, it’s a good price. Short term I’ll be in under $80"
2021-04-14 10:13:48,stocks,"Wdym? I'm saying it's already up 34% and he's talking about ""the real breakout"", just saying to have realistic expectations. I'm also in PINS FYI"
2021-04-14 12:09:21,stocks,"Fair, I've seen this stock before but I don't know much about it. I tend to avoid low float stocks myself as they are very volatile."
2021-04-14 15:02:29,stocks,Trade just executed lol
2021-04-14 14:59:35,stocks,Sure!
2021-04-14 08:34:59,stocks,What could possibly go wrong?
2021-04-14 08:03:13,stocks,Yep
2021-04-14 08:36:10,stocks,Which is hilarious because that will never happen.
2021-04-14 07:58:02,stocks,"Yeah but they hold $19 billion total in cash and cash equivalents.  Only $1.5 billion of that is in Bitcoin.  That's nothing.

It's irrational behavior on the part of investors and makes me very skeptical."
2021-04-14 07:52:28,stocks,That's how I'm reading it unless someone has a better plausible explanation.

2021-04-14 07:46:29,stocks,CNBC said it'll start at $250 today. At that price I feel better just putting more money into ETH. I've become a believer in Ethereum over the past few months.
2021-04-14 07:41:25,stocks,No.
2021-04-14 09:23:41,stocks,lmao yes I might need another coffee lol

2021-04-14 11:41:56,stocks,"Can you onboard fiat to crypto on Binance?  It couldn't when I was on there a couple years ago.  Had to buy on Coinbase, then send Btc to Binance to trade altcoins.  That's why I use CB and pay CB fees."
2021-04-14 12:57:44,stocks,My bad- thats what I meant.
2021-04-14 12:56:53,stocks,thats good. consider some SCHD. good dividend and has growth too.
2021-04-14 19:16:18,stocks,Good man
2021-04-14 15:04:28,stocks,Do you know an ETF focused on chips?
2021-04-14 15:46:50,stocks,I see that it’s been dipping down to around 200 for the last few months. I’ll keep my eye on it. Is it worth holding both SQ and PYPL?
2021-04-14 13:10:50,stocks,Having a car and access to the internet is living like a king in a lot of countries
2021-04-14 13:31:50,stocks,Also you somehow had enough money to buy food im assuming since you didn’t starve to death but also had money to spend on investments that bought you a house??? That sounds pretty middle class to me. Fuck outta here you dont know shit about poverty.
2021-04-14 08:01:02,stocks,"Well, I hope they're right because I dont want to see anyone lose their money. It may quadruple in price in the next 5 years or it make be worth as much as doge is currently. Too much volatility and not enough logical sense for my taste.

I say we all buy chuckecheese coins and make that the new global currency, it's about the same amount of logic."
2021-04-14 07:08:33,stocks,"Oh yeah agree people can do what they want with their money, also not touching it but shit, if the markets were to crash this year it'd be because of new crypto millionaires or some shit"
2021-04-14 07:17:40,stocks,"Because nothing substantial is being said. That post is no more credible than mine, where I tell you that I wouldn't touch doge, but bitcoin is not going anywhere.

Actually my post is is more credible because it's backed by top of the line companies and investors, with American traditional financial institutions now working their way in. Bitcoin is and will continue to be a better investment than bonds."
2021-04-14 17:31:50,stocks,"If you look at the 4h chart, a green day tomorrow put it in a clear uptrend. Even a minor negative day would keep it above the previous recent low of $23.07 and $22.91, maintaining an uptrend.

I don't expect Demo Day to be a catalyst.  Partnerships and ERs will be catalysts.  I'm not in this stock to flip it after a couple weeks or months."
2021-04-14 10:06:41,stocks,"Chances are itll open and spike up very high like most IPOs do, then in a few days probably go down, but then again there has never been an IPO like this before, so like who knows"
2021-04-14 11:01:57,stocks,"Yeah that's why it came to 7.375 and not 7. OP asked for a formula, and used $7 as his example, so that's what I used"

2021-04-14 11:50:05,stocks,Amazon is not blockbuster lmao
2021-04-14 15:41:34,stocks,Could you elaborate?
2021-04-14 10:07:26,stocks,Yeah I meant what happened to INTC but yeah the Nvidia news. Then again if it's just the NVDA news it should be a short term drop.
2021-04-14 13:55:17,stocks,Lmao ok nice 60 bucks
2021-04-14 10:36:05,stocks,I was looking at it yesterday and saw that it's pulled in 5% in the past month. Had to do a double take.
2021-04-14 10:50:43,stocks,"I disagree. But if you believe your money is better elsewhere then go for it.

With rising inflation on the horizon, banks will do well. They have underperformed for years, and even with the recent runup have a lot of room to run. They have tons of cash, so dividends and buybacks are gonna continue to grow."
2021-04-14 09:58:52,stocks,It is. But sounds about right for the markets at the moment. Insane.
2021-04-14 09:55:06,stocks,Whenever your brokerage let's you. I'd wait a couple weeks tho dude
2021-04-14 10:04:03,stocks,It wont be until this afternoon at least
2021-04-14 10:07:33,stocks,It's down because of recent Nvidia news
2021-04-14 10:59:12,stocks,Wait longer than a month. I'm long 3500 F.
2021-04-14 11:06:23,stocks,I think it could be a decent idea to increase your holdings in it but I’d only buy it if it’s below 60
2021-04-14 18:48:24,stocks,The premiums don’t seem worth it to only sell 1 contract per week. How long are you? Would you mind giving up the shares if it pops off?
2021-04-14 11:50:44,stocks,"Tesla isnt a 1t company either.

But most importantly didnt gain 800bn in a month. Wake up"
2021-04-14 12:07:22,stocks,"Don’t be a scumbag. Do things that help the world, not hurt it."
2021-04-14 12:13:17,stocks,ye but those are the winter play
2021-04-14 10:11:56,stocks,Third time's a charm
2021-04-14 07:33:14,stocks,"Check this out:

https://moneyandmarkets.com/gold-inflation-hedge/

Gold went through a long bear market but the price of gold matched the CPI  exactly after 40 years, starting in 1980.  

BTC going up substantially every year does not mean it's an inflation hedge, any more than MSFT is an inflation hedge.  You could argue it's a good investment.  Fine.  But inflation hedges are *hedges*, they're not designed to make you rich. They're designed to protect you against inflation.

The problem I see is that BTC fiends are calling it an inflation hedge, but at the same time it's not acting that way at all.  It's acting very differently.  If the true value of BTC were to hedge against inflation, it should not have gone up 800% in 52 weeks, when the CPI was mostly below 2%.  

So if the true value isn't coming from its supposed properties as an inflation hedge, where is it coming from?  And is that source of value something you're willing to bet on?

For me, at the moment, no."
2021-04-14 07:48:17,stocks,"Thank you for that explanation. That helped. I reread your paragraph twice, and found that you could replace BTC with gold and the meaning essentially stays the same. Just an interesting anecdote"
2021-04-14 08:12:05,stocks,"Can you clarify something for someone who does not know much/anything about crypto. You say the amount of BTC is capped but isn't that incorrect? Because you can buy .0000001 of a BTC right? And you can buy .00000000000001 so, in theory, doesn't that make the amount of it uncapped?"
2021-04-14 11:27:34,stocks," I didn't remember the market dropping when Doordash was listed, but I just looked at some charts and it looks like you are right"
2021-04-14 11:23:10,stocks,"No, it's the same story with both cases. They debut at who knows when and in the case of DoorDash, the market steadily worsened for the entire day, with the Nasdaq getting dumped hard on that day."
2021-04-14 09:59:33,stocks,"Disney World at full capacity is absurd, but well managed. Lines can take two hours, but if you're smart with their easy pass system, you'll get a lot out of the day without being stuck in those horrid lines. It's impressive, but it still sucks to feel like you're crammed basically everywhere. 35% sounds like heaven."
2021-04-14 13:07:53,stocks,"Ah, okay, I thought maybe I was missing something here! Thanks for the info"
2021-04-14 15:21:32,stocks,"$WFC up over 5% today.  Goldman Sachs, JPM, and WFC all reported great numbers.  Another stock to benefit from banking industry is Diebold ($DBD).  A turnaround story with improving earnings and entrance into new technologies (tabletop kiosks in restaurants)."
2021-04-14 12:15:41,stocks,"All my other money in my brokerage is in VOO, AAPL, MSFT, WMT, WM, and CRSR. I’m still doing well, I just picked MWK as my speculative “play” and don’t have that much into it. It just isn’t fun to see such a large drop. I have definitely learned a lot about low float stocks."
2021-04-14 15:07:01,stocks,Same here! 🍻
2021-04-14 15:16:26,stocks,"Ok, here you go."
2021-04-14 08:39:43,stocks,Crypto holders could come to their senses? Haha just kidding bitcoin 120k next year.
2021-04-14 08:37:24,stocks,Never bet against a cult. I can see tesla going over 1k by EOY.
2021-04-14 08:38:44,stocks,"It's exaggerated for sure, but that's how things are right now

Plus tech/ev looking green again further adds to it"
2021-04-14 08:11:49,stocks,When a stock moves without some crazy news known to public there is news in the background that we haven't heard of yet. I've seen tiny bars with massive volume on TSLA's chart recently and that tells you one thing - insiders know something.
2021-04-14 08:24:39,stocks,We will never see 250 it will open at 500 or more imo.
2021-04-14 07:50:28,stocks,Why?
2021-04-14 11:04:16,stocks,The estimate they've given here would be 6pm UK time.
2021-04-14 09:49:55,stocks,Dude its going to go through the roof
2021-04-14 13:05:56,stocks,No worries.  I was just being my same smart-ass self.
2021-04-14 14:08:55,stocks,I bought schd a bit ago and I’m happy with it. Better than betting on anything ARK at this point.
2021-04-14 15:07:19,stocks,"SMH, SOXX, or if you are bullish SOXL is a 3x leveraged ETF.  Just google each of them to see what % their holdings are and decide which one you like best"
2021-04-14 15:07:50,stocks,">e price. Cause, lately even if earnings were good (AMZ, A

SOXX"
2021-04-14 16:11:37,stocks,I so regret not buying that 200 dip...
2021-04-14 07:23:31,stocks,"I’m not commenting on fundamentals, I even highlighted doge was created initially as a joke. The creator sold out almost immediately to buy a used car. The absurdity of it all is hilarious. Can you imagine making 50x your investment in just 3 months? It’s just fascinating to observe from the bleachers. I do find it funny the tribalism from Stockmarket investors who get small poppy syndrome over others successes."
2021-04-14 10:33:00,stocks,What did you put in at? 350?
2021-04-14 11:51:44,stocks,Absolutely. I'm just not sure your logic is strong.
2021-04-14 15:55:50,stocks,I’m in growth stocks so I’m aware that there will be rough periods. But every day is the same at the moment. My stocks usually opens at a good level and then slowly loses all gains during the day. It would be nice if they just had a bit of resistance
2021-04-14 15:54:48,stocks,The more speculative holdings haven't been doing too well for the last 2 months. Index are getting carried by SP500.
2021-04-14 10:09:59,stocks,"Intel kinda sucks, their share price is only up 11 dollars from 3 years ago. It was also this price in the year 2000 during the dot com bubble. I dont have any real faith in Intel matching their competitors growth anytime soon"
2021-04-14 10:51:19,stocks,"Yeah, I don't see a reason to invest in anything else right now while it's on this run."
2021-04-14 10:54:20,stocks,"I was only holding two, and I think the street overshot on the bank stocks. WFC is up 4% and I should’ve waited. That’s on me. But JPM has traded sideways for weeks and dropped on exceptional earnings which tells me a lot."
2021-04-14 10:08:31,stocks,"And laptops sold a shit ton, intel owns that market."
2021-04-14 11:04:23,stocks,"true - i intend to

just feel a month of 3% is worth more than a lot longer of .5 up then .5 down on repeat haha"
2021-04-14 11:11:33,stocks,"When the electric F150 comes out later this fall I think the stock will rise nicely. The chip shortage is affecting all automakers and their incomes too, I can see F hitting $14 later this year."
2021-04-14 18:57:32,stocks,It's a small amount I agree. I'm completely comfortable if I lose it at this price point.
2021-04-14 12:17:57,stocks,true true
2021-04-14 07:43:24,stocks,"The crazy thing is all these people ""buying"" BTC on brokerage apps dont actually own any crypto."
2021-04-14 07:51:03,stocks,"Sure!

Not exactly, though.  Gold is used in the manufacturing of mobile phones as well in things like golden teeth.  It's used in jewelry, too, although jewelry pretty much has value because it looks pretty and we say it has value, true.  But we do use it to make things.  BTC isn't used to make anything.

Gold also has been used as money for millennia, and all of the worlds central banks are literally holding tons of it.  This is a case of ""people say it has value"", true.  But it's more time-tested than BTC which has only been around for about 10 years.  

If BTC proves itself in the next few years or decades it could take on a similar role.  Right now, however, it's still acting very volatile and we don't have any proof of its long term viability."
2021-04-14 08:25:59,stocks,"It's still capped.  Think of it like dividing into $1 into 100 cents.  The part we're splitting is still the same whole: $1.  Even if we made microcents it'd still be the same thing.

The capping thing runs into trouble when you consider that there are OTHER cryptos.  Yeah, BTC is capped but there's also Ethereum, etc. meaning the cypto world itself is not capped."
2021-04-14 11:26:44,stocks,"Thanks for clearing that up. Looks like COIN will be $450-$500 when it does list. At $250 I'm OK, but $500 is too risky this early on."
2021-04-14 15:46:11,stocks,Damn nice call on WFC! Definitely think we’re set for a big year from banks. Not at all familiar with DBD so ill be researching them after work. Much appreciated
2021-04-14 12:35:55,stocks,"Yeah I think we all get burnt now and then on bad bets, not to say that MWK won't go back soon.

 The more I look at MSFT chart over time, the more I reckon its the best company in the world."
2021-04-14 08:40:24,stocks,The stock price sure lol But they will never deliver on the fundamentals or valuations in a million years.
2021-04-14 08:23:21,stocks,BTC has gone up 7% in the last two days.  Tesla 11-12%.  Call me crazy but I think it's related.  Might not be insiders.  Could be a pump and dump.  Let's see.
2021-04-14 07:52:38,stocks,"Check out my comment history, I've made a few comments in this thread."
2021-04-14 19:11:53,stocks,"is QQQ a sound etf to have? 

May just start buying a mix of msft and apple"
2021-04-14 10:34:00,stocks,I put at 250 this morning I’ll probably change it once i see how its doing
2021-04-14 12:03:19,stocks,"You don't need much logic to know that Amazon is an absolute behemoth and is not going away for the foreseeable future. They're still aggressively expanding and even at a 1.7T market cap they're considered a ""value"" stock. They're the literal boogeyman for any sector they push into (e.g. GoodRX)."
2021-04-14 15:59:44,stocks,If you have long term growth stocks why are you even bothering to check day to day. You should expect volatility for years....
2021-04-14 10:12:33,stocks,"Defo not anytime soon, if anything they're at their worst atm. But with the new CEO and the absolute scale of the company I reckon it will eventually go up. Then again, there might be better opportunities elsewhere until INTC get back to that position, if it gets back to that position."
2021-04-14 10:58:44,stocks,"Sounds like you're trading them and not investing. 


Personally I'm long financials to balance out the tech side of my portfolio. Sideways trading for a few weeks is normal, as is selling on a great earnings report. Doesn't move the needle for me with a long term outlook."
2021-04-14 17:33:43,stocks,There are a number of reasons to be bullish on Ford.
2021-04-14 07:44:57,stocks,Could you elaborate or hit me with a link?  I'm not totally in the loop about this.
2021-04-14 08:41:28,stocks,"I never expected them to sell a single car, they keep surprising me who knows. I own them by owning the nasdaq i suppose. I remain sceptical but its not outside of the realm of possibilities."
2021-04-14 11:30:25,stocks,Maybe so!
2021-04-14 07:58:56,stocks,I read a few of your comments and it just confused me really. Are you against crypto generally or just BTC? In a comment a while back you said FOMO is hitting you hard and ‘couldn’t hurt to have a little exposure’ to it. Why expose yourself to something you don’t believe in?
2021-04-14 19:24:13,stocks,"I see it mentioned here quite often, but I'm in VOO."
2021-04-14 12:06:20,stocks,"Any update? Had mine set at 250 and updated to 280. If it hits 500, I might leave it."
2021-04-14 07:50:30,stocks,"So places like coin base let you ""own"" it but they still hold it for you. Robinhood is basically trading the price, not possible to access any actual crypto.

You dont really own any crypto until you transfer it to a hard wallet and have it disconnected from the internet"
2021-04-14 08:46:21,stocks,"I know, eventually it will all end. Company that’s fraudulent with a psychopath at the helm eventually comes crashing down. Good luck though."
2021-04-14 08:04:55,stocks,"I'm against crypto generally speaking as I don't think it's been properly tested and I'm skeptical about its long-term value.  However, I could be proven wrong, and long-term it may act in a similar way as gold and precious metals/commodities have in the past.  

We're simply not sure if it's the future or not.  Buying Bitcoin or crypto is still a gamble at this point. 

The main problem I have with it at present it that it seems to be riding a highly speculative bubble.  Now is a horrible time to buy, IMO, although I may be wrong and people might continue to profit for months and years.  Or not.  A lot of people could be left holding very big bags.  It's not a risk I'm willing to take right now, because that's not how I invest.  That stuff is for /r/wallstreetbets.

If in the end it does prove to have long-term value, then as I said in one of my comments, the price won't really matter.  I can get in later. Assets that have long-term value are generally stable, otherwise they wouldn't really have long-term value.  BTC is not stable right now and won't be until its long-term value is established, if that day ever comes.

Hope that makes sense."
2021-04-14 07:53:01,stocks,"Well that's dumb.  Hopefully people who buy BTC actually do so in a way that allows them to hold it.

Thanks for explaining."
2021-04-14 09:53:51,stocks,"crypto has outperformed every single stock in the stock market. Crypto is the future in terms of how companies can utilize efficiency in their structure of business. You’re old school money/boomer if you think crypto isn’t going anywhere or it’s just gonna crash. it’s literally backed by some of the biggest whales. It’s too big to fail now, I think you’re comparing crypto to it’s early stages of 2010. 

Btw it crashed in 2017 harder than any stock market crashed, yet it rallied on some of the most insane bull runs I’ve seen."

2021-04-14 13:04:35,stocks,Not so sure about DELL. Just because their PE is lower doesnt make them a better investment. I believe they have a significantly lower PE than their tech peers because their business isnt as strong and people just dont want that stock as much. A low PE doesnt mean people are going to suddenly start buying it unless they plan to really transform their business in a way that could drastically improve profits.

I think it's a deep value stock at this prices with such good cash flow It's a SAAS company that provides shipping related services to businesses. Although it faced a bump in 2018-2019 for dropping their contract with USPS, management's decision to withdraw has proven to be the right decision all along.

They had a CAGR of 30% for the last 5 years. About 1% debt and a huge cash reserve.

Will grow *at least* 10-15% for the next 5 years and they have a net income margin of around 24%(yes, that's right!) and a gross margin of close to 80%. They also generate a lot of FCF.

Their subscriber numbers are growing (Covid boosted the growth) and churn is low as small businesses save a lot of money using their software.

Their cash reserve seems to suggest that they are gonna buy out some competition or related company. Which could also lead to more revenue growth (granted that would be inorganic growth).

CEO has almost 90% approval in Glassdoor and the employees seem to feel like a family working there.

And for me, I think the multiples are too low for such a good stock. Trailing P/E of only 22.16. Trailing P/S of around 5.

They are also expanding internationally, especially in Europe, which if they are successful, would prove to be an explosive driver of growth.

Plus, management is quite conservative in financing, always keeping leverage low."

I’m thinking of selling some of my small share positions (VOO, IVV, QQQ) to get the cash to purchase a deep deep ITM QQQ call for as far out as available (dec 2023). Then sell some pretty far OTM weekly calls just to collect small premiums with the intent to exercise at the 2023 expiration if I can’t sell. 

Bad idea for a first LEAPS play? To this point I’ve only played with some CSPs and covered calls.

Very nervous as this would be the largest single transaction I’ve made with my relatively small (90k) portfolio.

What happens if you sell a call and it gets exercised? Do you just exercise your LEAP early and then give those shares?"
2021-04-14 01:06:46,stocks,I wouldn’t say that’s a bad idea. Just go for a strike that has some volume. Don’t want to buy and have a hard time finding a seller. I have 30% of my portfolio as leaps and selling cc against them. Easier than taking too much of my own capital.
2021-04-14 00:56:54,stocks,Is the capital requirement much lower on the LEAP than the 100 shares?
2021-04-14 02:12:13,stocks,"The deep ITM LEAP gets exercised to cover the call, but usually you avoid this by closing the position early or simply avoiding dividend season for your stock. Generally with PMCC you pick OTM options that are short dated and don't have a high chance of ever being itm."
2021-04-14 01:57:27,stocks,Do leaps count for covering calls like owning shares? (Can you write calls against leaps in a non margin account?)
2021-04-14 01:01:07,stocks,50-60% less capital required to purchase the call
2021-04-14 07:10:23,stocks,"Either this, or you keep rolling out and up. I haven't tried it on something with low volatility, like the QQQ, but I'd imagine you could keep rolling up and out, until it closes OTM. Alternatively, you can buy back the call close to close to stop yourself from being exercised."
2021-04-14 06:54:29,stocks,No. The LEAPS usually doesn't get exercised because you will losing its time value. Just take the loss and keep the LEAPS or sell the LEAPS.
2021-04-14 08:42:28,stocks,Yeah you covered call just has to be above your leap strike. Like for instance I have a DKNG $50 1/20/23 leap but I’m selling a $62 4/23/21 call against it.

2021-04-14 11:02:56,stocks,"I just tried this and both E*trade and ameritrade aren't allowing it at level 2..  reading through all the literature / agreements they have when you apply to upgrade it looks like it won't actually count as using margin though as long as the long leaps have higher premiums than the short term options, which should always be the case when the leaps have lower strikes like you said."
2021-04-14 08:28:06,stocks,The margin part. Things go wrong and you could be in debt rather than just have worthless options.
2021-04-14 10:08:53,stocks,"On the other hand, things would have to go VERY WRONG for QQQ to take a 50% hit out of nowhere. Depends how expensive your margin is, but if it's something like RH's 2.5%, the cost of margin is gonna be a hell of a lot cheaper than the extrinsic on the call.

But if his margin is already maxed then sure, leaps will be fine, but he'll pay a lot of extrinsic and regardless of how he covers the calls he needs to be careful about getting assigned."
2021-04-14 00:00:00,stocks,"Covered calls question Selling calls question

Covered calls Question

My position: I sold 4/16 25.5 CC for a stock last week for $20, now it spiked up $77. It shows I'm -$57 on the option and my portfolio deducted $57 from total balance. If it hits 25.5 by friday and the call gets exercised will that 57 return to my account plus 20 premium or? I understand selling calls I just don't quite understand how it can deduct an amount from the account. If anyone can explain that'd be amazing. Thank you in advance!"
2021-04-14 00:30:46,stocks,It just means the option is worth $57 more now. Meaning if you wanted to get out of the option it would cost you $57 more than what you got paid in premium.
2021-04-14 02:21:20,stocks,It's a dumb thing brokers do. I'm not sure why but I assume they have their reasons. You haven't lost anything. If the stock price goes up and you had sold CCs the worst possible scenario is you end up forced to sell those shares at the strike which would still give you a profit + the premium you got for writing the option. You'd just make slightly less than if you had just held and sold the shares at whatever price it went up to.
2021-04-14 00:41:02,stocks,"You should head over to r/options

Also... If you wrote a covered call, it means you have 100 shares of the underlying 

When you sold the call, you received cash equal to the premium you sold it at, it'll show up as your ""cost basis""

When it gets exercised, you'll lose your 100 shares and receive 25.5 per share or $2,550 dollars in your account + the original premium."
2021-04-14 12:46:54,stocks,"All they are showing you is the current value of the option in comparison to what you sold for. You sold a covered call at $0.20, it is now worth $0.77. IF you were to close out your own option, ie, buy your own contract back, you'd lose $57. 

In the meantime, all it is is entirely paper accounting. if you get your shares called away, you will not have really lost $57. you will of received your $20 in premium plus whatever your shares are worth and that is your realized gain or loss. 

All this reporting is doing it more or less telling you what you COULD of had, relative to current option values. 

I currently have 3 stocks I have sold calls on, two are ""green"" for me, as in the option value decreases and 1 is red for me, the option value increased. I don't pay attention as the premium amount is already in the bank, so to speak."
2021-04-14 00:40:56,stocks,But if I don't do anything I will get that 57 back after the option expires? I kinda understand but seeing negative on portfolio is kinda confusuing
2021-04-14 02:37:16,stocks,"I agree It's very confusing from their end to deduct the amount from account balance when selling cc. But on the opposite side I think they do that to give you the exact balance in case you want to buy back the calls, your balance wouldn't change since the negative amount already applied to the account balance, I think that could be their reason but for people who don't want to buy back the calls, It's super confusing."
2021-04-14 03:52:37,stocks,"It's like having a liability in your balance sheet. If you wanted to close out of that position, you have this liability you have to deal with. That's why it stays there as a negative value.

I get what you mean, but it's not really a dumb thing. It's a checks and balance thing in accounting."
2021-04-14 00:47:52,stocks,"Thanks for your reply, I did head over to r/Options but this post wasn't qualified. 
 I understand your answer, but on the -57 on my account balance, will it get canceled out when the option expires?"
2021-04-14 01:05:39,stocks,Ignore the negative number...it means nothing..when the option expires that will fix your portfolio balance. You didn’t lose anything
2021-04-14 00:51:21,stocks,"It's just a ""paper loss"" if you're planning to hold the option to expiration

When / if the option expires it'll be removed from your account.  If the option is exercised itll still be removed from your account. The only difference is that is if your shares get sold or not"

2021-04-14 00:00:00,stocks,"Is it wrong for me to feel wary of the future stock market and economy? Just to clear things first, I am a young investor who just got serious about investing after the whole downturn on March of last year. Things that I admit 1) I still lack knowledge and experience compared to the veterans in this subreddit (that's why I am asking you guys) 2) I am a pessimist. So the question I have might be a trivial or somewhat of an annoying one but I just wanted a serious, impartial discussion about the future market. Now I understand that nobody will be able foresee the future but I feel like the current zeitgeist of ""put all your money into stocks/crypto and you will become rich easily!"" seems dangerous. I mean the market is doing pretty amazing right now. Crypto (I know some people will hate that I mention this but since coinbase IPO is happening tomorrow, I will include it) is just breaking records pretty much everyday and more much is being poured into the market everyday. Stock prices seem absurdly high but people are still putting their money into it. Although, the economy seems bad, the stock market is doing amazing. Now, this might be a good news to someone of you guys who is probably making a killing right now but is it wrong to be scared of the bubble bursting in the future?  When The Fed printer is going brrrr, the stock prices are going up and up more than what the company is actually worth, eventually wouldn't there be a point when people are just like ""well that's just too much""? Will this actually happen or am I just naive in assuming people won't pay overpriced equity or crypto? How can an average person protect themselves from this possible crash?

If what you'd do doesn't change much then worrying about it won't help anything. If you do want to do something then throw money in VXUS to get international exposure, but I don't know how much that shields you from a future U.S. market crash (business-wise we're kind of a big deal) and international equities have been underperforming for quite awhile now."

Gonna be wild. The fed has no incentive to stop printing money. The well to do have no reason to stop putting money in the market, which means the wealth gap will only increase exponentially.

2021-04-14 01:54:01,stocks,"For there to be a crash we would need another black swan event, it would cause massive deleveraging like what happened with Archegos.  The more likely scenario is that we see a bear/stagnant market for the next 6-12 months as inflation fears get resolved one way or the other and interest rates stabilize at some level. If you are really looking to protect from a crash, an even split between QQQ/GLD/TLT and cash would hold up well, except for the fact that this combo won’t perform well in a rising rate environment like the one we’re currently in.

If you google “sector rotation”, you’ll see that the stock market actually starts to retreat when the economy really starts recovering. So if the market is topping out, I think holding value/dividend stocks in energy/staples/healthcare sectors might be the way to go. Either way, use the RSI on the weekly/monthly charts to figure out good entry and exit positions."

2021-04-14 00:00:00,stocks,"Analysis - Duckhorn Portfolio $NAPA I can't stress this enough. The numbers look out of the ordinary. 

Just looking at the recent IPO's, I came across $NAPA. A producer of luxury wines in North America that was founded in 1976 and had a price per share of $15.00 at its IPO. Having BofA, Citigroup and many more giving it a PT of $21, I see this as a long hold due to these simple figures. 

500% Net Sales Growth (since 2010)

18% 5-year Compounded Annual Growth rate 

\#1 Largest Pure Play U.S. Luxury Wine Company 

11 Years of Consecutive Organic Growth 

9% Average Net Income Margin 

40% EBITDA margin 

P/E ratio = 0.04 

Owning 10 different Wine Brands (Decoy, Postmark)

Vaccine Rollout will promote more sales with restaurants and gatherings and increasing

Sadly this company is in $11,005,000 in debt but to save you from calculating the quick ratio, in simple terms, they have $245,311,000 just with the inventory. Seems pretty sexy. Going through the risks, the main concern they mentioned was the fact they might struggle to produce wine if a bad year of weather were to occur. 

This stock doesn't have much volume. You see that's not a problem cause I have this sweating disorder called like hyperhidrosis or something which makes me sweat constantly so if you guys want an easy-going stock to add into the portfolio, this is the one. I see this climbing up to STZ which is $226.57 a share. 

This is my first DD on here so hope you guys enjoy it."
2021-04-13 23:48:46,stocks,Good breakdown thanks
2021-04-14 00:02:14,stocks,0.04!?
2021-04-14 06:51:13,stocks,"Thanks for the analysis.  I am a wine enthusiast, I do like the wines they own and that they're widely available, specifically Decoy and Duckhorn. They also have 2 labels that are outside of Napa in Washington/Oregon and most of the labels in Napa are grown in areas that are really not THAT prone to fires. Wine does better with less water, the grapes produce a more robust wine when they are under stress(but not like fire or parasites) so I am not that concerned about climate effects especially in the near term. Hot dry summers produce excellent grapes. The enthusiasm for wine is growing and I think that Chinese consumption is at all time highs. The world loves a Napa cabernet or merlot, even the French, and though there is stiff competition for bold reds within Napa and from wine regions like Bordeaux, Rioja, mendoza, chile, Napa will continue to thrive. Additionally, in France wine producers cannot even irrigate their vines, in Chile/argentina they fertilize them with all kinds of cancer related stuff, so there is that. Napa has a good reputation and good production capability.  I bought in around IPO and have been buying a few shares here and there. That's my macro take on the industry, only with limited insight."

2021-04-14 00:02:42,stocks,ya. pretty crazy huh
2021-04-14 10:45:26,stocks,"I’m a winemaker, used to work in Napa but moved to Oregon. I would say climate change is an issue for Napa/Sonoma wines. Smoke impacting the wines from fires is a bigger deal than the actual vineyards burning, and it is a real concern because it can travel far and quickly. Plus heat/water stress doesn’t always make better wines, there is a Goldilocks zone. That said, I think Duckhorn is well diversified brand and they have a lot of smart people working for them. Even if even fire decreases the quality of the tourism experience that California can offer Duckhorn does have good distribution outside of tasting room sales and they are growing their brands outside of California. So I think they are a stable company to invest in, I’m not sure they will be a huge growth stock in the long term though. Just my two cents."

I think people would also be surprised at how bad the conditions might appear when you still make really good wines. The bottom line is perception is almost as important as reality with complex sensory experiences like in wine."

2021-04-14 00:32:39,stocks,"Sure, you can buy stocks, but definitely not recommended.

1. All capital gains in a C corporation are taxed at the same rate as other income, currently 21% (likely higher if tax reform passes). When you distribute the earnings as dividends to yourself, you pay additional taxes on your 1040 based on your tax bracket, resulting in double taxation.
2. If the amount of income you receive from trading stocks exceeds 60% of your total C corporation income for the year, your C corporation becomes a personal holding company, subject to additional taxes. An additional 20% on undistributed income.
3. Even if the passive income from stocks does not exceed 60%, you may be subject to the accumulated earnings tax if you distribute your earnings, which is also 20%.
4. Not to mention, there are state corporate taxes as well.

There are lots of other reasons to not do it, but these are some of the major points.

2021-04-14 00:53:43,stocks,Wut if u do this in Cayman Islands?
2021-04-14 09:19:32,stocks,"Not to piggyback on OP's post, but since you seem like you know what you are talking about, I've had the same question about my S Corp.  Is the answer more or less the same?"
2021-04-14 01:08:11,stocks,"As a U.S. taxpayer? Then your corporation becomes a Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) subject to subpart F rules. As a CFC, the GILTI and subpart F rules require the shareholder to include all the C corporation's income on the shareholder's tax return every year even if not distributed as a dividend and the income is taxed at the the taxpayer's ordinary rate (no preferential rates allowed). So potentially just as bad, if not worse."
2021-04-14 11:13:24,stocks,"See my response above to other commenter that asked the same question. An S-corp will yield the same tax results as a single member LLC/individual. There is no double layer of taxation trading as a S-corp, but there are also no additional tax benefits, only potentially some legal benefits such as liability protection."

2021-04-14 01:31:32,stocks,ONE LAST THING!! What the duck for real! Aren’t US publicly traded companies like apple majority owned by US citizens? How does this not apply to them? Can’t a partnership entity still copy what apple did and pay less as a C Corp off shore?
2021-04-14 01:41:05,stocks,"Have a read: [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/280E](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/280E)

It's my favorite section of the tax law."
2021-04-14 01:41:04,stocks,"Because a C corporation is only a CFC if the more than 50% of its shares are owned by shareholders that own at least 10% of the shares. OP owns 100%, therefore a CFC. Apple has millions of shareholders and the largest shareholder is around 6% (no single shareholder exceeds 10%). Edit: Also, Apple is incorporated in the U.S. CFC rules do not apply to domestic corporations.

Sure, you can have a partnership for trading. In fact most private equity and hedge funds are partnerships. Many are based in the Cayman Islands. But since partnership income flows directly to your 1040, no point in setting up an entity if you are trading for yourself. That is why I told OP a C Corporation is terrible idea for trading. I see no problems with a partnership or trading as an individual."
2021-04-14 08:16:44,stocks,Are some of these issues resolved by electing S status
2021-04-14 09:14:58,stocks,"Yes, trading as an S corporation, partnership (as a single person, you would have to be a single member LLC), or as an individual will all generally yield the same result from a tax perspective. All the income will flow directly to your 1040 and there is no added layer of taxes.

If you are an individual trading for yourself, there is no tax benefit to setting up an entity. In this situation, an entity such as an S-corp or SMLLC only provides some legal protection such as limited liability, etc.

Except for rare situations, unless you enjoy paying extra taxes, you should not be trading as a C-corp. All other entities are fine, but you are just creating extra work for yourself by trading through an entity as on your own as an individual."

Can you get wealthy over the long haul buying and holding large cap stocks over decades? Or does it require picking a needle in the hay stack? Could one get wealthy buying AAPL at this level? $2T? Looking for people who have been investing for decades for answers based off their experience. 

Thank you in advance!"
2021-04-13 23:39:29,stocks,"Absolutely. One way is to buy large value stocks that are stable (or generally as stable as a stock can be) and pay a dividend - think companies like MMM, JNJ, PEP, VZ, MO, etc.

Reinvest the dividends to buy more shares quarterly. Look up 30 years later (though keep an eye on them during that time in case a company really declines and you need to sell and put the funds elsewhere) and you are likely to have a large portfolio that kicks off a sizable amount of monthly income.

It's not the only way, and it's not a get rich quick way, but if you have enough time and stay committed to the process, it can pay off handsomely."

2021-04-14 11:07:13,stocks,"Historically 4% of stocks drive most of the markets gains. It’s hard to pick which ones are going to be in that 4% decade after decade. Everyone has their own approach, but from a probability standpoint, it’s unlikely you’ll hit winner after winner, decade after decade. 

This supports buying a broadly diversified index fund so you don’t have to worry about missing out on those huge winners. They do all the work and you can ride it out. If your goal is to do this long term and you’re not chasing short term profits, this is the best way to consistently build wealth from an empirical standpoint. 

Otherwise, if you like to pick individual stocks, that’s fine. Everyone has a different approach, I would just suggest making sure you understand your real goals and your temperament when it comes to market volatility."
2021-04-14 02:29:47,stocks,"Depends on what you start with, how actively you manage, how much you can tolerate (and not just tolerate but _stomach_ risk) and how you define ""wealthy"". And of course some luck."
2021-04-14 00:45:53,stocks,"The short answer is unless you’re going to dedicate significant resources to doing research and get over a 5-10 year learning hump it is better to buy the needle in the haystack. 

Look at the largest blue chips in 1990, 2000, and 2010. At the time people would have said those are no brainer investments and buy and hold for life. You would have been a lot better buying the index. 

Can you pick stocks and do well? Absolutely. It’s just a lot of work and most people can’t beat the index over the long run."

2021-04-14 13:30:09,stocks,I picked up some common this morning. They had good growth trajectory over the last year so as long as  the change in leadership doesn’t effect sales it should go back up.

Now the same Call Option is trading at 16.20$, and I made a 30% gain so far.

Call me pig, but I dreaming to see Aapl skyrocking to 155$ per share by the beginning of June to see a 321% of gain. Please pray for me. I  still believe that it is possible!"

These machines are truly insane though. They're barely even trying and they knock it out the park. They just shoved the M1 into last year's Pro body without touching the internals, no changes to the cooling solution and it screams. Once Apple increases the core counts and puts these in a machine with even more power and better cooling it's going to get crazy."

2021-04-14 04:05:54,stocks,"Yes. Stock should still go up.

If there's a company on nobody's radar, that releases amazing growth quarter over quarter what happens?

Well they should be collecting lots of cash on their balance sheets which they can use to buyback stock.

If the stock holders are willing to sell their stocks for cheaper than it's worth given the company's growth, then great, the company's EPS will rise even faster.

Let's say no matter what the company does, people don't want to pay more for it.

Well then if they're bought back soo many shares with no price movement that the PE ratio is < 5 or something they can just pay a 20% dividend yield and share holders will be collecting $$$.

In short, stock will always follow the company's performance, at least on a long enough time frame."
2021-04-14 02:18:56,stocks,"It's not that they don't go up, it's that it's already priced in. Professional investors get these sorts of news *long* before the public, either via their industry models, private research sources, or just straight up inside connections. Retail is always the last to know, that's why from your perspective it's a bunch of random movements, but from the perspective of a professional fund, it's a sophisticated game.

Look at it this way - say a high-level executive at Apple just *happens* to hint at the company's plans to enter electric vehicles at a private party, who's going to be able to prove it in the court of law? Yet that piece of information could drive stock prices for months among those in the know, before retail even catches a wind of it. That's why retail can never actually win - optimal trading is about having access to information that you don't have - and is better off investing in the over all market than individual companies."

2021-04-14 10:06:12,stocks,You’re not wrong and the cult is strong. People don’t realize apple laptops have out dated hardware and cost $500-$1k more than a comparable windows laptop.

I guess the tracking will be made visable when the Q1 and Q2 numbers are reported.  Banks and Credit Cards deliquency reporting tells you people are more solvent."
2021-04-14 07:12:29,stocks,That is called insider information and there is no way an apple exec is hinting at doing anything at some private party.  People speculate though.  Do some research on Martha Stewart.  I think conspiracy theories are getting the best of you.  I own 500 shares and bought around Sep - Oct 2020.  They are in 4 accounts and I'm up from 20-24%.  I'd say that's winning.

2021-04-14 06:51:15,stocks,Well the company can do share buybacks if it hits $0 which would increase the price away from 0
2021-04-14 07:23:59,stocks,"Wrong, investors will absolutely buy shares in profitable companies.  To think they are going to blackball a company while it is profitable is never going to happen.  Stock prices are tied to forward earnings.  If in quarterly reporting a CEO say they are lowering guidance or they don't want to give guidance, those are negative sentiments.  The stock price will respond whether during trading, in premarket or in after hours.  On the other hand if they see a strong pipeline, they are going to report that as well and the price will corelate.  Cash is another one.  Apple is a cash cow.  Buy backs. Sometimes a company will buy back stock with its cash in a downturn because it props up the price.  Just as issuing stock dilutes it.  Now in a case like TSLA, he used 10% of his cash to buy #bitcoin.  #coin was at $40K then.  Look how fast that 10% cash grew.  That will come up in their next report.  I don't know that Apple is buying any but that would be a factor to watch."
2021-04-14 16:16:15,stocks,That not a realistic way too look at the market. Every buyer offers 150 sure but then one person offers 149 and then another smarter person says fuck that I’m doing 140. And then down we go to the equilibrium price between supply and demand. Why would buyers offer to pay more than the market value anyways? They’re always looking to pay less with the sellers trying to sell it for more.

I see Microsoft in good shape because they are the only ones could fire up millions of windows os in the cloud without paying a cent for licenses. They could literally offer the whole game archive of decades. They will be using their own cloud I assume. I never liked Microsoft’s products but I am thinking to go in because they are also second runner in the cloud. I am already in Amazon.

If you want to play games in 4K, you’ll need a connection speed of 35 Mbps or more.

They're still a horrible pain in the ass to manage in a Microsoft based identity management system, although MS is admittedly making some progress in terms of allowing MDM of Macs through InTune.  That said, the best MDM for Macs is JAMF which as far as I know most places won't want to deal with if they're already using InTune.

Honestly if you're a random salaried middle-manage at a 500 company, and someone offers you a sliding scale on tips up to your salary, you're going to take it because the risk is just so low (the US surprisingly has an unlimited war on drugs budget but $0 for white collar/wallstreet crime)."

I'm relatively new to this, and I want to factor out opinions on this particular stock, but are there general best practices if you want to buy an approximate dollar amount of a direct listing stock, rather than a specific number of shares, at market open?

2021-04-13 20:34:58,stocks,Long puts cap your loses at the premium you paid for the contract.
2021-04-13 20:36:40,stocks,"Yes buy a put option. 

Your max loss will be the premium you pay.

2021-04-13 20:47:32,stocks,"Believe you’re referencing a naked call option. There are unlimited losses with a naked call investment; nothing else to it.

If you own the security, your call is covered. This is generally “safer”. Your maximum loss in a covered position is the purchase price less the sale premium on the option. In a covered position, your potential profit also has a ceiling, because you’d be holding the underlying security you have a call position open with at a lesser value than your purchase price."
2021-04-13 20:59:49,stocks,That’s called a put...

2021-04-13 20:40:34,stocks,"Ok so maybe you can help me out with this: let's say I believe a stock currently valued at $100 will fall to $80 within the next two months. I would buy a put option with a strike price of $90, so when (or if) the stock falls to $80, I can sell it at $90 and gain $10 per share. But if it goes up in price to $110 and the two months run out, do I still own those stocks at $110? Where would I lose money?"
2021-04-13 22:55:12,stocks,"Feel like money would be spent betting on a good company than shorting a bad one. Limited gains, unlimited loss and markets usually tend to go up. You could have shorted the housing market and still lost a substantial amount of money and have been right"
2021-04-13 22:44:03,stocks,"This deserves more attention, imo.
- shorting the stock wins if the price goes down. It may win a lot. If the company goes bankrupt, the win becomes a jackpot. But, by itself, it has an unlimited downside. If the stock price goes to infinity, the loss is infinite.
- this is where the call comes in. If the price goes above the call's strike price, then you exercise the call and the loss is capped."
2021-04-14 04:01:12,stocks,"I'm with this guy.

Or sell weekly ATM calls if you're sure it will drive down. You get to collect money, and if it moves against you, your shares get called away and you move along."
2021-04-13 20:44:54,stocks,"This is just advice, but REALLY learn more about options before you play with them.  It can be a VERY high risk environment if you don't know whats going on.  there are a lot of good tutorials on utube.  just my opinion, but learning options through trial and error is like learning to play poker - after you lose your first $100k, you kinda get the hang of it........"
2021-04-14 00:00:48,stocks,"Current stock value: $100

You think it's going to $80

Buy 1 put option contact with a strike price of $90; contract price is $0.50. You pay $50 (each contract is for 100 shares so it's 100 x $0.50) for the option to sell the shares to someone at the strike price of $90.

If the stock falls to $80, you can exercise the option and sell them 100 shares at $90/share while you are able to buy them for $80/share on the open market. You make $950 ($90 sale price - $80 purchase price = $10 profit x 100 shares = $1,000 - $50 option premium you previously paid).

If the price of the stock stays at $100, goes to $100, or only drops to $90, and expires, you are out the $50 you paid for the option. You never have to buy the shares because to sell because you never exercised the option.

With the numbers above, $89.50 is your breakeven share price ($90 sale price - $89.50 purchase price = $0.50 profit x 100 shares = $50 - $50 premium). For any price $89.51 or higher, you'd lose money if you exercised the option. You could theoretically sell anywhere between $89.50 and $90.00 and lose less than the $50 premium you'd be out if you let it expire worthless.

If you're bearish on a stock, a buying a put is the ""safest"" way to make that play. Your max upside in the above example would be $8,950 if the stock went to zero ($90 sale price - $0 purchase price = $90 profit x 100 shares = $9,000 - $50 premium), while you maximum loss would be $50 (if you let the option expire).

All of that being said, I agree with others that you should really read up on options, as they can be risky. Though buying put and buying calls are generally the lowest risk since you can only lose your premium. Selling covered calls is also relatively low risk since you are selling a call on stock you already own and purchased, so even if it gets exercised, you don't have to buy it on the open market to complete the deal."
2021-04-13 20:42:42,stocks,You only lose the money you paid for the put option. If the price is above your strike by expiry it expires worthless and the casino eats the money you put in.
2021-04-13 20:43:34,stocks,"If you have long options that are not in the money. You are under no obligation to exercise them. 

As for your entry, I don’t really want to opine on that. But I will say, it depends on your strategy. Do you plan on exercising in the money or do you plan on selling the contracts before expiry? That changes your entry strike."
2021-04-13 22:24:22,stocks,"Your put expires worthless if it's a 90 put and the stock goes to 110. Actually, if the stock is at 90 at expiration the put is worthless. Same with a call in reverse. If the stock is 100 and you buy a 110 call, the stock has to be above 110 for the call to have any value at expiration. If the stock is at or below 110 your call is worthless. The good part of buying options is that all you can lose is the amount of money you bought them for in the first place. The problem is that they expire and there is constant premium decay. If you just buy the stock it doesn't expire and there isn't any premium decay - you can hold on for as long as it takes to make a profit."
2021-04-14 00:42:41,stocks,"You don't own anything with a long put besides the right to sell at a certain price.

If it goes up to $110, you still have the right to sell at $90 until your option expires, but... why would you when you could just sell for $110?  Oh and by the way you probably paid $2 to $5 dollars per share for that put option, which is now worthless . That's where you lose money."
2021-04-14 06:53:58,stocks,"If a stock is now trading at 100, you think it’ll fall to 80, so you buy a 90$ put and it ends up going to 91$ on expiry you will lose 100% of your option. Just remember that with puts. Puts also a for bears and have limited upside. Calls are unlimited upside so clearly superior."
2021-04-14 08:47:54,stocks,Limited losses
2021-04-13 20:52:03,stocks,Listen to shitt4brains and do a little more reading on options trading before diving in. Naked calls are a really risky play.
2021-04-14 00:15:37,stocks,"Thank you for this explanation, this is clearer than anything else that I've read. To execute this, would I have to buy 100 shares just before I sell them at the strike price, or would that automatically happen when I exercise the option?"
2021-04-13 21:28:19,stocks,Just me who thought you were calling the other guy names and had to do a double take and look at his username before I realised what was going on? 😅
2021-04-14 00:28:31,stocks,"You could buy the 100 shares then execute the option, but most people will just sell the put contract since the value would have gone up."
2021-04-14 00:38:14,stocks,"You would either need the cash on hand to purchase the shares to turn around and sell at the higher price.

Or you would need to have been approved to trade on margin and in that case, your broker could open a short position in the shares - I.e. they would go ahead and sell the shares at $90 for you and you'd have an open short position until you closed it by buying the shares at $80."
2021-04-14 00:31:15,stocks,"And the amount you'd make from selling the contract is the same aa the amount you'd make from buying 100 shares at market and then selling at strike price? If the only loss you can have is the premium and you never have to actually buy shares, I don't understand why this kind of put is so risky."
2021-04-14 00:46:32,stocks,"So if I had the cash on hand, would that be considered a covered put? Since I only own the right to sell at $90, and not any shares, why would I need to cover the put with cash or margin when I can just sell the contract itself?"
2021-04-14 00:32:48,stocks,"Generally approximately, as long as the option is liquid enough.

It's risky because you are going to get hit by theta decay. Even if your hypothesis is correct and that the market is badly mispricing a stock (possible but not necessarily true), being able to predict that it will correct within a certain time period is challenging.

The longer out the exercise date is, the more your premium is going to be to buy the put."
2021-04-14 02:32:27,stocks,You don't. Just sell the contract. It's always better.
2021-04-14 08:52:12,stocks,"Honesty, I would always just sell the contract myself and not have to worry about any of it."
2021-04-14 13:48:47,stocks,"This. In March, I sold a covered call on some BAC shares I own with a $40 strike price and a July 16 expiration when it was trading in the $37-39/share range. The premium I received was $2.78 a share (so $278). For it to be worth the option owner exercising, it’ll need to get to $42.78/share.

Possible, yes. So far it’s not bumped above about $40.25 or so. But as time goes by the value of the option for the holder will decline due to the time being shorter until expiration even if the price ticks up some.

Ultimately, I don’t care if they get exercised because my cost basis is so low but if you’re buying calls and puts and the one paying the premium they can add up pretty quickly and you can find yourself out a decent chunk of change if the shares do move the way you’ve predicted."

2021-04-13 22:15:46,stocks,You deposit the physical certificate to your broker and they sell it.  Or you can contact a company if the shares are registered to you and state your certificate was lost and request the shares be deposited with your broker.  There would be a fee. Then the paper certificate would show as redeemed and have no stock value.

have you tried contacting customer support? the fact that you can SEE your shares is already a better situation than what most people with these paper certificates have found themselves in if you were to search the sub.

you should be able to some way or another transfer those digital shares into a normal brokerage, and from there do what you want with them.

2021-04-14 00:00:00,stocks,"It seems like the MAGNETude of what's going on is being artificially obfuscated. Rare earth minerals are the foundation of the modern age. All the talk of the shortage of electronic components chips etc and the shortage of rare earth minerals, and the fact that China is risking war with Vietnam ASEAN and even the United States being pulled in due to their alliance with Japan and S Korea, plus how even N Korea admires Vietnam is all based on the oil of the green sustainable revolution: rare earth minerals.

Since the 70s we've outsourced the production and refinement of rare earth minerals which are used to develop anything that manipulates electrons ie. The bottom row of the periodic table right above the exotics, and now China has run its wells dry AND by some coincidence fascism took over Myanmar and so cut off China from the rare earth mineral mine right there.

We have a mining operation where there is the highest concentration of rare earth minerals in the western hemisphere, yet no attention is being drawn to it and its price is being manipulated to the point of absurdity.

How could we have everyone warning about the shortage of electronics components while at the same time the very resource that is needed to make electronics components, the M part of EM ie electro magnetism I. E. Electricity I. E. The historical precious metals gold silver and copper are the most electrically conductive metals, while the resource that makes those things worth anything more than bling, and the resource that makes uranium and lithium worth anything more than boom, have its price signals go down?

MP was the historic site that was the foundation of the electronic age in the United States. Nothing has changed. Uranium is nothing but ultra coal, you can turn a nuclear power plant into a coal power plant because it's the same exact thing. You boil water which pressurizes turbines which require I'll say it again: RARE EARTH MINERALS to produce electricity.

Hydro electrics dams anything, the screen you are looking at is manipulating electronics using rare earth minerals.

The age of discovery was based on the discovery of magnetism, and all electricity is is pumping electronics by moving magnets around a coil of any precious metal, usually the cheapest which is copper, or the newly discovered aluminum (which by the way is how we got mirrors so reflective we were able to invent lasers)

I think we all know that the market is being botted to all hell, and it's causing people to become so frustrated they're ""investing"" in crypto, because they're becoming too fearful of investing in real things that we need and right now rare earth minerals are the only hope we have to progress technologically.

If MP fails so goes the world into a mad max dystopia where the only thing we have is scavengers trying to gather things from old pc boards and combustion based ""tech"".

The classical capitalist in everyone no matter whatever box anyone wants to sit in is called knows that ultimately by whatever means resources need to go where they are needed. Something crucial that there is a global shortage of has no reason to have its price signals go down especially after the president of the United States makes an address about his crucial it is that we industrialise our own electronics components and that can't be done unless MP succeeds.

It seems as if the same forces that are causing China such grief is also crippling the United States from successfully starting the most obvious foundation we'd need to create a new industrial revolution.

Obviously I'm investing in MP because I like electricity and I like having electronics. Do you have any interest in continuing to have electronic technology or harnessing electrons at all?

Or are we just not interested in manipulating electrons anymore because the price signals would indicate that a single Tesla car is worth a million apparently because we are ending the modern age and it'll be a neat trophy that can't run anymore that just tells the story of the fall of the modern age.

Added: okay so, hmmm I had no idea that there were people who believed that we were somehow behind the m part of electro magnetism.

Here's a puzzle: 

The simplest motor is a speaker driver which exists because it serves a function even while being so simple as being simply a pistonic motor.

Can you figure out a way to make a pistonic motor without a fixed magnet? If you could you would corner the world of subwoofers and be a billionaire.

If you could figure out how to make a pistonic motor without any rare earth magnets you'd literally be the next Nikola Tesla.

When you turn an electric motor you'll feel a wobble. That's the fixed magnets that are aligned in inverted sequence. Magnets are the fulcrum around which electromotive force is leveraged. That's why subwoofers need giant magnets.

Without magnets a lever would be without its fulcrum and would leave you with a stick.

Rare earth minerals include things like neodymium but also the rest of the bottom row of the periodic table above the exotics.

Warning to all, this is an activist investment and a long term trips hold. In the short term I would watch and buy the dip. There is resistance at around 34 and it tends to fluctuate around 35. Its hit 33 for a brief period which I did happen to snatch up by setting a limit buy there. You can also just set a limit and play defense at 33. There's a general consensus that it's a safe bet there given there is enough institutional investors that there's only 18 percent shares left for the public."
2021-04-14 00:29:59,stocks,What ticker do I buy
2021-04-14 16:41:12,stocks,REMX is all you need.
2021-04-14 07:15:05,stocks,"Yeai think the fact that we lived comfortably with things made of rare earth minerals being produced in mass scale to the point where I used to go to radio shack and spend a few bucks for some components, or we buy small magnets and don't really think to buy large magnets, but then when you buy a generator or even a speaker driver you realize how much you're paying for is not really as cheap as it seems... A subwoofer driver is really only worth its magnet, the rest is dressing to sell the magnet essentially since all the other parts are cheap. A bit of copper wire, cloth paper, and a big magnet. it's at least 100 bucks for solid subwoofer driver. A cheap subwoofer driver is obviously cheap the same way you can tell a diamond is cheap, by the literal size of the magnet. Then you have companies who take that driver and make as cheap of a box as you can get away with like the kef q150 where you are literally just buying the driver, the box is pennies worth of mdf so poorly crafted it has one cross beam that looks like a beaver carved it.

This is 600 bucks a pair:

https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0875/3864/products/kef_q150_black.jpg?v=1551761073

Mass produced those are expected to sell on volume and are hardly marked up, it's as cheap as it can be and really all you're paying for is the driver which is a big magnet.

https://img.canuckaudiomart.com/uploads/large/2529158-88c74dd7-kef-t2-slimline-subwoofer-powered-10.jpg

Another excuse to buy a 700 dollar magnet. Shipping fees priced in. Beyond the magnet it's a paper diaphragm, rubber surround, some canvass, for the spider, some aluminum for the frame, and the mdf box. But still they can't actually make it much cheaper because the price of the driver is the same as the price of the product. The most expensive thing in there once mass produced is the magnet which is huge. You can buy a cheap 50 dollar subwoofer driver and the magnet is about the same size as a mid woofer.

https://imgur.com/a/LgGyxLf

Magnets are very much like diamonds where they get way more expensive the bigger they are and the better quality, well crafted they are except they're actually functional and literally power everything.

Even as kids I think we all are fascinated by magnets and they would be precious if small samples like refrigerator magnets weren't so relatively cheap.

Lode stones were the basis to magic stones and the correlation between what across the world are considered precious metals I e. Gold silver copper all correlate to the highest electrical conductivity, only aluminum is newly discovered so doesn't have the same status, steel was pretty damn cool but only attained precious metal status in blade making as Damascus steel.

Anyone who's handled these things would know they do some interesting things together, like try throwing a ""lode stone"" at a block of gold silver or copper. It'll literally stop as if there were a force field. The way magnets interact with precious metals are actually way more interesting than just attracting iron. 

I doubt it's just a coincidence that those three are regarded so highly as magical and we've now begun really wielding this magic and take it for granted that the precious metals and the magic stones/crystals are actually the closest thing there is to magic. Magnets were once thought of as the philosophers stone in alchemy due to how it had all these strange relationships with metals.

It's not as scary but it's kind of similar to the Golden age of antibiotics we are lucky enough to be living in that is a temporary panacea that we know is not going to always be so accessible.

Luckily although China has depleted it mines there are still 2 regions of high concentration, one is mountain pass, $MP and the other are the caves of South East Asia. But as far as we know, the other places discovered don't have ore of any significant concentration that'd make it worthwhile. MP is a site with ultra rich ore and like 200000 tonnes estimated. So much that with such high demand unlike most companies they're already profitable."
2021-04-14 01:03:44,stocks,MP is the ticker they are referring to.
2021-04-14 14:03:48,stocks,"It actually did some major positive movements today. Many of us were afraid it would be pushed down past 33. I added a warning to people since there was a major put option expiring on the 16th and mentioned that imo anything under 35 is a safe bet, but due to the put option activity you can set your limit lower to 33 or so and snag it for a discount.

I invest in stuff I really believe in and would rather everyone do that rather than treating our economy as a casino. I think the strategy of just seeing the real value that's there, knowing it's worthwhile and for something that'd be a benefit to everyone and just stand by your own judgment of the value of the company and if we all insisted on that it would be the value just like how voting works.

As much as all the crazy manipulation can cause even recessions it all ends up an illusion over time, and the swings just go up and down anyway on aggregate and if you really believe an operation is worthwhile getting in early on seems like a cool thing to do.

There are hazards of course so never put in more than you can afford but I severely doubt this company would actually go bankrupt or anything and the lowest is ever conceivable imagine it would go short term is down to 28ish, and then make it way back to 35 over time and then I personally think once everyone realizes the severity of the situation it'll be kinda like how we take antibiotics for granted.

We take having these magic crystals and stones for granted but these are literally the substances alchemists would use as reagents that inspired magic stones in fantasy. The lode stone was called the magnet and code names the magnesian stone and was considered a candidate for the philosophers stone due to how they knew it had such strange interactions with not just irons but all the precious metals.

So these magical substances ended up becoming what we now have that pretty much is as close to magic as we can even have to the point where we've taken them for granted and forgot the reagents of this wizardry is of limited supply and once upon a time used to be a thing people would go on quests to discover.

So we pretty much live in the age of magic, but without the magic star dust it really can all fade away, so once it all clicks. Why the hostilities are happening around the world and the components shortage while we're trying to kick start a new phase of technological development this mine is one of 2 left that are where REE are found in high enough concentration with very high quality ore.

So I see it as a reboot and that mine is the same type of anything mine as you find in a game of star craft. All the sustainable tech, drones. And the future is going to be founded on that mine.

So my price expectations is about 80 at the very least. The mine they're running is not going to be a traditional mine but is focused on sustainability, and they even have an r and d department to research new novel applications for the minerals and magnetism itself, which would make them less of a mine and more like how you would expect to reboot a new electronic age. 

I don't doubt they'll find plenty of IP working with the raw resources and the operation will be a mine and r and d lab since as opposed to other mines this is a mine that harvests the key reagents that would yield new discoveries which is not something you'd see in a coal mine or a lithium mine.

I'm definitely doing to write to them and keep in touch and suggest ideas and see how receptive they are."
2021-04-14 17:04:37,stocks,I’m so confused.   Are you talking about ticker MP ?   Why didn’t you put the ticker in the title ?   Is it not allowed on this SUB?
2021-04-13 20:11:40,stocks,"Hmm... A resource that is causing a global crisis that's more essential than oil... A resource that china is risking war to attain... The foundation of the modern age, a resource where even something as simple as the simplest of all motors a speaker driver and is effectively the most expensive thing in there in terms of the quality of the driver and the weight that must be factored into its price.

Any energy production from hydro electric dams of the last to wind turbines require rare earth minerals.

The only exception is the least practical since e=mc2

The conversion of mass inertia into energy is much more worthwhile than the minute amount we get from catching photons on a medium that degrades and becomes less effective the hotter it gets I. E. The more efficient it should be, when it's facing the sun, causes it to be its least efficient, due to the heating of the medium increasing its impedence which is why people don't want to commit to solar panels versus anything else that transfers actual momentum into energy.

If mp succeeded we wouldn't even need lithium. The electric street cars we used to have didn't need lithium batteries. The most effective batteries are mechanical batteries that are completely sustainable. The conversion of chemical energy storage back into electricity is actually something we're gonna judge ourselves as primitive for since we're so dumb we can't even figure out the 3d pendulum I. E. flywheel batteries which we figured out like 100 years ago, but just kinda stopped because we'd rather keep selling consumables... Meanwhile energy plants use flywheel batteries and just kinda pretend they don't exist.

The whole concept of e = Mc 2 doesn't just apply to bombs, it also applies to how easy it is to convert mass inertia into a ton of em leverage."

2021-04-13 21:02:49,stocks,"A mine that is the only one in the western hemisphere where there is the highest concentration of a resource that is so in high demand that again we are facing a global electronic components shortage.

When you play any real time strategy game what is it that you start your economy with? You know people used to fight wars over bat shit? Mining is the foundation of all industry

Notice how China just got cut off of Myanmar and now they're panicking and trying to go after the caves of South east Asia? You know where there's another very high concentration? And that region is sure as hell not as easy to mine as the relatively flat lands we have around Mountain Pass.

If we fail at that mine, the age of electronics is grinding to a halt. So just a mine is kinda an under statement.

Until we can figure out how to leverage electro motive force without rare earth minerals. And when we do you'll see much smaller and lighter weight subwoofers. Rare earth minerals are literally the foundation of the modern age.

Coal? Uranium? Lithium? All that would be pointless without rare earth minerals. In fact we had electric street cars BEFORE we ever even had chemical batteries because rare earth minerals were so abundant we didn't even need batteries.

The original electric street cars ran on electricity using nothing but conversion of electro motive force.

If gm didn't burn all the street cars they'd be in museums and kids would go ""what's that?"" and that was a question you're not supposed to ask because chemical batteries sell better."
2021-04-13 20:24:44,stocks,"Show me one that doesnt. Literaly all of the things you mentioned are classical inverted fixed magnet arrays just like the motors that propel drones.

Heating using a motor, but the other side of the ac grid that's piping power into the high impedence metal is definitely a fixed magnet generator.

I think you listed the same thing 3 times. An ac a heater and a fan, and you're only referring to the fan part on all three instances. So show me a fan motor without fixed magnets."
2021-04-13 21:20:04,stocks,"Yea I brought that up as the simplest example of an ac motor. If someone cold figure out how to basically make a lever work without a fulcrum in this case electromotive force without fixed magnets they'd not only dominate the audio world with subwoofers that can be as powerful as lightweight as they want, but also the same thing would be able to be applied to anything else that uses em propulsion."

2021-04-13 21:37:59,stocks,"The connection to the claim that ""China is hoarding the rare earth minerals"" when they're actually so depleted they're again, having a face off with the entire pacific rim with Vietnam leading the charge and Japan Singapore s Korea even the Phillipines and they're ready to send China back to the stone age and all China wants is what MP has.

It's that crucial of a resource. You at the beginning of this chat I presume didn't really think about the significance of how bad things would be if we ran out of the entire bottom row of the periodic chart and are calling it just a mine. You presumed we had figured out a way to make ac motors using only ac power pushing against nothing.

If there's a resource that a nation like China would risk war over its probably at least as important as oil. And this is much more important than oil especially given any chance America has to industrialise and to modernize hinges on those resources. We can't make electronic devices if we don't have the whole base chart of the period table.

Look at what's on the bottom right above the exotics. That's what we call rare earth minerals. This isn't a coal mine or a lithium mine which again would be pointless combustibles if it wasn't for the bottom row of the period chart and what we have in abundance at mountain pass.

It's the only mine in the western hemisphere. Rare earth minerals appear randomly like gold but when you find a region of extreme concentration it's what you'd call a figurative gold mine, but in this case it's way more precious than a gold mine.

The only hope that America could reindustrialise is of we begin to have rare earth minerals in abundant supply again. If it wasnt so precious we'd have electric street cars that don't even need batteries again.

And the timing is what makes it so odd. The world is facing a depletion crisis. So supply is at an all time low and demand an all time high.... So how should we value mp?"
2021-04-14 02:25:21,stocks,"It's doubled but think of what is happening right now.

Biden just had to speak about the global electronic components shortage which is so plainly obviously connected to the fact that China is running out of rare earth minerals to the point where you can query the words hoarding and rare earth minerals and it'll lead you to accusation that China is hoarding it all.

Yet they are so desperate for it they have a 15 percent non voting investment into mp and have proxy militia facing off with viet nam and the rest of asean which corresponds to their being cut off from Myanmar.

So right now we're facing a global crisis which threatens to grind technological advancement to a halt while we're in the middle of a recession and trying to reignite our economy.

How much is the reignition of the American economy and the birth of a new tech revolution worth? Because mp is the foundation just like in star craft the first thing you need to do is get the mines going, except in this game there is only one mine left and it really needs support.

I've looked into their work and see that they're also pretty ambitious and are creating a department to engineer new applications for rate earth minerals and magnetic tech which is pretty cool. They aren't trying to be and shouldn't be seen as some lithium or coal mine since the stuff they are mining is more like the generic anything ore that you mine in star craft that is needed for literally everythjng else you plan on building.

The term it's a gold mine is synonymous with bonanza or riches. This is more then a gold mine. It's an anything mine, it's the bottom row of the periodic table for chrissake. Imagine not having that entire row anymore.

But to simplify it, most people just think of magnets. Imagine a subwoofer and how much power can be generated where through just pistoning a diaphragm with an ac coil it can shake the paintings off your walls. Now imagine trying to make the thing without a magnet. That type of power is the type of power we take for granted. China has been the principle manufacturer of speaker drivers for the last 30 years, but they're running out. We on the other hand don't only need subwoofers it's just a fun example of how unfun it would be to not have that required giant magnets that allow that to work any more. 


but imagine all the sustainable energy solutions we need. All the most efficient electric generators convert actual mass inertia into energy I. E. Turbines wind mills, ocean wave power, etc. Those all need giant magnets to work. Every single one of them.

Even nuclear power is just a means of boiling water to turn turbines all the same."
2021-04-14 01:57:32,stocks,"As of now they're doing the black water or z or acolyte or whatever the hell they keep renaming themselves type proxies. The group who are encroaching on Vietnam and the Phillipines are classified as militia and so China is acting as if they are not directly involved. Vietnam and the rest of asean are not having it and are making sure that it's known.

Through the use of the proxy militia China can act like they aren't directly culpable. Everyone sees through it, it's just a technicality the same way the united states is a proxy military for Europe and they can pretend like they don't benefit and were just super agro for no reason (but look who was in viet nam before America and who ended up taking the flack while the French who started the genocide are barely mentioned)

Magnets seem so much like toys and we take them for granted but think of the force inside of a 10 pound neodymium magnet. That force is what's used to make even gas powered generators and why they're so expensive even though a generator is actually really simple. It's just a copper coil and magnets that are cranked around the copper wire using some source of fuel.

This is the same principle that we use to turn uranium into boiling water that vents and turns a turbine.

The only green energy source that currently doesn't use magnetism is basically just a half battery and uses a photovoltaic effect and as a battery it suffers all the same issues of losing efficiency as it heats and wearing out over time.

Were actually held back a lot already by not having our own source of rare earth minerals. And magnets are one major extremely powerful product that we take for granted.

I keep using a subwoofer as an example because it's such a simple but effective type of motor but with just a coil that alternatives its Flux against a big powerful magnet you can shake a whole house.

Imagine if you didn't have magnets anymore. How much power would it take to achieve the shame thing trying to use 2 coils? A 10 lb neodymium magnet has enough force that just exists in it that it can cause serious injuries. It pretty much is the closest thing we have to a magic stone. Any alternative to it is never anywhere near as efficiency or versatile. You couldn't use two coils for instance to generate power, you'd need the fixed magnet as the source of power that would pump the electrons.

All our efforts toward a sustainable power future rely on fixed magnets and rare earth minerals. China was already hurting for rare earth minerals before, Myanmar just made things much worse.

It's really bizarre how despite all the talk over how crucial this electronic component shortage is, and how we need to industrialise the foundation of industrialisation is treated like it's just another lithium mine or something.

It's almost as if we wanted to create a city and no one cared about supporting steel production... Rare earth minerals are more crucial than petro.... If there were only one source of oil left and everyone else was running out and we were in the 80s, how much would the last oil company be worth? And that's not even a fair comparison because we can advance beyond petro. We actually can't advance beyond generating electricity at the very least. And a green future would be about creating a ton of electric generators and each of them would need rare earth minerals. All the other alternatives are like trying to make a subwoofer without a magnet."
2021-04-14 02:41:42,stocks,"Please use some common sense. Again why do you think all the motors you have use magnets? Why the hell would we resort to not relying on an inherent source of power.

All sound quality aside think about how powerful a subwoofer is. Now try to create something that powerful and efficient without a permanent magnet.

The lack of rare earth minerals has been holding us back for a long time and if we have to resort to even worse tech then we currently have that would be stupid. There's a reason why our robots suck and Hollywood gets its drones from china. 

There's a reason why all the little ac motors you have use magnets. And again think of the other end. How would you generate nuclear power even? Chicken and egg?

The entire green revolution is sure as hell not going to be solar panels. The most effective and efficient conversion is mass inertia using fixed magnets to pump electrons. The force that is inherent in a ten pound neodymium magnet is way more powerful and effective than trying to magnetize a coil against another coil which is why no one does that even with coupled driver subwoofers which are inherently symmetrical so the Flux would be inherently balanced and any noise could easily be filtered out. 

Try to make a subwoofer using two coils. The only reason why anyone would do such a thing is out of shear desperation and you'd end up with a much worse product that even with twice the power would yield a fraction of force. Lack of resources is why so many millenials, my generation, are so desperate for quality we buy shit from the 70s and 80s."
2021-04-14 03:40:34,stocks,"By the way the challenge is still open. I can show you all the ac motors I have, I can take apart a fan, a drone engine, all you have to do is show me one motor you can find without fixed magnets."
2021-04-13 21:16:59,stocks,"Like any lever without a fulcrum! Obviously right?

If there was a way to do that subwoofer manufacturers sure as hell would sieze upon it. A speaker driver is the most basic engine, a simple ac piston. So again... Show me an ac motor without a fulcrum I e fixed magnets because if you can show me you should probably tell the rest of the world. Subwoofers would be 90 percent lighter. We would be able to make magnetic propulsion devices without magnets. You'd solve the whole chicken and the egg puzzle."
2021-04-13 21:45:22,stocks,got it
2021-04-13 21:20:53,stocks,There are no permanent magnets in AC motors. The reason they use permanent magnets in speakers is because there would be excessive hum due to the 60 Hz AC coupling to the speaker audio input.
2021-04-14 00:03:40,stocks,"Again show me a design for an ac motor with no permanent magnets. The hum would be no big deal thats easily dealt with using XLR. You've listed fans, three times, once in its cold setting once in its hot settings, then a garage opener and a blender. All have fixed magnets as their fulcrum.

What's the point of the coil em magnet? What's it propel against? Would you just use twice the power and have it propel against a constantly charged coil? And if so why would you imagine that would be something we'd have to resort to? Check the ac motors anywhere in your house and try turning them. Tell me if you find any of them that actually turn smoothly.

Added: where it would be the coolest application if it worked would be on coupled subwoofer drivers since they are symmetrically coupled anyway so any Flux would be inherently symmetrical. If you could figure that out it would be again, revolutionary. If you try it though you'll see why no one does that, and it's not because of hum. It's because the power it'd take to equal what is already available in a 10 lb neodymium magnet or even a ferrite magnet is of such magnitude the only reason why you wouldn't use a permanent magnet is out of desperation and it would never yield nearly the same efficiency. Thats why if you go look at all the ac motors you'll notice they don't turn smoothly. I'm sure you have a fan or a blender."
2021-04-14 00:09:32,stocks,I can show you infinite ac motors with magnets. You just have to show me one. And the explanation about speaker hum was honestly really weak. As if decades of transmitting sound we'd not have figured out how to negate noise.

Last month when the sky was falling for all these new “investors” on here and we reached some low spots in March, one guy talked about how he was down 40% on PLUG but was still up 20% on AAPL. He said, “I’m still up on AAPL, so obviously I’m not going to buy any more right now” (AAPL was $120 at the time). 

Like what fucking logic? Like buying AMZN at $75 and then never buying on a dip if it falls from $200 to $100, because “obviously” why buy at a higher price than original cost basis? In case it wasn’t common knowledge on here (you’d be surprised), AMZN is over $3,000 now.

Basically case 1 & 2 is perfectly timing the market which is essentially impossible. 

The outcome of course was those who invested in lump sum at the bottom made more money over the same period of time. Dollar cost average came in second, and lump sum at the bottom clearly came in last.

We haven't gotten a big and prolonged crash in the last 10 yrs, so most people probably forgot or haven't experienced what it felt like to invest money and see it going down for years. It takes a lot of discipline and conviction to keep putting in money in that situation.

Also, about diversification... when things go south, correlation tends to go to 1. That’s what happened in 2008. Everything tanked. Other than cash. So all time high or not, the question is do you hold enough cash to slowly average down if market tanks (I am doing it) or do you go all in.

If they'd used an assumed, conservative rate of return rather than look at what the market was actually getting them then maybe they'd have gotten what they planned for (of course that's a dumb strategy for a lot of reasons).  But in reality in a market bubble like we had in the late 90s they probably looked at their accounts, realized they had way more money than they actually needed, and retired early.

The basic idea is, DCA pays off in a choppy market because you buy more shares when they're cheaper and less when they're more expensive.   But in the long run, markets do tend to trend upward, so it actually works out that usually you'd be better off investing lump sum now.  Of course obviously if now is right before a crash, that doesn't work out.

2021-04-14 00:53:46,stocks,"I'm currently learning about puts and calls so maybe you could help me out. You're describing a protective put, right? Where you buy a put option on a stock that you currently own so that you can sell the stocks at a higher price than market if they drop too much, thus putting a cap on how much you can lose, but then lose money on the premium if the stocks go up? I don't understand why you wouldn't just put in a limit order to sell at what would be the strike price. Would you sell the contract itself and hold on to the stocks that dipped?"
2021-04-14 01:13:25,stocks,"I don't use protective puts much, because yeah as you say, it's expensive protection because you have to pay the premium.

One reason a limit sell/trailing stop isn't quite the same is there's no guarantee you'll be able to sell at or even close to your limit price in case of a gap down (e.g. if very bad news about the stock came out like massive earnings miss), where as with a put that's irrelevant, you can always sell for the strike price even if it gaps down 50% below that."

Im new to options and I’m trying to understand. This is purely hypothetical, I don’t have this money haha, but say I had 39,000 to buy 20 contracts of 1/20 2023 215c on VTI. 

This ETF has been pretty steadily growing over the years with only a major dip on March 2020, the reason being obvious.

But with the trend this ETF follows, would it be safe to say in about 2 years when my option expires, I should be up a good amount? Much safer than buying options on a single stock?"

2021-04-13 23:48:34,stocks,"Would look at the analysts as an aggregate. You’re going to get some outliers and sounds like Schwab is one of those. I think analyst ratings aren’t all that useful (don’t write them completely off but they’re usually pretty skewed and in accurate). I believe the average price target for Amazon is a shade under $4K.

It’s no secret Amazon competes on price, Bezos has been upfront about this since its founding - I’m paraphrasing but he knows for certain in twenty years customers will want products cheaper and faster. 

There is still tremendous runway for growth, we’re only in the second or third inning for AWS and probably the fourth or fifth inning for e-commerce."
2021-04-14 03:13:25,stocks,"On the mobile app, when you click on the rating it brings you to pdf's that's has an easy table on what their ratings mean. C means that schwab rates it a hold. Which sounds pretty logical to me"
2021-04-13 21:24:12,stocks,amazon is going to be the biggest company in the world. Buy it if you like money.
2021-04-13 20:53:06,stocks,"As with all purchases, it depends whether you're looking at this as a short to medium-term trade or a long-term hold.  Schwab and most analysts give their assessments based on near-term (within a year) predictions.  That's why you see analysts flip-flop so much -- they change their analysis based on the quarterly data."
2021-04-14 05:21:35,stocks,"what are your other four? I assume msft+googl+appl, whats the last one?"

Taking a look at their ratings performance, ""F"" stocks have outperformed every other rating in the past year."
2021-04-13 21:00:06,stocks,"> c doesn’t mean declining just average return projections.

They specifically say that ""most investors don't invest in this"" because  of a perceived lack of price appreciation.

If it's not appreciating, it's (effectively) depreciating.  Meaning going down."
2021-04-13 20:58:21,stocks,"But what's that based on?

It's not like people were heavily shopping at malls prior to COVID.  Malls have been on the steep decline.

Other stores like Best Buy still had pickup service, same as Wal-Mart that never ""officially"" closed.

I don't really see anything significantly having changed except that Amazon is selling more to businesses on the back end.  Unless I'm missing something."

2021-04-13 23:58:03,stocks,"Totally agree with your statement. AWS is clunky, like most of Amazons internal systems, however they were first to market. I really wish Microsoft keeps pushing Azure because it’s a wayyy better product than AWS."
2021-04-13 21:02:37,stocks,"Well, the main reason is cost, the secondary reason is brand, the third is convenience/speed.

I bought my OLED from Amazon.

Could I have bought it from Best Buy?  Absolutely.

The problem is that Best Buy would take longer to deliver it than Amazon.

I know this because it's my second OLED - and the first one was bought from Best Buy in early 2019, and I had to risk driving it home because they wouldn't be able to deliver it for a week.

Yet Amazon was able to ship this second OLED in 2 days AND it was cheaper."

The only reason they’d hold 11% as crypto as a whole *20xs* is if they had no competition.  Kind of weird to assume they’ll keep that

Especially when they’re charging so much for fees, and lowering that fee would crash the stock (by obliterating their next quarters earnings and causing a panic). 

And competitors could easily lower the fee

2021-04-14 02:49:08,stocks,Groundbreaking
2021-04-13 23:13:37,stocks,"I’m not talking about mining, you’re misunderstanding the analogy. Yes, those who didn’t get in early can still buy Bitcoin, just like in the gold rush they could still buy gold. However it is at a way higher price than those who got in early. There are people still buying Bitcoin at high prices, and investing in Coinbase is profiting from those people. 

By your logic, why would people invest in banks when they can just have dollars? Coinbase is a wallet company that allows people to use the asset as a currency. It’s a Bitcoin bank. One isn’t just investing in Bitcoin, they are investing in the storage, transactions, and growth of the industry as a whole instead of the raw asset. The asset could go sideways for a year but the company is still profitable because of all of the transactions and business from the different cryptos that it deals with. Make sense? 

It also makes it more normalized to be investing in a company that has a balance sheet, press releases, earnings reports, and a board of directors to hold accountable. Buying a bitcoin provides none of the above."

I sell plastic bags. You know, the global plastic market size is estimated to be USD 579.7 billion. Even if we just have 1% of the marketshare, we're looking at \~5.8 billion dollars. That's more money than all of you sharks combined. What do you think? Deal?"
2021-04-14 10:53:22,stocks,">	In 2020, ICE and Nasdaq each made an average of 0.01% on each dollar of securities’ trades. Hence, Coinbase reaped about 50 times the margins of those longstanding, gargantuan marketplaces. It generated the equivalent of three-quarters of Nasdaq’s trading revenues—$1.5 billion versus $2.0 billion—on 2% of the volumes."
2021-04-14 13:12:29,stocks,"That’s what I was thinking. If you’re already bullish on BTC, might as well buy BTC. Or buy both COIN and BTC if you think COIN dominates the crypto sector. Or if you’re bullish on BTC and bearish on COIN, buy BTC and short COIN."

2021-04-14 09:08:35,stocks,A slick UI and easy to use experience should be the goal of basically all retail type businesses.
2021-04-14 13:04:01,stocks,"Yep. I literally, no joke, not making this up or remembering favorably, thought to myself “I should buy some of this and just stick it in the closet for 10 years”. It was in the $20-50ish
range at the time.

There were several other times later in the years when Bitcoin was around $300 I thought about doing the same. I just didn’t have enough expendable income to really invest at the time. Called my father and asked if I could borrow $10,000 to invest (they had the money easily) and was laughed at.

I likely would have unloaded at the $1,000 mark. But I would still have had around $4.5 million at that initial investment point. If I kept it I’d be nearing $100 million today, but I try to lowball it at the $4.75 million point to be more realistic.

Every single hour I work I’m reminded of it. I’m a hard worker too. I always give it 110%. But knowing each keystroke could have been unnecessary has destroyed my mental health over the years. There is so much good for the world I want to do, but instead I’m stuck in the hamster wheel to keep food on the table and roof over my head.

On the positive side though, GME has really revitalized my drive. I’m not blinded by riches, I’m being cautious and calculated, but I feel like I’m being given a second chance and that gives me some inspiration to push through."
2021-04-13 22:38:54,stocks,"I am a pretty firm believer that crypto volume will remain insanely high for the next few years, even during a downturn. 


That said - I gotta' point out what another user just did: Coinbase's fees are based on the price of the crypto. So if it's lower, the fee is lower. 


Very simple concept I overlooked, haha."
2021-04-14 01:00:48,stocks,That's how it works. Reddit is an exclusive club /s.

2021-04-13 23:52:42,stocks,Coinbase is extremely correlated to the price bitcoin. Unless coinbase is going to sell skinny jeans to school kids when bitcoins goes into another bear market
2021-04-13 21:36:47,stocks,Bitcoin is so much easier to store compared to physical gold. It’s not even close.
2021-04-14 03:06:22,stocks,"In fact, the recent gigantic leak sent the stock flying upwards :D"
2021-04-14 15:08:18,stocks,i regret not shorting this despite knowing it be a shit show this morning
2021-04-14 00:12:05,stocks,"Just jesting. I wouldn't risk shorting, it would be financial suicide. There's more money to be made in just buying and holding, IMO.

2021-04-14 07:14:10,stocks,"Huh, but 7% is much much lower than the SPX gains right?"
2021-04-14 16:57:27,stocks,"> This is what I've been doing for the past 5 years. 7% annualized return

So you have been spending your time actively trading in order to underperform the broad market and are losing in comparison to buying 5 years ago and doing literally nothing. 

An odd thing to brag about but hey whatever floats your boat"
2021-04-14 08:21:37,stocks,How will you know bitcoin has reached its peak?
2021-04-14 09:08:49,stocks,"To be fair, they're going through an extreme growth phase with the intense media attention and upward swing of crypto.  It could be difficult for them to hire up quickly enough.  I'd consider a transitory phase.

I've had an account with them a few years now and have only done a handful of transactions, but compared to Mount Gox days\*\* is an incredibly difference and fantastic UX regardless of product type.  I've been a software dev myself for over 20 years.  They also have Ycombinator roots which means they have SV as a whole on their side.

\*\*note: I once purchase 59 btc for $1000 and sold for $700 during a crash, yes suicide has felt like a possible avenue a few times :)"
2021-04-13 20:05:43,stocks,"Yup we're looking at 5.8 billion dollars market share, now my valuation is at 150b. what do you think? deal?"
2021-04-14 09:33:16,stocks,Plastic bags are now outlawed in many states no deal
2021-04-13 21:00:10,stocks,Cardano is all about stakes. Not sure what they are
2021-04-14 00:32:08,stocks,"That’s like saying “Bitcoin is up 5x in the past 6 months.  Therefore it will be up 10x in the next year”

Surely you remember that Bitcoin can wildly crash after a bull run and stay bear for years? It’s only happened like 3+ times already in the last decade"
2021-04-14 00:36:17,stocks,"Thing is, it’s an exchange. Should be valued like other exchanges (Nasdaq etc) not Facebook or Tesla 

As an exchange the only things that matter are volume traded and fees. That’s 97% of their income 

Fees will 100% get slashed as others come in. Stocks basically trade for free (0.01% to 0) coinbase charges insanely high fees (0.50%). Meaning it’s 50x higher fees than nasdaq

Given that fees are going down almost assuredly, where’s the growth?  

If fees go down by 50x, volume would have to go up by 50x to even stay at what they’re at now, much less grow"
2021-04-14 14:42:28,stocks,"I feel your pain about btc and share your excitement for GME I’m in for 111 @ $44. I doubt it has the same potential as BTC but I think I there is a tremendous upside to it considering the sheer amount of press that’s covered it, the management changes, and the ape mentality. Im not letting this one slip through my fingers again, holding till $0 or $5000."
2021-04-14 07:00:09,stocks,"I just don't understand the ""currency"" moniker. I can't buy a coffee with it. Lol. It's been a fantastic investment, for sure."
2021-04-13 20:18:43,stocks,Very knowledgeable thank you for the nice write up.... stupid idea or decent to buy at a share at 600 (if it opens there) to start a position with wildness to average down or smarter to wait waited a few days til the hype wears off
2021-04-13 20:19:23,stocks,Thanks for your opinions 👍
2021-04-14 09:50:51,stocks,Yeah it probably says “estimated ipo price” don’t ever believe that
2021-04-14 09:51:34,stocks,I do hope it opens at 250 though ThAtd be a hell of a buy
2021-04-14 16:54:06,stocks,"Got in at 381 and sold at 410, been in a freefall ever since"
2021-04-14 15:14:36,stocks,"Don't mind me, I'm just holding $381 bags."
2021-04-14 06:06:49,stocks,"Got it

2021-04-14 00:01:17,stocks,"They make money either direction Bitcoin trends.  It’s volume correlated to Bitcoin, not price."
2021-04-14 00:29:32,stocks,"Regardless of Bitcoin, Coinbase handles a multitude of other cryptocurrencies, so for your analogy if Bitcoin goes down then YES, Coinbase can sell skinny jeans to school kids since Bitcoin isn't their only draw."
2021-04-14 04:26:44,stocks,Coinbase gets a fee when you buy. They also get a fee when you sell.
2021-04-13 23:11:41,stocks,"Yeah, that’s a strange argument for sure. Just download Coinbase and buy some Bitcoin fool. Lol"
2021-04-14 01:01:33,stocks,You wouldn’t download a car!
2021-04-14 02:28:16,stocks,"Wut, all you have to do is go to apmex, use your card, and receive said gold in mail...."
2021-04-14 07:51:39,stocks,The stock opens today homie.
2021-04-14 01:54:00,stocks,Or you could take a small position with a stop loss so it doesn't kill ur funds
2021-04-14 10:26:09,stocks,the end of the cycle usually happens towards the end of the year .. you dont have to know exactly what year but you can prepare for it every year by not going all in on btx  winter time dummy 😙
2021-04-14 07:26:43,stocks,Who would of thought that buying at a random point in time and setting an arbitrary price target that you hope to hit in some undetermined time frame isn't a market beating strategy?
2021-04-14 09:30:36,stocks,Much higher than the 0.01% I'd currently get in a savings account though.
2021-04-14 15:28:45,stocks,When it dumps 40% and doesn't reclaim it's high
2021-04-14 10:14:11,stocks,"I signed up for Binance instead. I assume it was an app issue with Coinbase since Binance accepted me in 5 mins including all the verification.

2021-04-13 21:45:30,stocks,The biggest.
2021-04-14 14:27:07,stocks,and coinbase still makes money when bitcoin goes down.
2021-04-13 22:29:49,stocks,"what is net margins, margins and profit? What's the difference between those 3 and which would be net income??"
2021-04-14 10:26:21,stocks,What matters is reach. They can transition from fees to something else. When I do the same and sell orders for front running for a few millisecond advantage?
2021-04-14 07:02:55,stocks,You can even use doge. coin as a currency I believe in some places unfortunately. You can use Bitcoin in a million places in today's society literally. I can use it to buy pizza at a local Mom and Pop shop right down the street from me dude literally.
2021-04-14 09:56:51,stocks,"I put a limit order in at that price anyway, I have no idea what will happen or when, but I’m guessing it won’t fill"
2021-04-14 00:03:57,stocks,"Volume goes down when price trends down. They don't offer margin trading

love how this is getting down votes when you can open any chart see im right"
2021-04-14 00:33:01,stocks,"All those other currency, those follow the price of bitcoin too . You can easily see this by comparing the charts. Bitcoin sets the crypto market trends. Also all those other crypto related stocks are just proxy to the Bitcoin market, coinbase will be no different"

2021-04-14 07:40:45,stocks,"Lol, yeah. That's why I'm wondering. The annual return over that period of the SPX is 15%. And considering that a lot of IPOs happen during bull markets, makes it even worse"
2021-04-14 09:33:05,stocks,So.. what is your strategy for deciding when to sell?
2021-04-14 17:00:00,stocks,That's not what you compare returns to. If you decide to actively trade you compare your returns to buying an index fund and leaving it alone. You underperformed which means the result of all of the effort you put into trading is you have less money than had you not traded.
2021-04-14 00:28:11,stocks,"Not really. Their revenue is something like 97% from trading fees

The institutional custody barely pays shit at the moment. And there’s plenty of competitors in that space like NYDIG and Bakkt (VIH) and Gemini who all also have 20B each

2021-04-14 00:31:07,stocks,Everyone’s talking about it
2021-04-14 15:00:42,stocks,".. their fees are based on the price of BTC

if BTC goes down 70%, so does their fee revenue (if volume were to remain the same)

volume drops too though

considering that 97% of their revenue is from trading fees, this should be a red flag"
2021-04-13 22:30:47,stocks,"Profit is the total amount of money a company makes from operations, what is significant is income because that is the amount the company keeps from the revenue"
2021-04-14 11:14:02,stocks,"They can transition to a new line of business that will take up 97% of their profits, since they have a lot of users?

Not sure that makes sense as an investment thesis.  Look at FB and how much they’ve been able to pivot from ad dollars in 10 years"
2021-04-14 08:02:06,stocks,"Literally, bitcoin is an awful choice for transactional currency. Confirmation time and high fees make it dumb as fuck. Not to mention current price volatility means that value will almost always shift while you wait for a transaction to go through.

Don't misunderstand. There's coin with actual transactional effectiveness like LTC or BCH, but neither has the same level of mainstream popularity as BTC and is a ways away from being accepted at major stores across the US. 

There's a bitcoin ATM at the gas station next to my office and I can now buy a Tesla in BTC, but that's not even close to the same thing as me using crypto to pay for my lunch in a drive-thru."

2021-04-14 00:39:19,stocks,"You need to look at Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a parent and their children. 

Reference: A parent has a child or children, the parent raises the children in their likelihood (helps them grow and learn) until the children mature then they are free to fly their own way.

Bitcoin could be considered a ""parent"" to many other cryptocurrencies and helps them grow and mature until they are ""old"" enough to fly their own way. Some will nourish-some will falter. Just like parents and their children."
2021-04-14 10:50:03,stocks,Oh shit.  Whoops.
2021-04-14 10:36:50,stocks,bro not once did i say it was inevitable as we all understand it has to happen at some point for the price to go up again happy for you and those gains tho well done.  I was simply trying to explain that what the guy said in his reply was pretty solid advice to be careful..this cycle has to end just like any other and then you never know how long till next one ☝️ stay safe :)
2021-04-14 10:22:42,stocks,"I think trading fees will drop to near zero very soon from competition. Just like trading fees for stocks have dropped to zero. I remember paying $20 per trade with Ameritrade, it’s now zero.

2021-04-14 00:50:02,stocks,"Lol I don't know what you're getting at but other crypto have historically been higher beta bets on bitcoin. Bitcoin brings the whole market with it . Coinbase hasn't proven it self to be very innovative like a Google or make good buys like Facebook but that might change. They have first mover advantage with regulations, but they can easily be replaced with other exchanges. They are basically just a bank that turns your USD to crypto. They will prob go up allot this year like everything crypto related, and if you only trade stocks it's prob a good play, but I highly doubt it will beat the price of bitcoin over the long run"
2021-04-14 10:48:50,stocks,"my confusion with his comment was he said it would end ""soon"" as though he was an oracle.

2021-04-14 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, April 13, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, April 13, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) gaining while the Dow Jones (DIA) fell modestly. Market participants are closely monitoring the pace of vaccine distribution after US federal health officials called for the pause in the rollout of the Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine and the upcoming earnings season.

In a joint statement posted to Twitter [(check out the thread here](https://twitter.com/US_FDA/status/1381925612743499778)), The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) called for a pause in the rollout of the JNJ vaccine following reports of rare blood clots in people who received the vaccine. The agencies are reviewing data over six reported U.S. cases of a severe blood clot in individuals after receiving the vaccine, and have recommended the pause ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the FDA said in a Twitter post. To date, roughly 6.8 million doses of the single-dose JNJ vaccine have been administered.

In a statement, JNJ said it has been “working closely with medical experts and health authorities, and we strongly support the open communication of this information to healthcare professionals and the public” and added “In addition, we have been reviewing these cases with European health authorities. We have made the decision to proactively delay the rollout of our vaccine in Europe.” During a press briefing, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the J&J vaccine review would likely take “days to weeks, rather than weeks to months”, in order to resolve.”

As earnings season kicks off, a slew of recent promising economic data has suggested corporate profits will jump in tandem with the recovering economy, especially in the sectors most heavily affected by the pandemic. Over the past several weeks, analysts have raised their earnings estimates by record levels with the expectation that recent economic growth will drive corporate earnings higher. According to FactSet, first-quarter [earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6%](https://insight.factset.com/record-high-increase-in-sp-500-eps-estimates-for-q1) over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far.

**Highlights**

* Earnings season is kicking off Wednesday pre-market, with many big banks reporting earnings.

https://www.ft.com/content/d43ec8c5-0990-4781-b71f-82cb73a09610 

TLDR:

 too few companies in the index, should have done the rebalancing before the ETFs became these big, when doing the rebalancing suddenly, values of the etf will go down as they can't just sell so many without bringing the price down, or buying too much without increasing the price up..

Some excerpts below
-------

Massive investor inflows into two BlackRock exchange traded funds pinned on just 30 clean energy stocks may force the asset manager to sell billions of dollars worth of shares to prevent it building up overly large holdings in the companies.

The potential sales of two New Zealand energy companies would represent the amount that is typically traded in 40-50 days in order to comply with a dramatic index rebalancing


the ETFs now own more than 8 per cent of the market cap of six stocks, according to SocGen’s calculations, and more than 6 per cent of a further eight.

ETFs tracking the index would need to buy all of the freshly added stocks, as well as increasing their holdings in some existing constituents.

To do the rebalncing (from 33 company now to the intended 77) iShares ETFs would need to pump more than $400m into each of Vestas Wind Systems, Orsted and NextEra Energy, as well as large sums into Chinese groups such as China Longyuan Power, Xinjiang Goldwind and GCL-Poly Energy.

This buying spree would be counterbalanced by a wave of disposals. The ETFs would need to sell $405m worth of stock in New Zealand’s Meridian Energy, SocGen estimated, equivalent to 47.6 days of typical turnover.

Similarly, the estimated $360m of sales of fellow Kiwi operator Contact Energy would represent 45.9 days of trading.

“In a perfect world, they would have changed the index before now,” he (an expert) added.

“It’s very rare that you say ‘our index is too narrow because the ETFs following it are more successful than we imagined’,” said Sleep. “The index was created for the express requirement of these ETFs. I don’t suppose they ever imagined they would [hold] $11bn.”

Even this latest set of proposals may not be enough. S&P has already signalled its intention to conduct a further consultation after the April revamp to potentially expand the Clean Energy index into fields such as marine energy, alternative fuels, energy storage, energy efficiency and smart grids. S&P declined to comment pending the results of the current review."

Is this speculation? I’m just starting out so when i start researching about a company it mostly consists of things like this.

2021-04-14 10:49:14,stocks,"It's not wild speculation, but it's best educated guess. There are fundamentals to try to get to a fair value of a company but it's complicated (to me at least) and it's not my day job, and there's other issues eg just because you think something has a different fair value doesn't mean the market agrees (which is good when trying to find undervalued stock, but isn't great when your pick doesn't really move up in price action). 

My opinion, put money into a diverse ETF or index and only make stock picks for a small part of your portfolio when you're comfortable. Take however much time you need to feel comfortable but act with conviction, not on a yolo or speculation. Conviction is what's going to help you to keep holding through volatile periods rather than selling before seeing a plan through."

2021-04-14 00:00:00,stocks,"A very, very bullish DD on $APD I've been looking into Hydrogen for quite a while, especially more recently with the hit its taken, but the more I've looked into it, the more I think APD is severely undervalued at its current price. I'd love to hear other opinions on this, and Hydrogen in general, but I also want to give my perspective, and why I'm extremely bullish on it.

I think hydrogen has a better future than EV. Hydrogen production costs have fallen 40% since 2015,and are expected to fall by a further 40% through 2025. It's always been the fuel of the future, the issue is with making it safe to store. $2/kg is a potential tipping point that will make hydrogen competitive in multiple sectors, including power generation and long-range shipping. 

People think we need to move to EV cars to lower Carbon Dioxide emissions is the big move we need to make, but transport only accounts for 16% of greenhouse gases. Planes cannot run off electricity or solar, they would require either nuclear power, or hydrogen to sustain travel. Maybe you might disagree here, but I think the safety concerns would make it unfeasible. For a lot of industries, especially ones reliant on forms crude oil, hydrogen may be the only feasible replacement, with its extremely high kilogram calorific value. Other viable options are Butane, Methane, and Natural Gas. 

Suppose hydrogen never took off as a fuel supply for transport. What are other uses of hydrogen? Well, key factors driving the hydrogen generation market growth include rising demand for petroleum coke in the steel industry and development in the cement and power generation industries, this all ignoring the many favourable government initiatives regarding the sustainable and green environment.

$APD not only produces hydrogen, but also have room to grow in their production of Oxygen, Nitrogen, Argon and Carbon Dioxide. They have great earnings and a P/E ratio below 40. The projected market for Oxygen is $30 Billion by 2025, for Nitrogen its about $33 Billion. Argon has a much smaller, but not insignificant projected market of $487 million by 2026, and $12.1 billion for carbon dioxide by 2027. As if that weren't enough, they also produce semiconductor materials (with a semiconductor shortage, there is a lot to gain here); natural gas liquefaction technology and equipment (I don't know much about that stuff); epoxy additives (Epoxy resins are used in Wind Turbines, Electrical systems like circuit boards. Epoxy resin market is expected to almost double in value to over $10 Billion); Gas Cabinets (It costs $4k to get a projected market size, I aint paying that shit, but for reference here's what wikipedia has to say: A gas cabinet is a metallic enclosure which is used to provide local exhaust ventilation system for virtually all of the gases used or generated in the Semiconductor, Solar, MEMS, NANO, Solar PV, Manufacturing and other advanced technologies.).

In case you're not convinced yet, lets take a look at their competitors. LINDE PLC is the the leader by market cap, with revenues of $27.24 billion annually. APD have a YOY revenue of $8.86 Billion. However, take a look at net income. Despite only making $8.86 Billion, they have a net income of $1.9 billion (a profit margin of 21.5%),while Linde have a net income of $2.5 billion (profit margin of 9%). What makes APD even better is that they have been steadily increasing their YOY profit margin. Linde rocks a P/E ratio of about 60. I think it isn't crazy to put a similar price target on APD, which would essentially double their share price. Even on a bearish case, I think it wouldn't be unreasonable to put such a prediction for this pricetag over the next 2-3 years. 

TLDR: I think this is severly undervalued. They are profitable now, but do they have room to fucking grow. As clean energy is pushed more and more, I think their earnings will grow exponentially, and I wouldn't put it past them to do it."

It has about 3x the energy content of gas, and the reach of hydrogen is far outside of transport. We're not talking about a company that might be profitable in the future, we're talking about a company that's profitable now, and will be even more profitable, anywhere from 2x to 4x, depending on whether or not you think it should have a value similar to Linde. They are the most profitable gas company in the world, with an EPS CAGR of 11% from 2014 to 2020."
2021-04-13 22:00:45,stocks,"Well hydrogen is required to make ammonia, via the Haber-Bosch Process, so there's obviously more work to make ammonia, but if ammonia was a more convenient/superior fuel to hydrogen, hydrogen plants like APD would still benefit greatly. From what I've been able to find, it seems like they also sell on the biproducts of gasification as well.
As to why I think hydrogen is superior to ammonia, I would say it all comes down to its energy content, 3x that of gas. Storage of hydrogen is obviously an issue, but APD doesn't have to worry about that. It's been pulling in positive net income for 15 years, and moving into a time where clean energy is being pushed more and more, some industries will only have the options of running off hydrogen, other natural gases with high energy content, or nuclear. I think the risk of nuclear will be far too high for many industries, hence a move towards hydrogen as a power source"

At 107% of the float, this would seem to stink of naked short selling. It also involves parties who were involved in GME naked shorting. Including Point 72 and Citadel.

These Hedge funds should not continue to get away with this. Now, they are messing with American companies that are creating valuable infrastructure and SAVING LIVES.

I dont believe they thoroughly thought this play through. They may be able to suppress the price in the short term, but a lot of the underlying companies have very positive catalysts coming and some even have potential buyouts. Eventually, they will have to come home on their shorts, and when they do, it will send the price back up.

The below have been sourced from [Fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/xbi). You can find that not only are they shorting the fund, they are also shorting the underlying stocks. Take MYOV as a prime example. A company with short positions by Citadel and a few others on the list, with FDA and EMA approval coming in the next 5 weeks for Prostate Cancer and Uterine Fibroids.

Of course, I have to add that I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. Mostly, this is looking to share this research with the community and bring it to their attention.

**TLDR**: HF's are at it again and now changing their attention to lifesaving drugs. In doing so they are almost certainly naked shorting. This all presents a future unwinding or squeeze opportunity that can be capitalized by either taking a position in XBI or the underlying companies.

**Positions**: 20k shares MYOV and 300+ Calls. No positions in XBI at this time. Considering entering over the next few days."

2021-04-14 00:00:00,stocks,"Thoughts on Applovin's IPO? ($APP) Applovin, or $APP (How on earth are these guys the first one to get that ticker?) is being listed in two days. As you can guess from the name, Applovin is a mobile app technology company that specializes in gaming apps. The name is in fact, based off of Mclovin. APP has had notable customers/acquisitions such as Spotify, Machine Zone, Opentable, and Lion Studios.

[The company is seeking a 30 billion dollar valuation](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/applovin-ipo-5-things-to-know-about-the-software-company-seeking-a-30-billion-valuation-11617836424), the mobile app market itself is 200 billion. apparently, [Applovin made 1.5 billion last year with a net loss of 145mill](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/applovin-files-for-ipo-says-2020-sales-reached-1point45-billion.html) (46% increase). Take note, this was largely due to quarantine. People were bored inside their homes and bought a lot of mobile games. I could not find anything on what they plan to do this year. On their prospectus, they claim acquisitions are a big part of their company, and on their blog there is a post about the future of mobile gaming and Virtual Reality, but thats not really saying much, especially with a shaky field such as VR. I am linking the prospectus at the bottom of the post.

**PPS: $75 - $85**

**Common Stock: 25,000,000**

**Outstanding Shares: 360,000,000**

**IPO Date: April 15th,** according to webull who sometimes get this stuff wrong, lol.

# Pros:

* Excellent company, has a lot under it's belt, acquired a lot of companies, and looks to gain more.
* Promising growth. The game applications or mobile games are a huge part of application's revenue. They make more money than other apps. [25% of all applications are games. Thats 2x more than the next biggest group, business](https://mindsea.com/app-stats/)
* Their run in 2020 was amazing.

# Cons:

* The mobile app industry is super competitive, and Applovin claiming they are worth 15% of the entire mobile app market is a little crazy.
* Notable competitors are Zynga ($ZNGA) Unity ($U) Skillz ($SKLZ)
* Last year's growth will not be replicated this year, even being stated on their prospectus.
* Reliant on a 3rd party for distribution.

&#x200B;

Personally, I think I'll buy into this one. Mobile gaming is growing, and I believe other gaming companies (nintendo activision microsoft etc...) can see that as well. I also like Applovin acquiring more companies. I don't think I'll sacrifice a large chunk of my portfolio on this one, and I don't believe I'll hold it for long. The best option for me would be to play the IPO with a trailing stop loss, sell it for profit, and rebuy in like two weeks.

What does everyone else think?

So Nvidia will have to rely on some server based tech (they claim A100 GPUs), which renders Cloudflare's Workers tech redundant at this point. 

If they do extend support to Tensorflow, they now need to rely on a C++ compiler as well, which takes away the biggest benefit (extremely fast cold start times) since you can no longer use a V8 isolate for an ML worker.

2021-04-14 07:51:21,stocks,"I think $NET has the potential to be a 3-bagger over the next 5 years. They're making big bets on the macro trends affecting the internet. They're pushing a huge serverless agenda and becoming a hosting service in many ways. Back in March, they announced this security product: https://blog.cloudflare.com/browser-isolation-for-teams-of-all-sizes/

A lot of these solutions will be necessary as industry macro trends are showing more movement of enterprise solutions to hosted, edge and cloud. If Cloudflare is correct in their bets and assuming this industry macrotrend will continue, they're further ahead of other security and hosting providers.

Additionally, they operate at 78% margins with yoy revenue growth at 50%. 
https://cloudflare.net/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Cloudflare-10-K-2020.pdf

They're a 23B company right now with annual revenue of 430M. Their P/S ratio is huge at 53, but if they can maintain their growth rate of 50% over the next 3 years (with continued focus on hosting and security) I could easily see NET touching $200 by 2025 and being a 100Bn mktcap company.

Beyond that, I think they'll have to expand into new markets to start seeing valuations pushing 10x return.

2021-04-14 07:39:00,stocks,"AMD vs NVDA isn't really comparing apples to apples anymore. It would be like comparing TSLA to GM. If you are investing in AMD/NVDA only for semiconductor, then you could try to compare their respective businesses. AMD makes most of their income from x86 CPU processors and their GPU lines.

Take a look at their 2020 annual report: https://ir.amd.com/sec-filings/filter/annual-filings/content/0001628280-21-001185/0001628280-21-001185.pdf

In section 14 under segment reporting, of the 10B net revenue they made 65% comes from computing and graphics, 33% from custom embedded. AMD doesn't break it out by segment, so its hard to tell how much is end consumer vs b2b. And how much is datacenter enterprise builds vs individual compute usage.

Now look at NVIDIA's year end report under Note 17: https://s22.q4cdn.com/364334381/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/0ec16816-55e2-4812-8f77-75cab5909247.pdfhttps://s22.q4cdn.com/364334381/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/0ec16816-55e2-4812-8f77-75cab5909247.pdf

They made 16B in net revenue with ~15B coming form three segments: Gaming, ProViz and DC. The big difference between NVDA and AMD is that NVDA is targeting enterprise data center growth. Their YoY DC space growth was 110% in 2021.

In addition, NVDA is expanding into new markets. For example, their 10K shows revenue recognition from their automotive division which includes both embedded SoC, infotainment solutions, AI driver solutions and autonomous driving solutions. AMD doesn't have an equivalent division (at least publically...) in their organization yet.

The big difference between NVDA and AMD is that NVDA has branched out into new industries and is offering software and services stacks that go on top of the hardware components they sell as their core competency. AMD seems to still be focused as a chip manufacturer while NVDA is trying to evolve into something bigger and more.


In my thoughts? NVDA is more of a growth company and with that comes risk. As long as NVDA can keep expanding into new markets and winning strong revenue in those markets NVDA is a better bet. AMD will keep chugging along as aggregate market demand for silicon and chips will increase. But their revenue multipliers will be relatively flat unless they can expand their business into new markets.

Just my 2c from having been invested in both AMD and NVDA. Personally I'm looking to exit my AMD position and only hold NVDA as my only exposure in semiconductors. Its a riskier play, but the entire stock market is about risk and risk management. I feel more comfortable being locked into NVDA than AMD at this point due to aggregate macro trends and business leadership."

2021-04-13 20:57:01,stocks,"Last time I ran the numbers between the companies NET had a 50 times sales valuation almost double that of FSLY multiple. FSLY has better Net Revenue Retention, Revenue (quarterly YoY growth) was 40.24% for FSLY and 50.04% for NET. Operating margin was -36.86 vs -25.77. EV to Revenues was 27 for fastly and 50.34 for NET. NET does have the better numbers but not substantially better that I would say it justifies double the valuation. So yes I think NET is over valued compared to FSLY, however I do own both personally and think both will be fantastic long term holds.

FSLY lost TikTok in Q4 which hurt their short term numbers but doesn’t change their long term outlook"

2021-04-14 03:48:37,stocks,Fastly tech is absolutely the best.  That's one reason I think someone might end up scooping them up.
2021-04-14 08:08:18,stocks,"I personally find it tough to compare NET and FSLY as apples to apples. I say this because as you dig deeper into the technology you realize they aren't really operating in the same space and have different target customers. It would be similar to comparing TSLA to GM.

In the TSLA vs GM argument, where they overlap is that they both make cars and are pushing electrification. But if you look at their target markets and investment fields, they couldn't be more different. GM is clearly focused only on electrification right now. They aren't even trying to spread into energy storage, self-driving Level5, etc. Their majority consumer base is truck and SUV drivers, and that market segment has shown that they aren't into the robotaxi mindset. TSLA on the other hand is committing much more research into Level5 self driving, advancements in battery manufacturing/energy density and recurring revenue subscription models around charging and software services, etc. I'm not making a comment on their comparative valuations (ie. should TSLA be worth 10x GM despite selling 1/10 the vehicles), I'm just saying that on the surface they look similar but under the hood their target markets are different.

Now comparing NET and FSLY is similar too. Firstly, NET sees themselves as a security company first. Their products all have a security focus primarily and the new products they're releasing are also security focused. Take a look at their recent product release blogs:

https://blog.cloudflare.com/browser-isolation-for-teams-of-all-sizes/

https://blog.cloudflare.com/new-cloudflare-waf/

NET also is focused on edge computing and trying to bring hosted services as close to the internet consumer as possible.


FSLY on the other hand is focused more on hosting solutions and ease of integration. They have a security offering, but I would contend their primarily focus is on hosting speed and ease of API integration. FSLY has a challenge where they are in markets pushing ""bits"". Which tends to be a low margin environment. Take Tiktok for example. Tiktok is lots of video data that has to be delivered with low latency. Hosting and pushing that amount of video bandwidth across the world is considered ""dumb bits"". There isn't much value add beyond the bandwidth hosting itself. The revenue multiplier and margins on pushing ""dumb bits"" on video host isn't much.


I think thats why you're seeing a different valuation proposal between NET and FSLY. Back in September, it seemed like these two companies were equivalent with FSLY actually being more valuable than NET. NET was trading at $38 (mktcap of 10B) with FSLY trading at $100 (mktcap of 12B). But as you can see, NET has crept ahead to a mktcap of $22B while FSLY has fallen back with a mktcap of $8B. I think this is primarily based on the future value of each of their offerings, continued margin and macro trends in the industry.

I used to be in both FSLY and NET, but back in September I opted to consolidate all my shares into NET. I know its riskier, but it was a risk I was willing to take based on macro industry trends that I personally believe in."
2021-04-14 03:47:39,stocks,"I like that FSLY is the best technology-wise, and has so few customers so for that their remaining addressable market is enormous.  

Per your numbers, do you have current rule of 40 calculations on these two companies?"
2021-04-14 00:30:18,stocks,"I believe it has to be approved by foreign governments as well i.e China, Europe, Russia, ETC. which is why I think it's unlikely although I really hope it does for those Nvidia gainz!"
2021-04-14 01:18:12,stocks,"They don't hold a monopoly, or near monopoly, over integral hardware components like NVDA would"
2021-04-14 09:37:59,stocks,Thanks for the good response. I agree it is difficult to compare them as apples to apples and it is one of the reasons why I currently own both. I believe they both have their own niche and runway ahead of them.
2021-04-14 11:26:10,stocks,"I did when reviewing a few SaaS companies.
Sales Growth % YoY vs Operating Profit % 
FSLY: 40% vs -30% = Efficiency Score of <20% 
NET: 50% vs -23% = Efficiency Score of 20-40%

Pin those numbers vs valuation:
Growth+Profit% vs EV/Sales Ratio
FSLY: GP 10% vs 26 = Score <20%
NET: GP 27% vs 54 = Score 20-40%

Like I said above NET beats FSLY in all categories but the multiple you are paying for it makes the stock extremely expensive. When you plot these on a chart vs each other they aren't far off but the valuation is way higher for NET. Both have massive runways and I own both as long term holds. I just think FSLY currently offers the better ""value"" right now for opportunity as I do think NET is very expensive. It trades at the same multiple as CRWD which is growing at revenue YOY of 74%.

Just my 2 cents though."

2021-04-14 00:00:00,stocks,"$URNM is the most risk asymmetric trade I've seen in my 4+ years of active trading Uranium miners and nuclear as a whole have been covered more and more recently across multiple finance subreddits (for good reason), so I won't bore you with the details. In a nutshell, and most recently, the second largest producer of uranium in the world announced on Friday that they were reopening the largest uranium mine in the world, despite less than ideal Covid-related issues to do so. They are doing this **not** to flood the market with cheap pounds of uranium, **but** out of sheer necessity to fulfill their existing contractual obligations on long term contracts with utilities. This is, according to mining analysts, **the most bullish indicator that the uranium bull market has begun**. In an interview last month, veteran mining investor Rick Rule has said this exact move would be proof that the rally has begun ""in earnest"":

*""If you see Cameco restart Cigar Lake, then you will know that the game is on in earnest""*

This was validated by an upgrade to $CCJ $CCO yesterday by Cantor Fitzgerald, from Hold to Buy, with boosted PT. 

Other uranium traders have echoed that this news is not only not bearish for the sector as a whole, but affirms the dire supply situation that the sector has:


""Cigar was always coming back (with estimates ranging from May - July). Timing a BIT strange given the recent COVID case at site and general negative virus headlines from Sask.  but perhaps CL workers have been given priority for vax?  **Doesn’t change S/D model much at all.**""

The price of uranium will have to go up, because unlike silver, gold, or bitcoin, uranium has a real functional use in everyday society. If nuclear reactors shutdown, you get blackouts and/or massive increases in electricity cost. These are not an option, so existing reactors will pay whatever they have to to get the fuel they need. Because ultimately, nuclear fuel is such a small fraction of the cost of running a nuclear power plant, it's never going to be a dealbreaker to shut down the plant. They will pay whatever it takes. And uranium miners will be there to sell them pounds at 100+% markup.

All the evidence I need lies in the valuations. The combined market cap of the uranium sector was around $200bn in the last bull market peak. Today, it is around $20bn. Clearly, it must go higher. Compare that with a $2 trillion crypto market cap, $700 bn $TSLA market cap, $10 bn market cap of a certain video game retailer, or [insert unprofitable company still in R&D stage of questionable future tech that is somehow still >$5 bn]. Buyer beware, but I'll take the currently unloved commodity with a very hairy supply chain that is undersupplied, relatively difficult to acquire, in demand, and is about to sell for higher prices. 

And if you think you have missed out on big gains that have happened in the past 6 months, think again. In the above video, Rick Rule said this (in Feb 2021):
*""For investors, we haven't begun to see the fireworks that you look for in the uranium market""*

And I hope this post does not get into a debate about your personal opinions about nuclear power. But in case it does, here is the newest video from Kurzgesagt (YT science channel with 14.5M subs, released today) about why we cannot afford to abandon existing nuclear power and why it is beneficial in the long run to develop new nuclear technologies. 

In short: 

 * renewables cannot do it alone and the grid is not built for 100% renewables anyway; 

 * the consequences of climate change are too severe and time sensitive, and fossil fuels replace nuclear when it is shutdown; and 

 * nuclear provides opportunity for producing more than just electricity, but also hydrogen production, process heat (industrial emissions), and thermal propulsion (maritime shipping emissions), some things renewables cannot solve anyway.


Also the public's opinion on nuclear doesn't even really matter anymore. The most important countries (China, India, Russia, EU, UK, USA (advanced nuclear only), and certain very wealthy countries in the Middle East) have already committed to building more nuclear, so atoms for peace are here to stay.

In summary, this is a long term investment in a sector that has been unloved for far too long and is now suffering from massive undersupply AND growing demand. This massive undersupply was due to happen even before COVID shutdown several of the world's largest mines, so the situation is much worse now. 

**tl;dr give yourself exposure to the sector as a whole and buy the ETFs $URNM (more of a pureplay and my personal favorite) or $URA which will each *probably* experience 5x growth from now to the peak sometime in the next 2-4 years. Don't try to time it, just buy and hold, and don't sell until valuations make sense. (Cameco >$30bn market cap)**

Disclaimer: my IRA is probably 75% uranium miners, so I am clearly bullish and not selling anytime soon. I have a couple small near term trades in the sector too."

CVE I would like to dig into a Canadian oil company called Cenovus energy, hear me out before bashing. I'm all for green energy but we're here to make money and I'm sharing my thoughts, looking for input as well. 

Cenovus announced the acquisition of Husky Energy in late October 2020, to create the third largest Canadian oil and natural gas producer. 
The transaction should be highly accretive and lead to substantial synergies, increased scale, more stable cash generation and reduced group leverage. 

Higher oil prices will allow Cenovus to reach its debt reduction target of $10-billion by year-end, removing the need to sell assets, but Mr. Pourbaix (CEO) said the company is continuing to sort its operations into core and non-core buckets.

#Standout points

* Price to book value is 0.7
* Breakeven at $36US WTI
* Annual synergies $1.2billion
* Cenovus will now have the biggest refining capacity in Canada, second biggest upgrader. 
* Oil production will be almost on par with Suncor. Going from around 450,000 BOE/d to over 750,000 BOE/D. Source: http://imgur.com/a/05ypaVc

#Saudi Arabia 

A finance ministry spokesman said the kingdom and OPEC+ have immediate and longer term views on maintaining stable oil prices ""for the benefit of all concerned"", and will continue to respond to global events and supply and demand issues in line with this objective.

Ratings agency Fitch expects a fiscal deficit of about $40 billion this year, assuming an average oil price of $59 a barrel, average oil production of 8.7 million barrels a day, and total spending of 1 trillion riyals.

The government would need prices of $76 per barrel to have a balanced budget this year, but under the current dividend policy, and as production recovers, the breakeven price could come down to around $60 a barrel, said Krisjanis Krustins, director in Fitch's sovereign team.

#Russia 

Putin a few years ago said a price of $60-$65 a barrel suited Moscow. Recently Russia would support broadly stable oil output by OPEC+ group of leading global oil producers in May

* We’re piloting methanol fuel cells at our conventional oil and gas operations to identify an efficient and reliable energy source to supplement solar power.  But what is a methanol fuel cell?
* A fuel cell works like a battery as an energy conversion device that turns hydrocarbons like methanol into electricity,” explains Ray Lambert, Emissions Management Engineer, Environmental Solutions & Systems at Cenovus Energy. “And the methanol fuel cells are being trialed as backup power for devices at several of our sites.”
Source: https://www.cenovus.com/news/our-stories/no-sunlight-no-problem-how-methanol-fuel-cells-can-help-us-reduce-our-emissions.html

* Cenovus's long-term ambition is to reach net zero emissions by 2050. This will require ongoing focus on technology solutions beyond those that are commercial and economic today. We continue to identify opportunities to participate in longer-term solutions to address emissions from our operations and beyond. This includes extensive collaboration efforts with our peers, academics, other industries and entrepreneurs from around the world.

*Between 2004 and 2019, Cenovus reduced the CO2 emissions intensity of its oil sands operations by about 30 percent.

*NOx emissions at our Christina Lake oil sands facility are about 50 percent below the regulatory threshold of 400 tonnes per year.

At its core, I think it's a great idea. The pandemic has illustrated that many schools can move to an online platform and make advanced learning both cheaper and more accessible. I can personally atest to this as I learned how to program and received a programming job as a direct result of one of these online courses. 

Here's what I know: 

- Coursera has diversified its income streams to include both direct to customer, enterprise business, and federal aid. 
- They added roughly 30.6 million users during the pandemic; while obviously this level of growth can not be maintained, i believe firmly that this will still lead to growth as a result of the 'network effect.

-They have not turned a profit yet, but their profits have grown from 184 million to 290 in 2020. However, other companies in the 'tech' industry also takes years before becoming profitable. 

-Their headquarters maintains a professional environment (a bit shallow but hey I want to at least make sure that they aren't running out of a guys garage).

2021-04-14 13:03:05,stocks,Do we have to do anything in particular? Wait until the price increases to the sale price?
2021-04-14 13:36:01,stocks,"At this point I believe it is a judgment call as to whether you think they will succeed in regulatory approval.  I’m hanging in for full price or very close to it, my hat is in the it’s going to go through ring. Just a caution, there are elements who’d want to be negative about it going through, including the short position that is no doubt out of the money, so be careful of taking anything you read at face value, including my decision."
2021-04-13 20:09:49,stocks,Have you asked this on https://economics.stackexchange.com/?
2021-04-13 22:09:21,stocks,You will lose more money waiting for a correction as opposed to picking a good investment that will ride the correction out and keep climbing. There is no indicator that can accurately predict a near term (think 1-3 months) correction. The closest thing is the yield curve inversion which historically has preceded every recession in the last 50 years by 12 months or less.

2021-04-14 11:22:39,stocks,So you are bullish on icln as a whole? I’ve lost a good amount on icln. Don’t have strictly plug. I’m wondering if I should just dollar cost average down or hold for now.

2021-04-13 22:54:01,stocks,"I am gonna throw a couple bucks in for a few shares. All these articles prior to the DPO saying that it's a $100bn company may get people jumping in as with the $250 reference price at opening values the company at only \~$46bn. 

Crypto's also hit an ATH today and keep getting ridiculous momentum, so I wouldn't be surprised to see Coinbase trade at $500 shortly."

2021-04-13 22:04:12,stocks,Honestly at $250 a pop you're better off just putting that into crypto itself.
2021-04-13 22:09:19,stocks,Buy it in a week or so.  The next big money is when they are bought out.  And it will happen.
2021-04-13 23:03:37,stocks,At its marketcap there’s no upside left (I think it will be over 100B rather quickly).  I went into $vih /Bakkt and $ftcv / eToro as plays that should rise with the tide.

2021-04-14 00:39:04,stocks,Is the projection really an opening at $250?  Where do you see the day ending?  Does it sustain or grow on day two?  I'm having trouble with this one and will watch and wait.
2021-04-14 04:15:15,stocks,There was an article (different post that was posted here) saying the IPO valuation is 100b while the actual revenue valuation is only about 18.1b SOoOooo sounds to me like it’s gonna open high and tank in the next few weeks and personally I’m a bit weary about another HYLN type situation

2021-04-14 09:12:13,stocks,I want to own coinbase longterm but today I just want to buy one share so I can say i owned it from day 1. Then I'll add more in the future once the price stabilizes.
2021-04-14 09:14:53,stocks,Who buying at 250
2021-04-14 09:56:11,stocks,I bet it's over $300 today.  Too early and too volatile for my risk appetite.
2021-04-14 10:02:58,stocks,"pre-ipo contracts are currently going for 530, already peaked at 635. That's an insane valuation"
2021-04-14 10:08:33,stocks,Did anyone else find this morning the stock was unavailable to purchase?  I tried using E*TRADE and no data was loading on $COIN
2021-04-14 12:27:36,stocks,"i was planning to pump & dump today, but seems brokers are taking all the shares for them until its no longer a good shot!"

2021-04-14 15:08:01,stocks,Tanked quick 318 now.
2021-04-13 23:08:50,stocks,"One thing that nobody seems to be focussing on is that CoinBase did not make HUGE revenue in terms of conventional ways.

The prices of Crypto really were the ones that made Coinbase the money.   If the prices of BTC and other coins were lower - Coinbase revenue would not be as high.

So if Crypto dips and the users are still buying and selling - the revenue would drop.

This is something that really should be talked about more - because CoinBase is not doing anything spectacular to be listed so high.  It's due to the Crypto - without it being Coins being valued so high CoinBase would not be worth the value they are listing at.

Don't get me wrong I am still buying...."
2021-04-14 10:52:37,stocks,"If you believe in the technology, you'd buy their tokens. Why would I buy a stock of a centralized exchange that will never perform as good as the corresponding cryptos?
If crypto fails, Coinbase fails. If crypto succeeds, Coinbase won't succeed as much."
2021-04-13 20:35:39,stocks,"Under $450-475 I’m in on it. Anything higher than that is too risky for me, I’ll wait for the the dip. I don’t think we’ll see under $450 though, would not surprise me if it hits $600-$700 tomorrow the way crypto is being hyped right now. Definitely going to be watching regardless and best of luck to whoever does invest 🤝."
2021-04-13 23:24:49,stocks,Analysts think it's overpriced so I'm expecting it to dip lower than it's debut price before buying
2021-04-14 01:31:25,stocks,"Coinbase is gonna be the Goldman Sachs of crypto. It’s a giant bank that holds other people’s coins for them, both deep storage and quick exchanges. 

They’ve never had a huge hack or anything, so I think they’re solid. I’ve got a couple ethereum on coinbase since 2017, great user interface and functionality"
2021-04-14 07:39:24,stocks,"Lol @ everyone saying $250 is way to overpriced for them, but they'll buy GME at $400 lmao!"
2021-04-14 09:24:00,stocks,"Problem is that when BTC takes a nosedive (tomorrow, next month, next year?), Coinbase shares will go right with it.  I’m waiting to buy until we see a significant downturn on BTC.

Edit:  Wow, downvotes for expressing my personal investment strategy with respect to COIN. Unexpected. 

Putting aside the fact that listings are usually a complete shit show in terms of volatility, here’s my reasoning.

COIN’s fees are based on a % of the transaction. They charge a 0.5% spread and then another 1.5-4% on top (or a flat rate charge for small transactions).  See https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/pricing-and-fees/fees. 

If the price of BTC drops, that directly affects how much the commission they get is worth in fiat. A big drop in BTC will definitely influence institutional investors’ attitude to COIN, and probably a chunk of retail investors as well, which will create downward pressure on the stock. 

I agree that such a drop wouldn’t affect the long term prospects of COIN or the value of the company/brand, which is why I’m all in on COIN after BTC goes through a significant dip. 

Best case, I get the stock on sale. Worst case, the stock price stays stable, and I buy in knowing #COIN is resistant to crypto volatility. Meanwhile, I’ll continue to average into BTC, as I have been. 

In short, buying in today, the worst case seems much, much worse than waiting, and the best case isn’t all that much better."

2021-04-13 20:53:09,stocks,Im kinda expexting the shareprice to at least go 50% in the first day. If my broker allows me ill buy in first second i can. Dont listen to me tho im stooped this is kinda Yolo and fingers crossed for crypto hype to take it there.

2021-04-14 00:36:23,stocks,Can someone please tell me how to buy it? I’m not super smart. Lol I can’t find it on any of my  brokerage apps
2021-04-14 01:46:20,stocks,By the time any of us can get in the price is going to be insane. I'm going to let it settle for a few days. Regardless this thing is going to be one of the most volatile stocks out there
2021-04-14 01:52:51,stocks,I'm going to watch the pump and dump then probably hop on in a month or so.

2021-04-14 10:29:36,stocks,"I plan to buy put options as soon as they are available at the right price. No one needed this before. What value does it bring that would substantiate it's price? What service does it provide to potential users that qualifies it for a tens of billions market cap? I see an opportunistic grab for investor cash leveraging a proven product that is someone else's product, so it's leveraging a brand that it does not own with a promise of services in a space that never demanded it. I see it as a flash in the pan for smart money to outsmart itself, and lose big."

2021-04-13 20:46:17,stocks,The fees they rely on for their revenue today won’t last as incumbents figure out ways to disrupt that model. I’m excited for them as I have friends that work there but long term I personally don’t see them growing as quickly in the future and a lot of the growth last year was due to stimulus checks and general boredom within the traditional markets.

If I hadn't sold a solid 2/3 of my remaining Ethereum holdings (on a Mnuchin crackdown rumor in December), I would have a couple extra hundred thousand to invest.

I sold the initial bulk of my Ethereum in 2019 after holding most of it from $9 USD to $1300 USD in 2017 and then seeing it crash down to below $100 (don't pity me lol, relatively-speaking I still made out like a bandit with profit taking and with my 2/3 being subsequently put into daytrading options and with a bet on GME turning into a second windfall).

I would never have sold if I did not need to pay bills and support a lavish relationship at the time.

Even now, extra money I put into Ethereum and Bitcoin because the rate of return is consistently better than any other and the trading is 24/7 and hence can be algorithmically done over the weekend and overnight.  No ridiculous Good Friday closures of the market.

My next $10k is going straight into Ethereum more than likely. I easily see it past $10k itself at some point. Still hit myself to the day for selling any as it was by far the best chance I had of unlocking the ""Multi-Millionaire"" achievement.

P.S. Ironically, never use Coinbase as an exchange. The fees are extortionate. I find Kraken so much more amenable."

There is no price set for the offering that is fixed.  An auction is run to balance the buys and sells and this may take several hours before its run.   Once this price is set, everyone gets the same price and continuous market starts. 

For rblx - 
“Shares began trading at $64.50, which represented a 43% increase from a private financing round in January, when the company sold shares for $45. The NYSE set a reference price on Tuesday of $45, though no stock changed hands at those levels. The reference price tends to reflect private market trading and does not indicate where a stock will open.”

2021-04-14 10:25:14,stocks,"I sold far more than I bought during the bear market, sadly.

Granted most of those sales were above basis (DCAing sales?), but I would prefer to have had $10,000 extra at the time Ethereum trolololed its way back down to $100 per ETH as I have always had a very firm conviction that it could easily be $1,000, $2,000, etc. especially after it had reached a high of \~$1,400 before its crash. It always seemed a far more useful technology than Bitcoin, with broader applications, but nonetheless a sibling of BTC and able to coexist with its older brother of five figure fame.

So I have not DCAed as I wish I could have. Bills, frivolous non-COVID spending (eating out is a budget killer, remember those days?), and budgeting vacations and the like ended up nom noming most of my spare monies at the time and I ended up divesting from some of my ETH (probably averaging $300-$400 per ETH and several dozen tokens) rather than accumulating (despite the fact that I was buying every other paycheck or so: it simply was a net outflow considering my sales).

And then with ugh Trump Mnuchin news that Coinbase CEO even started mentioning (nothing to do with my decision not to buy them) where the Treasury Dept had a policy about to be dropped to require verification with wallets (a death knell), I decided to sell probably 2/3 of my remaining 50 or so tokens. This was right before BTC (and then ETH) went parabolic and my sales at $700 per token on average, which were cool at the time, seemed insane in hindsight.

So I don't even like to look at the price nowadays. Too much pain.

(I still am DCAing in, but options daytrading takes up most of my buying power considering daytrading equity per account cannot drop below $25k w/o penalties and the fact that I have multiple margin accounts that need to be monitored)

tl;dr I recommend continuing to DCA in. Thinking a crash is inevitable is possibly very wrong and is kind of a bet against the tech in my mind. If you have profit taking goals, by all means take profit at some interval, but I would continue to DCA no matter what and I plan to make my next lump sum deposit into ETH/BTC as soon as I can close some substantial options positions. There are algobots for crypto as well that can help with this, but they require some learning time that might not exist unless you have access to backtesting features."

 ""Stole"" is a strong word, for people wanting your company to lose. Especially since some shortsellers were paying Tesla employees to slow down manufacturing production. Shortsellers losing money doesnt seem like a strong case to despise Elon Musk IMHO.

> He also continues to lie about his driverless software which is not functional and he lies to investors and says it's much better than it is. Tesla will never acieve fully autonomous driving and he is acting like they are days away from it.

For legal reasons tesla is very particular about what they refer to as full self-driving technology. It seems like most consumers understand this.

Its a developing technology, but why do you think it will never be functional? Its pretty functional already.

Tesla must be just as deluded to believe their own lies then, because they are making deliberate moves to have a self-driving taxi service set up."

You sit there for 5-10 minutes waiting to see what the open price is and have a second to make the decision to sell or hold before it opens again. As for Reddit stocks, sometimes they can be good. A lot of us rode the GME spikes. But also can be risky. Day traders aren’t usually trading with 5 shares. It’s in the hundreds to thousands and most of us aren’t willing to risk it on stocks that can drop $5 in 2 seconds like some of the Reddit stocks.

you said the key word there: spam.

if you asked the community, everyone would say that spam should be banned.

>What if 50% of the content on r/stocks/new was about renting out investment properties in Russia? We're just supposed to let that through?

again, a total strawman response. there's a big difference between being able to talk about what percentage of someone's money is represented by stocks versus what's in other asset classes and discussing the merits of different coin types or specific properties.

>No sorry, this is r/stocks. If you're coming here to not discuss stocks then you're on the wrong board.

which again, is completely irrelevant to the point being made. [this](https://i.imgur.com/Q46wbWp.png) is an example of what the bot has removed as ""off topic"" (and mods refused to re-instate when contacting via modmail). the enforcement is completely and utterly counterproductive.

to say that the blacklists are ""to prevent the sub from being overrun with offtopic spam"" just isn't matching up with what's happening in practice. the community would gladly tell you this, but that would involve actually listening to  the community rather than taking the ""we know what's best for you"" approach."

2021-04-13 21:04:39,stocks,"No it's not. You may want to think that all trading is scientific and sophisticated. Long term investing with the majority of your portfolio should be. Though that doesn't require DD either- just put it in an ETF that tracks the SP500 or a blue chip and leave it alone. But then there is another type of short term speculation with money that you are prepared to lose that falls into a different area. You don't have to make spreadsheets and work as a janitor for 10 years cleaning the CEOs office to make a speculative trade on a high growth stock. If we did that no one would have ever bought TSLA and would continue not to.

I am not saying DD as a blanket ""I am not gambling, I am investing"" term is completely usless. But if you don't know crap about investing to begin with, what is your DD worth? Just listen to Bogle or Buffett and go on with your life. Your ""research"" isn't going to produce anything that isn't already out there."
2021-04-13 21:18:36,stocks,"You should 100% be doing DD on growth stocks. Categorizing them as high risk so “who cares flip a coin” is a recipe for failure. I agree you can’t generally use conventional metrics like PE or PEG can be completely useless for a young company. 

However, should still be doing your homework. Look at market cap and potential opportunity, compare it to other companies in its sectors, pin it against its competitors, look at CAGR, look at more mature companies with similar fundamentals, and look at the CEO and how invested they are in. If they are tied to the growth of the company they will likely have long term outlook rather then trying to please shareholders in the next quarter. 

Please don’t be telling people DD is not needed. There is already enough naive people dumping their life savings into the market when they shouldn’t be investing."
2021-04-13 22:26:29,stocks,You can do DD for growth stocks. You can use price sales ratio and yoy growth.
2021-04-13 22:08:26,stocks,"Well we can agree to disagree before beating this into the ground, but: The problem is DD is a blanket term people like to throw out that doesn't actually mean anything to a new investor. If you mapped out the ""DD"" most people are doing versus what happens in reality, I doubt you would find much correlation at all. All single stock have an inherent degree of speculation and risk. None of us are Warren Buffet or Cathie Wood. Very few actively managed accounts by professionals even beat the SP500. Jack Bogle, who has done more primary research into the market than any new Reddit investor is going to do, would say just to put it in VTSAX and forget single stocks.

The reality is that PLTR is being bought up by ARK, getting government contract after government contract, trading near $20 a share. That makes it a decent speculative stock. I could look up stock analysis 101 and crunch some numbers that don't mean anything to me, but the former factors already tell me that I am comfortable putting money into it- money after my auto investing in VTSAX every check, after my 15% to retirement, after all my bills are paid. I feel entirely comfortable making that decision personally."

2021-04-14 10:04:47,stocks,"If the study was done properly, both the experiment (vaccine) group and the placebo group are paid and told of the study and told that they may get the vaccine or may get the placebo. So, both groups will be careful to minimize the chance of getting infected. Also if it's double blind, the persons administering the vaccine doses won't know if they are administering the vaccine or placebo.  This way they'd be sure to treat both the experimental group and the placebo group exactly the same.

The problem with the study mentioned in the market watch news or tabloid source is there are no details about how the study was done. I guess the clinic that administered the second dose of the PFE vaccine are scared they had a super spreader event at one of the sites where the second dose was administered. Those who failed to get vaccinated were not there, and didn't get infected. And they also were more careful to avoid getting infected because they know they were not vaccinated.

Until we know more about this study and how those 8 vaccinated people got infected, the vaccine should not take any of the blame for those 8 infections. It appears the clinic where those people got the second does isn't talking or cooperating in the study. I guess the clinic is afraid they will get sued.  If there is no further word, PFE maybe should do an investigation.

I don't own any of the PFE, JNJ or MDRA stocks. I just want to know if the PFE vaccine is still as good as the Madera vaccine."

I'm only trying to decide which vaccine is best to get, and what type of clinic to get vaccinated at.  I wonder if the JNJ vaccine is best because you only have to come in once to get vaccinated.  I think that vaccine clinics that make you wait an hour or so in rooms crowded with people should be avoided.  The application and appointment scheduling should be done online. Get in and get the shot and get out as soon as possible, and of course wear a mask."

2021-04-14 10:48:26,stocks,"ETFs issue shares only to Authorized Participants (i.e., market makers pre-registered with the issuer).

The AP requests more shares when the market price of the ETF is bid up above the value of the underlying basket of stocks. The AP redeems shares when the market price deviates below the underlying.

You and I can't get new shares from the issuer. We would have to be an AP, basically a broker-dealer and an investment bank. I doubt there are many, if any, hedge funds that are APs.

The only way a short can get new shares is if the short is an AP, and the mechanics of an AP also being a short-seller is a little too mind-fucky for me at the moment.

Bottom line, if the ETF does not own a large fraction of the stock in its strategy, then shorting 100% of it is like shorting a small percentage of each of those stocks, and the stress of a squeeze attempt is spread thinly by that diversification, and made laggy by the AP and issuer having to get in the middle to buy shares of stock and issue shares of the fund.

I suspect if the price of the ETF gets too far from the underlying, they just halt trade in the ETF until it can be rebalanced, or permanently (by acceleration or forced redemption) if it can't. I'd have to dig into the ETF's prospectus looking for that and I've never really thing to ask that question."

This made news not profitable, so the fairness doctrine also required a minimum amount of news by local stations.  This is why the news used to be on all the stations 2 hours a day, instead of condensed into a few stations that sell you ads and call it news.  TV stations may have not liked this, but back then the news was real, not political propaganda."

Gaming is going digital. Both new consoles have digital only editions. The writing is on the wall. 

As for the physical locations: I live by a few. They’re small stores in low traffic malls that are already failing. Not a ton of floor space for a huge PC parts, or a LAN center. Not to mention I don’t know anyone who wants to go pay a bunch of money to play LAN games when they have their own PC at home with high speed internet like they already do.

2021-04-13 20:51:58,stocks,"If it is pump and dump schemes, they aren't very successful.  Very few stocks on those low price clickbait articles ever go up from what I recall.  They just seemed like really terrible stock picks that seem doomed to go down."

2021-04-13 20:49:59,stocks,Funny timing. I just read something suggesting that you buy TQQQ with 1/3 of your money and hold 2/3 cash.

2021-04-14 13:00:37,stocks,"Right on, makes sense. We keep 6-9 months EF and every penny beyond 9+ months is invested. Sometimes I'll let it go to 6 months if there's a buying opportunity. 

Reality is as the brokerage account grows in theory I can use that as EF even if I assume it gets cuts in half so I'm even more comfortable with 6 months as time goes on."

2021-04-13 21:05:19,stocks,"The big issue was C was paying 50 cents dividend when the stock was in the $50s.  Say you picked it up through the 90s like your friend and had a really low basis. Your choice was leave your money making 4%+ in qualified dividend for tax free income, or sell, take LTCG tax on more than half the value, and reinvest a smaller amount in something paying a lower dividend. It was an impossible choice to make (mainly because the dividend was impossible for C to maintain long term).

Don’t you fucking dare ask me how I know this."

2021-04-14 01:16:50,stocks,"Given the almost irrational exuberance today we have of tech stonks that only go up, I present to you a very different perspective written by Aikya investment fund analysts on every Redditor's and his dog's darling, BABA.

Note the views below are Aikya's and not mine and should only serve to generate discussion on BABA's profitability and prospects. I'm personally vested in BABA @ 250 before chancing upon this Aikya report so would like to hear fellow Redditors views if they are worth keeping. 

Will BABA stonks ever get to the moon? According to Aikya, the upside is extremely fraught with accounting issues detrimental to minority shareholders (99.99% of Redditors). I definitely think the Aikya report is worth a read for BABA investors.

*Alibaba management justifies these  acquisitions saying that they are linked to the building of a digital  ecosystem. However, most of the businesses don’t make any money (eating  up most of the core business’ free cashflow) and claims around  strengthening the ecosystem often seem tenuous. For example, in 2015,  Alibaba invested $590 million into Meizu, a Chinese smartphone  manufacturer, which besides having nothing to do with Alibaba’s core  business also meant entry into a highly competitive space. A now  struggling Meizu needed a financial bailout from the government in 20197.  Alibaba Pictures Group, which began in 2014 as a 60% stake in  ChinaVision Group, has been another sinkhole of capital for Alibaba  shareholders. The company has accumulated $500 million in losses, after  four years in the red8.*

*Some of these acquisitions are in fact  so outlandish that Alibaba’s management team cannot claim synergistic  benefits for the core business. Consider South China Morning Post, where  Joseph Tsai was explicit about needing to control the narrative  presented on China9. Or the $192 million purchase of 50% of Guangzhou Evergrande Football Club, which appears to be a vanity project.*"
2021-04-14 05:43:15,stocks,"The S&P was $450 back at the end of 1994. If you waited for a dip then you would still be waiting. 

Waiting for a dip is such a terrible strategy for 99.9% of people. If you are among the .1% of people who can actually time the market then go for it."
2021-04-13 22:16:57,stocks,"Look at Intel, look at IBM. Intel Dominated the market but never got to the dotcom highs. IBM did great and took a decade to reach that high again, but it is lower now. Now think that most of the companies from back then don't exist anymore, a huge amount of companies dissapear over time.

Add inflation too and you'll realize averaging down is not such a certain strategy."

2021-04-14 03:15:01,stocks,A friend of mine never bought a house because he was afraid of another housing crash. That crash never happened. Today he still rents and I own a house with no mortgage. Fear can be extremely costly.
2021-04-13 21:38:52,stocks,"The risk of not investing is far more dangerous than the risk of losing money in investing.

If I were you I would go with VTI"
2021-04-14 19:09:23,stocks,"The price of $10 or $9 doesn't really matter, it's the volatility. I found it difficult to get the same kind of volatility in a $150 stock compared to a $10 stock. For a $10 stock to be up 3 percent, it only needs to go up to $10.30. For a $150 stock, it needs to go to $154.50.

I feel like a $10 stock can go to $10.30 and back, multiple times in a day, while a $150 stock doesn't normally go to $154.50 and back multiples times in a day."
2021-04-14 19:12:33,stocks,any thoughts on HYLN ?
2021-04-14 19:14:02,stocks,Haven’t looked into it.
2021-04-14 08:25:44,stocks,WTF - why isn’t my portfolio at an ATH?
2021-04-14 09:44:00,stocks,I bought puts on riot because I believed it was overvalued when it was around its high. I bet heavily on it because in their SEC flies it states that there was a high risk of them getting shut down by the government
2021-04-14 10:22:34,stocks,"Every company puts risks like that in their SEC. They are legally bound to do that otherwise they could get sued by shareholders. Technically that is a risk for any company, just not high. If you read Tesla’s risks in their SECs 99% of them sound like they would never happen but they gotta put it in there anyway"
2021-04-14 11:56:02,stocks,"What I’m not understanding is if money supply goes down as you are saying, how is that the same as the fed “adding liquidity”? Sounds like decreasing liquidity from the system"
2021-04-14 14:27:21,stocks,"Cash in public hands goes up. That enhances inflation temporarily, when it is needed because deflation is a risk.

But because of the debt balancing the cash, the bump in cash doesn't create a sense of permanent increase in cash. So the intentional inflationary pressure doesn't compound itself.

Later, as the loans are paid or sold, cash goes down. That happens when the economy is growing, which could cause inflation.

The Fed is using the mechanism to offset natural fluctuations."

2021-04-14 16:37:24,stocks,"So in a nutshell, fed adding liquidity means increasing money supply and circulation through buying MBS/treaturies/bonds . They later decrease liquidity when the loans/bonds are paid off from the system back to the feds. I was only asking about what the “adding liquidity” part meant so correct me if I’m wrong."

2021-04-13 22:13:28,stocks,"Thanks! yeah, you're right, it can be tempting but i dont want to do it. I hate how US brokers are required to do this however in the UK, with some brokers, you can pattern day trade with just £1!!! imagine that! oh well, thats Finra's rule on that for US brokers unfortunately.

2021-04-14 05:47:46,stocks,"Idk everyone on here called me a bag holder last year, Goldman Sachs predicted 0% growth and I returned ~22% by just buying index funds throughout the year and throughout the dip. I get that it’s not an exact science, but if they predict 0% and the stock market returns 16%, that’s embarrassing. 

I’m gonna just keep buying and hope for the best lol. If you know a guy who actually can time the market let me know and then we’ll talk."
2021-04-14 11:08:28,stocks,"Gotta zoom out to big picture RSI with these slow movers, on the 3yr it isn’t overbought yet, but nearing those levels. On the 3yr once it becomes overbought, it is always a breakout."
2021-04-14 07:07:48,stocks,Not an investment fund as such.  The facilities are equity lines of credit funding.  They receive shares up front for 'services' sell them into the market and use those proceeds as their investment into the Companies.

2021-04-14 16:18:19,stocks,"That's funny. I got my gf to put 50% of her 200k into 2 very different Vanguard ETFs, one US growth fund and the other more focused on foreign tech. So for the 1st 3 months the US growth fund was outpacing the overseas one 2 to 1 and so she asked me to get rid of it. I told her that yes, NOW the US fund is earning higher but to wait 5 minutes. Two days later the US markets began their sizeable correction ( 4 weeks ago) and all of a sudden the fuzzy ferners was making 5 to 1 over the US. Moral of the story? Fuck if I know but they are both above 4% to date on the year beginning 1/29/21"

2021-04-14 02:20:11,stocks,"The list is quality of healthcare, not access to healthcare. Which by the way, overregulation reduce access to healthcare because hospitals end up spending 1/4 of their entire budgets on being compliant, which drives up costs. 

Are you really trying to deny that physician burnout is a thing in the US because of things like coding? Sheesh man, I'm not making this stuff up. Just do some research. If we elected Bernie Sanders as president and had socialized medicine, we would still have physician burnout and too much money being spent on compliance vs healthcare quality. It would literally do nothing to improve quality."

2021-04-13 22:42:12,stocks,"Well if I were 18 I would set up a Roth IRA like many on here have said and depending on your risk tolerance put 50-80% of my money in there. Buy 2-3 ETFs large or mid cap growth with a low expense ratio less than 1%.

With the money that’s left buy 60% BTC and 20% ETH and %20 2-3 smaller coins of your choosing.
