2021-05-17 19:04:12,stocks,"Tesla approach  ( only cameras and no lidar and he mapping for safety reasons ) is not very promising. Elon didn’t even reach 10 Procent of his promises, mentioned 6 years ago. I would not bet that we will ever reach full autonomous L5.I would definetly buy Intel (mobileeye) or Google (waymo, leading in this field). Nvidia  is also a Good buy."
2021-05-17 19:21:41,stocks,IDRV because no one can pick the exact company that will succeed so I rather buy the parts that everyone will use
2021-05-17 19:33:34,stocks,Is your chinese stock Autonavi? Or Baidu
2021-05-17 19:54:49,stocks,"one thing to keep in mind is L3 is not claimed because it comes with legal issues. Also don't look at that chart as a linear model, it will be exponential when L2 and 3 is confidently secured with it's vast amount of data.

What I look at is the approach to solving Autonomous Driving and who has technology that scales in cost and manufacturing. No one else is trying vision based, either Tesla will achieve it or they will partner and license their tech with another player."

2021-05-17 18:46:29,stocks,"good choice. but given Huawei is already has its owm HarmonyOS for its self driving car. Do you think Apple / Google will come up with their own OS for ev?
I do agree Cyber security will be huge issue in the future. BB QnX  will be even more relevant at that time"
2021-05-17 18:47:47,stocks,"Can you elaborate more? security issue, infrastructure, or politics ...?"
2021-05-17 18:55:47,stocks,"I agree safety is the most concerned area ( human lives are invaluable), but BAIC is recently release its own L4 ready ev.
 ( they claim its L4 but need more testing proves)

If you watch the video, the car drives like an normal, average experience driver

The car performs performs very well, given the road condition and how hectic people are moving ( spawn out of nowhere)"
2021-05-17 19:56:37,stocks,"I am not clear about this. You are saying self driving car causes more death so attorneys get more money. 

I think it is the other way around, mass self driving car will have less death, eventually drive car attorneys and car insurance companies out of business"
2021-05-17 19:15:13,stocks,"Agree on this. Tesla tries to cut corners here and go without HD map + Lidar. He is betting on powerful CPU specialized in FSD in the very near future. I respect him, but I think he goes the wrong way."
2021-05-17 19:38:46,stocks,"LKCO. They are partnering with BAIC, L4 already. They will be removed from DoD Black list soon so I'm very bullish in this stock"
2021-05-17 19:52:51,stocks,Even Chinese cars have Lidar.
2021-05-17 18:53:07,stocks,Apple without a doubt will. They want to integrate everything into their own ecosystem and that’s what Apple does.
2021-05-17 19:09:18,stocks,"The primary issue is that of software liability.  It could be argued that the only reason the USA didn't end up in the same cold war dead end the Soviet Union experienced is because it had transitioned to development of software.  Why?  Software in inherently deflationary and offsets and inherently inflationary monetary policy.  One of the key components to this dynamic is the exemption of software from any sort of legal liability.  

When software is employed in a manner that makes life or death decisions for human beings on a daily, common man level, that liability exemption will evaporate.

Beyond that, there's this fundamental failure of understand what is being ""disintermediated"".  Float.  That is what is being disintermediated.  There is a *remarkable* percentage of capital market investment that comes directly from insurance industry float.  Removal of that float will be devastating for the capital markets.

...but more importantly, what people really fail to understand is that the combination of those two factors is completely non-linear.

So, none of the proposed ""security, infrastructure, politics"".  Economic."
2021-05-17 19:59:29,stocks,No I am not saying that -- there already has been two killed in a Tesla car in Texas with no one was driving ... big law suit ... more will follow. Irresponsible.
2021-05-17 19:24:02,stocks,"Its not like the hardware is that impressive. This is just a ASIC chip with 144 Tops. The new Hw.4 will be 3 times faster \~ 400 Tops.

Nvidia already release their latest SoC chip called Orin with 1000 tops and150 W consumption (same as the Hw.3).  I would definetly not bet on Tesla in this case. But the main reason we will never reach L5 is not because the hardware is too slow it it because, we need to solve the ""general AI problem"" first in order to reach Fully autonomous driving. Also his bullshitting about Lidar is very childish.  Why do you think (even the chinese) is including lidar in their setup with cameras? Its just for security reasons. I would be surprise if FSD would ever reach L3.."
2021-05-17 19:09:39,stocks,"I do think Apple has very strong potential,  if not the strongest player. They have software and hardware fully integrated, top notch battery for their devices. But there are a couple of caveats here:
1. Apple has not annonced which conventional Auto maker it will partner with ( can be in-house, but will cost more money and time in short term)
2.AI technologies will be inferior to Google and Tesla ( Google has Waymo at L4 in Phoenix, AZ. Tesla has tested self-driving large scale decage ago)
3. FSD car requires a very powerful CPU ( can bypass that with 5G, but that will push the bar very high to telecom company, and you know most of them sucked). In short amount of time (2-3 years), can they compete with NVDA in this field?"
2021-05-17 19:34:51,stocks,"So your points are:
1. Software has no capabilities of choosing who will die or live in a near-sighted accident situations. - Legal issue.
2. Switching too fast to self-driving will destroy a piece of chains in capitalist economy (insurance industry will be slinmed), which can collapse the economy partially.

To encounter point 1, I think we can eliminate human driving in the near future. By using central HD spatial data and install more IoT sensors ( geo fence, smart traffic control), we can achieve near 100% non human driving. The 5G will be crucial here. But there will be way less traffic, less accident, less death). With enough proves ( death rate statically), most of us will switch to full self driving car if it is free.

To encounter point 2, I think car insurance companies do not contribute to the growth of society. If I remember correctly, they even lobby the lawmaker to mandate this driver must have insurance law. Most of the car insurance is leeches, they go full internet already, they don't promote local job growth

If I miss any of your point, please correct me"
2021-05-17 19:51:06,stocks,"Do you mind elaborating more on the general AI problem?

Tesla has been on L2 for a long time. Their most current tech is just enhanced L2. Full self driving is very misleading term."
2021-05-17 18:07:18,stocks,"If the Fed tapers or changes its rate hike expectations from the original 2023 plan, there would be a significant decline in growth/rate sensitive stocks. What we’ve seen the past couple months is nothing compared to what would happen if the Fed actually surprised us with rate hikes. 

I don’t think most people are fully grasping how bloated some of these growth names STILL are even after the 15-30% declines we’ve seen recently. Many are still at 25-50x sales because I guess investors still trust the Fed will stick to the plan. 

The “buy the dip” mentality might not be the best idea right now IMO."
2021-05-17 19:42:47,stocks,There is a possibility increased inflation will have political fallout that limits Biden's plans.  It will buttress arguments against the spending free-for-all that is already making some people uncomfortable.  If the infrastructure bill is not as large as expected then that will affect stocks.  It will also dampen the wealth effect from those with increased savings and lower debt; people don't feel as well off when prices are rising.  Some of the recovery plays may not be as strong as we hope.
2021-05-17 19:11:19,stocks,I thought the stocks plummeted because the big funds didn't believe the fed won't be raising rates. If so I believe that news is priced in already.
2021-05-17 19:59:38,stocks,"I saw something that basically says inflation wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for used car prices ie semiconductor shortage.  with that in mind, the shortage is probably transitory and inflation levels may not actually be that bad"
2021-05-17 17:48:51,stocks,"expected reaction: growth stocks plummet, tech has a pullback until they reconfirm they're money printers

unlikely but possible reaction: market moves higher on that news because everyone feels relieved"
2021-05-17 19:59:34,stocks,"I would be shocked if he said they are raising rates.  He said over a year ago that they were going to let inflation run hot, that it would temporary, and they wouldn’t make any changes unless they saw something both worrisome and repeatedly.  He’s going to say what he’s been saying."
2021-05-17 18:48:04,stocks,I loved seeing posts asking “should I buy the dip” like buddy did you try zooming out to the 6 month chart???
2021-05-17 18:16:55,stocks,Feels so much like 2000 and 2007 it isn't funny. I'm long oil stocks and they are absolutely crushing it.
2021-05-17 18:56:16,stocks,At this point im gonna feel relieved when they finally announce the rate hike. Feels like that narrative needs to end.
2021-05-17 17:30:32,stocks,Look up after hours and pre market. The market is never truly closed.
2021-05-17 17:58:09,stocks,That's the price volatility in that time period. Wicks tell you things. The type of candle tells you things. Same candle means different things depending on previous candles. Body size tells you things.
2021-05-17 17:14:44,stocks,"You’ll never see a common stock reach that price, they will do splits long before it gets anywhere near that. Also most companies market value prevents them from constant growth, they will all cap out at some level."
2021-05-17 16:55:59,stocks,They’ll do plenty of stock splits before then so the price will never get that high.
2021-05-17 17:38:57,stocks,How about diversify to real estate?
2021-05-17 16:58:55,stocks,"As long as the greater tech market keeps growing, yes. If it fails to grow at the same rate or shrinks, no. No way to tell what it’s going to do with any degree of certainty, but a bet on SPY is a bet on our own country. If our economy starts shrinking, we are going to have all sorts of problems, and I honestly don’t know a good hedge against it, other than investing overseas.

The biggest uncertainty right now is the value of the dollar and if uncertainty in the USD will negatively affect the market. Will this trigger another correction, a recession, or nothing at all? Nobody knows for sure."
2021-05-17 18:06:40,stocks,"im assuming you mean spx but even then, the math doesnt check out cause its about 16k

spy is currently at 416 and with a 7% compounded growth, that brings a share price of 1.6k (and this is a bit conservative, I'd go for 10%)"
2021-05-17 19:55:58,stocks,No. 7% is not likely. The equity risk premium + risk free rate = est 5% now. 7% is based on old numbers.
2021-05-17 17:31:33,stocks,BRK.A entering chat
2021-05-17 19:29:28,stocks,yeah but will 7% continue for 60 years is my question boiled down
2021-05-17 17:44:55,stocks,Real estate is a lot more expensive to invest in
2021-05-17 19:30:48,stocks,yeah i mean I have to agree its hard to see that far ahead if 7% will happen forever.  I saw Vanguard published on article that instead of 7% we could see 5 or 6% as the new norm for economy growth by SPY at some point.
2021-05-17 19:28:07,stocks,I think my math is correct.  1.07\^60 = 57.  57 times current SPY price puts that at over 24K a share.
2021-05-17 17:43:42,stocks,"AMZN in 1-2 decades as well, unless they do a split (they won't)"
2021-05-17 18:17:12,stocks,If you think Berkshire is a common stock that’s on you 😂😂 most of us only dream of buying 100 shares of that!

2021-05-17 19:46:08,stocks,"I’m sure once we have the pandemic behind us things will go back to normal, until the next black swan event. And then once we have that one behind us, it will be back to normal until the next black swan event."
2021-05-17 19:39:59,stocks,ah i read 20 not 60
2021-05-17 18:17:42,stocks,"They’ve already been considering a split, or at least are rumoured to be."
2021-05-17 16:51:43,stocks,"if youre investing in the long term, don't bother

you'll sleep better

when you read on the news the market is down 15% from its high, you can log in to buy more"
2021-05-17 16:53:31,stocks,"Your mental health definately benefits from it. Especially on red days, looking at your portfolio constantly can be very toxic."

2021-05-17 17:17:40,stocks,"I feel like with COVID and working from home, lots of us have been looking for excitement in the market and we had the initial euphoria but now we are seeing the downturn and the bad effects from it. I took a couple weeks off earlier this year after a big L and it has helped me readjust my priorities. If you are bagholding some shit stock that is just constantly on your mind, consider just letting it go because it's not just overpriced stock you are holding its emotional baggage as well. I let go of some bags that I didn't have deep conviction in and I felt a lot better afterward. albeit a little poorer.

Just set some price alerts in case something crazy happens and you need to adjust. Otherwise, if you need a break, delete your apps for a few weeks and clear your head. Also stay away from the investing sites."
2021-05-17 18:47:39,stocks,"Takes some time, but eventually you’ll just stop caring. 

I opened my brokerage in January, and would check constantly, now I’m checking way less frequently."
2021-05-17 16:58:09,stocks,Same boat 😂😁👍
2021-05-17 18:51:02,stocks,"I wouldn't bother checking your portfolio unless you have dry powder to deploy. Keep up with the news, so you know if your investment thesis has changed, but daily/weekly fluctuations are just noise."
2021-05-17 18:35:00,stocks,"Don’t invest anything you aren’t willing to lose. If you are willing to lose it, you can take a break from checking on it. 

The real big balls move is to buy leap call options and not check on them until 60 days before expiration.

The most diamond handed of all are the dudes who straight delete their trading apps and opt for the paper statements."
2021-05-17 17:41:16,stocks,"Benefits? mental health stability for one. Stressing about that everyday is not good for you. Especially if you feel confident on your picks.

Checking back after a few weeks and seeing it higher than you expected is an amazing feeling. You dont get that if you check it everyday and watch it slowly move up.

Its honestly liberating to know you have made good solid choices and dont have to watch it like a hawk everyday. If your choices are good, you wont be coming back to a massacre, and if it is lower, you know its only temp.

There is a bit of an addiction going on when you see it go up or down everyday. You become a lot more emotionally invested in it, and it hurts more when you see red on it, even if that red is only temp. 

Not watching it for weeks lets you get some distance, clarity, and you arent as attached or feel the pain as acutely when it goes red. Its a lot less stressful to look back after a few weeks, see it had gone red, and then back to green. - All while you had no idea. Its reassuring and confidence building. Red doesnt hurt when you see it from that point."
2021-05-17 17:01:51,stocks,"Definitely long term and have been buying dips and the dips of the dips. I think there is a point where I will stop and just keep in mind my long term horizon. 

Not to the point of not sleeping, just puts me in a negative mood some days - but I'm aware if I keep at it, it might get to that point.."
2021-05-17 16:53:03,stocks,What a wise man.
2021-05-17 17:00:34,stocks,"Its painful but its not keep me up at night. Just day after day after day, I can feel it putting me in a negative mood. Despite my convictions and research... I guess people are right when they say emotions are a big part of investing. I see what they mean."
2021-05-17 16:59:21,stocks,haha I'll try this maybe think of doing the same!
2021-05-17 18:19:17,stocks,Solid advice. Will try it for sure.
2021-05-17 17:01:49,stocks,100% Agree 👍
2021-05-17 16:54:26,stocks,All of my (five) stocks were up today. I think the simulation is glitching.
2021-05-17 18:52:55,stocks,"Was all green today!   


Inflation fears are overblown, media/people/twitter needs something negative to hold onto.

2021-05-17 17:16:26,stocks,Nice pump attempt. But most of us have already done our research and decided to avoid coin at all costs. It won’t be going anywhere worthwhile.
2021-05-17 16:41:41,stocks,"Insiders dumping. Private offering today not even one month since IPO? Very bearish indicators here

2021-05-17 16:59:23,stocks,"DPO insiders have to sell or there is no market.

They did a sr con note for 2026 so that would be a practically 0% interest and dilution at worst would happen if coin was booming at worst worst coin loses everything and everyone loses so no added down side by doing this but they get 1.5B in liquidity.

2021-05-17 18:40:27,stocks,"I really don’t think it is overvalued considering it’s market positioning (11% crypto market share, only publicly listed exchange) and exponential growth.

2021-05-17 16:37:49,stocks,"There are ton of things, but here are couple:

1. Core business. Do you understand it and what could affect it. I’d suggest to stick with things that you have knowledge on.

2. Financials. Look at revenue, net income, free cash flow and margins. See how they’ve developed during the years.

3. Balance sheet. A very important factor to account. A healthy company has a solid balance sheet with a good war chest and a controlled debt. Look at D/E and quick ratio. For numbers 1,  2 and 3 you should read 10-Q and 10-K forms.

4. Moat. Does the company have an advantage in their market. Do they have a strong brand like Apple or do they hold a significant market share like Microsoft has with Windows.

5. Management. This is a very underated one. When investing in a company, you are essentially giving your trust for the company’s management. A good company with a bad management can lead to very bad things. A good C-suite will maintain solid future growth if they do their job well."

2021-05-17 15:43:14,stocks,"My portfolio is probably about 40% of Microsoft and Apple. I sleep very well, but some diversification is needed to more riskier plays. I’m willing to hold them for many years to come."
2021-05-17 15:50:02,stocks,20% of my portfolio is in $AAPL and I have over a 400% return on it
2021-05-17 18:27:54,stocks,90 percent of my portfolio is AMZN and I sleep like a baby
2021-05-17 15:50:25,stocks,Is this some type of MAGA joke?
2021-05-17 16:26:57,stocks,I’d sleep fine as they are quality companies but I doubt this outperforms going forward.  A decade of ultra low interest rates is a huge driver of returns on these names.
2021-05-17 16:37:22,stocks,"I sleep fine having 4 companies that aren’t these...I feel google has the fairest price right now..
I mean volatility doesn’t equate to losing money..no reason to lose sleep unless you have 4 stocks you didn’t research well.."

you could do better"

2021-05-17 15:47:08,stocks,"Wouldn't bother me at all. 

Though having tesla as 100% of my portfolio probably wouldn't effect my sleep in any way either... so that probably says something more about my personality and risk tolerance than it does about anything else."
2021-05-17 16:02:43,stocks,Well.
2021-05-17 16:02:58,stocks,If your time horizon is that long and you seriously plan on holding it then regardless of what stocks you pick I'd say probably a good 80-90% of them will have positive returns barring the company going bankrupt.

2021-05-17 18:27:28,stocks,"I sleep like a baby with 82% of my portfolio in OTC micro cap oil miner, RECAF, and 5% more in OTC Helium miners HLOGF and RHCCF. 

So honestly I would probably lose sleep over the amount of profit I would be leaving on the table by being all in on low growth blue chips, thus guaranteeing I have no chance of retiring early."
2021-05-17 15:44:48,stocks,"I feel like I would sleep well at night, not worried about losing, but the growth is pretty much gone in those companies at this point.  You might see 10% year over year, which is excellent but not life changing.  It'll soon be like your grandpa investing in General Electric, solid, but not spectacular.  So, maybe go 75% in and shoot for the stars on the other 25%."
2021-05-17 16:08:14,stocks,Someone did a quick analysis of tracking the return of the top 3 market cap companies over the past 20 years.  And just those 3 companies (it changes over time) beats the S&P
2021-05-17 16:32:25,stocks,Yeah 20 may be pushing it.  I think the world will end by then.

2021-05-17 16:33:20,stocks,So what companies will outperform GOOGL AMZN and MSFT??
2021-05-17 16:57:27,stocks,What 4 companies?
2021-05-17 16:21:04,stocks,We're talking 5 to 10 years at least.  Get out your lube.
2021-05-17 16:31:17,stocks,Msft amzn googl?  YES!!!
2021-05-17 16:30:35,stocks,Maybe. Maybe not.
2021-05-17 16:28:50,stocks,The return on the faang stocks won't be great?  Lol ok.  Those companies pull the weight for the entire market.
2021-05-17 18:34:16,stocks,"Recently youd be sleeping about 34% worse...

I kid. Sorta. I took a bath on EV stock XL by overholding past its merger. What % loss is a $21 free fall to $6?

2021-05-17 17:06:39,stocks,I bought 100 share when they were trading near $25. I am going to hold on to them till I retire
2021-05-17 19:02:20,stocks,"Any growth company suffers from multiple compression as interest rates (on gov. and corporate bonds) increases, because it means that lower-risk investments are paying better than they used to, relative to more risky investments (i.e. companies where most of the earnings are in the future). 

Similarly, multiple expansion is a partial explanation for the explosion in growth names we saw following the covid crash, as interest rates plummeted -- increasing the relative value of those future earnings. 

With regard to Apple specifically, it actually has $130B in debt. It took on this debt because the interest rate is low, so it can use this money to buy back its own shares, on the assumption that its earnings will grow much faster than the interest rate on that debt. This allows Apple to increase its earnings per share, even through years where its earnings don't increase much (between major phone cycles, for example), with minimal financial risk. If interest rates increase significantly, Apple will no longer be able to employ this strategy."

2021-05-17 19:03:51,stocks,Redfin and Amazon are worlds apart from one another.
2021-05-17 17:07:44,stocks,I was thinking this thing myself. We have OpenDoor and OfferPad along with Zillow doing it so why not RDFN ? I’ve been watching these since I sold my house to OfferPad. Hottest thing out there but only until new homes sales slow that’s the main reason to do it because they let you live in your house rent free and give the builder the go ahead to build without having to sell your home
2021-05-17 14:31:50,stocks,"Lol, they've been around since 2002, every healthy company is always growing. The idea is to understand what the R&D is being tailored toward to understand its potential."
2021-05-17 18:16:56,stocks,I really wanted to sell my house to Zillow but they understandably low balled me because they didnt see my vision. I eventually sold it for $300K over Zillow's offer.

2021-05-17 14:51:55,stocks,"5% YoY growth in Q1 2021 while revenue in 2020 was stagnant compared to 2019 due to covid. So in 2 years 5% growth, which is pretty bad compared to competitors (and for any growth company for that matter).

2021-05-17 17:06:10,stocks,Own 300 shares and thinking about picking more. Looking at entry price seeing where this is going to go.
2021-05-17 19:52:15,stocks,Paysafe is a company that handles payments on the darker side of the internet that PayPal doesn't want to get involved with. They mainly manage payments for gambling and porn. Not sure this is a good thing
2021-05-17 14:32:57,stocks,I can see PSFE getting to 20 by end of December let's get this 💰
2021-05-17 17:49:10,stocks,I averaged on down to $13.49 after earnings. Now I'm digging my heels in.
2021-05-17 15:57:17,stocks,"I tend to agree with this.  I bought in the day the merger was announced.  Rode it all the way up and then down.  Held it until I saw the earnings growth on first report after merger and decided to sell.  I think it is a solid company, but it really isn't showing much in the way of growth.  Yes, I know the gaming and sports betting angle- but show me the money.  

I sold mine for a small loss after holding it for months...around 12.  Bummer.

I'm keeping it on my list and will look to re-enter if it hits the 7s or 8s."
2021-05-17 18:18:36,stocks,This
2021-05-17 14:35:46,stocks,I do plan on holding long term as gaming and gambling should be huge growth drivers. I guess we will see once the NFL returns and we see q3/q4 results.
2021-05-17 14:29:31,stocks,"I think it goes to $80. I wish I had gotten in earlier. It was on my list but I just never did my DD in time. I guess I could still go in a little, 30% isn’t nothing."

It varies by company somewhat, though. Quick glance at charts, I'd like Delta over Southwest right now. Plenty of upside to its previous trend.

That is not an exhaustive DD so please y'all don't argue with me about the details.

I have a little in JETS just to see what happens, but I made some good gains earlier this year with SKYW."

2021-05-17 13:50:28,stocks,"Yes it would be affected but not because they’re shorting it - it would have an effect because they’re trading ~10% of the total value traded in a given day.

Market doesn’t care if you’re short selling or selling. Selling a significant chunk of volume will make the price go down.

It also depends HOW they trade it. They could easily just bat it down if they want but usually they’d want to decrease their impact in the stock so they’d trade it as a % of volume or VWAP it - or try to place a block with another buyer."
2021-05-17 13:57:28,stocks,"In the near term, yes - because you are selling the stock that you borrowed. 

Longer term, maybe - because at some point you have to buy shares to cover your short sale. So you really hope there are shares available at a favorable price to buy - otherwise you just got squeezed."
2021-05-17 13:51:26,stocks,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe you're asking if a stock is shorted will  the result be that the price comes down... 

Short answer : yes.

Short selling stock has the same effect as people who own the stock selling their position and leaving the stock altogether. Granted you need a sufficiently high volume of people shorting the stock to push the price down, but it is very possible to push prices down as a result of shorting. 

 short positions are taken in companies when the belief is that the stock price / market capitalization is too high compared to its fundamentals or other trading strategy of the short seller"
2021-05-17 17:57:14,stocks,selling aapl short for 1b yes that would move the stock for  2-3% roughly but the play would be on the volatility of the calls.

2021-05-17 14:01:09,stocks,I guess it’s a tactic they can use to save their quarter and worry about at the start of the next Q
2021-05-17 13:54:51,stocks,Thanks! It was a question that has been on my mind for a while and it seems messed up that even if you don’t own the stock you can sell it and affect the companies stock price but I guess since you’re still taking on risk it is fair lol
2021-05-17 14:05:28,stocks,But they do that at the request of clients - and if they’re trading balance sheet it’s their job not to impact the stock. It’s not being sneaky/tricky it’s them providing liquidity without market impact. As a retail investor that’s what you want otherwise anytime one of the big HFs wants to buy/sell a portion of their large positions the market would be super volatile
2021-05-17 13:47:47,stocks,Why was the price once over $6000?

I am a little worried about the past bankruptcy and the company they just acquired was in bankruptcy itself. The past bankruptcy is the reason they had no debt.

They issued a bunch of shares to make this deal so i want to see a share buyback program.

Also the gas/oil ratio is a little too light on the oil side, nat gas has just been in the shitter for so long its hard to see a significant rise in nat gas margins any time soon

2021-05-17 13:29:48,stocks,I wouldn’t recommend it. You’re in a great position for your age with lots of time before retirement. Maybe consider directing new contributions to your TD account rather than wiping out your Betterment.
2021-05-17 13:54:39,stocks,"If you stuck everything into the S&P 500, you would not outperform, it would be market perform.

2021-05-17 17:09:02,stocks,Diversification has a potential to decrease risk without decreasing the reward. Owning 10-30 companys is a sweet spot in my opinion and having some short positions in companys you have a high conviction of being overvalued. This will decrease your market beta and decrease overall market risk. You should also learn a little bit about options because you own more than 100 shares you can sell cover calls and make some sweet premium and decrease your overall cost basis of your Apple shares.

I personally considee the index fund one of the greatest modern tools for improving wealth for the lower and middle class. 

The whole idea is to not be required to pour countless hours into becoming financially literate/a good investor. Calling it a ""quick buck"" is kind of false since index is also the lower benchmark any active investor compares (or should compare) themselves to."

Fitch Ratings expects the rally in China’s steel price to slow in coming weeks as summer approaches, as the season tends to see lower downstream demand due to subdued construction activity. However, a combination of high iron ore prices and new environmental regulations that limit supply are likely to keep the steel price elevated. We expect this to benefit larger steel producers that have environmentally compliant facilities and are more resilient to the production cuts"

Last earning made me double down even though GAAP loss did not do them justice but they have to take it for tax purpose.   Huge potential but also very high risk.  They do have a MOAT, a patented yeast fermentation that acts like a machine that makes a molecule and they have scaled 17 so far.  Some of them they are selling 50-100 million per molecule.  A lot of their products like Biossance has been selling well with good revenue growth.  

Management is a little bit iffy though with Melo history of over promising but under delivering.  Their clean oil flopped but they have a huge backer Doeer.  If they manage to execute this though especially the new plant in Brazil, the upside is huge .  So I would say that with a better balance sheet now, this can be a potentially a multibagger."

2021-05-17 15:16:29,stocks,"Costco is better because it has more growth potential and targets both consumers and businesses. It has a strong loyal base and they are in consumer retail which is fairly stable.

SNE is too fickle for me. Their electronic products have been generally overpriced and not better than generic brands since the 90s. Their rep is in the gutter outside of Playstation. Though I like the PS brand you need to remember that consoles are slim margins (not really profitable). The real profit is in the software, not the console, so it will come down to releases and oh yea, there has been a lot of consolidation happening. For example, MS bought Bethesda, etc. Also I think that the aging gamer demographics are pushing people back to PC (Gen-X being the 1st to shift back) and there is a ton of pressure coming from cloud based gaming consoles by companies like MS, Google and Amzn and, of course, mobile. So no one really knows where Sony is going to be 20 years from now.

Target is modeled to be a more upscale Walmart with slightly higher prices. In my experience, they are not more upscale. Further, some Walmarts, like the super Walmarts near me, is much nicer than any Target and I much prefer the Walmart grocery stores to Target with their limited food section. But thats just me."

2021-05-17 16:14:04,stocks,">I think the PS5 might be somewhat priced in

May I ask how you figured it's priced in? Would be super interested to hear your thoughts considering, Sony's stock is already fairly cheap.

With a P/E ratio of 11 (ttm) it's among the cheapest entertainment/electronics stocks on the market. Forward P/E is higher, but still is pretty low at 17. Worth noting that they're usually quite conservative their guidance.

With a neutral to bearish DCF analysis the intrinsic value of their stock is about $105. That's just what you get when using last year's earnings as base year, plugging in 0% revenue growth forever and 10% net profit margin forever, 7% discount rate and taking into account their $20B in net cash on the balance sheet.

If Sony is just able to grow their music business, gaming and image sensor business at average market growth rate then that should give Sony a significantly higher DCF valuation already.

>I’d go with Microsoft as they are more diversified than Sony.

You can't really go wrong with Microsoft, it's hard to think of companies in its segment that have a stronger moat than Microsoft. But from a valuation point of view, Sony is without a doubt a much more attractive stock imho. If you attribute less importance to valuation and more importance to the long-term robustness & profitability of the business and the moat, then i'd say Microsoft is a better & safer investment imho. Not really sure why you brought specifically Microsoft into this comparison as they're completely different businesses though.

Sony is also very broadly diversified considering it's a conglomerate consisting of several core businesses: image sensors, gaming, music, movies/TV, electronics and insurance. That's some very broad diversification and it has a strong moat in image sensors, music and gaming."

2021-05-17 00:00:00,stocks,"US or Canadian Dividends US or Canadian dividends as a Canadian?

Hi there I have a dilemma I need help on. I have some money to invest upwards of 50-100k for dividends stocks from recent riskier investments and I’m just wondering what is the better option in terms of yeild with the tax on American dividends being larger. One company is Canadian EIT.un. Great company, 10-11% yeild right now. Pay monthly dividend which I like hate waiting for quarterly. Have been paying same dividend for 20 years. 

Or we have ORC which pays 14-15%. Also pays monthly. Company seems solid and both have a long MR of 30% so I can margin them both the same to get my levered dividends for more gains. 

Now my question is for the math and tax experts. Since this money can’t go into a TFSA as mine is currently maxed out, what is the better play for yeild after the tax mans comes for his fair share? Love the 15% but not if is going to be a hot 8% after. Depending on my investments later on the year I should be making around 55000$ on paper but could possibly make upwards of 80-90 if all goes well. 

Let me know what you think! Thanks for anything."
2021-05-17 12:35:35,stocks,Go with Canadian dividend. It's more stable and reliable.
2021-05-17 13:30:55,stocks,"Be careful about chasing dividends.  Stocks with high yields have high yields for a reason, and that reason is poor stock performance.  You say ORC looks like a solid company but it's been on a steady downtrend since 2013.

My advice? Focus on good companies and look at dividends as a bonus.  Buying a stock with a 14% yield is pointless if the stock loses 5% annually."
2021-05-17 13:52:02,stocks,"100% Canadian since the US has a 15% withholding tax on dividends. I read it may also actually be 30% and a form is needed to be filled out to get it to 15%.

2021-05-17 00:00:00,stocks,"Specialty retail stocks are bumping: PLCE and DDS particularly Retail stocks have been on a surge in the past 6 months. The biggest gainers in this space are DDS (Dillards) and PLCE (The Children's Place). Both could be considered boomer stocks that still rely on brick & mortar, especially Dillards. But both company's are carrying strong tailwinds from reopening and pent up demands.

PLCE has Q1 earnings coming up on May 20. PLCE mainly sells children's clothing. And I think analysts and investors are pricing in the next 4 months of growth as COVID is lifting, kids will need new clothing for summer (parties, birthdays, etc) as well as back to school in 4 months. PLCE in Q4 reported that their digital sales are up, but that they're revenues are still down. Macro factors, they're still worried about declining birth rates. Since January, PLCE is up almost 70%, mostly through reliable increasing revenues and earnings. Despite revenue not beating expectations, they're still doing well.

One thing to note with PLCE using their Q4 2020 returns: https://investor.childrensplace.com/static-files/26f7ea63-8d41-481a-984d-b53f68e13032

In February 2, 2019 they made $1.9B in sales with profit of $111M.  At that time, their stock was trading at about $100. They're on track to hit that number in 2021 and even surpass it based on analyst estimates. We could see 50% more upside from PLCE if their Q1 results show anywhere near $600M in sales.

DDS is a different story. DDS just announced a $500M share buyback and a $0.15 dividend. This was on Friday. And since then, DDS has jumped almost 40%. It opened Friday at $107 and its currently trading at $142. On Friday, it was trading as low as $100 at one point.

A $500M share buyback will be done at the market:
https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dillards-announces-stock-buyback-worth-%24500m-to-pay-%240.15-quarterly-dividend-2021-05-17

> Under the new buyback program, the company can acquire securities via open market transactions as well as private negotiations.

The dividend is payable on August for investors as of June 30.

The P/S ratios of the department store industry are between 0.28 and 0.50, with DDS being on the high side. But their revenues are increasing and with a share buyback that will lower their total float, thus decreasing their P/S, DDS could be an exciting story. The funny thing is that DDS options have spiked in IV, so I would probably buy shares to avoid any major losses due to stock dump after June 30's ex-dividend date.

If you're looking non-tech plays to diversify your portfolio, but still have some aggressive gains, PLCE and DDS may be nice additions.


Anecdotally, many states are reducing social distancing restrictions. I could see department stores getting lots of benefits from traditional forms of shopping. I don't think the retail-pocalypse has destroyed the entire industry quite yet."
2021-05-17 00:00:00,stocks,"Help a Novice Improve Embryonic Portfolio? So I recently started investing the last few months and am getting cold feet from modest losses. I plan to invest roughly $1000 more in the next few months.

I got a few shares of AAPL (I’m a total fanboy) at 135 and quickly learned I should have DCA’d. I started to diversify, adding in small $10-20 portions of GOOG, AMZN and FB here or there—whenever I saw a dip ($50 in each so far).

I have 10 shares of FNMA at about $2 (my friend from college was convinced it will moon...)

I dabbled in crypto with about $200 (split between ETH, ADA, MATIC,BTC) but because of my timing the results have so far been *dismal*—so I’m here today!

I’m considering UAL as a reopening play, and want to diversify out of just tech. Maybe into alternative energy/sustainability projects, and perhaps in gene mapping and editing techs but I don’t really know where to start.

Since most of my assets are crashing I want to invest in some safer ETFs. I’m thinking SPDR and NASDAQ, and maybe some tech and green energy ones, and some that will profit from massive gov infrastructure spending. Again I don’t know where to start.  

I’ve seen a lot of mentions that “growth” stocks are bad and “value” stocks are good because of worries about inflation. But I have no idea what the difference is. Is now even a smart time to invest? I feel like I should have done this a year ago... :(

I’m in this for the long haul, but I don’t want to invest in something that might be *deep* red the next few years (hence I’m not putting a dime more into crypto; stocks and etfs seem as safe as savings by comparison and that’s what brought me here)

2021-05-17 11:02:14,stocks,"Some tips first:
1. Time in the market is better than timing the market. 
2. Never trust anyone else with your money. So your own DD.

That said, i have come across several folks who invested an year ago and are in the red. So I doubt if you really missed out on anything. There is never a good time. Just get in, diversify your investments, DCA if you can and hang in there for the long term 5/10/20/30 years and you WILL make money. 

It does sound like you don’t have the appetite for risk that comes with investing in individual stocks, so ETFs are your friends. 

Suggest you start with VOO/VTI, VXUS, SCHD.

Want to diversify? Look at these ETFs: 
XLF (Finance), XLI (Industrial), XLY (Consumer Staples), XLE (Energy), VNQ (Real Estate), XLB (Materials), XME (Metals and Mining).

2021-05-17 12:00:54,stocks,"Did you listen to their Q1 reports? It was concerning. So ENPH ran up to $220 before its historic slide. They did good on revenue and earnings, but the big dark cloud they unloaded on themselves was lowered expectations for growth through 2021. All green energy is getting clobbered by raw material shortages. ENPH announced that they expected lower product and revenue growth through 2021 because they will have restrictions on the production of their microinverters.

The market has absolutely punished them for it, because growth stocks that operate at PE and PS ratios of ENPH has absolutely no room for error otherwise they'll be punished.

I think it'll go back, but you need to wait for it to find its bottom. Q2 earnings may provide more insights whether it'll slide more. 

This isn't a short squeeze or hedge fund attack. This is an aggregate macro factor supply/demand issue.

Ask yourself these 4 questions:

1. What is ENPH's revenue growth rate?

2. What is their PS multiple?

3. How many years in the future is ENPH's growth priced into the current stock?

4. What are competitor multiples?

ENPH was pricing in nearly 4 years of growth into their stock. If you're willing to wait for this chip shortage to end (predicting in about 1-2 years) you could see 100% growth in ENPH price. Thats a good ROI given SPY only grows about 10% a year.

But if you don't have faith that will happen, I would consider reallocating your capital.

edit\*:what i mean specifically, is what will happen to the price (normally); do those big orders get filled? i would think so, for someone to place an order in the millions of bucks, seems like they probably know what they are doing. so i see the big order and think, the price must end up dropping at least to there, if the person expects it to get filled? im just deciding if i should get in at a penny above that buy order or wait until its filled and see if the price goes lower

2021-05-17 10:44:11,stocks,"As others have mentioned, the executives and employees of these companies are blacked out from trading during certain periods, and the trades on either end (or by those not ""in the know"") have to be approved by some form of internal oversight.   Granted, each company is in charge of their blackout policies and their trade approvals, but it's generally pretty difficult for an employee to trade on events like these, unless they trade on a private platform and take the risk personally.

The most troubling part of all this is who IS trading on the insider information.  The bankers, consultants, and attorneys that facilitate these major transactions all sit on these calls throughout the process and know every nitty-gritty detail (and have huge mouths).  They leak info and trade on this information constantly, often at the company and shareholder's expense."

That said though: ATT ($T) is a dividend stock and has been trying hard to offload debt (mainly Direct TV). Continuing the HBO Max success would have meant investing more (debt) to keep up with Netflix. You could have made a reasonable educated guess SOMETHING was going to happen with HBO Max either way given they have a new CEO.

It's a right call for them -- owning the vertical just means even more unnecessary debt."

I am also a T owner for a long time, mostly for the dividends, and I am not the least bit surprised by their price movement, nor this merger. The push above 30 was correction from its pullbacks over the last couple years, as well as the market adjustment thats been steadily occurring between almost all blue chip stocks relative to growth stocks. HBO Max was a big deal, and T has been very creative in driving membership to it, in spite of the other competition.  In addition, I have a sister that works for AT&T Warner Media devision, and she never told about it."
2021-05-17 14:36:28,stocks,"I think you should be looking at streaming market share and market share growth. I don’t think people necessarily knew about the T merger. The truth is HBO Max has been kicking ass and taking share from Disney and Netflix, rather than all streaming services struggling together.

Company executives legally purchasing their own stock and an unaffiliated board member (or whatever she was) dumping 100% of her holdings, based on inside information, the day before a 50% drawdown are two entirely different things."

This has given me more insight into the future of NF more than anything else. T is going to have a hell of a lot more content to stream then Netflix. I can see the future now. All the media giants slowly picking off their content from Netflix. You can see that reflected in NF content over the last year. More and more foreign content they can buy for cheap. They’re still getting some good content off companies like Cracked though with shows like Start Up which get abandoned or didn’t have money to get through more seasons.

2021-05-17 00:00:00,stocks,"TWLO: What happens when SMS becomes obsolete? Been doing some DD on TWLO and can't wrap my head around what to me seems like one of the key risks/bear scenarios, being the eventual decline/obsolescence of SMS. 

I believe in the bull thesis and think Jeff Lawson has an amazing vision for the business and potential to grow the business into a developer-led customer engagement business, but today, the core business is still being a communications API provider. 

TWLO generates 45% of its revenue currently from SMS, providing the API which is used by businesses to prove an array of services, marketing, notifications, updates and codes to name a few examples. 

Unlike voice or email which does not appear likely to be replaced, when you look at SMS, it's hard to see a world where SMS thrives over the various chat apps, given the limited functionality of SMS over the internet-based apps. The only advantage SMS has over an internet app is it its ubiquity and platform/device agnostic nature, which affords it a high degree of visibility and front-page status on most people's phone real estate. Part of this, I would argue, is also because old habits die hard and we all expect SMS when interacting with those outside of our social networks.

However, if the West goes the way of what is being seen in China, with the almost universal adoption of a singular chat app e.g. WeChat, we could see the use and value of SMS decline, as is being observed in China. 

Without solving for the complexity and obstacles in connecting internet devices to the legacy PSTN network, TWLO's value add is greatly diminished, and whilst they still provide API services for apps such as Whatsapp, FB etc, this relies on the communication being routed through TWLO as part of an omni-channel solution. If Whatsapp reaches out directly to the end customer through their platform, TWLO is not involved in that transaction. 

This also increases the reliance on big tech to allow TWLO to provide these services. 

On one hand, SMS usage in the near term is forecast to grow, and tools such as TWLO's APIs will unlock effective, powerful and hopefully two-engagement that benefits both business and customer. The use cases are just getting started. On the other hand, I can see a world where the pace of SMS obsolescence increases as we become saturated with marketing and often unwanted notifications, and we slowly migrate to different applications/platforms for our real communications, relegating the SMS app to the attic in our phones, only checking it occasionally when we know we are expecting something. This decline in eyeballs would then reduce the effectiveness of SMS for businesses and marketers, diverting these communications to a realm where TWLO has limited ability to monetise. 

I don't know if i'm just missing something or it's just me, I haven't read much debate/discussion on this when reading about TWLO so just curious on people's thoughts."
2021-05-17 08:26:40,stocks,"""Sms"" really now includes iMessage (apple business chat), Google messages (RCS). 

Twilio facilitates connection into both* of these

Edit: I've done extensive work with ""chat based ecommerce"", the overwhelming feed back is that customers like the separation of platforms, ie. Use WhatsApp for personal close friends, Slack for work, SMS for talking to businesses (chat based commerce). 

There's no real need for a combined single chat platform. Tech tried this in the last 10 yrs and it went no where. The culture and need just isn't there.

Edit2: Twilio is also pushing into ""messaging"" in general, tech wise it opens up revenue streams from IoT and pipeline / infrastructures. It's a hard tech problem to build your own messaging queue, and it's one of those things you shouldn't build your self."
2021-05-17 08:52:29,stocks,"SMS is already obsolete in most parts of the world. I haven't used it for 5+ years, at this point it is just a means for two factor authentication for accounts"
2021-05-17 10:36:19,stocks,"I would equate your description to any tech company.  What happens when people stop reading books?  Will Amazon go out of business?  No, of course not - they have created a model that evolved with the trends.  That is how I view Twilio.  They already provide APIs to businesses allowing them to communicate on multiple platforms - not just SMS.  But businesses choose to use what they find most effective.  As trends change - so will twilio.  

They also are staying ahead of the stack by buying segment last year.  This is Jeff really planning for the future. 

I think you could make a description that a lot of technology will be obsolete - so why invest.  But when you have a company like Amazon or Twilio that is beloved and has a leadership team with the vision for the future of communications, you should believe that they see where things are going much better than you or I.  And they will skate to where the puck is going....."

Well, Actually it's more like ""if the US goes the way of the rest of the world"", because globally speaking, WhatsApp has more than 2 billion users (mostly outside the US) , plus around 1.2 billions for WeChat, 600 millions from QQ and 500 millions from Telegram. And if you take into account Facebook Messenger, that's another 1.3 billions users (of course, there might be overlaps).

The point is: based on my personal knowledge, SMS are not as popular outside of the US, and that has historical roots: until quite recently, most Telecom companies outside the US didn't offer unlimited SMS plans, and the unit price for them was steep: In Mexico for instance, until a couple years ago an individual SMS would cost around $0.10 USD (ten cents). That is the main reason WhatsApp became so ubiquitous here.

2021-05-17 16:11:00,stocks,"Cellular / wireless engineer here.

I think you're over-thinking the whole thing.  Can a new API be constructed for a new service?  Obviously yes.  Does it matter if SMS goes away?  No, not really.  Will it?  Not anytime soon.  Even for those who are no longer using SMS, their phones still handle activation and control of some features using SMS in the background that the customer never sees (there's other services that use it as well).  It's going to be in place and usable in some fashion for quite a while.  I can tell you this isn't anything the cellular providers are talking about, simply because it's not a feature that's going to magically vanish in the next few years and at the network flow level, it's still used internally for a variety of purposes.

We keep everything separate at my company.  I use Slack for personal hangout / chats as well as work, but I never run more than one instance of one or the other, simply because it takes up too much screen real-estate to do that effectively.  But even as a handset manufacturer among other things, our employees are using /everything/ available to them... so long as it's secure enough.  

The spam on SMS, while annoying, could easily be rooted out and filtered away if the carriers wanted to make the effort.  Some have already blocked IP ranges mainly due to spammers these days and blocked entire area codes (like the Bahamas), but there's obvious pay-offs going on in the background with it still slipping through."
2021-05-17 14:02:00,stocks,"SMS will always exist. RCS is the next version of SMS which will provide everything iMessage/Whatsapp has but as standard. You never know it might be a big hit. Either wait it's not going anywhere.

Sort of an investing newbie, but shouldn’t nio be around 10x the price it is currently? Being Tesla’s largest competitor in their niche, nio’s market cap doesn’t justify being 1/10th of tsla’s. Is their a reason for this?"

Decided to hold off on buying just to see what the heck is going on while trying to amass some much needed buying power. May well begin a hyper steady drip feed approach now. Buying entire shares at once has made me super susceptible to whacky market shifts. Going forward, I am now gonna add careful partial portions to lower my basises without screwing up my balancing too bad while giving me room to continue if things get more intense.

2021-05-17 15:12:48,stocks,"Re: T & DISCA

I've been googling for an hour for a straight answer on this.

So AT&T and DISCA are both selling off their media assets and creating a new entity (let's called it WBDC) that will stream both companies assets as a single streaming service.

They're saying that AT&T stockholders will own 71% of the new company and Discovery stockholders will own 29%.

So does this mean they're going to be issuing shares to anyone who owns either of those stocks? If I own both, will I now own T, DISCA & WBDC at some point?

Or am I completely misreading the situation?"

2021-05-17 14:46:24,stocks,"I think many people not experienced with what a slow moving bear market looks like is going to get destroyed by ""dollar cost averaging"" in the medium term.

Think about what the 2000 dot com bust looked like - ie how the crash lasted nearly three years from the all time high. Every month it kept getting lower, and anybody who ""dollar cost averaged"" down was effectively bleeding month after month until they couldn't take it any more. So many people exited the stock market for life during that time.

If this is where we're heading into, it's going to look *very* different from the March 2020 ""crash"" and even the 2008 crash, where a relatively sharp crash was followed by a bottom and an extended bull run. In that kind of situation, yeah, average down wins. But in a slow moving bear market, average down can feel like death by a thousand cuts."

if I thought of the stock market as a local microcosm of it's current form (e.g. trading/bartering or even plain purchasing everyday items), I get this revulsion response of ""hell, I am NOT paying that much for that"".

Strangely, the very things that I have purchased (in my everyday life) that I have given a proper ""intrinsic"" value assessment have only proven their long term worth and have a resale value that is greater than my purchase price due to its intrinsic worth.   Example - finding great deals at garage sales, craigslist, etc. hell, my house that I purchased in 2010, part of the reason I bought was the perceived value of the sum of the elements (solid foundation/materials, location - close to a park and relatively close to the city, space, acreage, space, etc). it's now more than doubled in value. point is - I felt comfortable purchasing it in 2010. Obviously the market has more than doubled since then.

Now is a likely a good time to jump in to IPOE and get ahead of the run up in price that often happens leading up to the Shareholder Approval Vote (next week)/ Ticker Symbol Change. Sofi is following the same path as IPOB... which ran to $26 on acquisition announcement (Opendoor).. then pulled back to $15 .. before running up to $32 on merger day. (SOFI /IPOE is now at $15)

**Top 10 CNBC Disruptor List & Recent Expansion**
SoFi was Top 10 on the CNBC disruptor 50 Prior to the 3 game changing moves below.. Which tells you how strong they are now. They are now set up to be the dominant online, 1 stop company for Banking, Brokerage, lending needs & Insurance. And unlike most new stocks... Sofi is projected to be profitable within a year.. 

Not to mention a rock Solid management team (lead by CEO Anthony Noto .. prior COO and CFO of twitter. Also prior CFO of the NFL). 

**3 Important moves**
1) Acquired Golden National Bank- as a fast track to gain its national charter.

2) Sofi acquired Galileo Technology (A financial platform/ software company) .. for $1.2Billion, which is likely worth $2B now. which will operate as its on entity.. and will have huge growth. Galileo supports the backend of various fintechs including Robinhood, Chime, and others. (this is a secret weapon in the valuation game going forward).

3) The move to give regular investors (account holders) access to pre-market IPO offerings (they will also be underwriting a number of offerings). This will further drive up the rate of new account signups, which is already growing quickly."

2021-05-17 11:30:20,stocks,"DTCC and ICC, clearing agencies, have both passed wind-down plans for in the event of extreme market stress. ICC passed theirs at the last second on Friday, literally 11:59PM EST May 14. (DTC-004 and ICC-005)

These rules, at least from my interpretation, are expecting defaulting member(s) due to high risk positions, and they expect large payouts from those defaulting members. 

The wind down plan will tell all members to eliminate their risky position if it causes any member to default from that same position. 

The wind down plan also allows the auction of defaulting members assets to be sold to other members. This allows others to help pay for the defaulting member. They want to mitigate the amount that the DTCC or ICC has to pay up.

Does this mean market crash? Could be. We'll see.

Edit: Rip guess I get downvoted despite calling out significant rule changes for the largest clearing corporations. At least it's better than, ""hurr Elon musk""."

We were bound for a shakeout, interestingly enough, Covid probably helped many of these companies delay their reckoning for a year. 

You could see it at work. My last three companies hired for growth 2017-2019,  but that growth never materialized and they all would have laid off in 2020 Covid or not. We were headed for a recession no matter what. Stimulus and stonks held it at bay, but 2021-2022 does not look promising."

If NET performs well and the markets don’t die, you might see share price go up 75% from where it is now over the next several years (as an example, not a prediction). They may also die off. You’ll probably never get that kind of growth from NVDA unless you’re buying at the bottom after a huge drop or crash.

Everything was over priced and over hyped. Sure, low interest rates will cause numerous incentives to throw money into the market, but at a certain point a lot of these tech companies are way overvalued considering they’re not even profitable yet.

In the end, though, everything hasn’t tanked, you just don’t see the unreasonably good performance of risky tech stocks that you saw in 2020.

So the question isn’t “why aren’t people buying apples even though they prevent cancer,” the question is “why did apples cost a million dollars to begin with”

Edit:
In this analogy, apples are the hyped-up stocks youre referring to. Could apply to clean energy, Tesla, whatever. Sure, clean energy will undoubtedly grow in the future. But it may just be overpriced. This is partly because of excessive hype and people just throwing money into it because “it’s the future,” but also because there’s no where else to put money right now other than stocks. Anywhere else you put money, you will effectively be losing to inflation (not because inflation is high, but because interest rates are so low). Everyone anticipates this will change once interest rates increase, giving less incentive to put money in stocks. On top of that, new growing sectors like clean energy, EVs, etc don’t make profits and rely on borrowing money to grow, which is easier with low interest rates. That will need to change eventually to slow down inflation"

same stock is now down 5% after your second buy? fine, because you used a stop loss. exited and wait for a better reentry.

Capital gains of $1 needs to be reported and tax paid on it. It does not kick in at a certain number, it's any amount of profit. Although there are different tax levels based on how long you held onto it before selling like less than a year or more than a year. 

You could buy a stock for $5 and sell it for $10, you still need to pay capital gains on that $5 profit, even if that's the only trade you have done within the whole year.

2021-05-17 15:18:05,stocks,"Your job isn’t considered capitol gains but they are both taxed the same for the most part (unless you hold your investments for more than a year in which case they are taxed as long term capitol gains). If you sell investments for a profit after holding for less than a year, it is taxed as regular income just like your job. So the standard deduction credit applies towards all your income, short term investments included. 

Really Simplified Example: 
Job Income: 45,000 
Investment Income (short term): 12000 
Total income: 57,000
Standard tax deduction for single filer: 12,500 
Taxable income: 44,500

This is not entirely accurate.  There is no ""tax credit."" You simply net your capital gains with your capital losses. If it is positive, you pay tax on the net gain.

2021-05-17 00:00:00,stocks,"Should I invest more than half of my money as a first year college student living with their parents? I know that as a general rule most people tend to save the majority of their money to cover their living expenses and only invest any spare capacity of money that they can afford to lose, but considering that I live at home with little to no living expenses, should I take more of a risk with my money and set aside a larger chunk of my savings for investments? I have never invested in the stock market, so my experience is limited and I'm still learning how to analyse trends and financial statements and all that, so I'm a little unsure of how much risk I should really take considering my inexperience. My budget is pretty low as well at just around 5,000 AUD, so in order to really make any worthwhile returns I probably need to invest around half of that. What do you guys think?"

2021-05-17 10:19:56,stocks,">I know that as a general rule most people tend to save the majority of their money to cover their living expenses and only invest any spare capacity of money that they can afford to lose...

I think general rule is that you save about 6 months of your living expenses. Then you save for immidiate financial goals(big purchases you might need to make within a year or two, like a downpayment for a house or a car). After that you invest the rest. But you invest majority for that investment fund in something safe and stable(index etf for example). Now a small minority portion you don't mind losing, you invest into more risker personal picks that you want to try out. Oh, and technically investments doesn't have to be in stock markets. You could start here, and then move a part into investing in real estate or something later as your funds grow.  
For your specific case, it doesn't like like you have 6 months expense you need to save for. But you may have immediate financial need that you should set aside like 2 months of rent cost(incase your parents suddenly asks you to move out), and/or if you don't have your own car already then you may want to save for down payment for that. Add anything else you may need to pay for within next two years and set money for that aside.  
After that's been set you should start investing. My recommendation is throw the money into something like VTI or VOO for now, and do some paper trading on personal picks. Once you get good at paper trading that you start beating the market then take a small portion of the overall funds for more active investing on personal picks."

It's really your comfort level and goals (goals that change over time).

As young as you are I personally wouldn't be afraid to pick just a few that you really believe are going to do well over time (assuming you're long).  For example you mention tech is your thing - there's really no one that could fault you for throwing it all into a few of your favorite FAAMG picks.  But I certainly wouldn't advise throwing it all into a few risky bets... unless you're also ready to accept the losses if it doesn't go well.

Personally, I started out with a portfolio so long I couldn't even keep track of what I owned, now it's down to 5.  That number can vary a bit... but 5 is what I've found works for me.

2021-05-16 22:11:29,stocks,"That's part of where my concern is. Is it worth only having 350$ in a microcap, given how minimal the gains would be compared to 1000$ of, say, SQ"
2021-05-17 00:46:30,stocks,"The issue comes down to the size of the positions. The idea being that there's a balance between percentage gains and total gains. Having a stock double in value isn't substantial if you have 250$ of it, when I could instead, in theory, make 250$ from a 25% gain of a stock I have 1000$ in.

I get it's not a very diverse portfolio, but if allocate 5% to a position, that would be 250$, which some woild argue is too small to produce significant gains. That's not necessarily what I believe, but it's something I've seen discussed on this sub a few times"

Cryptos should not be included in this. 60% in tech is aggressive, 40% in tech, 20% in industrials and the rest is a mix with everything else is a good mix IMO. Although, it’s all debatable and complete subjective. Also PayPal and square are more fintech, which is almost a separate industry at this point. Small caps are gambling and should not be more than 10%."
2021-05-16 23:37:26,stocks,"Up to you my brother. It's all about total portfolio gain don't lose sight of that.  If you have conviction about them all, keep them.  It's more fun that way anyway imo."
2021-05-17 11:00:02,stocks,"There is certainly merit to looking at things from a practical perspective but its also important to consider that you really dont know which stock will climb 25%. Thats the argument for diversification, not that I necessarily agree.

I dont mind sharing my strategy with folks but do note the nature of my IT job gives me a lot of disposable time. Plus I love analyzing stocks and my background is very science heavy so numbers, modeling and forecasting come natural. Also note my strategy changes based on macro factors. But right now its:

$1 speculative + $1 anchor stocks + $1 cash

Speculative - 50% large cap high growth + 50% small to mid cap risky high growth (these are the keys to my success).

Anchors = 50% dividend long term growth blue chips + 50% stable REITs or REIT preferred stock.

Cash - Due to macro high valuation I have been keeping a lot of cash the last 5 years. This is deploy it if I see a great deal. For example, last year, ENPH dipped to $40 based on a short report. I investigated it and found that it was fluff and that the person who wrote it didnt understand the solar sector at all (helps when you install it yourself for friends and family). I deployed most of the cash. Unfortunately, I sold most of it the next day after it spiked back up but I did keep some as free tokens of appreciation."

2021-05-16 22:21:41,stocks,"I'll mostly focus on the last point there; if small caps should be less than 10%, is it worth having any at all if you're only having <500$ of it?

As young as you are you can do your future self a huge favor by just plugging away at some diversified holdings.

Just IMO. If you’re not willing to buy MORE when it loses value, it’s a bad investment. U should be so sure where the company will be in 3-5 years that u get happy for a discount. Look at the price history of say, DPZ, ISRG or ALGN, would u care if it went down 20% 10 years ago or get happy. Idk if youre timeframe is short or not, but The people that NEVER lose go on 3-5-20 year time horizons. 

Leaps are good in theory, and u can kill it. But there are authors & other people who call 5-10 baggers all the time. Why risk losing it?  5x isn’t good enough?

Investment is defense against risk more than going for returns. Buffett, Klarman, Fisher & the pros are t doing options. 
I don’t know your pics. I took a quick look at that pharmacy one. It has no revenue, only R&D, fundraising, losses, & expenses. Which means it’s a LONGSHOT. They literally don’t make any $ in sales.

2021-05-16 20:52:07,stocks,"Pensioncraft on youtube provides some insights if you follow the videos. Practical tips that basically boil down to: buy index funds, start buying, if you expect a crash buy a little slower but move cash to stocks within a year, don't watch the news, take a sleeping pill, the best investors are dead investors, don't do silly things like selling during a crash."
2021-05-16 22:45:08,stocks,"I can't provide advice on the timing of how to change what you have into future investments (the market can continue going down or up in the near future and I can't predict that. You're current picks could continue going down or they could rebound. I won't try to suggest what to do with that.)

What I can say is half of investing isn't just trying to maximize your portfolio return, it is also managing risks.

Too many people are getting on the internet meme hypes and not learning to do the latter. 

&#x200B;

I would learn to start with some broad market index portfolios first, understand how different parts of the market go up and down over time and then branch into more specific strategies, while you keep your portfolio safely balanced.

Many people are down sense January, but many of us are up and it isn't be we are great stock pickers. The S&P 500 index is up 12.8% Year to date, which is beyond average.  What has happened is many people are highlighting riskier investments of new companies that might make it big, but aren't making all of the profits yet. They are potentially the next big things. The problem with these investments is they are volatile. During some periods they go up faster than the market and during other periods they go down faster. If there is a total market downturn, they will generally go down more.  (ie. high risk-high reward)

What you want to do is learn to spread your risk out, find things that aren't as risky and more likely to keep making you consistent money. Then with a small portion of your portfolio pursue some riskier strategies you are well researched in and feel could give you larger gains in the future.

\-- It is worth noting that all 3 of the stocks you listed are not making annual profits yet, rather they are taking losses -- Let that sink in. They are not making an annual profit.

 What is going on is they could fail or be the next thing to make it. People are making speculative investments them making it and trying to get in early, but that is a risk. They haven't made the profits yet. Someone else could come in with a slightly better strategy and steal their thunder in the future. The macro-economy could downturn and they will get hit harder.

Make sure to own things currently making profits too.

A few ideas:

VOOV - This is the S&P 500 Value stocks indexed (same as VOO when mixed with VOOG) Up 18.8% YTD

VOOG - This is the S&P 500 Growth Stocks indexed (Same as VOO when mixed with VOOV) Up 7.9% YTD

DIA - This indexes the Dow Jones Industrial average. Up 13.8% YTD

QQQ  - This indexes the NASDAQ. Up 17% year to date

&#x200B;

VOOV/VOOG 50%

QQQ 10-20%

DIA 10-20%

I would make these the bulk of your portfolio and then choose a smaller portion to try things that are riskier or individual picks."

Last week, I decided to just sell everything i was still in the green with (apple, salesforce, etc) and just doubled-down on my Nio leaps by buying them mostly deep ITM. I did this so that I can bring my original breakeven price down. I bought two $25 calls, one $17 call, one $15 call, and two $55 calls. Before purchasing these, my breakeven was around $72. Now my breakeven is below 55 and I could certainly sleep better at night 😂. Still a bit risky but better than before. 

I can't speak for any of your other positions. But if you're in a similar spot as I was and you're starting to get nervous, then the approach I took is something to consider at least. For me, it was the obvious choice rather than selling for over 75% loss haha.

Before NIO's recent correction, $80 leaps expiring Jan 2023 seemed like a decent bet. Now, I feel like we will be extremely lucky to see $75 a share by that date. Obviously just my opinion though.

Good luck and stay strong, brotha !"
2021-05-17 00:00:00,stocks,"MATERIALS - Trinseo (TSE) Crushes Earning - STRONG VALUE PLAY Trinseo looks to be in the beginning of a breakout. The company blew earnings estimates by 39.25% but there have been very few revisions by the lazy analysts and algorithms. 

The company revisions in their earnings call slide presentation on May 6th project Adjusted EPS of $9.12-10.14 in 2021. Comparable companies trade around 10x, and TSE closed Friday at $67.75. 

There is MORE! TSE is 94.77% institutionally owned and 2.2% by insiders leaving a public float of basically 3% with total shares outstanding of 38.74m as of 5/3/21. That leaves about 1.16m shares float. TSE trades an average 10 day volume of 375.79k, yes that is a K for 375,790 shares traded on average. Meaning to be that once volume by retail catches on the stock could bounce quickly. 

This is not stock advice, but what it appears to me is that once the analysts get off their bums and do the math the revisions will be HUGE! 

Lastly, the technicals on the chart finally straightened out to where the 20,50,100 and 200 day moving averages are back in order and hence, “BEGINNING OF A BREAKOUT.”

In theory this should not change the price of the stock, because before the company had cash, which is included in the stock price, and after there are less shares but the company is worth less (does not have the cash anymore) so the price of a stock is the same, there are just less pieces of a smaller pie.

Usually buybacks do increase the price of a company. This is because it is seen as a bullish sign. Basically it's as if the company is signalling their stock is undervalued.

Try to imagine it that way: if you knew your company was going bust, you would dump all your shares while the price is still high, whereas if you knew the company is doing good, you would try to buy them while they're still low.

There is probably a lot of regulation involved to avoid insider trading, but high level, that's how it works."

Quote:
""Every publicly traded company issues shares. ... Shares outstanding refers to the total number of shares a company has issued, while the public float — also referred to as floating shares or ""the float"" — are shares that are publicly owned, unrestricted and available on the open market."""

The exact opposite happens when they add shares to the market, thats why make sure you look at the diluted and outstanding shares in the market over years in the company’s financials.

A few companies started doing buybacks and now every company does it. The one thing I have not seen discussed much about buybacks is the executives conflict of interest with them. If I am CEO of ABCD and most of my salary comes in the form of options than I will be motivated to buyback shares since it will instantly increase my pay. I think this is one reason why so many companies have gotten on the buyback train and find it impossible to stop doing them once they start.

Also, the could be the case that the company buys back its shares without retiring them, and they are kept on the company balance sheet or made partof employee compensation programs. In this case, the only thing lowering your ownership stake is if you were the one selling your shares to the company.

Theoretically they could issue new stocks and receive cash. That a 10B market cap company could theoretically raise another billion doesn´t make the company worth 11B. It is still a 10B company.

>The only thing that happens in a buyback is there's fewer shares outstanding. Market cap stays the same ( no change to value), therefore the share price goes up.

No! This is categorically wrong. If a 10B market cap company (with say 2B in cash) uses 1B to buy back shares, it´s market cap will trend towards 9B all else the same. Exactly like if a 10B company with cash would pay 1B in dividends, its market cap would decrease by 1B all else the same. Look at any stock the day after dividend ex-date. Its price goes down by the amount of dividend, because the company is now worth less.

It is possible that the company is over-capitalized. And that it is reasonable to decrease their equity. It is possible that a 1B reduction in assets by paying cash-dividend/buying back stock decreases the market value of the company by less than 1B. But this is not basic math."

2021-05-17 17:04:38,stocks,"You just countered your own point when saying ""Theoretically they could issue new stocks and receive cash... it's still a 10B company"". Exactly. The amount of shares outstanding can both increase and decrease, this does not mechanically change the value of the company. It can fundamentally change value of the stock price, due to dilution or concentration. As for ""all else the same"", it's purely semantics, as like you said, if they bought back 1B the value would trend towards 9B, and if they issued 1B worth of new shares it would trend towards 11B. This would never happen in a real scenario, it is simply a mathematical truth. If the company issues new stock, the stock goes down, generally adjusting roughly for the dilution. Depending on investor sentiment, the news of raising capital could be negatively or positively reacted to, hence creating a deviation in one direction or the other, from the new, adjusted share price."
2021-05-17 00:00:00,stocks,"Disco for $DISCA. Why Discovery is the play, and why it’s due for a short squeeze TL;DR $DISCA is ripe for a push upwards

I am not a financial advisor and I am not good at writing DD’s with fancy colors and graphs. Please do your own research before investing

About 2 months ago we saw the fallout of Archegos, and Bill Hwang become a laughing stock after losing 20 billion dollars from his margin call. Viacom ($VIAC) and Discovery ($DISCA) were among the hardest hit in that selloff. Let’s cut to the chase on why this is this is ready for takeoff, and that big buyers are gonna swoop this back up to new highs 

For starters, the stock currently has a moderately high short interest ratio of 25%. It’s amongst the top shorted stocks within the NYSE. 

https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/DISCA/short-interest/

On top of the moderately high short interest, you might notice $DISCA is the class A version of the stock. There are actually two other tickers discovery sells shares for: $DISCB and $DISCK. What’s very interesting is despite $DISCK and $DISCA shares trading relatively similar prices, $DISCB shares have actually soared since the selloff, and are trading at double the amount of the regular class A shares. What’s the difference between class A and class B shares? Simple.

“The difference between Class A shares and Class B shares of a company’s stock usually comes down to the number of voting rights assigned to the shareholder.  Class A shareholders generally have more clout”


https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/062215/what-difference-between-class-shares-and-other-common-shares-companys-stock.asp

Now, why is this due for a squeeze? Today, news came out about AT&T wanting to combine media assets with discovery, pushing the valuation of the company to a whopping 150 Billion dollars. Currently, Discovery’s market cap sits at a valuation of 17.41 billion dollars, meaning this merger would push its valuation up 8.6x. I dont know about you guys but that sounds pretty wild to me.

2021-05-17 04:54:33,stocks,"As someone just reading and watching the subreddits because I believe it's very dangerous to invest into something someone posts about (because there is no reason to post about it for no personal gain, and when personal gain is involved the view will be subjective instead of objective) it amazes me to constantly see these huge shifts in public believe and opinion.

Don't get me wrong, I buy up hype stocks when they start trending on multiple subreddits and sell max 1-2 days later, works like a charm, but not long ago all subreddits were filled with hate against Chinese stocks/companies, how insecure and problematic they are. And before that people were full suckers for Chinese stocks as China is undoubtedly one of the fastest growing countries, not to imagine what happens if they actually get their shit together and educate most of the people for proper jobs. But where is the love coming from now? Especially after restrictions on China got stronger, China making more news invading other countries property and also China reporting more and more investigations into their companies that seems like an odd time to change opinion."
2021-05-17 00:00:00,stocks,"The cleanest re-open play left - Simon Properties  Starting in early fall last year, I kept questioning many of my recovery-related positions as having already had their run. As weeks and months went by, stocks in those industries kept increasing - airlines, cruises, casinos, et al. Come February, I wanted to find more recovery plays and landed on one of my better trades of the last few months - call options on Live Nation ($LYV). In the last few weeks I wanted to do more digging as I questioned that maybe there's something left as a recovery play. I ran across $SPG, Simon Properties Group.

I believe SPG is a great pick as it has big upside potential for a large cap stock (40bn market cap), with minimal downside risk. Being mostly an investor/owner of malls (the largest in the nation), and mall-like real estate, the stock was obviously shot down at the start of the pandemic last year. It has recovered since but not to pre-Covid levels and far from all time highs of $229 (currently at $122).  


The stock offers a nice dividend to top it all off, the only time it diluted is when it made some acquisitions for basically pennies on the dollar at the height of the pandemic (great moves), and run by good management.   They’ve even kept paying the dividend, paying it out every quarter still, with Q1 2020 being the sole exception, when everything was closed.  Profitable, low PE, dividend, and growth all in one.  *A true hidden gem!*"
2021-05-16 20:43:40,stocks,"I’m not sure how much growth I believe the stock still has left, considering it’s approaching pre COVID levels at this point.

2021-05-17 00:00:00,stocks,"Trying to understand the pros and cons of buying on a margin Hi, I’m relatively new to investing. I started buying stocks in February and you have really gotten into it and enjoy it immensely. There are however, a lot of parts of investing that I really don’t understand. I google stuff constantly and try and do my own research but it can get pretty confusing. 
My current question is about margin buying. I was recently offered the ability to use margin buying on RH and was given an $11,000 margin which seems dangerous to me because from what I have gleaned from my research, buying on margin is like using credit from whatever platform you’re using to invest. 
Let’s say I use $500 on the margin to buy stock, when I deposit more money will they automatically take that $500 back? Is that how you pay it off? Are they making money off of this? Like hidden fees and exorbitant interest rates and stuff like that?I guess what I mean is, overall, is it sketchy? Should I avoid buying on a margin? 
One reason I’ve seen given as a benefit is that you’re able to buy more stock at the time when you need to and therefore can make more profit because it gives you additional capital to invest. That makes sense, but again I wonder what their angle is. I really don’t want to get myself in a bad situation because I’m ignorant. Any advice or experience on the matter would be greatly appreciated!"
2021-05-16 22:39:37,stocks,"I leverage myself 1-1. Right now would not be a great time to be using alot of margin, but I like to use margin when I see tasty dips and want to pick up something at a discount, and I can pay it back later. 

It is risky by nature to be leveraged. It is a form of debt and it is not secured. I am a fan of leverage, but I am a very conservative investor. I don't use it for trades besides the occasional swing if I see a grand opportunity. I will use it to sell puts though, and if I get assigned and am in the red, I can hold and pay the interest, which is mostly what I would do if assigned on a put. I usually like to own stocks that I sell puts on (GE is one, premiums trash, but I like the opportunities for small discounts.)

It's very risky to use for certain people because everyone has different risk levels and most people prefer to only play with their money. As someone who is conservative, I don't mind much seeing my money swing as much due to my leverage. I prefer to own safer stocks and have dividends pay for my margin, BUT the downside of that, is that it reduces my compounding, which makes me rely on value and growth stocks and balancing my portfolio relatively often. I need to take my profits a little early, as well as sell my losers. 

As long as margin is cheap, I will continue to use it. It's great for buying safer dips (no falling knife stocks) and selling puts. I think it is a good debt that can be utilized as a tool if not used overzealously. 

With that all said, it's very risky to be leveraged for newer investors. I first tried it a few years ago and my portfolio wasn't as balanced (growth/tech dec2018 tore me up) and I ended up being way out of my risk tolerance territory, and had to sell great stocks for a loss due to my inexperience and gross negligence. If I only used my own money, I would've owned nvidia, lam, paycomm and 200$, 180, and 90 respectively. Hindsight is always 2020 , but that's why port balance with margin is important."

2021-05-17 01:02:17,stocks,"Congrats on graduating. I also hold a CS degree and taught for a while. Basically self taught in finance and real estate over the last 2 decades. My performance has been about 30% on average the last 15 years or so.

MOST IMPORTANT ADVICE: Dont let people make you doubt yourself. For us scientists, this is easy to do because we are intuitively always self checking because we value the right answer rather than shooting from the hip like dolts. Its our nature as scientist always check and double check. Dont assume others are like us. Most people are idiots who run around saying things in absolutes and pretending they have answers. They almost always dont know spit. Its important that you realized your inexperience, but do trust your problem solving skill and do use it to learn valuation and forecast forward. It works.

&#x200B;

1. Do anchor yourself with safe long term stuff with medium growth. Dont just jump to high risk tech. I dont believe in the mantra of young taking big risks. Its for fools who are desperate. You are a science grad. You will make plenty of money. No reason to gamble especially initially when you are not knowledgeable. Better to gamble once you actually know what you are doing years from now with disposable money.
2. DO pick your own stocks. Even if you screw up, which you will at some point, the lesson learned is more valuable than the loss. Call it an educational expense. Our ability to process info is very high. Use that to learn from errors. I screwed up too when I started but my later history speaks for itself. I learned and adapted. Use your head and dont let ego get in the way.
3. DO take a financial accounting class or just read a text book when you have time. Its helpful to know bean counter vocab.

Once you have a nice portfolio of safe long term stuff, use excess money to play around with risky stuff.

My 2 cents."

ETFs in general are some of the ""safest"" investments because, similar to a mutual fund, you're getting hundreds of companies in one easy to buy fund, and getting instant diversification. 

VOO and SPY both replicate the S&P 500, which comprises the top US companies. It's about as ""safe"" as you can get, so much so that it serves as the benchmark to compare all other investments. The S&P has risen an average of 8% annually since its inception in the early 1900s, and 12% annually over the past decade. While I argue that beating the S&P is not hard to do, you'll often hear the fact that the majority of professional funds don't beat it over 5 and 10 year time frames, to the tune of like 95 of them not beating its returns. Thus, you're statistically better off just buying it.

All ETFs have a small fee (built in to the price of the fund, you're not having to cut them a check). VOO is 0.03%, and SPY is 0.09%. Both seem insignificantly small, and they ultimately are, but it will add up over a decade or more, and why would you pay more for SPY when you don't have to?"

It hasn't been ""losing money"" since 2013. 

Are you talking about stock price when you say ""losing money""? If so, it isn't losing money by your definition. 

The stock price has fluctuated up and down from its highest price which was 7 years ago.

If you'd bought before 2014, you're stock has gone up in price and is profitable. 

Bought in 2018, 2019, 2020? Your stock has gone up. 

Basically, unless syoud bought it at its highest price, you'd have made money. 

None of that includes what you'd earn from dividend.

&#x200B;

the whole company was turned around into a cloud service company and is very successful at that. 

with the spinoff of their GTS division, it will be a somewhat completed turnaround. 

\- hence losing money in the process. 

considering the size and business of IBM it is a remarkable story of how even the biggest companies can change, if they really want to and have the backing of board and shareholders.   


of course many partners and people working there felt dismissed and couldn´t / cant understand the direction the company is taking.  

on top of that: its a dividend aristocrat with one of the highest yields in that elusive companies. 

bear case: historically bad at marketing, and using their full products potential to gain any traction at all. they build /  own / sell some extremely sophisticated niche products and failed to gain any more market shares.  

still: I personally like them a lot for the first three points alone."
2021-05-17 01:45:12,stocks,"I'm investing in Red Hat, not IBM per se. While I like old IBM model Ms and Thinkpads they have their staff use Macbooks now. IBM is not what they used to be in 1980s. Red Hat part was around 5bn when they acquired them so it's still a small part of IBM but it has growth potential."
2021-05-17 01:48:04,stocks,"Them acquiring Red Hat.
Red Hat is the Linux distribution (RHEL) which essentially runs everything on the internet and on companies as well. They acquired it not so long ago and there is absolutely no way this will ever shrink, infact this industry will continue to grow year over year at a huge pace as everything gets more connected and as more and more things rely on technology, Linux will power it all and Red Hat essentially has a monopoly status in this market.

You aren't investing in IBM, you're investing in Red Hat and there's no way this investment can go wrong as Linux machines will only continue to grow and Red Hat will continue to lead the way.

Past info about IBM is irrelevant at this stage since them acquiring Red Hat changes everything for their future prospects. If they manage to hit a few more home runs like this acquisition then it can be a really big player in the future and a stable one too as this sector will bring income no matter what the conditions around you are."
2021-05-17 01:50:15,stocks,IBM is AI tech
2021-05-17 01:52:24,stocks,"No, IBM has not lost any money since 2013. It has steadily made money every single year. Earnings from continuing operations have been:

    2014: $15.8B; $15.59 per share
    2015: $13.3B; $13.60 per share
    2016: $11.9B; $12.39 per share 
    2017:  $5.8B;  $6.14 per share 
    2018:  $8.7B;  $9.51 per share 
    2019:  $9.4B; $10.57 per share  
    2020:  $5.5B;  $6.13 per share 

On top of which, free cash flow has been more consistent than earnings, from 2014-2020 it has been $12.6B, $13.3B, $11.7B, $13.0B, $11.9B, $11.9B, and $10.8B. 

And stockholder's equity in that time went from $11.9B in 2014 to $20.6B in 2020, as retained earnings increased from $137.8B to $162.7B. And there has been no increase in the number of shares outstanding, it actually fell from 990.5 million to 893 million. 

So it's not just about the dividends. There's no dilution there, and they aren't paying out all the earnings in dividends, so even apart from the nice dividend, shares have simply gotten steadily more valuable over time.  

So with all that, if the price is for some reason still lower than it was in 2013 or 2014, then, you know what they say, ""buy low, sell high""."

* Red Hat (Unix/Linux Cloud computing, who have themselves been buying up other companies)
* Nordcloud (cloud strategy company)
* Turbonomic (Cloud/Fintech)
* and many others

All of these acquisitions will help IBM build up momentum to take on Microsoft and Amazon, which is why the stock has begun rising the past couple of months. There's also the fact that IBM will split into two companies: IBM, and Kyndryl. IBM will focus entirely on cloud (new stuff), and Kyndryl will focus on technology infrastructure (old stuff)."
2021-05-17 02:16:29,stocks,"The upside of IBM is a very strong customer base and their position in the hybrid cloud computing infrastructure.

They are the repair center for many P.C/Server manufacturers, for Lenovo the biggest manufacturer this also will never change.

They also have quiet a lot of IT Outsourcing at big companys and are for example one of the few Companys that still supports Main Frame and therefore almost all banks.

This brings them into a good position for A.I and Big Data but did they use this position? As you said i don’t think so currently..."

Quantum Computing

Those are my reasons"
2021-05-17 05:58:32,stocks,Mainly for quantum computing and tiny chips.
2021-05-17 07:26:39,stocks,The only thing it got going for it very well is quantum computing which is a big deal but a lot of other tech companies have also started to invest in it
2021-05-17 08:15:59,stocks,Yes. You buy them because they are cheap and the stock has gone down for 10 years. They had a bad manager. They got a new one and look to be in a good position to dominate chips and hybrid cloud. They are going to build India. 500/share + by 2025.
2021-05-17 08:48:08,stocks,"Did you buy high on them? I bought them @ 120, so maybe you're failing to buy low? And like you said...dividends are pretty great."

2021-05-17 09:34:37,stocks,"I don’t own it, but they’re the type of company that could potentially come up with the next greatest thing."
2021-05-17 11:04:03,stocks,Their current CEO is actually pretty good. He is also a graduate from IIT same as Sundar pichai. I think the main problem with IBM was their ex CEO who was pretty bad.
2021-05-17 11:56:53,stocks,IBM has been having problems since even before 2013. They had tons of cool ideas which turned out to not be commercially viable. Like Watson for example.
2021-05-17 13:50:24,stocks,"As a 'sad', IBM customer on a few technologies, their cloud is a literal joke.  They've sent their 'army' of sales guys over and over again to pitch their cloud... they sit there all high and mighty touting features that are still in BETA and it's like 5 year old tech compared to the other guys.   We demoed it, and if your buying into the IBM cloud... good luck to you."
2021-05-17 15:58:42,stocks,Have you used the Model M? It's great
2021-05-17 18:33:50,stocks,I would not touch it only for Jim Chanos' verdict (basically calling it a borderline accounting fraud).

2021-05-16 20:17:16,stocks,"IMO, IBM is messing around with Red Hat a bit too much. Before, enterprises could use CentOS for production and then be upsold. Now no company wants to use CentOS for production since it does not mirror RHEL's release schedule, opting for nightly updates."

IBM had the foresight to see what was coming, but their execution is an entirely different story."
2021-05-17 09:22:09,stocks,"They have all that though in the last few years, they didn't miss anything. What they do though is wait for smaller companies to make that and then acquire that company and sell it under their IBM name"

2021-05-17 11:43:25,stocks,"The spin off isn’t because of there being no business. It is because IBMs processes are still straight out of the 60s. Their management is utterly incapable of transforming this consultation in to a higher yield business because change is scary, so instead, they’re cutting off the limb.

If NewCo doesn’t pull their heads out of their 1960s asses, they’re going to bleed business faster than you’ve ever seen.

I would not look at newco until they prove they’re interested in evolving to modern pipelines.

Anyone who’s ever had to deal with IBM in the last few years has uttered the words “why the fuck does this take 4 months? Every other business we deal with has response times in hours, not months…”"
2021-05-16 22:14:30,stocks,"There was absolutely no rational reason to bet long on AAPL in 1998 (iMac was a big surprise that year). The fact that they became so successful was as predictable as pets.com failing or Google exploding (each launching that year). 

By your logic we should just invest in every single company because they might become an unprecedented breakaway success 10 years later?"
2021-05-16 21:03:41,stocks,"That's true, but what will it be worth in the future?"

2021-05-17 00:24:02,stocks,"Upgrading fabs are billions of dollars worth investments and take about a year or
more to ramp up. Then there are yield issues. When they start early samples yields are dismal like 2%. They need to refine the process to increase yield at an acceptable level before going into mass production. 

Also not all chips need to be at lowest possible process mode. I’d say only premium tier phones take advantage of 5nm node right now. Global chip shortage is not related to what process nodes it’s just that we have limited number of companies that can make chips and they are not able to meet demands due to increase in demand for remote work and in-home entertainment."
2021-05-17 09:51:26,stocks,"Your questions are exactly why it's not really a big deal. Sure, they produced one 2nm equivalent chip in a lab. But with certain semiconductor technologies like leading edge digital products (like this) or silicon carbide it doesn't really mean anything if you can produce one of them, because scaling production is the difficult part. Companies announce this type of thing all the time and then four years later you haven't heard a thing about it."

2021-05-16 22:52:51,stocks,I think he's saying time in the market bests all.
2021-05-17 13:03:54,stocks,Evaluating a stock or company is not timing the market.
2021-05-16 21:14:32,stocks,New CEO is at least a start
2021-05-17 01:05:08,stocks,"I'm a current, long term and very jaded IBMer. The ship has sailed for me and I hope to be out soon but I do see real hope for the company. Arvid is a smart guy and seems to have a lot of respect - lots of people appreciate his down to earth style. But I'm most hopeful because of the stance we have always taken (unless you go back as far as WW2) and continue to take on social justice and inclusion. I know these ""soft"" qualities don't necessarily translate to financial success but there is real potential."
2021-05-17 11:48:45,stocks,Honestly I've had no issues with their tech support at the enterprise level
2021-05-16 20:48:12,stocks,That's still a thing. In there defense. Your bound to hit some decent ones of you're patenting basically everything.

2021-05-17 05:04:23,stocks,Cloud detracts from IBM. Who want an IBM cloud for probably a higher cost than one from AWS or Microsoft that have already proven themselves.
2021-05-16 20:37:37,stocks,"Yeah seriously, an older friend of mine started a company and his company turned to IBM and became a customer with them. He met with a manager from IBM that was in charge of developing their business relationship and the manager was literally insane. He was genuinely insane. I don't mean that he's a bit weird or anything, i mean that he should be on medication.

He was - and by all accounts still is - obsessed with buying and selling used cars. He was always late to meetings because he'd spot a second hand BMW or something for a good price in AutoTrader, and he would drop everything to go and view it, even if it was in another state he had to travel to. I remember my friend telling me about an important business meeting they had where the manager completely ignored everybody, just sat there & looked irritated and didn't say a word the entire meeting. Then in the middle of the meeting out of nowehere in front of everybody he called his brother and gave him real shit for getting £250 less than he asked for for a second hand Range Rover he'd left him in charge of selling.

Another time, not long after this fiasco, a female reporter came to do a story on IBM and the manager was interviewed. The manager who was very well blessed in the groin department - did the whole interview with his dick hanging out of his trousers. He even sat up and started stretching with his dick out during the interview. The reporter was more flustered than I've ever seen anyone! When the interview was over she said that she could get him done for sexual harassment. His reply was literally the opposite of a response anyone would think of in that situation:

""You'll do ME for sexual harassment? You were staring at my cock the entire interview!"" 

It's safe to say that the type of people IBM hires are not suitable for their jobs & are literally insane."

2021-05-17 15:59:28,stocks,"I get that, but until they've proven it can scale, who would license it?"
2021-05-16 20:16:37,stocks,"Even if they did license it, clearly it wasn't enough for them to be profitable. So unless you have some reason to believe this is more significant now than it was for them to get to 7nm way before everyone else, then it means the same thing: not very much

So, do you have some reason to believe this is materially more important than when they beat everyone to 2nm by 4 years?"
2021-05-17 00:31:48,stocks,"IBM unveiled their first 7nm chip about 4 years before AMD and Intel (10nm for intel is roughly equivalent in transistor density to IBM or AMD 7nm)

And they were slow to be able to scale the manufacturing process to a meaningful level. There weren't *literally* 0 impactful products, I was being hyperbolic, but IBM's mainframe division has been in secular decline in favor of the public cloud/hyperscalers for over a decade now. So, despite having a superior chip, IBM didn't really have a meaningful product to put it in and they continued losing money and market share

And this is good PR because suckers like /u/richardswingin buy the hype. 

However, much like their previous chip breakthrough, I am highly skeptical that this will translate to any meaningful product that increases IBM's profit or helps them claw back market share. Maybe this time will be different, but I haven't been presented with any compelling evidence as to why it will be"
2021-05-16 20:56:12,stocks,Apple fought a much bigger uphill battle to get here. IBM’s is not that big of a battle considering how much cash they make. They have a lot of wiggle room still.

2021-05-17 11:52:05,stocks,"That, honestly, shocks me. 

In my dealings with them, they have nearly weekly internal downtime’s to the point that we require support to support their support.

They’re far and away the worst enterprise business I’ve ever worked with.

They have a good sales department though."
2021-05-16 20:53:50,stocks,This story is too hilarious and absurd to be true 😂

2021-05-16 22:58:58,stocks,Good point :)
2021-05-17 08:12:02,stocks,"Blackgrock and Vanguard mainly own it due to their index fonds, where it is in the S&P500 and the Dividend Aristocrat funds. 

Actually they had a 1Q Y/Y revenue DECLINE (down 2% in constant currency) in 2021. Everyone else grew 10-30% in the 1Q (at least i have not found a tech company with similar market cap that didn't grow that amount). It is falling further behind its competitors.

Last quarter they had EPS of 1.07. Using this for the four quarters means that their PE is 36. Even if we assume that EPS will be 5$ at the end of the year (i doubt it), it has a PE of 28,86. 

Taking Googles latest quarterly EPS of $26.29 that would be 21 PE this year and FB 3.3$ would be 23.4 PE. Additonally both have hardly any debt, wheras IBM has quite a lot. 

Analysts are mostly there to encourage buying, I wouldn't base my argument on them."

2021-05-17 08:01:13,stocks,They're fucking meaningless at this point. We need a new standard.
2021-05-16 21:59:09,stocks,"It used to mean something when the transistors were all the same shape, but geometry has changed.

The real metrics are transistor density and power density."
2021-05-16 23:24:55,stocks,"To add on to this

> That 2nm chip technology is a pretty big deal. Especially with the chip shortages

Especially with the chip shortages? It is going to take YEARS to be able to manufacture 2nm processors at scale. The only reason someone would even say this is if they're completely ignorant (which I think is already pretty obvious at this point, but I just couldn't let this go)"
2021-05-17 01:00:47,stocks,"Thank you for the explanation 🙏 Got it. Well, if they make the same mistake twice.. they deserve what they got coming. Hard to believe a mega Corp like IBM wouldn’t be aware of what you explained and pivot appropriately though. We’ll see."
2021-05-17 05:34:53,stocks,Maybe youre right. I am not a crystal ball. But i cant see every competitor spending what little development money they may have due to the pandemic and lack of sales due to no product to sell just waste money on hopefully finding a better solution. Itd just be easier to license it short term to get revenue rolling back in.
2021-05-16 21:13:44,stocks,"You’re right, but Apple also reclaimed its visionary leader. There’s no Steve Jobs taking the helm at IBM. 

I don’t want to say it’s impossible, but the cultural shift needed is massive and I have difficulty believing it can be pulled off.

2021-05-16 20:35:28,stocks,Agreed. People have been walking away. I know a lot in the F200 and nobody tells me about going to IBM anything. People are even starting to reevaluate RH because they have seen what IBM does to companies.

2021-05-16 21:00:50,stocks,Wasn't necessarily choosing one over the other. Just pointing out that there's so much talk about 5nm and 7nm on the TSM side vs 10nm and 14nm on the INTC side when in reality they're measuring different parts and aren't as far apart as a lay person might think.

2021-05-17 10:20:43,stocks,"People have been predicting a tailing off of transistor density increases for literally 40 years now - every single technological barrier people have pointed to has been overcome because there is sufficient economic incentive to figure out how to push through it.

They have solid early footing on AI/ML tech.. solid early footing in quantum computing.. they’ve spent a solid portion of time already focusing on share buybacks thus consolidating their value.. they have lower expenditure due to offshoring to India (with an Indian CEO that will likely know how to translate ideas between them and their US base & know how to get maximum value from that set up).. and they’re cheap right now?

Technically they are though because they failed trying to scale their 10nm chips. Their 10nm was supposed to be TSMCs 7nm for AMD"
2021-05-16 22:59:22,stocks,"Well, they are behind. They put a decade or more into defending their monopoly while failing to dedicate themselves to R&D. Hence, their competitors continuing to nag at their market share and beginning to outperform in key product classes like server grade hardware, their fabs need investment. 

The edge they have I believe is the US government to prop them up — especially confident of this now with the recent rhetoric. 

I have positions in INTC, TSM, AMD, and AAPL."
2021-05-16 23:19:32,stocks,"The physics stuff they are referring to is confinement. Electrons can do something called tunneling, where they are in one place, there is a barrier holding them in that place, and then they are outside having just magicked through the barrier. The wider the barrier, the less likely that the particle will tunnel. Chips can't get much smaller because the electrons going through them will have too high a chance to tunnel, meaning nothing will work right.

More handwaving, but a few phrases your can dive into on google if you would like to flush out the picture. Unfortunately I can't do a better ELI5 of it. Someone more talented at teaching probably could.

They're commodities that I've ended up using the way conventional wisdom said one should use bonds 10 years ago.

never see them mentioned in the news (I'm a WSJ/ Bloomberg TV/Businessweek kinda girl.) I'm baffled when they throw Bloomberg terminal graphs of commodities and exclude the Barclay's carbon credit index. The only ""non-tinfoil hat"" explanation I can think of is that they're not a volatile enough commodity to be worth discussing right now.

I can't shake the feeling that there's something I'm missing. Some kind of due diligence I'm failing to do because I don't know where to look...

Is there something other than ""stuff with higher returns is on fire sale"" that has an effect on carbon's performance as a commodity?

I'm happy to have a what seems like ""safe haven"" in my portfolio, but I feel like I'm flying blind with zero people discussing the pros and cons.

1) If I buy stock for 100 (3 years ago)

3) Then take all cash out of my Ameritrade account for a month. Then put all cash back into my Ameritrade account and rebuy everything  (One month later, all in the same year)

Will I get hit with capital gains? 

\-------Actual Situation------------------------------------------

This really happened with RDFN. I bought at 12 a share during the COVID DIP, Then sold at 70. Now I am looking to rebuy everything back at around 50.

2021-05-17 00:00:00,stocks,"AT&T ($T) in talks to combine media assets with Discovery ($DISCA) The Wall Street Journal reports that AT&T is in advanced talks to combine media assets, including CNN, with Discovery to consolidate their industry against incoming attacks from streaming.

The article states that T shareholders will maintain a large stake in the new entity. It’s unclear (at least to me) whether these media assets will be a new company altogether or be a part of Discovery.

Perhaps this suggests some of these media assets will push into cord-cutting and streaming, further suggesting the end of linear TV.

The deal is likely an attempt for HBO Max and Discovery + to form a giant conglomeration that can take on Disney + and Netflix. AT&T owns HBO, CNN, Cartoon Network, TBS, TNT, and Warner Bros. Studios. Discovery owns Food Network, HGTV, TLC, and Animal Planet.

Now do they expand HBO Max and join discovery or do they spin that off to a separate venture. That is the biggest question. 

They really need to sell off all the other crazy acquisitions they picked up under Randall Stephenson’s leadership. Direct tv acquired at $48b is a huge one, only valued at $15b now. Mexico mobile network and Latin America networks are other examples. 

I have faith in John Stankey, himself a 35 year veteran of AT&T and his leadership. If AT&T could rid themselves of some of these crazy non-profitable previous acquisitions. They will be able to turn into the amazing company they should be again. Let’s see how the market reacts to this news. I’m thinking $50 DISCA today."

I bought up a bunch of shares of YETI last year during the recession when  it was cheaper, and now it is currently my best performing stock.

I looked at old posts from 1-2 years ago and people do not seem to think  that company has long term potential. I think it does. It has expensive prices on its products, yes, but the brand name is well established and their marketing seems to be good. I see people wearing their apparel and using their products all the time in my area.

2021-05-17 10:04:49,stocks,"Until a large number of people collect Yeti products because of a different pattern on them they are not the same. Louis Vuitton has success because they stay at the forefront of their consumer's demands and have brand loyalty for frequently returning customers. Yeti may have brand loyalty, but most people don't go out and buy multiple of the same model of their products (aside from mug thermos, maybe). The consumer life-cycle of a cooler is also quite long. I still use my late father's Stanley thermos from the 80's. Purses last until fashion changes, which is often, or when the owner has a whim to buy a new one. 

If we're comparing them to a fashion company I'd compare it more to Underarmour. They hit a wall where they couldn't expand their consumer base further while knockoffs and other companies offered comparable products. Underarmour and Yeti are strong brands with heavy marketing cores, but they have their limits."

$1,000 given to your daily driver (probably where you spend a lot of your time) can make your travels a lot more enjoyable. It would probably put a smile on your face and make your brain plenty happy. That's arguably quite important. If you've budgeted for the pipes, go for it. Your head's in the right place anyway.

In my case, eventually it wore off when my life basically became work - stocks - sleep for a few months. I still live pretty frugal though. My go to now is to wait a day with big purchases (say over 100/200 euro) and see if you still want it. Also, ask yourself with purchases if it truly makes you happen or if it improves your life. 

I recently spend a ton of money on a home cinema set. I waited a week before actually purchasing and concluded it truly makes me happy. I watch several movies a week and it provides me something I truly care about.

Ask yourself if your car is that much of a pain currently, will the new exhaust system improve it and will it help you get more peace of mind? Then go for it. You're on the right track, but you can purchase stuff that makes you happy while investing enough to become FIRE."

Regretting spending frivolous sure, but you're not really in that area for buying a bag of chips on a Saturday. What is a much more common regret is not spending time with friends and family, not enjoying life etc. You should have some money every month that you can spend guilt free on living your life, how much depends on what you want to do and how much you make.

I used the pricing and yield numbers from the article and  created a spreadsheet of earning $2000 a month.  The results are as follows:

&#x200B;

JAN - $18/share with 5.0% yield, buy 2222.2 shares (current cost = $40,000)

FEB - $71/share with 5.5% yield, buy 512.1 shares (current cost = $36,363)

MAR - $86/share with 3.4% yield, buy 683.9 shares (current cost = $58,824)

APR - $52/share with 3.2% yield, buy 1179.2 shares (current cost = $62,500)

MAY - $30/share with 6.9% yield, buy 966.1 shares (current cost = $28,986)

JUN - $37/share with 4.2% yield, buy 1287.0 shares (current cost = $47.619)

JUL - $52/share with 2.9% yield, buy 1326.2 shares (current cost = $68,966)

AUG - $183/share with 2.7% yield, buy 404.7 shares (current cost = $74,074)

SEP - $60/share with 3.0% yield, buy 1111.1 shares (current cost = $66,666)

OCT - $137/share with 3.3% yield, buy 442.3 shares (current cost = $60,606)

NOV - $65/share with 4.3% yield, buy 715.5 shares (current cost = $46,511)

DEC - $104/share with 5.0% yield, buy 384.6 shares (current cost = $40,000)

&#x200B;

Again, works until it doesn't.

But I would never consider a fundamentally risky strategy like options selling a replacement for regular income, *especially* if you are using margin to do it.

The economics of many in ICLN actually have very little to do with the obvious broad shift toward increased consumption/production of clean energy. Everyone agrees this a good thing - but making earnings from it is a different story (and somewhat at odds with the objective of clean “renewable” energy in the first place). There is a big cannibalization problem and many of the heavy hitters, thus far, are really just public welfare business.

For starters, have a look at [this global water risk map](https://www.wri.org/applications/aqueduct/water-risk-atlas/#/?advanced=false&basemap=hydro&indicator=w_awr_def_tot_cat&lat=29.916852233070173&lng=-79.98046875000001&mapMode=view&month=1&opacity=0.5&ponderation=DEF&predefined=false&projection=absolute&scenario=optimistic&scope=baseline&timeScale=annual&year=baseline&zoom=3). There's also a ""Future"" tab in the top left to see possible outcomes."
2021-05-17 03:50:01,stocks,"You're right in that CSIQ is one of the more interesting companies included in this ETF. That said, it's not like their numbers will blow others out of the water. They produced a negative operating cash flow last year and they're constantly diluting shareholders by issuing more stocks. Their profit margin isn't exactly huge (4%) and I think they still have to prove their success long-term. Personally, I think the asking price is simply too high for what is being offered.

Also, bear in mind that this stock accounts for 0.51% of the total ETF volume. There aren't just solar stocks in this, but also wind (like Vestas and Orsted, both of which are overvalued at current prices). Until recently, the largest holding was $PLUG, which isn't profitable at all.

Either way, this is just my opinion, and I might have it completely backwards. Do your own DD and draw your own conclusions."

2021-05-16 21:17:47,stocks,"I am in agreement with your strategy and assessment of ETFs. However, this year was weird in that price went up faster and I traded more often. ARKK is a stock. I bought ARKK  last year in june @ $56 and  sold half my shares in dec for @$133 for 18% return on the total investment.  I made back my initial investment and then some.  I sold more in jan for $140. I kept 25% of the original shares. Just bought some more at $98 last week.   I am holding long term the original 25% since I have already made my investment back. The recent stock I bought I will sell at least half when the stock is over $145 and hold the rest, selling when it has spikes, but for the most part I will hold it. Doing this allows me to look at this stock as purely a cash vehicle selling at whatever price for a gain. I dont have to time the market after i have my initial investment back I do this with all my stocks, except the dividend plays.   I do this alot FB, TSLA, SQ, NVDA, and  Adobe, been setting up SNAP with this strategy.  I constantly do this recoup and reinvest. Use mostly Roth it saves on taxes.  I try to hold 25% of my portfolio in well researched speculative growth stocks for long term. I bought tesla in 2016 at $41 made back my initial investment.  Bought more for $42 in 2017 made back my initial investment and  little while holding the majority of shares that i bought. January sold at $800+ for pure profit."

What I look at is management, data utilization and integration and how they're saving money for all parties (corporations, insurance, patient). It's a highly sticky business model and their net promoter score is in the 90s. For health and insurance companies it's usually in the 30s. 

The TAM is huge and there's plenty of room for competition. Nothing is guaranteed but if you're offering me TDOC below $140 I'm going to happily buy. In hindsight people will look back and think ""damn, I thought this was a stay at home stock, didn't realize it was only a catalyst towards further telehealth adoption."""

2021-05-16 22:16:10,stocks,"See that's the perspective I'm looking for, the TAM. The main reason I'm not completely bearish because TDOC is in the unique position to potentially see respectable growth *while* losing market share.

I know physicians who are very skeptical of telemedicine, I feel like they're the party getting burnt when you say it saves money for all parties. How do doctors prefer TDOC, compared to competitors"
2021-05-17 08:18:21,stocks,"I did start investing in Tesla back when it was at $100 split-adjusted, and you'll be saying the same 5 years from now."
2021-05-17 13:06:40,stocks,"Agree with your thoughts and I'd assume most doctors would be taking a pay cut for services that could be performed online. My wife is a telehealth NP (different company) and she took a pay cut to have better life balance and it's saved us quite a bit of money in transportation and food costs. She loves it. 

Your point about losing market share while still having tremendous upside is an important one. If Amazon felt it weren't worthwhile to offer a narrow point of focus (essentially acute care, not ongoing treatment) they wouldn't look to enter. The knee jerk reaction is OMG Amazon is going to take over! They've entered many markets, some failed while others had varying degrees of success, but most importantly others have succeeded alongside Amazon. 

A point of differentiation is Teledoc is looking to manage patient experience; to treat the whole body and when they cannot help they'll refer to those that can. The Livongo merger is really where the long term path of Teledoc became evident. They overpaid in the short term because the synergy is immense. 

Either way it's a long term play. I'm obviously bullish and recognize I'm paying for growth. Then again, I don't feel I'm paying all that much given current prices driven in part by fear mongering over Amazon and Covid."
2021-05-17 08:38:17,stocks,"If you mean you bought Tesla for $20 pre-split, then that’s a huge win!  But it’s way overpriced now."
2021-05-17 13:11:55,stocks,"I believe your assumptions are reasonable and I am certainly reevaluating my feelings towards the stock. 

I'm a bit more bearish overall on telemedicine because I don't believe the caregiver part of the equation has been satisfactorily answered long-term. If TDOC winds up excelling there and scoring high on caregiver satisfaction I'd become quite bullish."
2021-05-17 08:52:51,stocks,"Nah split-adjusted, so $500 pre-split. And people were saying it was way overpriced back then already. Like I said, I expect in 5 years Tesla will have gone up anywhere between 3-5x from here and people will still be saying it's overpriced. Just the fact that they halved their PE ratio in 2-3 quarters despite considerable headwinds shows how quick things can change. If they keep improving margins/net income like that and the stock price doesn't follow, they'll be at a lower PE than Amazon within 1,5-2 years."
2021-05-17 14:03:38,stocks,"You're right with the caregiver angle. It's why Livongo with the hands on approach is so important. Sending equipment to the patient and instructing how to use it to help be a part of the experience also matters. As tech evolves I'm sure the integration of hands on will as well. 

Teledoc and Livongo synergy sweet spot is the merging of data between both companies under the TDOC hub. The more they can utilize data to help maintain chronic disease the better and more accurate the care will be. Insurance companies will continue to want to add TDOC as a service because it saves them money. Patients will want to interact directly with TDOC 360 because it's cheaper and more convenient. In some cases sadly it may be the only quality healthcare they'll be able to afford. 

I'm rambling at this point but I would just say we're barely touching the surface of possibilities here and it's why my money is on the first movers advantage TDOC has. They recognized they can't give full body care without Livongo. I'm sure there's going to be more aquisitions, shifts in strategy etc. The original founders at the helm of both appear genuinely focused on accomplishing this and I believe growth companies absolutely need strong management to succeed in the long term. 

My wife works for Oscar medical which is taking a different angle, streamlining their own insurance and managing the care of patients online as much as possible. Patients get lower premiums in the process. The difficulty is utilizing data to properly assign premium risk to each unique patient and it's much harder to use that data when there's so many moving parts that aren't communicating to the level needed to ensure profitability for the insurance model. Sadly they're finding people are so chronically ill that they're trying to have 5 issues managed in one appointment that's supposed to be for only a rash or yearly checkup. Being able to manage disease and in some cases prevent is where the real opportunity lies and one in which everyone wins. The inefficiencies in the health care system writ large are opportunities for disruption."
2021-05-17 14:07:49,stocks,"Also worth looking at  https://customer.guru/net-promoter-score/teladoc-inc

I believe they're up there with Netflix as far as NPS. Healthcare in general has a lower NPS which isn't shocking.

Edit: I guess that site is an estimator of NPS. I did find 95% NPS from Teledoc directly but I'm not sure if that's specifically to primary care and excluding other areas. As with anything take it with a grain of salt.

Well yes, because they are. Everyone else is using LIDAR which is limited to geofenced areas and not true FSD.

> Mobileye (intel division) has 13/15 top car manufacturers as partners, as long as they dont screw up badly, they will quickly surpass Tesla in data collection

Very unlikely. They'd need all those partners to install the same systems on all of their cars before their systems are working, which is not going to happen.

> I cant see Tesla announcing an actual fully working FSD, and not having Mobileye or Waymo like 2-3 years behind at most.

Waymo is not working on FSD like I said. Their system could work great in large cities, but it's not a global solution. Also, why would companies keep investing billions if they could already license the software from Tesla?

> So I dont see FSD being that much value to Tesla, unless they are the only ones to perfect it and have a 5+ year lead.

I think this will be pretty accurate, but even if it was just a 2 year lead and they'd only finish it in 2025 they'd be making about $60B in pure profits in 2026 and 2027 from FSD alone."

2021-05-17 11:24:25,stocks,"I'd make a case for uranium too. It's an industry entering a contracting cycle after a grim, 10-year post-Fukushima bear market that mothballed such key producing mines as Cameco's McArthur River and Paladin's Langer-Heinrich. New supply is needed to meet uncontracted demand, meanwhile U308 spot price sits at around $30 dollars a pound, a price that is a net loss for producers, who often need $50+ prices to cover mining costs and G&A.

On the growth side, Asia is the star child, with Japan restarting nuclear reactors that were closed after Fukishima, and China setting a 2025 target of 70GW power from 51GW currently. Sentiment in the west ranges from love (France), lukewarm (US), to downright hatred (Germany). But the fact is that of all net carbon zero energy sources, nuclear is both the most consistent (can constinuously supply baseload power to electrical grids) and has the longest history of use (has been giving human beings electricity since the 1950s).

Definitely a commodity worthy of consideration. If you want to start salivating, search ""2007 uranium bull run"" and feast your eyes on the wild speculation that comes when money enters this tiny market."

And that physical proves the other point. Many new investors don’t care about previous metrics or wall streets opinion. I mean I sure as hell don’t really care what they have to say, I’ll find my own value."

It could make money, though without perfect execution, I doubt it will ever be as profitable as people are hoping."

They already supplied KFC with it in limited quantities last year for some trial runs and it was amazing (I was lucky enough to try it). Beyond has a big future.

2021-05-16 22:33:50,stocks,And what would prompt this market crash?  Fairly bold statement to make.
2021-05-17 04:33:40,stocks,"Lol at the downvotes. It depends on how much you bought them for and how much loss you're willing to eat (or how much profit you can take) when selling.

The problem with holding stocks you bought at high valuations is that in the end, even if they recover (they most likely will if they're good companies), they won't have as much room to run.  I saw one YouTube analyist (Sven Carlin) saying you can expect about a 5-6% return with the current valuations, and that's assuming you don't panic sell when things tank.

If you wait for a better entry point, you can do a lot better than 5-6%.  The fact is that stocks, especially US and growth, but all stocks generally are trading really high right now.  There will be a better moment.  You just have to be patient.  Despite what the ""stocks go up crowd"" touts, things always correct.

As for me, I left my retirement money in for obvious reasons, and also some dividend stocks that I got cheap, but my ""funny money"" is on the sidelines waiting

Do your own research.  Look up the video [""Everything Money reacts to Sven Carlin""](https://youtu.be/0IqpoUTVnvI).  Great no nonsense talk about all this.  (Note: Sven is assuming interest rates remain near 0, but there's real fear that they will go up because inflation is going up and the Fed may have to fight that via raising rates).

The fact that people mass downvote you for having a genuine question goes to show that nobody has any idea that, yes, things are overvalued and at some point will have to correct.  The exuberance right now is irrational.

If you bought cheap then no worries.  The probably is that a lot of us are buying high or trying to get in high.  It's not the best idea."

2021-05-16 20:23:09,stocks,"There's that and also people are afraid that higher inflation means that the Fed will have to taper (stop printing money and raise rates). Higher rates make it more expensive to borrow, thus growth companies can't grow as much or as fast."

2021-05-17 01:22:19,stocks,"Eh, careful here. As Silent_Anybody5253 points out, the extenuating circumstances (COVID) that likely affected TJX's bottom line minimized their earnings to roughly 1/30th of what they have made the 3 years prior to 2020. As the E in P/E approaches zero, the fraction skyrockets. A company could barely break even on expenses and the P/E could be in the millions. 

Still, in this case, I'd agree that TJX is still overpriced if you factor out COVID."

2021-05-17 09:10:09,stocks,"A lot of people throw around the ""long term value"" label at recently under performing stocks, but I do think that first movers in the gene editing space have compelling long term value prop. 

Genetics is a key pillar of the future of medicine. Just look at what mRNA did for the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine race. 

Cynically, I think to an extent, there is a certain human desire to be able to ""fix"" or ""enhance"" ourselves. It's why people do botox, steroids, etc. 

Optimistically, I think the therapies will help resolve a lot of human suffering for which today there is no solution.

From an investor perspective, at the end of the day both the cynic and the optimist will be willing to pay."
2021-05-17 14:58:25,stocks,"Only 40.4M shares becoming available on the first day, with far fewer likely to come out of owners hands.  That's a minuscule amount of stock.  This could be a rocket based on that alone.  The numbers of the company are good, showing consistent growth in unique users and revenue, at rates above it's comparables, although the number of unique users is still much smaller than it competitors.  Its revenue has been growing at around 25% anually and it has turned a profit for years now.  It lost $1M in the first quarter of this year but that is almost certainly due to the costs associated with this direct listing.  

It just got trounced by Forbes and WSJ, and i think that's bullish. Forbes was saying that they should project 18% annual growth even though they've been showing growth of around 25% for years now, and that is into a market that will double by 2030.   Price on close of the first days trading is not knowable, but the long term prospects of this company, which is already self funding, which has just bought another platform, the first of many it intends to acquire, will make the current valuation of $10B seem like a massive bargain by 2030.  IMO"
