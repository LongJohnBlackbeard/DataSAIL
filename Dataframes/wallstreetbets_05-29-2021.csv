2021-05-29 19:56:00,wallstreetbets,"Sry I'm a new 🦍 here, so what is happening on tuesday?"
2021-05-29 19:56:29,wallstreetbets,What did you read to learn. I just ordered some books on Amazon to learn about options. But I always ask how people learn to broaden my search for knowledge.
2021-05-29 19:55:32,wallstreetbets,BB and NOK are on my list.. The problem is I've been investing so much time into these adding more at the moment is going to end up getting me fired from my day job haha. I can't.... concentrate... on anything else..
2021-05-29 19:56:36,wallstreetbets,I finally have enough money to buy some GME ;)
2021-05-29 19:58:01,wallstreetbets,I learned about options from [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJjRnKpwDyw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJjRnKpwDyw) \-- he's the only one that held my interest and I could follow..

2021-05-29 18:49:41,wallstreetbets,"one EU nation says ""we don't want a chinese car"" and it's a domino effect. I don't care about their projections and their results. chinese companies are HANDS OFF."

2021-05-29 18:47:52,wallstreetbets,Short to 37-34. Buy two weeks out on dip if we find support @ 37 IMO. Not financial advice.

2021-05-29 18:52:04,wallstreetbets,Makes sense. China still #1 ev market by a landslide. But they need to somehow break-into other markets for long-term sustainability IMO.

2021-05-29 18:53:13,wallstreetbets,Yea 40 resistance needs hold for the dip. Look for a possible test on Tuesday IMO.
2021-05-29 18:57:46,wallstreetbets,I do not take anything here as financial advice just discussion amongst retards and autists. Great discussion!
2021-05-29 18:59:14,wallstreetbets,Amen
2021-05-29 17:41:23,wallstreetbets,"I’m a bagholder, just not at those numbers. This meme actually made me feel slightly better. 

Also still waiting for the COIN bagholder at $429.54 to show up here."
2021-05-29 17:41:40,wallstreetbets,Some of us are bagholding all of those.  That takes a real retard.
2021-05-29 17:49:34,wallstreetbets,"how in the actual fuck did NKLA even touch that.  

\-No real product and just cool photoshop renderings

\-Fake video of truck moving from rolling downhill 

\-Companies revenue consisted of installing solar panels at ex-CEO's house

\-Former CEO is under investigation for fraud

At least the other tickers are legitimate companies lmao"

2021-05-29 18:39:08,wallstreetbets,I like that the NKLA bagholders are pointing a single finger into the open space because they know they are the biggest retards.
2021-05-29 18:45:30,wallstreetbets,When I saw AMC hit $35 i called my mom and said I'm getting a divorce.
2021-05-29 18:59:15,wallstreetbets,"AMC $32 here, bag's heavy but my beefy gorilla arms know no limits 🦍"

2021-05-29 19:45:28,wallstreetbets,I would agree if you did not have that scam NKLA in the mix. Trevor Milton needs to be in prison.
2021-05-29 17:52:52,wallstreetbets,I feel attacked.
2021-05-29 17:51:23,wallstreetbets,My poison is $COIN
2021-05-29 18:11:08,wallstreetbets,"The NKLA bagholders aren't even trying to ""squeeze the shorts."" They are just idiots who paid 90 dollars for a truck that rolls down a hill"

2021-05-29 19:58:18,wallstreetbets,"Who the fuck bought AMC @ $35? Cause I want to give your crazy ass a hug. 🫂

Edit: looking back.. I bought NAKD @ 1.59… still holding …forever."

2021-05-29 18:57:15,wallstreetbets,GME at 400 is kinda a deal
2021-05-29 19:10:34,wallstreetbets,"AMC isn't really a bagholder yet, right? Heard it's going to $60+ on Tuesday."
2021-05-29 19:49:36,wallstreetbets,PLUG at 63 🤣🤣
2021-05-29 18:10:35,wallstreetbets,If you're not holding $AMC then you are not cool like me. I'm ready to buy more on Tuesday morning
2021-05-29 17:55:30,wallstreetbets,Where's NOK?
2021-05-29 19:59:46,wallstreetbets,It seems like wallstreetbets has had a lot more negative posts on the shorts squeeze meme stocks since GME.  Is it me or am I just imagining things?
2021-05-29 19:16:27,wallstreetbets,I bought AMC at 19 last squeeze and then it dropped to 8 🤣 finally got out thanks guys
2021-05-29 19:46:02,wallstreetbets,And why don't you have NOK in this?

2021-05-29 19:39:33,wallstreetbets,"It's awesome, at one time or another I've owned every one of them except nkla. The only stock I own now is AMC."
2021-05-29 19:54:08,wallstreetbets,Lmao amc bag holder? Impossible
2021-05-29 18:28:01,wallstreetbets,"Isn't everyone a bag holder tho?  If you don't wanna pay high taxes, you gotta hold the bag for over a year."

2021-05-29 19:02:59,wallstreetbets,Where is Apple 135+ bagholder?
2021-05-29 18:59:43,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, the AMC bag holder won't be a bag holder for long, and the GME bagholder has a chance off getting out with minimal losses."
2021-05-29 18:46:53,wallstreetbets,"MVIS is killing me man, got in around 21"

2021-05-29 19:45:49,wallstreetbets,"OP, are you high? The last time AMC was $35 was in 2016.

2021-05-29 15:49:34,wallstreetbets,PLTR is an awfully retarded stock as of late. But I do truly believe in their business model and think $40b is a way low market cap for what they’re capable of

2021-05-29 18:56:31,wallstreetbets,Pltr great stonk check it out
2021-05-29 15:57:38,wallstreetbets,"Well, it depends on your risk tolerance. I’ve been trading options for a few years now. Stocks are way less risky, you can make a bad decision and still only lose 10-20%.. but you’re gains are more limited.  Option trading you have to go in willing to lose 100%. It’s much more risky. But your gains potential is much higher. 

For example, I bought most of these calls when PLTR was trading around 19.90-20.00.... i invested around $10,000. if I only bought shares my gains would have been more around $1,500... But in my situation, with owning options, if pltr simply did not change or went down to 19.50 I would have lost all $10,000"
2021-05-29 16:39:21,wallstreetbets,"I'd like to add some points to this:

You can absolutely lose all the money you pay to buy the options contracts, but they are also usually a small percentage of the price of buying the actual stock.
If you bet wrong, yes you lose 100% of it, but you can pay small amounts for options contracts (nobody is making you spend 10k like this retarded ape. You can spend $40 for a contract.)

The option will have something called a delta, or the percentage of $ change the option will see as the underlying stock moves. An option with a high delta can increase in price dramatically with the stock. The upside potential is absolutely massive. Hundreds of times the price you paid for the option can be paid out if you make a good bet.

Also, buying a stock can be riskier than an option in my opinion. I can spend a few hundred to bet on 10's of thousands of dollars worth of a stock if I'm right on my bet, and the most I lose betting on the option is the hundreds I put in.
If I put 10k on a stock, the stock's price could plummet past my stop losses and I could lose a lot more than 20-30%. Just picture a huge market crash vs a stop limit order on a stock. If everyone is heading for the door, who's gonna fill your stop limit order? If, instead, you use market stop orders all the time, you're getting scalped on the spread. Plus, that market stop can lose you massively more money than you expected.
With options, you always know exactly how much you can lose.

Considering the amount of value you can gain on the upside of buying options, versus the relatively very small amount paid for the contract, imo you end up risking a lot less on options for the payout vs what you risk buying stocks.

To answer your question though, yes you can make massively more money off options. A $4,000 call option on tesla before the rally could have made you a millionaire. You would have had to invest 100K directly into the stock for the same result.

Just... be careful. Because anytime you bet wrong, you can lose your whole investment if it expires worthlessly. Of course, you can sell the option early and get some of your money back from the time value on the contract.
So start small and don't go betting your whole account at once. IMO."

2021-05-29 16:48:05,wallstreetbets,"I have been investing for a few weeks now, only buying and selling stocks. I've made around $300ish since i started which i think is alright.

But i have been looking into options and how they work and i might play around with some smaller ones with about $1000 of money and see where it goes. I know i could make a good bit, but also lose that 1k just as easily. Buying low and selling high makes me feel better and holding till it's high is fine with me. But that your money is gone if it doesn't pan out makes my heart hurt and i haven't even made a single option trade yet."

Potential Downside I see with this is maybe a lack of trust in the executives if found guilty. I don’t really see this effecting the company long term unless the execs bring down the company with them if they go to jail but I see a fine as more likely if found guilty. Again I’m just thinking out loud here I don’t know very much ab legalities.

Nuke is cheaper, more environmentally friendly (even without reprocessing), than anything other than hydro and that is debatable. It also has the highest power factor of any power production types.
Edit wording largest vs highest."

2021-05-29 19:28:37,wallstreetbets,Hydro is definitely useful however limited. I did a report in my high school physics class but obviously I was in high school about tidal hydro generators. Tides only do not move for 4 hours per 24 and could theoretically create alot on energy if placed correctly. However the obvious problems are aquatic life and vessel travel lol.

2021-05-29 17:12:49,wallstreetbets,It's a well known fact that there isn't the physical quantity of silver or gold. That's true- but it's known and continues to be known so there will be no rush on it.

2021-05-29 15:15:21,wallstreetbets,😂
2021-05-29 14:43:11,wallstreetbets,"The amount is the number of contracts. And each contract is 100 shares. So yes, the amount is 30x100"
2021-05-29 14:48:04,wallstreetbets,I already sold gains first 💯
2021-05-29 15:15:42,wallstreetbets,Wtf are you talking about man they’re July 17th Calls
2021-05-29 14:49:18,wallstreetbets,Can you elaborate? I buy contracts with very little understanding of how they work. I know I shouldn’t buy without fully understanding everything but I’m too lazy to do the research
2021-05-29 15:06:56,wallstreetbets,Who is holding shorts?
2021-05-29 15:20:57,wallstreetbets,Is this actually a rule-of-thumb??

2021-05-29 15:39:53,wallstreetbets,"Bought BB calls on Friday at open, sold around peak at a 250% gains. Easiest 15k I ever made."
2021-05-29 17:39:38,wallstreetbets,To be honest BB is more than just a meme stock. They’re not a cellphone company. Blackberry provides security software and services and just last February they started a partnership with Amazon. You know richest country in the world and a lot of their software will be used in many of the EV vehicles you’ll see on the road. Call me a retard but BB will hit $100 within 2 years.
2021-05-29 19:31:21,wallstreetbets,"True, I’m in 2K."

Ok Yoda. 

I actually disagree with you. If your crystal ball works so well then why aren't you a millionaire living on a beach in the Caymans somewhere? oh yah... your ball doesn't work and you can't predict the future."
2021-05-29 15:15:21,wallstreetbets,I thought people have been pushing NOK.
2021-05-29 14:48:50,wallstreetbets,"Break even is strike price which is Target Price + premium. 

Average cost = premium which is $1.51. 

Break even 11.51 means these are $10 calls. That expire 7/16"
2021-05-29 15:26:01,wallstreetbets,Shit I thought this was a casino. I must be lost. I just buy stuff and hope for the best
2021-05-29 16:38:45,wallstreetbets,I also had BB Friday calls @ 10.00 brought it on thrusday made 10k 😊
2021-05-29 16:17:22,wallstreetbets,"Bought a few 6/18 15calls Thursday @ close, up 500% by early Friday. Still holding a couple for fun, they’re more than paid for. Just like in January, bought on the Friday when all meme hell was breaking loose & 10 bagged on Monday afternoon. The BB delayed reaction strikes again. 👍"
2021-05-29 15:37:41,wallstreetbets,Thanks!
2021-05-29 15:26:48,wallstreetbets,Hahah thats how its done. Buy and hope!!

2021-05-29 14:17:33,wallstreetbets,Buy shares please..
2021-05-29 09:04:13,wallstreetbets,Target was 300 for the day. Someone had to lose during a meme stock bull week.
2021-05-29 14:56:26,wallstreetbets,Vrrrmm vrrmm definitely turned sideways.
2021-05-29 14:35:29,wallstreetbets,He was gambling like most of the apes. If it hit he would have had crazy return on investment. Check out NVDA and what happened on Friday. If you bought 0dte 645c at open would have made a fortune.
2021-05-29 15:02:19,wallstreetbets,Way too many 250c and 300c and everything around them needed hedged. I felt that would put the price to 300 - 350: 300 minimum for the day. That would have turned 7k into 114k at $300 and likely a hell of a lot more on volume.
2021-05-29 14:30:37,wallstreetbets,This is a Wendy’s
2021-05-29 15:03:55,wallstreetbets,Kelvin definitely controls the remote.

2021-05-29 14:36:38,wallstreetbets,"Heyo - I'm very bullish on OTR autonomous freight and excited to see more companies available to invest in that operate in this area.

But, I want to call out two additional risks to autonomous freight compared to taxis that we should keep in mind:

\-**Legislation burden** \- Long distance trucking, with the exception of large states (CA, TX, AK), requires vehicles to cross state lines. That means, before autonomous OTR freight catches on, it will require synchronized legislation with multiple states and the fed. Taxis in one city have a lower legislation burden because likely only requires state/city approval.

\-**Depots** \- There is already a technology that allow a single individual to haul massive amounts of freight, meaning the human labor/ton of freight ratio is great. That technology is.... trains! What are the downsides of freight trains? Limited delivery points and delays in freight yards. Hence the power of trucking. However, autonomous trucking will start, as you mention, with highway traveling. That means these trucks will have to arrive at a depot, unload, and wait for a local driver. Now, I still believe that this is much more efficient use of capital, assets, and labor, but keep in mind that autonomous trucks and required depots begin to take on the look and logistical nightmare that are freight trains.

All that said, I still think that autonomous OTR is the future.

EDIT: I looked at TuSimple's investment deck, and it appears that most states have some level of approval for autonomous trucking so maybe that legislative burden is lower than I thought..."

It opened at $262 so you only needed a ~15% move for those 300s to be ITM, which isn’t crazy at all for GME.

Funny enough, I’m curious what time of day you bought them? I sold 300CCs around 11am when it was at around $245."

2021-05-29 15:34:46,wallstreetbets,"""AMC is currently the most shorted stock in the market as we speak."" That's just not true, the current short interest is 21% of the free float. Would love to know where you get your numbers from. Can you point to any source on the short interest?

Out of 450M there are currently roughly 94 million shares sold short. So AMC is definitely not one of the most shorted out there

Here is the source I used for the short interest.

2021-05-29 14:21:09,wallstreetbets,It hit $35.50 Friday AM at 6:30 and was sold off/shorted down to 29.00 for market open.
2021-05-29 13:54:53,wallstreetbets,"Last week was more of a gamma squeeze combined with a retail circle jerk (FOMO).

Remember if shorts wanted to fully cover they could within hours given the the huge volume. They've increased their short positions slightly so their covering is not driving up the price. They're trading options to make money off the movement and cover themselves in the event of sharp swings.

Given that the current call options pricing has skyrocketed it should break down sometime next week. The smart money is on selling out of money credit spreads I think. Retail is reaching hard for them and the premiums are off the hook. And buying $18-20p layered out 2-4 weeks.

BTW AMC doesn't even crack the top 40 list of most heavily shorted stocks currently: [https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest)"

2021-05-29 16:47:03,wallstreetbets,"I'm sure it can reach that price, but as you said that is a price target after the squeeze. In my retarded opinion the squeeze should send us to at least 10k. Not financial advise."

2021-05-29 13:09:19,wallstreetbets,I’ll cheers to the OP. I hope it pans out
2021-05-29 15:04:01,wallstreetbets,"This is all attributed to the popularity of this being a WSB MEME stock. Basically the people that missed the GME rocket jumped on the next big thing. Add in the institution's shorts and now having to cover said shorts. I mean do you really think AMC is a $20 stock? The movie theater is becoming antiquated. Sure, vaccines are rolling out and COVID is slowly becoming less stressful, therefore people are going. But take HBO Max for example, you don't have to pay $15 for 1 movie, you pay $15 for a month of content. 

I'm just not seeing any need for technicals when $AMC is riding a similar wave to $GME. 

I do like your research, report, and processing of data though."
2021-05-29 14:54:53,wallstreetbets,Don’t worry… I bought so many amc shorts yesterday that I should be rich by this time Wednesday

2021-05-29 14:15:46,wallstreetbets,Someone rebuttal this with logic
2021-05-29 13:02:10,wallstreetbets,"Nothing but bullshit in the OP’s post. 

There is minor potential for small short squeeze for this stock (days to cover is 1.8).  The perpetual gamma squeeze based on the assumption of a short squeeze and people holding shares is the driver of this stock. Stock goes up based on option calls.

This is not the most shorted stock as the OP claims.

When AMC dilutes more in order to save itself from bankruptcy (which it still has to do) then your investment will vanish as the stock is diluted. 

This is unavoidable. There is nothing that can prevent this reality from occurring and it will occur within several months.  Until then though you can enjoy more gamma squeezes as options approach expiry on Friday’s."

2021-05-29 13:48:51,wallstreetbets,"Basically in February when AMC had its ""short squeeze"" the hedge funds were fucked, right, they bet billions of dollars on like a couple dollar per share shorts so when that went up to $10 to $15 to $20 per share, the hedge funds were fucked, right, they had to cover they're shorts and it would put them hundreds of billions in debt. however to cover a short you can either pay it off, or borrow more shorts form the brokerage, they lend out short shares that are expected to be paid back. usually a company has hundreds of millions of short shares available. so when it had that squeeze back in February the hedge funds had to cover their shorts which was billions of dollars, but, they didn't have to cover ALL of their shorts because AMC will MAKE hedge funds pay a fraction of the shorts that they owe (usually when the price reaches highs and brokerages get scared) and then let them borrow the rest. and that's what they did. they kept borrowing shares so that they didn't have to pay the hundreds of billions that they owe. however after the squeeze since the hedge funds still had most of their shorts to cover since they borrowed even more instead of paying them off, they were still trying to get the most out of debt possible, and to do that they had to keep shorting it. WELL MOTHERFUCKERS IT IS TIME. THEY HAVE JUST BEEN CONSTANTLY SHORTING IT FOR MONTHS. THERE ARE NO MORE SHORTS AVAILABLE TO BORROW. THE HEDGEFUNDS ARE HAVING TO PAY PAY BECAUSE LIKE I WAS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER YOU CAN EITHER PAY OR BORROW MORE AND THERE SIMPLY ISNT ANYMORE TO BORROW THEY HAVE TO FUCKING PAY THE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THEYVE BEEN PUTTING OFF FOR THE LAST 3 MONTHS. AND BETTER YET THE STOCK HAS TRIPLED THIS WEEK AND THE HEDGEFUNDS HAVE PAYED CLOSE TO 0% OF WHAT THEY OWE. THEY HAVENT EVEN STARTED TO PAY YET."

2021-05-29 14:17:34,wallstreetbets,the thing is all those stocks are shorted cause theyre going down so if it keeps going down itd be logical to short to make money so thats why there are plenty of stock much more shorted than amc but the thing is amc has tripled in price since most of the shorts so why would you short a stock thats only going up. its to get the stock down so they can cover their shorts at the best price possible now us retail investors have them in a position where they are astronomically frucked right now so i believe your facts are right but the the logic and common sense isnt all there
2021-05-29 14:32:42,wallstreetbets,FUD.. I don’t see GME on that list either. Soooo go back to WSB

2021-05-29 15:06:36,wallstreetbets,More price action is needed to determine if 25.5$ will hold. I strongly believe so because even though we had HUGE volume on Friday (as big as Thursday) the bears did not manage to push the price down into Thursday’s price action very far (-1.51%). High volume bars are associated with strong support levels in the market and when price revisits these support levels we should see strong demand.

2021-05-29 16:46:24,wallstreetbets,Haven’t followed UWMC so can’t say. Just looked at it and for sure there is strong resistance with many layers to break on the way up. AMC has one layer to break and it’s 35$ so seems to me it’s a better bet with AMC at this point.

2021-05-29 14:43:40,wallstreetbets,"The stocks are heavily shorted because investors believe they are over valued.

The people shorting AMC read reddit lol and buy call options and sell puts, they go in and out of short positions daily. Yesterday alone they could open a short at $35 and close at $26 and gain 25% in hours.

Remember if AMC shorters felt like they are fucked they'd buy to cover as there is plenty of volume to do that then just reopen at a higher price for more possible gains. If short interest is INCREASING it tells you what their thought process is.

The bottom line retail buyers are driving up AMC price hoping that someone will throw them a lifeline and buy it from them at that higher price but it's not going to happen. Even if 100% of the short interest was covered, which is 20% of the stock right now, 80% of people holding the stock would be fucked as there would be no buyers left for them."

AMC has no choice but to pay down debt in order to operate due to size of debt and the cost to service it.

You new investors are going to get smoked when these meme stocks are done , we are no longer talking about why the squeeze is going to happen , we are talking about people who try to time it , ya know like the retards who bought GME $850 calls from Melvin capital of a few months back ?

2021-05-29 19:24:35,wallstreetbets,"No. 

HF's have a maxpain point. There have been several posts about maxpain and what it means is they know there is 100,000 ITM calls, and 100,000 PUTS and they try and manipulate the price to the penny to NOT PAY those that are ITM. In other words, calls over say 27 are ITM and PUTS under 26 are ITM so they park it at 26.50 to fuck both sides. Now sure, some people still win, those who bought really high/low/early but there is a point where MOST people LOSE. That's how they rig the price. They use shorts and buy ITM PUTS (taking a loss) to lower the price right to the cent to bring max pain. Retail doesn't have enough cash to offset this, and they can also use illegal dark pool trading where they only report the sells and not the buys, so it alters the percieved price. It would be like having 500 buys and 200 sells, and only reporting the 200 sells. This is how they manipulate the price to fuck us. Since learning this, I always exit my calls before Friday morning as I always get fucked. Also, institutional traders, day traders, week traders close their positions Friday morning. Now when this happens, all those shares that Market Makers bought to cover, can now liquidate them and do, driving the price further down. At 3pm, all Robinhood's calls expire and they do a massive stock sell dumping the daily price into the red."

2021-05-29 19:16:59,wallstreetbets,"Way too many GME holders spreading FUD about AMC. Before you bash AMC look at the large amount of DD. It’s been very heavily shorted with so many synthetic shares printed the amount of actual outstanding shares is probably in the billions. Yes, GME has a smaller float and it will moon higher, but that doesn’t change the fact that AMC is a legitimate money play that will also squeeze crazy high. 

AMC mooning is good for GME. No one who owns GME is selling for AMC. And when AMC moons it will likely cause GME to moon at the same time, or vice versa. Or even better, if AMC moons first, tons of apes will take their profits and put them into GME. Stop spreading AMC FUD cause both are legitimate plays and are beneficial to each other.  And yes I hold both AMC and GME."

2021-05-29 14:12:11,wallstreetbets,It honestly kind of irks me that wsb is getting all the credit on the media. We were pretty much bashed and exiled from this sub by the gme crackheads. What I do like is that we have 10 million members in this sub which will definitely cause a short squeeze. Gorilla gang 🦧
2021-05-29 12:54:55,wallstreetbets,How does one make videos like this? I have an idea for a video and I want to try it out. Also can we use any movie ?

2021-05-29 16:19:38,wallstreetbets,"My new fellow apes, not financial advice but just what I've experienced. I've jumped on to gme and amc and as most infant apes, ape sold his share of bananas early due to fear mongers. Short after ape seen if ape would've had gorilla balls ape would've been able to achieve goals ape desired to better the circumstances for ape family. I've reevaluated apeself and jungle. Apes lost of opportunities had a common denominator and it was panic selling. Ape dont sell bananas no more. 600 shares and holding to zero or hero. But ape knows not zero just hero!"

I am also in amc and gme. But I feel like amc has gotten so much more popular for newer ppl. And I dont get it. Is it the low price? Amc's floor is 100k while gme's is 10 mio. And in my knowledge they both have equal chances of squeezing (maybe even higher for gme). Why are so many ppl interessted in amc while you could make so much more money with gme. 
As I said, I have both stocks and i like them both. But why do newer ppl only go for amc?

2021-05-29 19:04:36,wallstreetbets,Hold both! That’s the way
2021-05-29 14:38:01,wallstreetbets,"if it was all for one it wouldnt have messed with leading HF like it has. With both putting pressure on these HF we are stronger. If you're in GME and not happy because AMC is seeing movement step back and be a team player because we as a group are forcing their hand. GME as a singular would have led to a bigger onslaught from the HF. Splitting the HF ammo in to 2 tickers is limiting their damage. It may take longer but it will lead to 2 tickers hitting high numbers. But GME's ceo isnt running a share count and isnt pushing the offensive on these MM/HF's like Adam Aron is. DFV started a great movement but 1 guy does not control the collective and his  words now are just emotes of encouragement with no voice. AMC has so many voices that show so much more analytics...either way, pick a side but both are working in tandem"
2021-05-29 14:28:27,wallstreetbets,"I have shares of both, as most people do. We can do two things at once, AMC is a good move rn.  DFV is not the only way"
2021-05-29 17:59:56,wallstreetbets,AMC is for the working man or woman. So more people will bet on a cheaper stock.
2021-05-29 14:56:11,wallstreetbets,Amc fud everything on wsb is fud for me haha
2021-05-29 14:11:26,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, it’s like amc takeover rn"
2021-05-29 15:15:31,wallstreetbets,"You don't know if DFV doesn't have shares in AMC. I would bet that he does, just can't post about it.

AMC is still in its infancy, theres a much bigger possible upside, plus the shares are much more accessible price wise."

2021-05-29 15:20:09,wallstreetbets,"Because we've seen this movie before (no pun intended), and it's playing exactly the same. Even your comment fits the script, when gme jumped from 20s-30s in an hour, people saying that was the squeeze *it wasn't*

The price action last week was retail just loading up and FOMOing.

When this starts halting because of too much movement, then maybe it's squeezing."
2021-05-29 13:21:19,wallstreetbets,I'm just holding to see what happens after GME and AMC  votes are all accounted for
2021-05-29 15:25:50,wallstreetbets,"Compare the squeeze to GME. A price range from 25-40 is not a squeeze. With all those short % still, the price should go beyond 100. The hedge is manipulating the market right now to make diamond hands and paperhands sell their shares."
2021-05-29 13:41:30,wallstreetbets,They haven't covered yet. Go on YouTube where people explain it and stop seeking help on reddit.
2021-05-29 16:58:04,wallstreetbets,Yes But it piss Him off he lost his voice screaming 😱 so it was worth 😉 it.
2021-05-29 13:25:04,wallstreetbets,"""I'm new and don't really understand the market""

Sounds like you managed to find the right place. For beginners, we usually recommend yolo'ing your life savings into a few FD's. I mean, who wants to work for the rest of their lives, amirite? Anyhow, just put all your money into some AMC $40 calls for next week - literally cannot go tits up. See you on the moon"
2021-05-29 13:13:50,wallstreetbets,I looked at AMC stock and it's currently close to where it was in 2016. I'm buying at peak expecting a sharp dip when the market opens on monday morning. I know literally nothing.
2021-05-29 13:24:51,wallstreetbets,"Don't worry neither do 90% of the people in on this trade. Bottom line up front, noone knows where this ends, but noone in their right mind thinks AMC or GME as companies are actually worth what they are trading for right now, it's all about the squeeze. You're late to the party, maybe not too late, but you have a lot more to lose than people who bought in at the beginning because your cost basis is way higher. 

In my personal opinion the hedge funds are going to pull some bullshit in the end and retail is going to get screwed, even if that bullshit is just declaring bankruptcy (the bad kind) and leaving the rest of the market holding the bag. In which case yay you ""won"", but you're also not getting shit because the people who were obligated to buy the shares went out of business instead, oh and the market might crash too because it might create a domino effect. If Lehman brothers fell so can Melvin and Citadel.

As far as general market intro and where this might be headed, I recommend watching the movies ""Margin Call"" and ""The Big Short"" for a fun intro that's obviously not that accurate. 

After that it gets harder because you actually need to start reading to learn, investopedia is a good start, and there's a variety of books to read about the market. Stay away from anything promises a get rich trading scheme because it's probably copy paste shit from investopedia mixed in with bad advice. Warren Buffett's book is good, but very TL;DR and is tough to get through if you're just looking for the essentials."

2021-05-29 14:59:15,wallstreetbets,well the point being that the squeeze of GME is gonna be bigger so having money in both is worse for you. If they don't squeeze in parallel it don't matter and you can maybe even put your AMC gains in GME but still if I had the choice I think I would pick GME. I know the barrier of entry is higher because of the price but it's just more worth it

That's the bad version of bankruptcy where the company is just liquidated and the courts determine what contracts are still valid and who gets paid out from what's left. Usually at least some of the creditors are left bag holding because there's no money left.

That's obviously not their strategy and doesn't benefit them at all, I'm just saying I think they're dumb enough to keep trying until they have no other option.

2021-05-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Amazon should consider buying Gamestop due to natural synergies between the two business models. Here's my full case. **1: Amazon wants to open up physical stores to sell over-stocked computer equipment from their warehouses. Gamestop has suitable locations for them all across the country to do so.**

Amazon has been looking into this idea even before the pandemic, and delayed its plans because of the pandemic. Essentially, Amazon has a bunch of excess stock of computer equipment in its warehouses that they really just want to get rid of (since it costs money to store). Instead of throwing it out they would prefer to sell it - even at a big discount. This is likely stuff like older graphics cards, monitors, computers etc. This solves a key issue with Gamestop's business model: Gamestop's margin's suck. Selling computer equipment that would have just been thrown out anyway means that every dollar sold is a dollar saved.

&#x200B;

Here's the original news report for anyone who wants more information:

&#x200B;

**2: A number of ex-Amazon executives already work at Gamestop in the C-Suite**

Due to this - the cultures of the companies are likely to become very similar and people at Amazon and Gamestop are likely to have worked together in the past. This makes any type of business combination much easier

&#x200B;

Here's a couple (I'm sure you guys can add more to this list): 

Chief Growth Officer (CGO):  Elliott Wilke 

Chief Operating Officer (COO):  Jenna Owens

Chief Technology Officer (CTO):  Matt Francis

&#x200B;

**3: A clean exit from a short selling debacle**

Many people have floated around theories of naked short selling, imaginary shares, etc. No matter if you believe these are correct or not lets make an assumption here that there is something fishy going on. If there is something fishy going on, there's nothing the SEC would like more than to neatly sweep it under the rug. Lets say this fishy thing makes it so that closing all short positions in GameStop would cause the stock price to skyrocket due to a share shortage and pose a serious threat to the entire financial system. Obviously this isn't a great outcome if the financial system fails

How does Amazon solve this? An all-stock deal. Short sellers go from being short Gamestop to being short Amazon. The number of liquid shares of Amazon is far greater in dollar value than the liquid shares of Gamestop. This means that short sellers would be able to close out of their position without pushing up Amazon's stock price to some ridiculous number

&#x200B;

**4: Amazon has the cash to bankroll and supercharge Gamestop's innovation**

Between developing NFTs and reinventing their business Gamestop has some challenges ahead of it. To execute on their strategies they will need cash to do so. An Amazon + Gamestop merger is more valuable than Gamestop alone and Amazon alone. Furthermore Amazon could benefit from this Gamestop's NFT technology (think digital rights management solution for all of Amazon's content) and expand its market share in collectables and gaming.

&#x200B;

**5: Amazon could use a distraction from news focusing on thwarted worker unionization attempts**

Being able to shift the news narrative from ""Amazon kills unionization attempts"" to ""Amazon saves \~50,000 jobs at struggling retailer Gamestop"" seems like an obvious perk of doing this deal

&#x200B;

Just a couple recent articles about Amazon:

Frontpage news was made fairly recently as Amazon defeated a unionization attempt

[https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/5/19/amazon-plans-for-new-alabama-warehouse-after-us-union-defeat](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/5/19/amazon-plans-for-new-alabama-warehouse-after-us-union-defeat)

&#x200B;

**6: Jeff Bezos is looking for a new project. Being the biggest champion of GameStop would cement his legacy**

Now that Jeff Bezos is stepping down as CEO of Amazon, he has time to work on new projects. Gamestop sounds like a fun fixer-upper for a billionaire with some extra time on his hands. Furthermore the rivalry between Elon Musk and Bezos has never been greater; their competing space projects (blue origin and spacex) have gone head to head in recent years. Elon has a key advantage that Bezos doesn't though - a die-hard fanbase. Arguably these fans have really powered SpaceX and Tesla's success - as Elon's celebrity status draws in talent and sells product. Bezos, while popular doesn't quite have the same type of energized fans. Buying Gamestop would also buy him an army of WSB apes and close the gap.

Elon & Jeff have been rivals for years:

[https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-elon-musk-rivalry-history-timeline-2020-7](https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-elon-musk-rivalry-history-timeline-2020-7)

Plus, now that he is single he has time to play videogames!

&#x200B;

**7: Bootstrapping Amazon's P/E Ratio**

Buying GameStop would make Amazon look cheaper (in terms of P/E ratio). As of 5/28 yahoo finance is showing forward (next 12 months) PE ratios of 54 for Amazon and 37 for Gamestop (price around 220) as of 5/28

Having a P/E ratio of 54 and buying a company with a PE ratio of 37 makes the combined company have a P/E ratio somewhere between the two. Amazon P/E ratio going from 54 to less than 54 makes the stock look like a better deal to investors."

I actually would be disappointed if Amazon bought out Gamestop."
2021-05-29 14:46:28,wallstreetbets,"Amazon prefers deals. They have a leadership principle, ""Frugality,"" that they take seriously. GME at current prices is anything but a deal."
2021-05-29 18:07:35,wallstreetbets,"No, GME doesn’t need Amazon and why mix good press with bad press. GME has goodwill from the public. Ryan Cohen is seen more favorably than Bezos. Besides why buy GME when Amazon can just get another bailout from the government?

Write off the comp parts as a loss or sell to government and problem solved. 

“I’m sure Biden will be more than happy to write Bezos a check! Let’s circle back on that.”

This does not mean GME is a bad company, it just means its not worth for amazon to buy them."
2021-05-29 17:58:23,wallstreetbets,Everyone in the world knows that gme is simply a playground for investors who want to make a quick buck. A PE ratio of 54 for amazon is justified because it is a growth stock and has demonstrated a robust business model. But 37 for amc? It’s extremely overvalued. Amazon is not retarded. Interesting read but I disagree with your reasonings
2021-05-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"AMC & GME Price Action Comparison before their squeeze What's going on y'all

&#x200B;

Just want to share some charts and information that I noticed while comparing AMC and GME before the squeeze

&#x200B;

So as you all know, this past week has been one for the books for AMC, from it's low on Monday, May 24th we witnessed an increase of 201% on AMC. Now this got me thinking and made me want to look back at the history of how GME started to move before it's squeeze.

&#x200B;

If you look at the candles closely, they are very very alot alike

&#x200B;

1. GME's breakout candle, on Thursday, January 13th and AMC's breakout candle, on Wednesday, May 13th are almost identical
2. After both breakouts, they traded above the bollinger bands for 3 back to back sessions
3. After GME's breakout, we saw a consolidation of price action for 5 trading sessions
4. After AMC's breakout we saw a consolidation of price action for 7 trading sessions
5. From GME's low on it's initial breakout to it's high the Friday before the squeeze, we saw on increase of 283%
6. From AMC's low on it's initial breakout to it's high the Friday before the potential squeeze, we saw an increase of 245%

&#x200B;

This is where things get interesting...

&#x200B;

The bullish candle that was formed for GME on Friday, January 22nd looks ALOT like the bullish candle formed on Thursday, May 27th for AMC

The spinning top candle that was formed for GME on Monday, Jan 25th looks alot like the spinning top candle formed on Friday, May 28th for AMC

&#x200B;

Taking into consideration the market is closed on memorial day, is this history repeating itself? If it is, that would mean the squeeze will start next week? Now I don't want to attach certain dates, I'm just sharing more information with you all. You be the judge of it.

2021-05-29 17:46:57,wallstreetbets,"here are some things investors may want to consider. The #AMC500k hashtag on Twitter is being used to promote the idea that AMC's stock price could soar all the way to $500,000 per share, up from $26.52 today. If that were to occur, with its over 490 million shares outstanding, AMC's market capitalization would be about $245 trillion. That might be a wee bit high for a struggling movie theater chain, particularly since the total market cap of all U.S. public companies is roughly $50 trillion. So, market will adjust it, this is something you should consider."
2021-05-29 13:56:52,wallstreetbets,#Who else buying on TUESDAY?
2021-05-29 14:10:02,wallstreetbets,AMC shorts have no reason to cover. The company itself pisses money every day. They will never make a profit and have 0 plans to fix any of it. So retail you can push this stock to 100 dollars. All your going to do is have them increase their short position at higher numbers..... We traded 635m shares on Thursday with a 450m float. So hate to break it to you guys but shorts didn’t cover and it appears this was just retail unloading shares at higher prices onto other retail investors.  So unless amc actually does something like a streaming service or gets bought out by another company that actually knows what they’re doing. I don’t see any situation where shorts will cover. All these news articles you read are fooling you. “Shorts lost 1.6 billion on amc today”. Yeah bud that’s unrealized losses. They can wait all year for that shit to go back down so they make their money back. Short of a absolute market crash of 40% across the board. No ones getting margin called.
2021-05-29 14:25:25,wallstreetbets,What happens when amc dumps there 113 million shares they have just sitting around. And is no one paying attention to citadel playing both calls and puts? I think it's a trap. No way they will let it happen again especially since everyone knows about it.
2021-05-29 12:47:49,wallstreetbets,Do you think it will dip before it gets there

2021-05-29 14:03:19,wallstreetbets,I am glad that you put this comparsion up. I have been telling the folks here that AMC recent rise is very similar to GME back in Jan especially in that two weeks period but only few believed me.

2021-05-29 18:42:22,wallstreetbets,"Just my prediction based on my past feelings about things like this: Tuesday June 1st will be a huge Green Day for AMC because people will try to buy as many shares as they can for the vote on June 2nd. June 2nd could go either way red or green but I think will trade relatively sideways and end down 1-5% from the day before because people will want to see where we end that day. Then up till Friday next week I think it’ll be relatively calm as well moving no more than 10% up or down. Then the following week starting that Monday and whenever AMC does whatever they’re doing with their stock based on the vote from June 2nd, it’ll be huge Green Day’s from there on out with few days in between where it doesn’t go up more than 20% consecutively. Just a theory."

2021-05-29 19:59:31,wallstreetbets,"🚀🚀🐵THIS IS AN INVESTMENT APES🐵🚀🚀
Let me explain something real quick that everyone needs to get behind if this is going to work. This is an investment in a business which can 🚀 regardless of our level of support. We have an opportunity here to make history & make this company really takeoff just  like Tesla & Amazon🚀. So here is the important thing to remember. Stay in, no matter what. Even after you hit your goal. Stay in. (You might regret it later) Let me explain why: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀m.h🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Say you get into AMC and plan to buy some thing with your CASH. Let’s say it’s a Tesla for god sake, if this stock hits $100 in value, & you think that’s a good chunk & get nervous & you pull out, then it all avalanches, everyone pulls out. And all this fails. Now say it hits $1000  in value, & you pull out, then it avalanches, then everyone pulls out, & It all fails . Now let’s say we all stay until it’s well into 1k(like Tesla), 2k(like google), 3K(like Amazon) and beyond  (Berkshire Hathaway) 400k 🚀. You pull out a fraction, and you have what you wanted) AND MOST IMPORTANTLY the stock stays strong, and we all win.
Control APES 🐵. Patients APES 🐵. We all chip in, we all stay patient, it’s no longer a meme or a gimmick. It gains legitimacy AS MORE TIME PASSES, other investors develop confidence in it. You get what you want and more, but that means staying in even if you’re sweating bullets and pay out looks sweet. Godspeed everyone. Let’s get rich together. And let’s get our kids rich as well. (Just imagine if AMC got into the streaming service 2-3 years from now) 
(P.S : TESLA was also shorted and squeezed to the moon 🚀🌙 ) Now look at him.......he’s actually going past the MOON. Pun intended.  #TreyTrades"
2021-05-29 18:39:54,wallstreetbets,Hoping AMC squeezes first so I can cash out thousands and throw it into gme
2021-05-29 15:29:39,wallstreetbets,I’ve heard it will only go to 50$ maybe 60 tops.
2021-05-29 16:14:22,wallstreetbets,"AMC has almost 450 M shares out and went from $ 5 ($3.11 on 20-Jan-21) to almost $30 in 4 months ...on the other hand ,CLVS has only 104.62 M shares outstanding...can justice be done to a life saving drug company ?"
2021-05-29 13:04:01,wallstreetbets,I bought in at  $10 and sold at $29. I guess I pulled out too soon?

2021-05-29 13:33:48,wallstreetbets,I think the date is Tuesday. $AMC will pop to $40 and the shorts will cover with $500m. Wednesday we pop to $50 and those high lying puts at 45p will sell for $.11 cents. Fast and furious like lightning.
2021-05-29 11:58:17,wallstreetbets,I bought some shares but Robinhood says my order hasn’t been filled yet. What does this mean?
2021-05-29 11:40:01,wallstreetbets,There is no squeeze

2021-05-29 15:23:39,wallstreetbets,So people keep saying that if the vote counts add up to more shares than actually exist it will trigger squeeze. But how exactly? It's pretty clear the shorts won't cover until physically forced to do so? Is there some mechanism I'm not aware of that would force them to buy back their shares once it's confirmed there are more votes than shares during the count? The shorts have clearly shown they have no issues doubling down with naked shorts so what's to stop them from doing it again if the vote count has more votes than actual shares?

2021-05-29 16:01:38,wallstreetbets,Yeee Babyyy thats what ive been looking for!!!
2021-05-29 16:02:42,wallstreetbets,"Here's the thing about technical analysis like this though, just because there is correlation between candle and initial squeeze does not mean there is causation. If we think about it logically, when does a squeeze happen? When shorters get margin called. What does a candle have to do with margin call unless you think a candle indicates that. But imo, that's unlikely since a margin call on AMC would surely mean a margin call on GME which has a significantly higher SI and so we should see it on GME first then.

Every single time someone tried to use the ""january candles"" to correlate it to current candles as indication of squeeze, it always fails and leads to disappointment. Just hold and wait, we have the winning hand."
2021-05-29 16:04:11,wallstreetbets,They might be rolling certain FTD cycles staggered and others the same.  Can anyone verify this?  That would explain the periodic decoupling but generally in sync chart movement.

2021-05-29 15:06:39,wallstreetbets,Well I’m in at 30/share. Let’s hope I’m not getting fucked cuz is gonna hurt. Holding Not selling
2021-05-29 15:21:08,wallstreetbets,"Based on this analytical comparison, how long do you predict the AMC squeeze lasting?"
2021-05-29 15:22:45,wallstreetbets,"I simplified it for those, like me, that get headaches from too many words....

1. Hold
2. Hold
3. Buy
4. Buy
5. Hold
6. Hold"
2021-05-29 15:23:08,wallstreetbets,"I'm back in AMC and live what's happening but lemme add this:

GME has NOT yet actually squeezed.

(But I get your point, and honestly it can be a lesson - if people hold and platforms don't start disrupting people's account access a real squeeze of AMC can happen)"
2021-05-29 15:27:27,wallstreetbets,START  YOUR   ENGINES Ape rockets!  It ain't just the Indy cars that will be squeezed on the track !     Do they sell tendies at AMC theaters yet?

2021-05-29 15:37:25,wallstreetbets,I wonder why? It couldn’t be because all I ever hear on any stock thread anywhere at anytime now is either GME or AMC related. Sooo they couldn’t potentially have almost identical trends since they will undoubtedly be the exact same purchasers and leaders of the first wave or am I oversimplifying it? I honestly haven’t paid much attention .. you know how they say if you’re reading about it in the paper it’s too late? Kinda how I felt with the pair of these
2021-05-29 15:39:54,wallstreetbets,Squeeze the shit out of the sellers it’s a bulls market now.

2021-05-29 17:36:58,wallstreetbets,"here are some things investors may want to consider. The #AMC500k hashtag on Twitter is being used to promote the idea that AMC's stock price could soar all the way to $500,000 per share, up from $26.52 today. If that were to occur, with its over 490 million shares outstanding, AMC's market capitalization would be about $245 trillion. That might be a wee bit high for a struggling movie theater chain, particularly since the total market cap of all U.S. public companies is roughly $50 trillion."
2021-05-29 17:36:58,wallstreetbets,This AMC squeeze is gonna be otherworldly
2021-05-29 17:43:54,wallstreetbets,1000th comment.
2021-05-29 17:44:22,wallstreetbets,"I hope that at the very least we don’t see this momentum wane and AMC’s price slowly fall back down. I’m hoping for some solid buying action on tuesday to get any shorts that shorted at 35 out of the money, if we can keep that type of price action for a couple of days perhaps we can force them to finally start covering, it’s really insane how they seem to be able to just never have to cover or be able to cover without us catching on."
2021-05-29 17:53:19,wallstreetbets,TLDR but bought amc shares
2021-05-29 18:17:09,wallstreetbets,Could someone explain to me what this means for the stock in the upcoming weeks?  Kind of new to this space.  I do have quite a few shares of AMC.  Is that good news or bad in the next couple of weeks? Thoughts?
2021-05-29 18:17:55,wallstreetbets,"Forgive me for my ignorance.  I’m
Need to stocks.  Been interested ever since January seeing what y’all did with GME.   So thrus and Friday I put $200 in AMC.  Could someone tell me how the squeeze works?  What triggers it?   And when do I buy more?   I’m excited!   I wanna be an ape lmao."
2021-05-29 18:25:28,wallstreetbets,Ok so realistically how high will AMC go?
2021-05-29 18:42:57,wallstreetbets,AMC 50$ and GME 300$ on Tuesday

2021-05-29 12:57:27,wallstreetbets,June 2 is just the count. July 29 is the announcement. Expect to moon way before that!
2021-05-29 12:28:41,wallstreetbets,"The voting will start after June 2 and the total number should be available after the shareholder meeting on July 29, I assume. All shares that were bought and held before June 2 will be counted"
2021-05-29 13:06:58,wallstreetbets,That’s just FUD. Short positions have actually increased last Friday. Borrowed share utilization is at 99.5%.
2021-05-29 15:22:37,wallstreetbets,"The share price is meaningless, the market cap for AMC is currently 11.76 billion, and topped out over 16 billion at the high on Friday. For what it's worth, GME market cap is currently sitting at 15.71 billion and topped out around 30 billion."
2021-05-29 14:38:29,wallstreetbets,Cause people are still messed up from that banana video
2021-05-29 13:20:19,wallstreetbets,Beast. We are in our way.
2021-05-29 14:08:13,wallstreetbets,Dumped 5k in friday at market open... market close down $1k. Buy my tears.
2021-05-29 13:53:49,wallstreetbets,If you can afford 50k worth you should get GME instead. At least it’s a fundamentally undervalued stock.
2021-05-29 14:06:14,wallstreetbets,Welcome brother🦧
2021-05-29 17:48:02,wallstreetbets,I've got two shares too! And I literally have no idea what's going on.
2021-05-29 16:42:40,wallstreetbets,That little bit of profit could turn out to be quite much for a normal human being
2021-05-29 14:54:07,wallstreetbets,Similar enough that I couldn't help but buy an AMC call yesterday. Fully expect it to expire worthless but if It does end up following the same pattern and I didn't get in I'd regret it more than the lost $$$
2021-05-29 17:52:55,wallstreetbets,"no one wants to see the price slip further down after all this momentum and how we fell $10 on friday. dips are bad at this point, we need buying at the current price and a lot of it, especially since you all are so confident in the squeeze saving a couple bucks a share won’t matter"
2021-05-29 16:58:50,wallstreetbets,"Every day they’re both below $300 is a sale tbh. At least, That’s about as high it can go before I’d not be able to buy anymore."
2021-05-29 17:27:05,wallstreetbets,why tuesday ? don't tell me the casino is closed on monday
2021-05-29 17:19:43,wallstreetbets,I bought at 35 like a smoothie 🤦🏼‍♂️😏
2021-05-29 12:12:41,wallstreetbets,I don’t think the real rising will start until after this upcoming week.  This upcoming week will rise overall but more if a consolidation
2021-05-29 13:45:22,wallstreetbets,DOn't forget HF's bought ITM PUTS and used them taking a loss to drop the price on Friday. They are getting desperate and have infinite reserves of money and fuckery to screw us. We need them to get fucked so we can moon this bi*ch
2021-05-29 18:14:53,wallstreetbets,"I'll buy more if it dips cuz I'm poor af.. but at least I finally sold my gd SNDL and freed up like $10 wooooo

Even though I expect it, how it ends up exactly at a price at the last second of the candle while it’s violently swinging up and down dollars per few seconds, it’s definitely beyond my single wrinkle."

2021-05-29 15:17:09,wallstreetbets,Right? I always see people saying that AMC has no DD. But I've probably watched and read days worth of DD over the past 4 months. Anyone bashing it hasn't been paying attention.
2021-05-29 18:37:21,wallstreetbets,Anyone believing 500k per share is a real fucking idiot cause that would literally mean the end of the financial system and be greater the US debt. You won’t even be able to pull the funds into your bank account much less see cash value

2021-05-29 16:02:15,wallstreetbets,"Assuming the votes are higher than available float, wouldn't a share recall force them to cover? I'm long AMC, not because I believe that they're worth $30+/share, but because I watched the GME saga unfold and, whether it's retail buying pressure or margin calls, I want to ride it up."
2021-05-29 16:10:06,wallstreetbets,This is the type of comments there needs to be more of.
2021-05-29 14:45:50,wallstreetbets,You are spot on. Retail is driving AMC share price which means one must sell to make money. Jim Cramer echoed the short positions as dumb. But alas we know it’s not about making money’s it’s all about social justice stick it to the rich and hedge fund folks. Right on.  Huh?
2021-05-29 15:24:24,wallstreetbets,"Except short volume increased Friday.. which means not retail unloading but increased synthetic selling pressure from shorting... 

and as per new regulations if we push their unrealized losses high enough they will HAVE to cover

Also if you have ever shorted before you’d know there are fees. AMC has very high fees. So let me know when you wanna pay like 7%/year holding an unrealized loss."
2021-05-29 19:41:31,wallstreetbets,"Hate to break it to you but retail barely makes a dent and doesn't drive share price, institutions do."
2021-05-29 13:47:04,wallstreetbets,Don’t wait for the dip! This is the dip. Next stop is the moon buddy.
2021-05-29 18:51:20,wallstreetbets,Why would they stop at 36? When they could get way more money? By squeezing it more?

2021-05-29 13:40:12,wallstreetbets,You don’t need a margin call to have a squeeze. Short sellers can feel the pressure and get out even if they aren’t margin called. Which certainly did happen

2021-05-29 15:05:31,wallstreetbets,I would assume the market had already priced this in months ago when vaccinations started (but the price kept going down and consolidating because of shorts). I’m dumb af and I already would have started buying long ago. And it wouldn’t 3x in the span of a week on no news and just vaccinations which have been happenings for months.
2021-05-29 13:34:59,wallstreetbets,"Retail investors are going to hold shares and trade options. Buying those calls forces MMs to buy shares. Buying shares on a dwindling supply causes upward pressure, making those calls print money. There's no reason to sell a single share."

2021-05-29 12:02:48,wallstreetbets,Market is closed through the weekend and Memorial day I believe. Your order will fulfill at market open if you are buying at market value. If you are buying with a limit itll only execute if your limit is reached when after the market opens and before your order expires depending on whether you did good til canceled or only for that day.
2021-05-29 12:40:27,wallstreetbets,It also means you’re retarded.
2021-05-29 13:26:56,wallstreetbets,It means you have not in fact bought some shares
2021-05-29 12:05:33,wallstreetbets,Your orders still pending cause the market is closed rn
2021-05-29 13:36:07,wallstreetbets,Double retarded for using RH. Stop buying stocks on the weekends and buy more crayons to eat.
2021-05-29 12:06:51,wallstreetbets,"It means you put in an order to buy however many shares, but the order hasn’t executed yet to actually BUY the shares"
2021-05-29 14:09:32,wallstreetbets,Did you get naked calls?
2021-05-29 13:47:34,wallstreetbets,"Can't buy til 9:30 am. 

As someone who trades on RH, expect a dip right after you buy, and then it to rise later in the day. Shorts and sellers _may_ attack between 10:15 and 1:15 which is their preferred time to attack. So hold and hope we end over 35 on Tuesday."

2021-05-29 15:27:52,wallstreetbets,Why are you here?
2021-05-29 13:56:12,wallstreetbets,"So basically Hedge Funds looked at distressed properties at the start of the Pandemic and they placed a huge bet agains them to go bankrupt. They did the same with ToysRUs and even Bed Bath and Beyond, trying to ruin these companies for profits. Our Hero, a guy named DFV (deepfuckingValue), aka RoaringKitty, was running a successful youtube channel where he said 'hey, they are shorting way too much on AMC and GME and we should buy'. So a bunch of Redditors on WSB decided to join together and like the stock and they did, causing it to go from $4 to $400 before Vlad Tenev, criminal pawn and CEO of Robinhood, was ordered to halt buying to stop the squeeze by the oligarchs who run the world. Naturally, he got away scott free and retail investors got fucked. But since then, the HF's who  own both AMC, GME and SPCE and a few others, always pull the same shit at the same time. Whatever their computer algorithim is, in general there is _always_ a short attack Tuesday and/or Wednesday between 10:30 and 1:30, and again Friday between 10:30 and 1:30 on BOTH AMC and GME. This past week was a bit different because they can't short or are out of shorts so they turned to buying ITM PUTS and taking a loss, used them to drive the price down because the squeeze would bankrupt them with ITM Calls."
2021-05-29 14:01:22,wallstreetbets,"Thing is it takes two days to get them right? 

Like, let's say EOD Thursday, the price is $35. My calls are ITM at 25. I execute, they tank the price, and then I get my shares next Tuesday at 23 and i lost money. I basically get fucked."
2021-05-29 14:00:18,wallstreetbets,Still no squeeze. Just FOMO buying. TO THE MOON

2021-05-29 12:09:50,wallstreetbets,I wouldn’t even say gamma quite yet. Next week we could really see the gamma when all those calls are bought
2021-05-29 18:47:10,wallstreetbets,I wouldn’t say shorts covering considering the short interest has been up everyday.

2021-05-29 14:37:59,wallstreetbets,look at my post its only been trust funds FOMOing into AMC

2021-05-29 15:35:42,wallstreetbets,Majority of Shorts covered on GME. Not all of them but most did if you closely followed the first real squeeze. Short interest went from 140%ish way way down. And here come the delusional people to downvote me. I was in at under $40 a share and road it all the way to the top so it’s not like I didn’t buy into it. It’s not going to 1000 or anything anymore. Brokers cancelled that party.
2021-05-29 18:45:18,wallstreetbets,No the DTCC said that no shorts ever covered.

2021-05-29 12:54:10,wallstreetbets,How exactly will it trigger the squeeze?
2021-05-29 18:09:56,wallstreetbets,Do they announce results or the count
2021-05-29 19:32:30,wallstreetbets,So yolo on calls for GME June 18 check
2021-05-29 15:41:14,wallstreetbets,For real? Maybe I should up my share count on Tuesday. It’s expensive but that could be the match that lights this bitches tampon.
2021-05-29 16:53:07,wallstreetbets,We don’t know if it will be announced then though do we? Might take a bit but hopefully that’s the case
2021-05-29 14:56:00,wallstreetbets,So what will happen on those days? A squeeze? or will it tank like a potato back to reality?

2021-05-29 14:52:48,wallstreetbets,Numbers released on the 2nd tho
2021-05-29 17:49:39,wallstreetbets,why will they count on june 2nd but wait a full two months to tell people if there are way more shares circulating than are supposed to exist?
2021-05-29 13:30:28,wallstreetbets,Many on this very sub said they were opening shorts on Friday. It's gonna be hammer time.

2021-05-29 17:07:12,wallstreetbets,I’m excited to see what happens Tuesday.
2021-05-29 15:21:19,wallstreetbets,GME? undervalued? it closed at 222 USD last Friday. what are you smoking? it was overvalued at 20 and now we're 11x that...
2021-05-29 15:02:53,wallstreetbets,"Fundamentally undervalued, out of debt, starting a digital reinvention of the company under new ambitious ownership, with $550m cash on hand and a scot-free global viral marketing campaign, and the smallest volume of shares and higher percentage locked up than any other shorted stock... 

Yes, AMC has those things *to a degree* but GME is very obviously the prime storm here."
2021-05-29 14:49:03,wallstreetbets,"I agree. In the unlikely scenario neither does squeeze, $GME still has far better fundamentals & growth potential compared to AMC."
2021-05-29 14:58:29,wallstreetbets,I know. Made over 900k profit on the first squeeze in January 😁
2021-05-29 17:40:03,wallstreetbets,Monday is Memorial day holiday!

2021-05-29 13:56:23,wallstreetbets,Fyi BB money is going to come in the form of integrated interface systems for electric vehicles. This has become the focus of their buisnes model. So we not only have its potential short term with these reddit plays but it could pan out to be an industry leader as its not looking to get tied down with 1 auto brand. They want to go to any car manufacturer and say hey you want make an E vehicle here is a plug and play driver interface system.

How foolish could you be to assume that multi multi billion dollar hedgefunds are profiting off of shorting a single stock out of the thousands..."
2021-05-29 18:51:56,wallstreetbets,"If more people held out until the price rose to 500k based on simple supply and demand.. i.e. shares need to be bought but people are selling at 500k, I would be interested to see what would happen. I don't really subscribe to the whole ""you're a real fucking idiot"" approach, but I am curious to see the outcome."
2021-05-29 15:39:04,wallstreetbets,"Shorts don’t have to cover. I think people forget there’s 15k hedge funds that have hundreds of billions of dollars. They don’t have to cover. 7% fee is nothing to them. 

P.s. synthetic shares are basically a conspiracy theory right now. People are gonna be extremely disappointed after the vote count is normal.

The fundamentals of the company are shit. As the stock goes higher people will just short it more. If the company doesn’t raise capital. They are doomed."

2021-05-29 13:48:49,wallstreetbets,I got two good options and one I just pressed too fast before reading it and will lose $750 unless it hits $40 Friday. I was rushing to get it at a good price and didn't pay attention. The others are ITM already and will cover the loss. Still hope for $40 EOD Thursday.
2021-05-29 12:34:18,wallstreetbets,How do I hedge my June 12 $360 GME covered calls? Should i be nervous they get called away?
2021-05-29 14:48:01,wallstreetbets,You must have got your finance degree or experience from Kellogg’s box or want a be financial advisor. Good luck with options strategy as it’s all retail with no fundamentals.
2021-05-29 14:56:58,wallstreetbets,Don’t sell at $100 or &500 or maybe  $1000 theres real wicked wisdom in all that. Limitless upside huh! Enjoy the ride to the moon and back FoggyOne.

2021-05-29 14:52:37,wallstreetbets,I hear all the options talk driving share shortage and thus price increase but that’s short term and at some point one must sell to make money as AMC has no fundamental value in long term.

2021-05-29 17:32:35,wallstreetbets,So what other reputable brokers would be recommended?
2021-05-29 18:53:00,wallstreetbets,"If by best you mean next to zero charting capabilities (and they’re only available on web, mobile has nothing but a line - not even volume), terrible fills, zero analysis capabilities, the most limited order types I’ve ever seen on a brokerage (no bracket orders on stocks. options only support limit and stop limit, no trailing stops, stop market, or market orders and no bracket orders either like stocks). No ability to view the chart for a specific option. No tick charts. No way to measure momentum/volatility. All you have is price points in the dark.

It’s actually worse than trading off yahoo finance which is saying a lot. I have no idea why the fuck people think this is such a great app. It’s literally missing everything you’d expect from even the most basic broker.

The only thing I can figure is they’ve never actually used another broker, got used to RH and now “reeeee it’s different!!! Where’s my single green line!?” When faced with any actual charts."
2021-05-29 18:14:40,wallstreetbets,If that's something you value over a stable brokerage then sure I guess that makes sense.
2021-05-29 18:49:42,wallstreetbets,You don’t have to have any stocks on the account to view the ticker. This is what I do. Have my gme in 3 other brokers and just pull up robbinghood for viewing.
2021-05-29 18:42:10,wallstreetbets,That’s true. I have fidelity but I rarely use it because the interface is confusing to me
2021-05-29 13:49:41,wallstreetbets,However public and fidelity did not.
2021-05-29 15:00:19,wallstreetbets,Webull and some other top big name brokerages restricted for hours. Robinhood did for more than a day. No matter what app or brokerage you use you are infinitely safer just not using robinhood.
2021-05-29 17:51:40,wallstreetbets,"it won’t really matter which broker you use because of a couple restrict it will affect the price on all, let’s hope that it just doesn’t happen and let’s hope we have enough momentum on tuesday to even initiate a squeeze first"
2021-05-29 18:10:15,wallstreetbets,"While true, their app is great for it's charts, tracking, alerts, info, etc. It's fine to use for small retail trading imo but I wouldn't use it as my main."
2021-05-29 19:29:14,wallstreetbets,Well poop. I just switched from RH to WeBull.
2021-05-29 15:52:00,wallstreetbets,My only problem with webull is that you can't enter a trade in the middle of the night. And you have to wait until 8:00 a.m. to enter an options trade. It's fantastic for looking at charts on your phone and their table for options chains gives a lot of info that you can see easily
2021-05-29 13:39:45,wallstreetbets,And that Robinhood restricted trading for far more than just a day or two.
2021-05-29 13:48:11,wallstreetbets,I did not. Do you have a link to an article or something? But also no one being margin called doesn't mean brokers still weren't at risk
2021-05-29 13:00:21,wallstreetbets,Yeah because that's who this sub trades with lol
2021-05-29 14:50:50,wallstreetbets,My jacked are tits!!
2021-05-29 13:02:29,wallstreetbets,"If it is announced that more voting shares were counted than exist, it will prove there's over 100% short interest which would be a bull signal telling people to buy in for the squeeze, which causes the squeeze."
2021-05-29 15:00:23,wallstreetbets,"Can't say what will happen. But the theory going around and why you're seeing so much posts about votes (if you can vote and you haven't yet you should btw), if they have received more votes than what their float is that proves there has been naked shorting of their stocks and that is illegal. Not sure what will happen, but I think it'll be one of the catalyst for what launches the rocket. Simple supply and demand means the price will go up, how much depends on how many people paper hand and how much synthetic shares are out there."
2021-05-29 15:17:17,wallstreetbets,June 2nd is mine. Happy freaking birthday to us!
2021-05-29 18:06:54,wallstreetbets,And your first pets name is?
2021-05-29 15:47:58,wallstreetbets,On whose face now?
2021-05-29 13:46:30,wallstreetbets,Meaning it is expected to go down? My apologies for my very smooth brain.
2021-05-29 18:03:50,wallstreetbets,"Sure, if I have a pie and I cut it up into a million pieces I don't have any more pie than if I cut it into 10 pieces. A share is a piece of the pie, and the market cap is the total size of the pie. When you look at how much the company is worth, all you care about is the size of the pie not the size of the pieces."
2021-05-29 18:07:08,wallstreetbets,Market cap is just the share price multiplied by the number of shares. The number of shares will absolutely matter when any sort of squeeze happens.
2021-05-29 18:15:05,wallstreetbets,Lol bruh
2021-05-29 14:00:01,wallstreetbets,Fuck no

2021-05-29 11:51:42,wallstreetbets,"""AMC is about to do what GME just did, I think""  


""All I heard is GME is going to 500!"""
2021-05-29 11:43:07,wallstreetbets,You here belong.
2021-05-29 15:18:44,wallstreetbets,To be fair most Americans speak broken English.
2021-05-29 11:52:11,wallstreetbets,"It’s not that they don’t think it can happen with AMC. It’s that they already have their money in GME, and want all the attention on it so GME squeeze happens faster/now"
2021-05-29 13:10:09,wallstreetbets,"GME is too a much higher extent. Yes AMC has an issue with naked shorts as well, but GME was supposed to be a guaranteed win for shitadel and hedges. AMC was on the brink of bamkruptcy but always had an opportunity to climb out of it with the pandemic slowly ending. GME, on the other hand, was believed to go bankrupt due to their brick and mortar business structure during COVID. Therefore there is a much higher concentration of naked shorts with GME compared to AMC. Congrats on ur tendies, no one is hating for your investment in AMC, it’s paying off, but GME investors r hoping for something much bigger."
2021-05-29 11:43:56,wallstreetbets,Their losses shall FAR outweigh the gains.
2021-05-29 15:40:46,wallstreetbets,"It’s not that us GME brothers won’t accept any other SS stock. It’s the fact Apes could be getting played on AMC to take money away from GME. I own both, but definitely more confident in GME potential. However, let’s all get this bread!!!🚀🚀🚀🚀🌒🌒🌓🌓💎👏🏼"
2021-05-29 16:09:15,wallstreetbets,"The difference is that no other stock has remotely anywhere close to the short interest of GME. For Shorters to have covered GME, they must have bought every single share in the float and returned it in january. Not to mention the popularity of GME being known and bought internationally as the leading shorted stock. This makes GME a lot higher potential to get to a lot higher number as well as even being a squeeze. It's still possible for other ""squeeze"" stocks to be covered if shorters really wanted to at a huge loss considering that their short interest were well below 100% in january and is likely still to be. But for GME, if it was 144% in january and it was impossible for them to cover without purchasing every single share in existence, what would GME's short interest now be? 

Don't get me wrong, stocks such as AMC could still squeeze but imo, I don't think it will reach higher than $200/share while GME has unlimited potential depending on how long people hold."
2021-05-29 15:42:22,wallstreetbets,"As the stock price go up people short it more.. you understand that when people get margin called or have to cover that’s what causes a massive short squeeze? 

How do you explain GME hitting nearly 500$ USD? Do you think the company’s fair suddenly valuation increased from 15x over a week? No that was a short squeeze. When citron eventually covered, they knew it wasn’t worth that much but they couldn’t hold their short position anymore and admitted defeat. Who tf are you to say this isn’t similar?"
2021-05-29 19:30:24,wallstreetbets,"Math and data prove that 0 shorts covered in January? I’d love to see that data. 
I never said they all covered. I just said some certainly did. I dunno if that’s 1 percent or 10 percent but some must have. It’s just impossible that no shorts got scared and covered. They must have."
2021-05-29 15:09:00,wallstreetbets,No one care where you brought it.  I told you to short it if you feel its too high..clown
2021-05-29 12:50:48,wallstreetbets,You should be nervous. You sold covered calls into the vote count....tf were you thinking. Only way you won’t miss out is to buy another 100 shares
2021-05-29 16:59:40,wallstreetbets,"You think the election was stolen.

2021-05-29 17:27:26,wallstreetbets,"I'm a bit confused about the fact that everyone, including the SEC is aware that hedge funds shorted more shares than exist, so if it were illegal and no one does anything about it, what does it matter? Clearly the SEC and governments are doing nothing.  All the companies allowing us to buy, sell or short these shares have detailed analytics and logs. They know exactly how many shares exist, who owns them and how much they paid, this isn't the 1900s... It just doesn't look like anyone in power has any intention of stopping hedge funds."

2021-05-29 14:56:30,wallstreetbets,Nah most people just believe that any AMC squeeze is not gonna be as high as the GME squeeze because of the amount of outstanding shares and the actions of the CEOs and BOD.
2021-05-29 15:47:01,wallstreetbets,Because gme was 120% shorted and amc is less then 20%. Of course shorts would cover in gme situation at that much short interest. The position of the AMC short is so much smaller. Even if all shorts exited amc. We could see 100 dollars. Then it crashes back down to bankruptcy cause THEY ARENT CHANGING. Then even after the previous shorts cover. A shit load of shorts enter new positions at crazy high stock levels. I’m not saying you can’t make money on the stock. But your a fool if your playing long on this thing when the company has done nothing to fix their piss poor finances.
2021-05-29 19:35:49,wallstreetbets,"Could have, but if you shorted at ~$5, you know how much money you would lose at january prices? Some may have covered sure, but definitely not the vast majority of them. Stock was at least 140% shorted in jan. That’s a mess that can’t be untangled just like that. Few may have covered. Majority didn’t because it would have literally bankrupted them. They’ve been kicking the can down the road for months through shorting, covering FTDs with married puts, all types of shenanigans. I’m not out here trying to be a dick, but compared to what is coming, what happened in january is nothing like what we’ll see in the upcoming months."

2021-05-29 19:01:12,wallstreetbets,No. They did restrict margin trading but that’s algorithmic based on volatility. When anything goes crazy most brokers up margin requirements until it hits 100% to prevent you from accidentally overshooting your available margin by $500k in 15 minutes because something exploded against you.
2021-05-29 14:01:51,wallstreetbets,"I use fidelity, it has great fills and also they didn't restrict trading on that infamous day. The downside is that the UI sucks and the app is not that great, especially if you are trading options"

2021-05-29 14:57:48,wallstreetbets,"There is a ton of evidence showing it’s way above 57m. And if the count comes out way high, it doesn’t need media exposure - I’m calling all my friends and family and telling them to buy shares that instant."
2021-05-29 13:15:49,wallstreetbets,"\*IF\* it happens and gets good enough exposure, it could also force the SEC's hand to investigate illegal naked shorting. Congress aren't ignoring this even if the media are.  


I agree. I don't think the voting share count will exceed the number of shares issued, I think there will be a lot of non-voting institutional and retail holders. Many on the retail end caused by using horse shit brokers where they don't actually own their shares to vote with."
2021-05-29 15:34:32,wallstreetbets,">I honestly also don't believe the share count to be over 57m

you know this is a sub for retards not actually stupid people right"
2021-05-29 14:18:16,wallstreetbets,Perhaps a wsb user could pay for an article in a national newspaper about it. That investment would pay for itself may times over.
2021-05-29 16:38:08,wallstreetbets,"I think it’s totally possible that the shares held are that high and that there are synthetics, idk if we can actually get THAT many people to vote. That said I did."
2021-05-29 14:08:08,wallstreetbets,"Are you stupid? It literally only needs to be 20 million, which is ALREADY CONFIRMED.  But you’re still only hanging out on WSB so your info isn’t that great."

2021-05-29 15:42:14,wallstreetbets,Exactly brother! AMC is compromised within! RC is King of GME!
2021-05-29 15:49:10,wallstreetbets,Oh definitely in for the squeeze here make no mistake. AMC isn’t worth tons but it has squeeze potential. I believe there are synthetic shares but we should know soon. But regardless I’m confident we have a much higher short % than 20 because of the phantom/synthetics.
2021-05-29 13:16:40,wallstreetbets,"Buying GME isn’t a hedge. A hedge is supposed to protect you from downside. But since the assumption is that it’ll moon, you might as well buy a new call when the premium is low (especially because of Friday’s dip) and close your position. You would still make some profit depending on when you sold your call and you would still hold your shares. Just a smooth brained ape’s opinion. In any case, buying more stock should still help increase your profits."

2021-05-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Time to make a WISH Ok so I just read this piece on $WISH. Here’s the piece I read from a research firm https://docsend.com/view/r35zrpbdzftxbeb2 

I’ll give my view also. Especially where I differ. 

Always starts with team. This team is top. Went through their LinkedIn pages and all of them are all stars. That’s seems like a great place to start. 

FINTECH
Not to mention they just got Jackie Reese from Square $SQ recently took over and looks like Wish could be a big #Fintech play with 100m users. They launched buy now and pay later recently. 

Also Palantir cofounder is on the board and CEO is one of the early Google search engine technologists. 

53k! LOCAL MERCHANTS- SOMETHING NO OTHER COMPANY HAS
They recently launched Wish Local. They partner with local merchants to sell goods in the local communities but using their app as the online face. 53k are on the platform. This allows them to deliver goods same day, buy online pick up same day, and Wish Express that is 5 days or less shipping. This also brings in traffic to merchants. So everyone is winning. 


30% OF MARKET CAP IS CASH NO DEBT
They trade at 1x sales. Grew it over 50%. 

LOGISTICS ON FIRE
This revenue is on fire. Growing over 2x and they mentioned this will soon make profit. They said they are offering to companies NOT selling on Wish. They just started this effort. This means someone selling on Shopify or other marketplaces can sell globally using their network. Not really possible before. 

Obviously there’s risks but it also seems like the risks have come down dramatically with share decline. 

Not only this. Short interest is high and I think reason for selling is private funds selling shares after lockup."
2021-05-29 10:58:14,wallstreetbets,"Doesn’t lockup expires June 14? Very Bullish long term, short term is worrisome. It’s the decline in MAU and increase losses, not to mention burning $300m in cash last quarter and then issuing a weak q2 guidance that might be 2-4% growth YoY. They didn’t announce Jackie Reese involvement because current management was killing it....quite the opposite probably. A few senior management left already including their original vp eng and their head of data & relevancy....who is primarily responsible for driving GMV growth...

Logistics is killing it and will probably be the long term winner here, but it’s still growing and will need further investments. Their e-commerce business is their main bread winner, but the decrease in retention will result in higher S&M cost, at least short term, to capture new and bring back older users.

Don’t get me wrong, this will grow wonderfully in the long term, but I think short term will create some bag holders. I think management needs more senior/experienced execs with Jackie being a great start. The team also needs to cut down on wasted money, Wish House for example. It also wouldn’t hurt to have a few more PR or news from the company in general..."
2021-05-29 17:30:24,wallstreetbets,Bought 1k shares in the $7’s long term. No debt and pretty oversold. Most people don’t realize how much they were impacted from the shipping delays during the pandemic. Expecting a nice recovery 2nd half of the year.

2021-05-29 13:59:55,wallstreetbets,"The direction they are going, per your description, just sounds like another Groupon. It's a shitty business model since local businesses/merchants already have bad margins, so not much to offer a middle-man. Groupon isn't even worth $1.5B (they have a lot of debt though). WISH could halve once more and I wouldn't be surprised. The no-debt part is a good point though."

Who?"
2021-05-29 11:09:28,wallstreetbets,"Thanks. Good points. The $300m was one time looks like and was catch-up from prior marketing spend delays. 

Agree bringing Jackie was acknowledging more structure needed. But also evident that Fintech is likely big target for them. Providing financing for customers, suppliers and how about local merchants. 

Covid messed up MAU and retention so yes will look strange for probably 6-12 months. 

Lock up. Looks like they have had three phases with last one in June. So yes that’ll open more. I did here GGV Capital mention two days ago that they remain very bullish."
2021-05-29 12:03:47,wallstreetbets,Nice $WISH buy!

2021-05-29 14:02:27,wallstreetbets,Much harder to get physical goods to move cross border to 100m monthly actives then digital coupons. Much different business. Not sure how that’s even close comparison to be honest.
2021-05-29 11:46:57,wallstreetbets,I think we could see AMC like move in WISH but much better fundamentals

Wish, you think you're just ordering a piece of plastic and it arrives in five pieces because they didn't glue it properly. The reviews for the stores are fake. The reviews for the products are all ""I just got this, haven't used it, but it's great"".

Just spend $5 and order something if you're thinking of buying the stock.

Consider it your DD, you will save yourself a lot of money."

When you sell primarily digital coupons. You are exposed everywhere. Yelp, DoorDash, Uber, etc. they all can offer digital coupons. Why because they can.

2021-05-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The state (and future) of oil, an OXY - Occidental Petroleum - trade idea.  

**TL;DR  BEAR CASE: OXY HAS DOGSHIT FOR A BALANCESHEET AND THIS MAY KEEP  INVESTORS AWAY REGARDLESS OF EVERYTHING IT HAS GOING FOR IT DUE TO  CURRENT MARKET UNCERTAINTY AND GENERAL OIL FUD, POTENTIALLY  OPEC/RUSSIA/WHATEVER HANDLES THE UNLIKELY POSSIBILITY OF LIFTED IRANIAN  SANCTIONS POORLY AND CRASHES OIL PRICES**

**TL;DR  BULL CASE: OXY HAS DOGSHIT FOR A BALANCESHEET AND THUS INVESTOR FEAR  HAS LEFT THE STOCK SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERVALUED WITH MODERATE IMMEDIATE  UPSIDE (1-2 weeks, $26 > $31) AND 2-3x POTENTIAL BY END OF YEAR,  BEING ONE OF THE COMPANIES BEST POSITIONED TO PROFIT OFF THE PRESENT AND  NAVIGATE THE FUTURE OF THE OIL INDUSTRY**

We  live in oily times. This has been the case since the dawn of the  petroleum industry; it is the lifeblood of the world, almost quite  literally, and our first fears of oil were that we would drain the  planet dry. Now, consensus is shifting towards the real issue with  reliance upon fossil fuels - if we keep up as we have been, we will end  all life on the planet in quite a different way. Climate change is real,  and the mainstream narrative has finally caught up - with covid slowly  fading away, and an era of relative peace (apart from the middle east  exploding as usual and china slowly buying the world), it is going to  become the hottest topic on our plates and people are going to be  feeling very angry about the prime culprits, big oil. This has already  started, last week, with the first strikes hitting Shell and Exxon, and I  have absolutely no doubt that similar incidents will continue to sweep  across the industry, especially once we hit full reopening and the media  needs its next big fix of drama. For those invested or who are  considering investing in the oil industry, we live in uncertain times,  but again, we live in oily times. I truly believe that the energy/oil  sector will fully recover from COVID and begin to absolutely take off  over the next few years, but not without a significant degree of  turbulence regarding oil companies. This will not be based around  fundamentals, but fear. For this reason, I feel that Occidental  Petroleum is the best positioned company to weather the potential media  circus, profit off the rising prices of oil and make absolute bank as  they begin to shift into carbon capture, which is what I believe to be  the future of oil companies in an attempt to remain carbon neutral  without massive restructuring and countless stranded assets. Much of  what I'm saying will apply to many small-midcap petroleum companies, but  I like OXY the most - and I love the technical setup, which I can't say  for other strong candidates like Devon Energy (DVN)

**SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

Oil  players cutting production without a meaningful reduction in demand is  massively bullish for oil. The lower the supply, the higher the demand,  and thus the higher the price of any given commodity. If the oil  industry is forced to restrict oil extraction, the first companies on  the block for being strong armed into lowering production are going to  be the supermajors. OXY is not a supermajor, and has already lowered  production/plans to keep production lowered this year (and leaned out  significantly, as they are now profitable at around $30bbl if I read  correctly). Therefore, reduced production from the supermajors in a  sector that is already likely to hit a supply crunch sometime this year  is bullish for all small-midcap oil producers, and although they have  seen good quarterly results, many of them are yet to recover to  pre-covid levels.

**TECHNICALS**

I'm  still too poor to afford crayons, but the long and short of it is this:  On March 5th 2021, oil closed at $66.27bbl. OXY was valued at $31.23  per share. On May 28th 2021, oil closed at $66.66bbl. Aside from this  being very bullish for Satan - the price of OXY at close was $25.96.  This, to me, makes no sense at all, given that OXY could be considered  as a highly levered company regarding oil prices. The price of oil did  not spike as rapidly as it did in March, but right now it feels to be in  a very clear uptrend, and has demonstrated a level of stability that  March did not. Moreso, OXY posted strong earnings and an EPS beat, but  they have been unable to recover recent highs, and pre-covid highs still  seem to be a distant dream, though entirely realistic within my eyes.  To me, this lack of positive price action is purely because of FUD -  people aren't sure what to make of oil right now, because they're smooth  brained retards. The bottom line is the bottom line; OXY and friends  are making big bucks, and the more restrictions the industry as a whole  finds itself slapped with, the higher the cost of oil, which leads to  greater benefit for small-medium players. Or, potentially, bankruptcy,  but I think OXY's investment in carbon capture is their silver bullet  which will give them safe haven and even greater appeal in the face of  future uncertainty.

**CARBON CAPTURE**

OXY  has significant interest in carbon capture. This is sort of beyond the  scope of this DD, but essentially, carbon capture is used to sequester  carbon - and in this case, this captured carbon is used to pump more oil  out of the ground. I personally believe it's going to be an incredibly  helpful and possibly even necessary technology, and I think if  restrictions do pass in regards to oil drilling, it's going to come also  in the form of regulations mandating an amount of carbon capture per  output. I'm aware that there's quite a lot of debate regarding the  actual usefulness of carbon capture, but it has clear and undeniable  benefit in oil drilling and regardless: governments throw money at  nonsense all the time, and even if it is ultimately an ineffective  method I believe that carbon capture is likely to see significant  interest and investment. It is entirely possible that OXY becomes an  industry leader in this respect, and it would mark a ridiculously  lucrative pivot when combined with their current position in oil. This  could easily see them reaching the ranks of the supermajors, if these  companies are unable to keep up with the current state of change and can  find no appropriate pivot themselves.

THE SHORT TERM PLAY

**The  price of oil has been inching towards testing 5 year highs over the  past week, having pushed past 52w highs on the Friday but closing lower  on the day. I believe this is for a single reason, one which will have  resolved by the 1st of June. We're currently in a long weekend with an  OPEC meeting on Tuesday, and the Iranian oil sanction FUD is still  weighing heavily on the market. Thus, it would have been foolish to buy  into a stock position over the last few days when next week will give  much greater clarity - hence why a number of oil equities have remained  somewhat flat compared to similar price action in March - since it is  not entirely clear in which direction oil prices will go right now and a  lot can change over a long weekend into an OPEC meeting.**

**Personally,  I believe that oil prices will go right the fuck up. OPEC is unlikely  to deviate from their plan, and will very likely talk on how they would  handle the potential reintroduction of Iranian oil to the market. This,  coming off of the memorial day weekend being a psychological marker that  things are ""back to normal"", with the weeks following being  historically bullish for the market in general, the current concerns on  inflation, the stories on oil majors cutting back production and the  ongoing tensions in the middle east makes me think we see oil cross  $68bbl by next week and, without a significant pullback, $70bbl by mid  June.**

**Therefore,  the play is simple. Check oil price movement immediately following the  OPEC meeting on Tuesday, and if it's stable or moving up, buy July 9th  OXY calls at a $28 strike - my price target being $33. So long as oil  doesn't crash back below $65, I have no doubt that OXY will retrace to  at least $30 by July 9th, which is a comfortable 100% profit at current  prices - I also expect an IV bump following OPEC, as there should be  some large buys as funds rush to reposition themselves in oil stocks  once the FUD clears. A few of the stocks in this sector - OXY and RIG in  particular - are quite prone to posting 10% to 15% green days out of  nowhere, and OXY is well overdue for one. Overall, these stocks have  been lagging in confidence compared to March, even with more stable  price action and higher highs - I expect a correction to the upside very  soon.**

THE LONG TERM PLAY

In the unlikely even that oil tanks after the OPEC meeting, we move to long term - buy OXY calls or shares at *whatever price they've dipped to the next time oil is around $58-$60bb*l,  because that feels like a historically strong level of support and  should hold even stronger given the current monetary environment. As  long as oil is above $55bbl, OXY is sitting in a pretty profitable  space, so a significant drop in price if oil drops to around the $60bbl  mark would indicate the stock being oversold compared to fundamentals,  and it's likely to pop back up around the Q2/Q3 earnings.

Buy  and hold for 5-10 years and I see a relatively safe 3-5x. Boomer shit,  and I bet they'll even up their dividend by then, but I think 2023 calls  are a bit unpredictable - 2022 are likely to print, I like $40s, but  things might get choppy past then. Still, even with their level of debt,  I don't see OXY as among the companies that may go under during the  coming massive shifts in the oil industry, and I believe that they will  be debt free within a few years and successfully pivot to carbon capture  and make a new name for themselves there. Potentially literally, given  that Total is now TotalEnergies, and Petroleum is going to go the way of  the gamer word.

**BEAR CASE**

There's  really not much here to be bearish about; it depends on the price  movement of oil and investor sentiment about large debtors. Personally I  believe that OXY will have a significantly cleaner balance sheet by end  of year, and given some stability in the price of oil above $60bbl I  think most investors will come around to that fact, too, but given the  general uncertainty in the market - strangely absent this week, as it  was overall bullish - OXY is not the safest investment, and the smart  money required to move the needle on an established and ""problem"" large  cap significantly might be absent for a few years yet, until some  definite stability and repayment of debt is found.

Also,  OXY did some potentially really stupid shit hedging oil prices and  their profits are capped at oil being $75bbl. Personally, I think this  is fine, as I see oil capping out at around $75bbl for the year, but  expect OXY stock price to hit a ceiling around there if crude does  breach $75 this year. At which point, I would advise either DVN or RIG  as they have much more room to run in a significant oil bull market.

Thanks for reading, if you have.

Good  luck to all; this is one of the ideas I have been more confident on  this year, and since I have made a fair bit of money off of various DDs  shared here (and I fucking hate what this place has become by the way,  but shout out to steel gang), I have wanted to give back in some way."

2021-05-29 18:37:58,wallstreetbets,Then sell why you keep it or why you did buy it from the beginning
2021-05-29 14:23:11,wallstreetbets,Damn you caught me! Attention is worth more than my grandma's panties these days 🤣
2021-05-29 16:54:44,wallstreetbets,Clov is a legit squeeze candidate. The only thing is the borrow rate is very low. Just need some volume.
2021-05-29 19:00:17,wallstreetbets,"Could be suss, could also be everyone got into investing during the gme squeeze. I only by chance had an older account for video stuff, only really got into stocks with the wave of noobs. seems kind of reasonable that there would be a spike at that time. particularly on this forum.  


saying that there have been quite a few less than 1 month old accounts talking a whole lot of bearish stuff.  aaaanyways looked at all the reddit stocks and clov seemed like a value play sub $8 when I entered. soooo im biased... and a noob."
2021-05-29 19:52:01,wallstreetbets,My account if way older than that and I also have decent karma. CLOV is legit. Severely beaten down and undervalued company. This is the next CIGNA / AETNA / UNITED.
2021-05-29 19:03:35,wallstreetbets,"(on a side note the clov board has been posting here everyday, but all the posts but this one seem to get taken down)"
2021-05-29 19:41:56,wallstreetbets,Thanks bro and it would be even good to invest Tuesday morning?
2021-05-29 19:59:12,wallstreetbets,They do Not i think...
2021-05-29 14:02:41,wallstreetbets,Once it closes above $8.10 it'll break the downtrend and the next resistant is $9.97. Above it and we can see it mooning 🌙
2021-05-29 07:55:52,wallstreetbets,"I mean, who hasn’t been."
2021-05-29 14:16:24,wallstreetbets,She swallows all the kids
2021-05-29 10:23:58,wallstreetbets,"I'm all for it.  When I originally bought it, the call cost $800.  They're currently .45 apiece lol."
2021-05-29 13:35:11,wallstreetbets,if it takes off ... its going to be a looong ride up.
2021-05-29 13:34:11,wallstreetbets,you think wsb pushed amc up $6 billion?
2021-05-29 13:49:53,wallstreetbets,"I agree, i bought in when i saw BaC released their downgrade to $9 on the exact day when their earnings were over expectation. On further check of [Fintel](https://fintel.io/so/us/clov), I saw them with put options so i guess they really did not want the stock price to go up. All aside, the fundamental of the company is real solid."
2021-05-29 12:18:54,wallstreetbets,Does your Aunt have nice DD? That is all I need in this life
2021-05-29 11:51:22,wallstreetbets,I don't mess with option anymore. Just up share for me.
2021-05-29 12:27:13,wallstreetbets,Oh well. Chart looked quite bearish when it dipped under 7. Thought I could make some easy money lol
2021-05-29 18:52:08,wallstreetbets,How is lifewatermedia treating you?
2021-05-29 18:46:07,wallstreetbets,"I don't have any of it, but I know now to set an order foe Tuesday. Sell short CLOV @ $11 × 1000"
2021-05-29 19:50:03,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, at these bottom prices? Yes. But, you can always be a little cautious and see how premarket goes. If it's up a lot in premarket, I would wait about 15-30 minutes before entering a position. If it's not moving much in premarket, might as well join in at market open."
2021-05-29 14:19:08,wallstreetbets,"Music to my ears, sold leaps for $15 strike, happy to hold. If it drops I’ll roll and keep holding til bags are lifted. I don’t mind the stock"
2021-05-29 10:03:13,wallstreetbets,My fat conservative uncle is shorting CLOV so I went ALL IN!
2021-05-29 13:35:59,wallstreetbets,"well, fuck. We have all been in those shit situations."
2021-05-29 14:24:49,wallstreetbets,No way. It's shady hedge funds manipulating the price but using WSB as a shield.
2021-05-29 13:45:08,wallstreetbets,I believed the hype on wsb for the June 2 votes and rumours about the synthetic shares that the hedgefunds were shorting pushed it up
2021-05-29 13:39:59,wallstreetbets,"Asked my aunt's boyfriend and they both are clients of Clover health. Fundamentals for the company are strong(Check their recent Revenue reports), Clients are inceasing at a fast rate and their business model is a game changer in health insurance. They have their own AI which helps match clients to the plans they need. My aunt says that it's the new generation of health insurance, like present day EVs to traditional motorcars."
2021-05-29 15:24:37,wallstreetbets,Lol yup ... Getting burnt hurts ...
2021-05-29 12:45:49,wallstreetbets,"You still might if people get onboard this rocket ship earlier than later, this is huge potential to fly"
2021-05-29 19:52:41,wallstreetbets,You think that's going to make a difference? LMAO
2021-05-29 11:51:39,wallstreetbets,Just point where he touched you
2021-05-29 11:51:25,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-29 15:20:54,wallstreetbets,Yes ... Ahem ... Sure ... Past tense lol ... Sigh
2021-05-29 18:48:49,wallstreetbets,"I actually think crowd sourced DD is better then anything wall street pros can generate. 

The collective iq of this sub is about 60 million. Wall St cant compete with that."
2021-05-29 16:30:34,wallstreetbets,the retard bought puts.
2021-05-29 19:53:45,wallstreetbets,"No, I think it's gonna make me 5k in a day or 2.

2021-05-29 19:21:59,wallstreetbets,That's not how it works lol.
2021-05-29 19:54:56,wallstreetbets,Make sure you enter your position and not wuss out if you see it moving.
2021-05-29 18:38:48,wallstreetbets,But he sure enjoyed it.
2021-05-29 19:33:49,wallstreetbets,Maybe the iq average is a little higher.
2021-05-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning May 31st, 2021 Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 31st, 2021.

# **A big jobs report looms in the week ahead, as markets enter the often-weak month of June - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/28/jobs-report-looms-in-the-week-ahead-as-markets-enter-the-often-weak-month-of-june.html)**
*****
> May’s employment report is the big event in the week ahead, as stocks enter the often weak month of June. Stocks are finishing May with a mixed performance. Big cap indexes like the S&P 500 and Dow notched gains. The S&P rose a half percent, and the Dow rose 1.9%. The small cap Russell 2000 was flat, up 0.1%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq declined 1.5%.
*****
> June is not historically a strong month for stocks. Bespoke Investment Group points out that over the past 50 years, the Dow has gained just 0.12% in June and has been positive 52% of the time.
*****
> But over the past 20 years, June was far weaker, gaining only 40% of the time. June’s performance is tied with September as the worst month of the year, with an average Dow decline of 0.7%, according to Bespoke.
*****
> The economy is front and center in the coming week with the important ISM readings on manufacturing and services sector activity, but the most important measure will be Friday’s jobs report. According to Dow Jones, economists expect Friday’s employment report to show the creation of about 674,000 jobs in May, after the disappointing 266,000 jobs added in April. That was about a quarter of what economists had expected.
*****
> “You know if we have two months in a row of not delivering on the jobs expectations, the market is going to get nervous,” said George Goncalves, head of U.S. macro strategy at MUFG. “Hopefully, we beat it and then that creates a positive buzz, and we go into the Fed meeting and then we’re, ‘Hey, the economy is still on track.’”
*****
> # Big June event
> The Fed meets June 15-16, and already market pros are anticipating it will be the most important event of the month. Fed officials have emphasized that they will keep policy easy as they watch to see signs that the economy is really healing. They also contend that higher inflation readings are temporary, since the data is being compared with a weak period last year.
*****
> Key for the markets is whether the Fed begins to believe that inflation is higher than it expected or that the economy is strengthening enough to progress without so much monetary support. Fed officials have said they would consider discussing tapering back on their quantitative easing bond purchase program if they see signs of improvement, and that would be a first step toward interest rate hikes, not expected until at least 2023.
*****
> If inflation runs too hot, the Fed’s main weapon to combat it is to raise interest rates.
*****
> The prospect of higher interest rates makes the stock market nervous, since it would mean higher costs for companies and less liquidity. In theory, higher interest rates also means that investors could potentially choose higher-yielding bond investments over stocks.
*****
> The next big read for the economy is Friday’s jobs report, and it looms large as recent inflation readings have come in much hotter than expected. The latest was the personal consumption expenditures price index Friday. It showed core inflation running at 3.1% year over year, the strongest reading for that measure since 1992.
*****
> The Fed’s beige book on the economy is expected Wednesday. ISM manufacturing data is expected Tuesday, and ISM services is released Thursday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks on central banks and climate change at Green Swan 2021 global virtual conference Friday.
*****
> # Inflation flare-up
> The Fed has said it would tolerate an average range of inflation around its 2% target until it sees inflation sticking at a higher level. Inflation has been running mostly below 2%, prior to the latest numbers.
*****
> “With the PCE number coming in like every other inflation number over the last six weeks, hotter than expected, the market is inching closer to calling the Fed out on its view that inflation is transitory,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG.
*****
> Emanuel said the speculative activity around meme stocks this week is a sign of froth and shows a large amount of liquidity in the hands of investors. One of those stocks, AMC, closed off 1.5% on Friday after rallying 116% in the past week, giving it a 2021 gain of 1,200%.
*****
> “The net net on the index level is basically it’s a stock market that’s moving sideways,” Emanuel said. “Our view continues to be that when you look at it longer term, the big picture is this is a bull market that started in March of last year that has further to run. When you look at it in the medium term, the market has every right to be concerned and we do believe they will amp up their concern that the Fed’s paying insufficient attention to price stability.”
*****
> Emanuel said he studied what happened to stocks when core PCE was above the Fed’s 2% target. “The average monthly return for months where the core PCE has been over 2%, going back to 1989 is (a decline) of 1.6%, with a decided bias toward more defensive sectors like health care outperforming and a very pronounced bias for technology of all kinds to underperform,” he said.
*****
> Technology stocks, as measured by the S&P information technology sector, gained 1.6% in the past month, and are up 5.9% year to date. The sector is lagging the S&P 500′s 12% gain.
*****
> The top-performing sectors have been cyclical year to date, with energy up 36.2%, financials up 28.5%, materials up 20.1% and industrials up 18.3%. Communications services, which contains some internet growth names, gained 16% since the start of the year. Health care has been outperforming information technology, up 8.6% year to date.
*****
> In the past week, the S&P 500 gained 1.2% to 4,204 and is within 1% of its all-time high. The Dow rose 0.9% to 34,529, and the Nasdaq was up 2% at 13,748.
*****
> # Red flag?
On the edges of the financial markets, market pros are paying attention to signs of a huge surge of liquidity in the financial system. In the past week, institutions have been placing unprecedented amounts of cash with the Fed, nearly a half trillion dollars Thursday.
*****
> “There’s way too much liquidity in the system, and it’s happening as a result of the Fed’s ongoing QE, but also disbursements from the fiscal stimulus,” said Goncalves.
*****
> He said the funds from trillions in stimulus, including to state and local governments, have not yet been spent but have found their way into the banking system. At the same time, institutions and individuals continue to move funds into money market funds, now holding about $4.6 trillion.
*****
> Those funds also put pressure on the system, since they put funds in Treasury bills. Goncalves expects the Fed to raise rates on excess reserves if the situation gets worse.
*****
> “There’s no precedent for this because it is totally a function of there being just too much money in the system,” he said.
*****
> “Institutions are redepositing cash at the Fed because they don’t have enough bills or short-term commercial paper. There’s not enough fixed income assets to go around,” said Goncalves. He said banks also do not want to hold the excess cash since it counts against their leverage ratio, and they would prefer to find other higher-yielding investments.
*****
> What it has done is sparked some speculation that the Fed would taper its QE program sooner than expected, he said.

> # Days After Memorial Day Improving

> Our office will be closed for observance of Memorial Day on Monday, May 31, 2021. U.S stock and bond markets will also be closed. As you spend some quality time off please consider taking time to commemorate those who have paid the ultimate price while serving in the U.S. military. Additionally, consider taking a moment to acknowledge first responders, nurses, doctors, law enforcement, firefighters, essential workers, scientists and everyone else that has tirelessly worked and sacrificed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

> For decades the Stock Trader’s Almanac has been tracking and monitoring the market’s performance around holidays. The trading day after Memorial Day has a mixed record going back to 1971. Both S&P 500 and NASDAQ have declined more often than risen on the day, but average performance is still modestly positive.

> Since 1986, the frequency of gains has improved, and average performance has also risen however, but S&P 500 declined five straight days after 2015-2019. The second trading day after Memorial Day has more advances than declines, but average performance is negative for NASDAQ. The third day after appears to have the best long- and short-term record combined with solid average performance.

> # Post-Election-Year June: Third Worst S&P 500 Month

> June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 50 years as a rule ranking sixth with a 0.9% average gain, up 28 of 50 years. This contributes to NASDAQ’s “Best Eight Months” which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking ninth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.8% in the month since 1979.

> In post-election years since 1953, June still ranks poorly and its average loss for DJIA increases to –1.1% while S&P 500′s modestly positive performance becomes a 0.6% loss. DJIA struggles the most, advancing in just four post-election year Junes (1977, 1985, 1997 and 2017). Russell 2000 fares best, up seven times in ten years with an average gain of 1.2%. NASDAQ lands in the middle, advancing 50% of the time with an average gain of 0.4%.

> # Checking the Gauges: Economic Surprise Indexes

> In terms of whether economic data is either beating or missing economists’ forecasts, it appears conditions may now be a bit better overseas. Driven by some improving COVID-19 trends, the economic backdrop has improved overseas, while high economic expectations have proved to be a more formidable hurdle here in the U.S. This improvement has helped to steady the foundation in many non-U.S. equity markets, and has caused us to improve our outlook for developed non-U.S. stocks. We believe the improving COVID-19 trends in Europe could be particularly sticky as vaccine distribution becomes more widespread.

> For several years now, being underweight European equities, relative to the U.S., has been a winning trade. A sea-change in that thinking could be approaching as value-heavy European indices have gotten some attention with the improvement from value, but a firm, constructive view of European equities may still be some ways off.

> The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index, or CESI, tracks how the economic data fare compared with expectations. The index rises when economic data exceeds Bloomberg consensus estimates and falls when data is below forecasts. As shown in the LPL Chart of the day, economically, global conditions remain rather strong, as evidenced by these indices, which remain above the zero line. This reflects economic data coming in better than expected in several geographic regions. The repair of global trade activity, as supply lines are reconnected, has been notably key in non-U.S. data outcomes.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/blog-chart-5.27.21.png?ssl=1))**

> Looking ahead, we expect now elevated economic expectations, particularly in the U.S., may prove a tougher target. As a result “economic surprises,” both in the U.S. and abroad, may fade as we move through the year. However, the overall global growth trajectory is expected to continue to be robust through 2021. Global real GDP contracted 3.3% in 2020, and it is expected to rise to +6.0% in 2021, according to Bloomberg’s consensus estimate, before ticking down to +3.4% in 2022.

> “Although high U.S. economic expectations could be tough to beat for the remainder of 2021, we still believe U.S. stocks should make up a material portion of equity portfolios. And even though economic expectations are being more readily exceeded overseas, it is tough to overlook U.S. companies’ innovation and profitability advantages.” explained LPL Financial Director of Research Marc Zabicki.

> # More and More Investors Are Looking For A Correction

> The S&P 500 has been hovering around 0.5% below its record highs this week, but without a true test of those highs, sentiment has not moved very far. The American Association of Individual Investors' weekly reading on bullish sentiment fell from 37% last week down to 36.4%. While that is the second week in a row with an absolute move less than a full percentage point in size, the marginally lower reading does leave bullish sentiment at the lowest level since the end of October.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052721-AAII-Bull.png))**

> Bearish sentiment moved by even less, only rising 0.1 percentage points. At 26.4%, it still is below the reading of 27% from the first week of the month. Outside of that reading, that is the highest level since February.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052721-AAII-Bear.png))**

> This week's moves left the bull-bear spread little changed at 10. That's down 0.7 points from last week but still above the 9.5 reading from two weeks ago.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052721-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

> Once again, the highest percentage of investors are in the neutral camp at 37.1%. As was the case last week, that makes for the highest level in neutral sentiment since the first week of 2020 when it stood north of 40%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052721-AAII-Neut.png))**

> Pivoting over to sentiment for equity newsletter writers measured in the Investors Intelligence survey, there were some more interesting moves. Bullish and bearish sentiments were not necessarily anything to gawk at similar to the AAII survey. Bullish sentiment has been on the decline with this week's survey showing a 3 percentage point drop to 51.5%, the lowest level since March 10th. Meanwhile, bearish sentiment moderated from 17.2 to 16.8%. That was the same level as the start of the month.

> The percentage of respondents ""looking for a correction"" was more notable. Rather than simply asking whether or not respondents foresee a correction in the technical sense on the horizon (a 10% decline from a high), Investors Intelligence defines a newsletter writer as ""looking for a correction"" when they are bullish on a list of stocks but at a lower price point. Coming in at 31.7%, the reading is a few percentage points above the historical average of 27.6% and is in the top quartile of the historical range. In other words, it is an elevated reading albeit far from without precedence. What is more significant is that it has been over a year since this part of the survey has seen these levels.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052721-II-Correction.png))**

> In the history of the survey dating back to 1963, there have only been eight other times that the percentage of newsletter writers looking for a correction has crossed above 30% for the first time in at least a year. The most recent of these was in April 2009. In the table below we show the S&P 500's performance in the year following those occurrences. As shown, performance has been generally positive across those past instances with average gains over the following weeks and months and moves higher at least 75% of the time one month, three months, and one year out. Additionally, while there were two times, 1982 and 2009, in which the S&P 500 rallied over the following year without looking back, there were another two times, 2001 and 2007, that at the following years' lows, the S&P 500 would end up lower by double-digit percentage points.

2021-05-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"WANT TO RETIRE QUICKER? HERE'S HOW! $$$ HOW TO MAKE MONEY OFF THE WORLDWIDE SEMICONDUCTOR SHORTAGE $$$

&#x200B;

\*\*\* If you aren't in TSM ( ***Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing***) you hate money. Here are some reasons you should look into this stock and buy it before it is too late. \*\*\*

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Economics 101, Supply and Demand.**

* TSM is the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world
* THERE IS A WORLDWIDE SEMICONDUCTOR SHORTAGE
* Let me emphasize this point. THERE IS A WORLDWIDE SEMICONDUCTOR SHORTAGE

As many of you know, there is a worldwide semiconductor shortage (yes I said it again). These semiconductors are vital components in every electronic we use today. Without these semiconductors, things like smartphones, automobiles, video game consoles, etc. Would not be able to function.

(Read the following if you want to see why these semiconductors are so vital...or just completely trust me, that's fine too)

***\*ALL COMPUTERS NEEDS SEMICONDUCTORS TO FUNCTION\****

Semiconductors are used primarily in electronic devices, including chips, diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits. According to Goldman Sachs 169 industries rely on semiconductors. Anything that is computerized or uses radio waves depends on semiconductors. Your phone is a computer, your car is a computer, your video game consoles are computers, your amazon firestick is a computer, every aspect of your life is dependent on these semiconductors.

TSM PRODUCES THESE CHIPS FOR THE FOLLWOING COMPANIES AND MANY MORE:
-Apple
-Toyota
-NVIDIA
-AMD
-SO MANY MORE

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do you believe the future of automobiles are powered by electric? Not without semiconductors.

**Semiconductors in Automobiles**

1. **Vehicle electrification –** Semiconductors have made it possible to replace manual systems with electrical systems. Electrification of key systems provides benefits such as increased vehicle efficiency, reductions in carbon emissions, and minimizing oil dependency.
2. **Safety and driver assistance –** The increasing need for better safety and driver assistance systems in cars has provided a niche for semiconductors. Intelligent functions such as backup cameras, blind-spot detection, adaptive cruise control, lane change assist, airbag deployment, and emergency braking systems are all made possible through the integration of semiconductor technologies.
3. **Connectivity –** Cars are increasingly incorporating technology that improves their connectivity. New vehicles on the market include ever-more sophisticated telematics (long-distance data transmission) and infotainment capabilities which feed drivers information on factors such as road closures, collision avoidance, and even free parking spaces at their destination. On-board computers which handle this information have to process millions of lines of code every second. Semiconductors allow cars to stay connected in real-time.

Semiconductors are key to the future of the electric vehicle (EV) industry as they help to control the powertrain and battery. Semiconductors are also used in the variety of touchscreens that are installed in the driver’s dash and in the back of passenger seats.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**FINANCIALS/NEWS**

* Financially, the company has reported its third straight quarter of record sales in its first-quarter earnings report back in April.
* Its revenue came in 25.4% higher year-over-year to 12.9 billion.
* The stock has more than doubled in price over the past year
* Japan’s government recently announced that it wants TSM and Sony to invest $9.2 billion to build the country’s first 20-nanometer chip plant.
* Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) said on Friday (5/21/2021) that it has increased its 2021 output for a key component for automotive semiconductors by 60% compared with last year, amid a global chip shortage.

These are just a couple of things. If This has caught your eye please research TSM on your own and you can find more great news and financial statements...or don't, you've made it this far, might as well go all in.

It’s a yolo play for me. I would recommend leaps if you want to be safe."
2021-05-29 03:42:06,wallstreetbets,You could have copied and pasted the Bee movie script and I would be convinced.
2021-05-29 05:26:32,wallstreetbets,So what you're saying is that there is a worldwide semiconductor shortage?
2021-05-29 10:47:20,wallstreetbets,"What we need is some kind of shortage.... perhaps of superconductors.  A worldwide one, preferably."
2021-05-29 07:49:33,wallstreetbets,Hearing you loud and clear mate!.. There’s a world wide train conductor shortage and we need to buy the transports. Load up on $IYT calls!!
2021-05-29 03:38:38,wallstreetbets,"God damnit, I’m in"
2021-05-29 04:57:34,wallstreetbets,"You've been around long enough to know, positions or ban."
2021-05-29 03:46:25,wallstreetbets,This is the way.  110 shares here
2021-05-29 03:40:30,wallstreetbets,"Dude, all i have to do is all in on TSM? 🦍"
2021-05-29 04:27:58,wallstreetbets,"I cannot see how TSM cannot perform well other than the Chinese invading Taiwan and tradhing it, or breaking it up."
2021-05-29 03:48:05,wallstreetbets,Did you say there was a semiconductor shortage?
2021-05-29 04:29:58,wallstreetbets,"They may be the largest but do they produce it the quickest? I know nothing about this, it’s a genuine question. Who is their competition?"
2021-05-29 07:48:27,wallstreetbets,"I have read that when this type of shortage happens all semiconductor manufacturers ramp up production and competition becomes fierce. It causes a price war between all the semi conductor companies ultimately making them less profitable. TSMC will likely win that war because it's the world leader and can drive it's prices down beating it's competition. It's why I have seen price targets for this wonderful company actually go down. 

But maybe I'm missing something about this industry? From what I read it's PT should be trending down. Although not sure about timeframe maybe in the short term there are still tons of profits to be made."
2021-05-29 11:36:48,wallstreetbets,Why 7/16? I'm about semi conductors but this seems like a real short date with no upcoming catalyst. Why not for next year...?
2021-05-29 03:49:20,wallstreetbets,"Real question. If you’re saying TSM stands to profit from a semi shortage, will Biden’s semi bill have a positive or negative effect?"
2021-05-29 15:33:34,wallstreetbets,"There’s a semiconductor shortage due to materials. I’m bullish on semi’s, but you have to be aware that there are manufacturing contracts that are already in place and paid for.

Just waiting on materials for production."
2021-05-29 04:14:53,wallstreetbets,I’ve been long since the covid dump in these guys and AMD since they make Lisa’s chipys and AMD designed the processors for the new consoles. Really good play for the chip shortage. Only downside is Winnie the Pooh and the recent outbreak of the coof in Taiwan.

2021-05-29 03:39:40,wallstreetbets,Good dd I’m in
2021-05-29 09:15:01,wallstreetbets,"All in on TSM is better than putting everything into July 16 @ a $120 call.  That may absolutely hit, and you’ll be rich AF.  But one wrench in their shit and your YOLO will leave your ass SOLO bc your girlfriend and her boyfriend just left your ass TF alone you broke bitch.  The DD here is exactly spot on.  Options are fucked all the time. I’d never say YOLO any option strategy. Spread out your calls with exp dates. Early ones hit?  Roll them motherfuckers up like a white Owl and enjoy!  

TSM is going to be a beast. MRVL is the long play

MRVL is under $50 now. That mafuka will be 3 fo hunnit in da next couple.  Baleedat."
2021-05-29 07:34:13,wallstreetbets,this is hilarious
2021-05-29 09:08:58,wallstreetbets,"Wait a sec, so what you're saying is that,  there really is a semiconductor shortage ?"
2021-05-29 07:51:29,wallstreetbets,Sounds like there’s some sort of shortage...
2021-05-29 03:39:42,wallstreetbets,Good dd I’m in
2021-05-29 07:47:51,wallstreetbets,"I know this is wsb and not r/investing.
  
 Im long on TSM and I dont understand or want to know how option trading works.
  
Im finally green now since red days in May. But im not sure how 200 units will make me retire early."
2021-05-29 09:27:31,wallstreetbets,Why TSM with cap of $552B and not INTC with mkt cap of just 237B?
2021-05-29 09:57:29,wallstreetbets,My algo stock picker really likes this stock. I had some but sold it. You may have convinced me to buy more or some options.
2021-05-29 10:30:53,wallstreetbets,But I’m semi conductable and short?
2021-05-29 17:38:38,wallstreetbets,I don’t see how the stock is under priced right now. It’s double pre-covid level

2021-05-29 09:32:00,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like decent DD, i do wonder what semiconductor supply looks like right now and if it can satisfy demand."
2021-05-29 10:42:40,wallstreetbets,But what will this do to my ornamental gourd futures?
2021-05-29 13:55:38,wallstreetbets,I wanted to buy shares at Monday and put buy limit at 108... now it's at 117 🤡
2021-05-29 17:18:54,wallstreetbets,"You make some really excellent points. I think short term your spot on but long-term... Do you think this will sprout opportunities for competition or companies doing vertical integration and buying/starting their own chip factories?  Although this is easier said than done maybe long-term it's good to watch out for new competition sprouting up as a man will be so high I'm sure they'll do good as well. 

Honestly this will be a great thing for long-term because the West depends on Asia too much for this nice would be nice to be self-reliant Nice dd"
2021-05-29 08:22:26,wallstreetbets,"It's a stupid play if you rely on EVs to drive demand. You know what are the most important factors for EV chips? Not size or computing power - it's easy to cram more slower & larger chips into a car. Not energy efficiency - it's peanuts compared to the energy needed to move 2 tons of steel around. Not heat efficiency - just put more fans in there. It's reliability and price. 

Even if the demand is there, TSM won't be able to price gouge EV manufacturers - EVs don't need fancy 7nm chips, manufacturers will just buy cheaper and widely available 16/14nm chips from the competitors. It's also cheaper to increase the production capacity for 'larger' chips and TSMC doesn't have any edge in this play.

Not to mention that TSMC is already operating at max capacity, and scaling up low margin chip production is harder and less profitable than selling $50 iphone cables. With the global demand for computing power, TSMC will grow, but its price may not."
2021-05-29 13:15:44,wallstreetbets,AMC to the moon. Got it
2021-05-29 13:55:12,wallstreetbets,"That sounds well and all, but when China decides to flex on Taiwan, TSM will crater, and for that reason I'm out."
2021-05-29 07:04:17,wallstreetbets,You could be better off reading the DD on another subreddit and looking at a Tweet from Ryan Choen. If something is going to happen in the market it is unlikely to be here in the short term unless the company is Shorted to hell
2021-05-29 03:51:44,wallstreetbets,"I'll join in, I like this stock."
2021-05-29 05:54:16,wallstreetbets,$15k in time to yolo the shit out of this!
2021-05-29 10:18:05,wallstreetbets,Supporting TSM doesn't even feel good for eSports. Idk mom
2021-05-29 12:30:44,wallstreetbets,"If you want to buy into something higher up the semiconductor chain: ASML and BESI. One behemoth and one smaller Dutch semiconductor machine builders. ASML almost has a monopoly on the machines building the smallest chips. BESI has shown tremendous growth and has good growth potential. It is also on sale now because of them putting their biggest sale in Q2 instead of Q1. 

Both boomer stocks I know but I made a lot of money from them."

2021-05-29 15:45:07,wallstreetbets,"And China invades Taiwan... then what? Or what about a naval blockade?

Maybe not today... maybe not tomorrow but China wants Taiwan back.. you can take THAT to the bank."
2021-05-29 12:36:39,wallstreetbets,"what are they going to do with that extra capacity when people will not have stimuli to consume so much, thus dropping the demand?"
2021-05-29 12:41:41,wallstreetbets,"Around 1/3 of a modern vehicles production cost is in the electronic systems,  not steel and other things."
2021-05-29 14:17:49,wallstreetbets,Why is the stock in a bear trend right now if demand is so high?
2021-05-29 09:29:35,wallstreetbets,"Us Gov is looking to fund US based competition to move away from Taiwan. Add to that the increased China naval presence near Taiwan and their recent history of “taking back what’s ours” (see Hong Kong) 
It’s a risky position. In my opinion Texas Instruments is a better play and they will be subsidized by the US government. 

Is anyone looking downstream at auto companies and shorting?"

2021-05-29 17:21:43,wallstreetbets,"Depends if you want to take a chance on “fast money” with high risks or a guaranteed profit long term with low risk.  AMC is a high risk, high volatility, high return play due to the high volume and short squeeze.  However, amc as a company, fundamentals, technicals make it a poor choice long term.  Tsm, as the author of this post stated is in high demand and a necessary component.  Tsm fundamentals, technicals definitely support low risk high profitability as a long term company investment.  So you can decide what you should do with your 3 grand by asking yourself what your investing goals are and what is your level of risk you are willing to take.  The safe investment is Tsm.  Long term Leap options 1-2 years out in the money or stock shares is the safest high probability positive return on investment."

2021-05-29 18:31:55,wallstreetbets,And am i the only one who noticed biontech as a buy on the day they announced the vaccine with pfizer they have only 1600 employees and not nearly the overhead cost that pfizer does so biontech was the one to buy that day it was 35ish a share i believe it hit about 208 but i know for a fact in one year it did do exactly as i thought off info i got from cash app and checking into it the day the contract was confirmed... I think theres still gains to be made as they vaccinate 17-5yr olds u pros check it out even tho i know i was already correct with the first position but i had no capital disnt even get my stimulus which i wanted to use but i live in flint mi and have been unemployed for 2yrs while raising a son i do own my home so i didnt have to worry about rent which allowed me to STAY HOME! idk wanted to talk about this cuz i feel i missed the best opportunity of my life...

They will lose money and it will be our gain because them being forced to buy will drive prices up further."

2021-05-29 02:35:45,wallstreetbets,They had strong earnings and pulled back to the mid teens.   Currently $21 and change with The all time high at $24. The $30 calls are a great way to burn tendies.

2021-05-29 15:56:01,wallstreetbets,I think this next earnings and the stock buybacks will push it to a new level. I mean that’s what stock buybacks are for really. They go heavy on buybacks when they think the stock is undervalued.

2021-05-29 11:02:18,wallstreetbets,"What's the idea here? That gun companies will do well under democrat leadership because everyone's buying up firearms just in case they're made illegal? But the reality is that they will never be illegal? 

Thats my only guess. I'd be scared to hold stock in these companies for the reason that you never fucking know what will happen with gov stuff. who knows, they could somehow abolish the 2nd amendment and then these companies are screwed"
2021-05-29 16:02:45,wallstreetbets,"The ammo companies are a bit priced in at this point. But when vsto was $20 i invested there. I do agree the ammo sells more and is better long term probably. But then again, theres also people who reload their ammunition or just will wait and not pay high prices. Or there are new off brand companies making ammo now. Guns are a bit more barrier to entry. Also there is branding people follow and s&w is well known for a lot of their specific models, ars pistols revolvers even handcuffs."

2021-05-29 16:11:51,wallstreetbets,Wasn’t it GME only at first. AMC was rejected initially. Anyways i’m just trying to bring attention to an undervalued stock. I’m not trying to mislead anyone and I don’t think it is a dead stock. It should outperform the other gun companies and overall this is one of industries that are doing very well after covid.
2021-05-29 13:08:40,wallstreetbets,"OLN's good, though I really like the revenue growth that's happened since VSTO acquired Remington ammo.  Either way, ammo sales have held strong, people can't get enough of it, and I don't think you can go wrong with either company."
2021-05-29 16:04:00,wallstreetbets,"I did this play last quarter with calls at $17.5.  After recovering from the post earnings sell off, I sold for a small gain and forever bid farewell to SWBI.  Wish you luck."
2021-05-29 19:51:07,wallstreetbets,You can simultaneously believe there’s no way this stock goes over $30 while also believing it doesn’t drop enough for puts to be profitable enough to play it. Way too many other opportunities for directional options plays to waste on a stock that has an $8 range for 10 months.

2021-05-29 18:18:59,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. The 2nd isn't going away, but under Dems the markets are volatile.  Dems are talking about registering more parts, which would mean All manufacturers retooling their entire lines.  Registering ammo, which would reduce ammo sales and drive up reloading components.  Getting rid of rifle-caliber pistols, which would again make lots of existing parts-stock illegal/drive demand near zero. 

Or SC could step in and say Nope.  Or Dems in purple areas could say Nope.  Or  NeoCons could jump on the ban wagon. We just don't know."

2021-05-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Vertex Energy, DD Remember, you ultimately make your own decisions in life. I am no financial advisor and this is not a recommendation, just knowledge I would like to share.. Heres to Vertex Energy and why I think it won't stop rising in price for the next few days...

First off, we have the $75 million deal to buy the Mobile refinery in Alabama from Royal Dutch Shell PLC which is expected to close by the end of the year, and would be the largest and most significant transaction Vertex has ever completed.

With the additional $85 million conversion of the Mobile refinery's hydrocracking unit, Vertex expects the refinery will have the potential to generate at least $3 billion in annual sales and $400 million of gross profit annually beginning in 2023.

As part of this transaction, Vertex will assume ownership of more than 3 million barrels of crude oil and product storage, together with other valuable logistics assets. Our vision for this site is that of diversification. We will seek to lead the southeast region in marketing next generation fuels and products that are not currently produced by the refinery today.

Vertex will become the sole owner and operator of the refinery upon closing. The refinery, which has a long track record of safe, reliable operations and consistent financial performance, will become Vertex's flagship refining asset upon the close of the transaction, positioning the Company to become a pure-play producer of renewable and conventional products. Highly attractive transaction economics, pro-forma for renewable diesel fuel project.

Still with me? Ok, so...

Vertex expects the average gross profit per barrel on its renewable diesel production will be significantly higher than that of the Mobile refinery's conventional fuels production, including the benefit of tax subsidies and carbon-reduction incentives. As this project involves the conversion of an existing, operating process unit, Vertex anticipates that both the capital cost and anticipated time-to-market will be significantly less than that of comparable greenfield conversion projects.​

Also, here's what Alvaro Ruiz, EVP of Corporate Development at Vertex had to say:

""As part of this transaction, we plan to enter into a multi-year crude supply and product offtake agreements with several highly-respected counterparties, including Shell, who has been an exceptional partner throughout the sale process. We believe these agreements will position us to reduce our working capital requirements, while mitigating spot market risk on product sales. Upon closing, we expect to hedge a significant portion of the first-year production, reducing our near-term exposure to movements in refined product margins, as we focus on completing the planned asset conversion, which remains the most significant near-term economic driver resulting from this transaction.""

BIG NEWS BOYS AND GIRLS​
Most importantè piece of info, right here:⤵️


PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION: Vertex intends to enter into a multi-year product off-take agreement with Shell, while continuing to supply Bunker Holding (""Bunker One"") under an existing 10-year agreement. Under the agreements, Shell and Bunker One will purchase 100% of the Mobile refinery's conventional fuels production. Concurrent with this arrangement, Vertex will enter into a separate, long-term agreement under which Idemitsu Apollo Corporation, a wholly-owned California-based subsidiary of Idemitsu Kosan, will purchase 100% of the Mobile refinery's renewable diesel fuel production. The sale of all conventional and unconventional fuels will be priced against spot market index prices.​

Okay, whew, that was beginning to strain MY eyes.. Here's - to me, the best thing out of all this info and the best for our future as a cleaner environment: 

Renewable diesel is a biofuel that can be produced from organic waste and vegetable oils. Renewable diesel is a sustainable, fungible replacement for petroleum-based diesel fuel. While California remains the primary market for domestically produced renewable diesel, given the economic benefits for its use under the state's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, other states are expected to follow suit, creating significant, incremental demand during the next decade. Once operable, the Mobile refinery's converted hydrocracking unit will be capable of processing a wide range of organic, pre-treated feedstocks, including soybean and corn oil, meat tallow and waste vegetable oils, among others.​
 
Thanks for your time.

2021-05-29 01:13:26,wallstreetbets,"Great except ‘renewable’ bio-fuels are as carbon intensive to produce as Dino oil.  Got nitrogen fertilizer?  It came from natural gas.  Got a planter and a combine?  Those run on diesel.  Spray for crops?  Petroleum is the emulsifier in many herbicides and pesticides.  Transportation to the elevator?  More diesel.  Grain elevator blowers - mostly running off of a fossil fuel plant.  Solvent to extract oil from soybeans?  Hexane.  Heat for extraction process?  Natural Gas.  

Get the idea?  I wouldn’t invest a nickel into any bio-fuel on the basis that they’re somehow going to be part solution to carbon footprint reduction.

You need industrial agriculture to do it and industrial agriculture is a big part of the problem."

There are plenty more ways to make all this without the conventional ways you mentioned.  Even if for the 1st year or 2 they still do it in conventional ways it won't be nearly as negative of an impact on the environment as much as normal oil or gas would."

2021-05-29 02:52:36,wallstreetbets,"I feel that the way the world is shaping out, in 20 years, alot of farmers will be forced to switch or corn due to lack of nutrients in the soil from continuous crop growing, without a natural nutrient supply to support it and especially all the pesticides poisoning the soil. Thats from my own personal experience seeing alot of the farmers from here in California - switch from whatever crop they were growing, over to corn. Also due to the climate changing all around the world. Humans are messing up the ways the world replenishes itself. I believe you when you say there are better things, but the powers that be of this world have it the way they do for some reason."

2021-05-29 08:18:52,wallstreetbets,"Dude.  You don’t get it.  I was a design engineer for Disney’s Harvest Power Plant over a decade ago.  I also worked for Consolidated Grain - one of the largest soybean processors in the US.

I’m telling you, I know a little more about this market than what is written on Wikipedia.  All bio-fuels are heavily subsidized right now and without those subsidies some would not exist.  They don’t make sense from a thermodynamic standpoint and are net consumers of energy.  I look technical proposals on making fuels from things like hog shit that would blow your mind.  Smithfield foods for instance is a company that’s  huge into this market.  And methane is a renewable fuel - not just a GHG. It is referenced to as RNG or renewable natural gas.  There is an entire market around producing it from organic waste.  That’s exactly what Disney was doing a decade ago.

Anyhow, I am not here to argue with some rando on the internet.  I am only writing this to encourage you to at least try to understand this market before throwing money into it."
2021-05-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$RKT 💯🎯🚀 SHORT SQUEEZE 3 MONTHS UPDATE!!! It has been 3 months since my last DD post on $RKT. It was on a Thursday night 02/25/2021 when I posted, at the time RKT was around 19-20 range and on the following Monday 03/01/2021 it started rallying, by 03/02 & 03/03 it hit the ATH level 43. You’re welcome to find my last DD post for verification. And for those of you who made tendies on it congratulations to you all! Spread the good energy!

As I am writing this post Today is 05/28/2021, I’ll try to bring more data and technical analysis on $RKT, as you all saw what happened yesterday 05/27/2021 around lunch time upon sudden move it went from 17.50 area all the way to 19.40. This move doesn’t seem so random at all, a combination of someone noticed this to be a strategic technical squeeze just testing the water after it being suppressed down for the past 3 months, and you can see how fast the shorts started covering all of a sudden.

Today 05/28/2021, at opening it shot up to $19.20 but the shorts came prepared for $RKT this morning with their analysts and news blasting numerous articles and downgrades from Morgan Stanley, Wedbush & Zacks, ALL AT ONCE. This is certainly no coincidence.

On the technical side, on the daily chart as you can see it has a gap to fill around 22.67 area then it’ll go straight to 28 and has a huge potential to pass beyond that and make it to a new all-time high, there’s nothing stopping it. On the daily MACD closed red and turned green, RSI is at the same level as last time before it squeezed to ATH $43, Parabolic S.A.R indicator flipped from red on the daily to green for the first time in 3 months. Another important factor is as you look at the volume and candle compared to last time it exploded (both red arrows) same volume, same price action.

Conclusion: the shorts are basically scared sh\*tless right now and they know it, is a tickle to the trigger for it to explode again like last time or even higher. Based on Excess Returns Model the fair value for RKT is $85, so why haven't we seen $100 yet?

2021-05-29 15:17:21,wallstreetbets,I truly believe RKT is so fickle. It’s so easy to manipulate but at the same time it just needs a bit of retail confidence to make it explode. Shorts are definitely on edge with this one. Pos: 100 January 2023 40.89c. Looking to retire off this one.

2021-05-28 23:02:22,wallstreetbets,I’ve been monitoring this all week with amc & GME rallying. I expect this one to follow. RKT Liftoff 2.0 incoming Tuesday ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|upvote)
2021-05-29 08:58:36,wallstreetbets,So Rkt up or down?
2021-05-29 03:35:11,wallstreetbets,Rkt $100-$150
2021-05-29 14:16:11,wallstreetbets,"Buy shares and hold, if your shorting against rocket you need to cover"
2021-05-28 22:17:36,wallstreetbets,"Hope this materializes ASAP 5,000 shares in the toilet so far . I wish the apes could unite and come to the rescue , these company has more logic and fundamentals for an upside than other memes , so if is possible male amc almost 40 today why not rkt in $50"
2021-05-29 01:08:17,wallstreetbets,"So I saw this price action and agree that someone appears to be “testing the waters.” IV spiked massively in the course of ten minutes, call strikes 6x’d. It was odd. I went and looked at the options chain for June 18th and it is VERY reminiscent of what AMC’s looked like for this week’s expiry a couple of weeks back, with stair stepped relatively large open interest even at fairly high strikes. With some volume and a whale stepping in I agree this looks primed for a gamma squeeze"
2021-05-29 05:02:19,wallstreetbets,Don’t tell u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT
2021-05-29 09:06:33,wallstreetbets,"Great technical analysis can’t wait for more posts. I agree with what you’re saying on a technical and fundamental basis. I believe this is a high quality stock that gets beat up way too hard

Edit: I also posted a DD discussing fundamentals of RKT in WSB about 5 hours ago if anyone is interested"
2021-05-28 21:56:43,wallstreetbets,Put in my limit buy! Actually sounds like a decent company but I only read their financials so far.
2021-05-29 00:21:44,wallstreetbets,I can confirm. I rememember his DD from March and bought an RKT contract. I made over 1000% on that contract. It was great. On Monday I'm signing up for round 2.
2021-05-29 17:29:17,wallstreetbets,I'm a RKT man. Averaging down rather than tempted to sell as I know with all of us together we can beat the market manipulation. Whether its Rocket's turn this time or next it will fly.
2021-05-29 11:26:28,wallstreetbets,It skipped over the 19.90 gap and now there is a gap at 16.90 complete manipulation.
2021-05-29 02:02:53,wallstreetbets,"I wanted to love RKT, but it didn't love me back. So I left like any abused SOB.  But like any abusive relationship, it's hard to say no to more.  And I'll come back.  After RKT gets beat up a bit to feel what it's like."
2021-05-29 09:41:15,wallstreetbets,"RKT holder here

RKT is undervalued, I will buy more if I have fund"

2021-05-29 00:06:11,wallstreetbets,UWMC is a better play if you’re hoping for a squeeze
2021-05-28 23:25:26,wallstreetbets,Helpful and interesting. Thank you.
2021-05-28 21:53:07,wallstreetbets,"short squeeze this, short squeeze that, blah blah blah RKT doesn't even have significant short interest that you mentioned"
2021-05-29 12:41:01,wallstreetbets,"While past behavior does not indicate future behavior, i hope your premonition comes true. I resigned myself to hold my small bags long and either take a small gain or write a loss before the end of the year. 

If it peaks high, dian fossey will get 10% for sure."
2021-05-29 17:17:13,wallstreetbets,Why is no one mentioning it went up because of the special dividend last time.
2021-05-28 21:57:44,wallstreetbets,"TLDR 

I sold my 1.7 shares of RKT today & threw it at AMC...so what are you talking about bruh?"
2021-05-29 09:58:56,wallstreetbets,If it does spike how many days do you think it will last?
2021-05-28 22:11:16,wallstreetbets,Si what numbers are we looking at and by when?
2021-05-28 23:25:20,wallstreetbets,I feel the last rise was due to the special dividen which won’t happen again this year most likely
2021-05-29 00:06:38,wallstreetbets,Can we get some more info on the short side? This was in my watch list since it came down under $20. Calls are cheap though 😋
2021-05-29 01:40:20,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the first round of tendies!! Last earnings ah drop was brutal....but maybe???!!!
2021-05-29 02:04:40,wallstreetbets,"Was listening to one of their adds on the Radio today in Rockville, MD."
2021-05-29 07:04:23,wallstreetbets,When do you think the next squeeze will happen? Next ER?
2021-05-29 07:36:44,wallstreetbets,Last time it had the catalyst of an earnings report though right? What’s the catalyst this time?
2021-05-29 11:24:13,wallstreetbets,I own RKT shares & have been since IPO. Is it too late to buy calls?
2021-05-29 13:02:47,wallstreetbets,I like UWMC better it has dividends!
2021-05-29 10:00:27,wallstreetbets,"Keep dreaming.  I saw the spike. It meant nothing to me and to Wall Street.  If it was a squeeze, it didn't last more than about 1 hour.  Squeees require buying pressure.  All I keep seeing is this stock dropping.  The stock closed down again aground $17.71.  

Right now a naked put into June 11 with a strike of $17 pays over 50 cents which is $500 per 10 contracts.  That doesn't look optimistic, but who know what will happen.

The reality is that the stock is doing nothing, but going down since May 5 after it announced.  It is a bank type of stock with a lot of negative sentiment, kind of like UWM.

I had a big position, but unloaded all but 1,000 shares when I saw it falling after the 1 cent earnings miss, fears of higher rates, and not so great comments by the CEO  Now I am in at $21.5 with a $21.89 call into September for about a $1,000.

I hope  I am wrong, but I see nothing on the horizon to move this stock up.  

Good Luck.  Dreams and hope keeps us motivated."

2021-05-29 11:21:19,wallstreetbets,RKT is a distraction.  GME is the way.
2021-05-29 09:17:52,wallstreetbets,Fuck RKT
2021-05-29 10:29:07,wallstreetbets,Market cap is so high for RKT I doubt it budges more than 5%
2021-05-29 18:45:29,wallstreetbets, 💩 stock
2021-05-29 01:38:16,wallstreetbets,This is a man who has been watching RKT chart for far too long to dictate his confirm bias.. Happens to all of us OP
2021-05-29 11:24:14,wallstreetbets,"I'm sorry but I refuse to support a literal scam, downvote me if you'd like but no significant squeeze will happen with RKT"
2021-05-29 03:10:12,wallstreetbets,I cut my loss and threw all into GME. Glad I did. The shareholder meeting on June 9th is going to push the price hard.
2021-05-29 12:19:53,wallstreetbets,If the trading on this company is as bad as the way they process loans (or doesn't) I wouldn't touch this stock with a strippers dick and 5 condoms.  Rocket is a total joke!  Absolutely by far the most inefficient company I have ever dealt with in my entire life.

2021-05-29 16:15:32,wallstreetbets,That’s a smart position especially if you bought recently with such low IV.

2021-05-29 15:49:08,wallstreetbets,Really? Link to confirm
2021-05-29 16:11:05,wallstreetbets,Is this real? I thought they could do the buyback whenever

2021-05-29 02:33:26,wallstreetbets,lol
2021-05-29 03:55:09,wallstreetbets,"It’s hilarious to me how “short interest” has become synonymous with how well the price is going to do. All because of GME.

Short interest is how many shares have been shorted, but not everything is a squeeze waiting to happen. It’s generally not really an indicator either way whether short interest is high or low. A lot of the times shares are shorted because the fundamentals of the company are trash, and market players believe the price is inflated due to hype or something unsubstantiated"
2021-05-29 03:47:16,wallstreetbets,I did read somewhere this week that there was 40m odd shares short
2021-05-29 11:11:24,wallstreetbets,This guy isn't here to hand feed you. You have to at least put in some work. If you looked at the charts yourself you'd see what he is saying is on point

2021-05-29 09:56:35,wallstreetbets,They should go back to being a private company and pay us all $30 a share
2021-05-28 23:06:41,wallstreetbets,I endorse this comment. Last time RKT rallied to all time high soon after GME and AMC.
2021-05-29 07:26:47,wallstreetbets,Once one of them squeezes you'll see apes pour into others like BB and rkt
2021-05-29 13:41:20,wallstreetbets,Rkt gets to 65 and youre loaded
2021-05-29 03:54:02,wallstreetbets,I can confirm...I noticed the spike too. It was definitely strange. 'Testing' wrote all over it
2021-05-29 05:22:14,wallstreetbets,"Yup. Brent from SpotGamma was quick to notice. I wonder if the stock can jump like it did Weds with ~100k volume in 5/28 strikes, what happens if we see 200K+? 👀"
2021-05-29 10:16:04,wallstreetbets,There is so much to like about this stock. Also I am pretty sure the $1billion buyback program they pledged to this year hasn’t even begun.

2021-05-28 23:57:12,wallstreetbets,Nah bro - I don't even know how to get access to buying actual IPO stock. I buy retail like every other ape. By the time I got to it it was already like $25 or something.
2021-05-29 15:49:34,wallstreetbets,"If op provides sources good on them... That's just good DD and slightly autistic... But if you understand the post and have been watching the same charts everyone has access to all this post is about is confirmation bias for the monkeys still in this.

Plus anyone investing thousands of dollars into something should do their own fucking homework anyway"
2021-05-29 08:28:10,wallstreetbets,"Yeah...I thought that might have something to do with it, but think there is more to it....something we're not seeing / hearing (possibly)"
2021-05-29 12:47:16,wallstreetbets,What determines whether or not you get the shares for your contract price? How much do you owe if the contract expires?
2021-05-29 11:18:32,wallstreetbets,"“Diamond handing” is the dumbest play you could make. Take profits people, and if you still “like the stock” then buy back in when these manipulated, dogshit tickers drill to the center of the earth and ride the next wave up."
2021-05-29 00:57:14,wallstreetbets,You replied to a bot my dude
2021-05-29 18:23:12,wallstreetbets,Yeah no...I limit ordered the RKT IPO on robinhood and got in just over 18 when it started trading to retail. You must have woken up a few hours late that day.
2021-05-29 02:17:03,wallstreetbets,Robinhood is offering ipo access now soo far soo good
2021-05-29 08:31:25,wallstreetbets,It's looped in with other memes but it's a fundamentally sound company that didn't need saving or restructuring but because home sales declined it got taken advantage of and shorted.
2021-05-29 13:29:03,wallstreetbets,"You can opt to exercise the contract which would give you 100 shares per contract. However in order to exercise you must have the money to purchase the 100 shares per contract at the contract price.   


You never owe but you can lose your initial investment; the contract expires and the price you anticipated isn’t met and you lose. If the price is met then you lose nothing but if the price is exceeded and it expires you get your initial investment plus whatever the percentage over goes. 

Letting your contract expire in the money is typically what folks do for a number of reasons but often because they don’t have the money to exercise and/or don’t want to hold the actual shares after their goal is met."
2021-05-29 02:55:55,wallstreetbets,Imagine Robinhood
2021-05-29 10:13:49,wallstreetbets,"I heard the big reason WS hates RKT is that Dan Gilbert kept an abnormally large portion of the outstanding shares after they went public. I’ve heard well over 90% but I’m not sure about that. On OpenInsider there is record of him and his wife each selling 20million shares (to fund a recent charity initiative) and it decreased their ownership by ~1%.

2021-05-29 11:06:05,wallstreetbets,Just buy as many shares as much money you can spare to gamble. If the signals are right you better buy when the market opens because if it starts climbing even by a little you will be buying less percentage of shares.

2021-05-28 20:38:51,wallstreetbets,"As someone who was lucky enough to ride the first GME rocket, I hope you all that are up big already on AMC are taking some profit at least. Play with house money! Be a little cautious with the story line that this is a GME esque squeeze, as it's really not the same situation. Not that you should to listen to some random..just want to see everyone making money on this amazing opportunity

Now I'll take my downvotes into oblivion like a man lol"
2021-05-28 21:48:06,wallstreetbets,"AMC & BB gonna go CRAZY next week, hooooly"
2021-05-28 23:12:14,wallstreetbets,Is anyone talking about beyond meat? Seems like that’s all Jimothy Cramer talked about today
2021-05-29 05:02:21,wallstreetbets,Its curious that a stock who had about 50%SI while GME had 140% SI in january is ripping now. AMC had a lot of share offerings and diluted the shit out of their stock while gamestop had only one with 3 million shares. They couldnt have covered GME and left AMC. Institutional ownership in GME was higher than AMC and still is. I suspect after AMC finishes ripping it will be GME's turn

2021-05-29 13:43:06,wallstreetbets,We need to dig in to Humble soon guys.
2021-05-29 14:03:40,wallstreetbets,You guys have to be mindful that not only do short squeezes push stocks higher but low float on a stock does too.  IBRX seems to be a mid-cap but its float is small for what it is.  Hidden low float stock.  82% of the company owned by one person who isn't going to sell because he's already a billionaire.  Big conference coming 06/04.   Pancreatic cancer trial data comes out in a conference they signed up for months ago.  Looking for that cancer moonshot.

2021-05-29 14:14:24,wallstreetbets,Mind to explain the reason? Because all he said was that it was shorted heavily for no reason. That short is not there anymore. The squeeze has been performed.
2021-05-28 20:25:11,wallstreetbets,What date on the calls? I think you did pretty well there if those shares got called away today. Max profit

2021-05-29 15:54:33,wallstreetbets,Go over to the bb sub honestly it is a really good long play aswell. They have recently gotten a few huge government contracts for cyber security and some for 5G and 6G ( yeah that’s now a thing). It’s missed a some quarterlies but not by much its mainly down to the pandemic. As long as they can continue filling contracts it’s a really good play with a solid business model and expansion.

2021-05-29 01:28:19,wallstreetbets,"It kind of seemed like he was going to attempt to use some weak reverse psychology to try and bait the WSB crowd in the direction of those stocks, but he didn't really even go that far.  He basically just said that somehow WSB would be spiting him by making said investments...

To be fair, he DIDN'T say the aforementioned three were BETTER moves than GME or AMC, in fact he said anyone selling and worse considering shorting either would be crazy given how locked in on them that those on WSB are right now.  He stated, basically that those on here underestimated the collective power of the (somewhat) unified group by ONLY targetting AMC and GME.  The problem with the whole premise for that segment, was his weird assumption that that a present focus on the two meant that we do not follow the market as a whole, and have not set our sights, or indeed begun to move on other stocks.

I doubt he even really believed as much, it seemed more like he knew most people on WSB would have zero interest in listening to him, so he didn't put all that much effort into the whole ""somehow you'll be putting me in my place if you...invest in these stocks I'm about to suggest"" idea."
2021-05-29 02:04:39,wallstreetbets,It's actually really tasty and will be quite successful in convincing people they can cut back on their meat production for the sake of the planet. Not sure about the company. But the products is good.
2021-05-28 22:20:03,wallstreetbets,BYND was a meme stock in this sub about a year ago. Too bad every single retard here thinks only in terms of GME and AMC as if they’re the only tickers to exist.

2021-05-29 14:23:09,wallstreetbets,"There has been no squeeze on GME. GME had a Gamma Squeeze.  Shorts have not covered anything......they never planned to. Same goes for AMC. They may squeeze but there are more legal shares issued available for AMC compared to GME. Time will tell on them both but the reason why he saw more in GME is because they have a way to change the gaming industry for years to come and has an easy way to transform into a great online business model. AMC's business model is limited comparatively because the experience is not the same from streaming a movie compared to the theater experience.  .  Make money on AMC guys ....I have. Make money on GME.....BB, NOK, KOSS, ect......they will all make money in this WSB market."

2021-05-28 21:53:17,wallstreetbets,"SOY PROTEIN ISOLATE

Processed soy is particularly bad. Whereas fermented, organic soy in small amounts (like natto) does not pose serious health risks, eating soy protein isolate will definitely take its toll on the body.

Some effects of soy include decreased libido, mood swings, depression, and several others.

This study from Harvard found that men consuming the equivalent of one cup of soy milk per day had 50% lower sperm count than men who did not consume soy. That includes even counting other factors like age, caffeine and alcohol intake, etc.

JUST WAIT. THERE’S MORE.

This study found that soy stimulated the growth of estrogen-dependent tumors found in breast cancer. And this one found the same thing.

This study found that,

“…this pilot study indicates that prolonged consumption of soy protein isolate has a stimulatory effect on the premenopausal female breast, characterized by increased secretion of breast fluid, the appearance of hyperplastic epithelial cells, and elevated levels of plasma estradiol. These findings are suggestive of an estrogenic stimulus from the isoflavones genistein and daidzein contained in soy protein isolate.“

Soy is high in phytic acid, also known as phytates. These phytates prevent the absorption of minerals like iron and calcium (among others). This can be particularly harmful, especially for children.


Additionally, soy is high in phytoestrogen (source). This can block normal estrogen, wich leads not just to hormonal imbalance, but even breast cancer.

Note: this is why my periods were so heavy, painful and irregular when I was a vegetarian as a teen.

YEAST EXTRACT AKA MONOSODIUM GLUTAMATE (MSG)

MSG hides under many names and yeast extract is one of them. MSG is an excitotoxin, i.e. it overstimulates the nervous system.


TITANIUM DIOXIDE

Yet another carcinogen.

Above all, be responsible, this is not a game you can loose everything you’ve got, easily, in a day. 

I tends of how to actually buy stocks you can buy through your bank or with Robinhood or e-toro apps that have zero commission, but careful the design is gamification friendly meaning it looks and feels like a game though it isn’t, it’s money. 

Good luck"

2021-05-29 10:15:13,wallstreetbets,It already started a streaming subscription service😂
2021-05-28 20:46:26,wallstreetbets,"Neat. But unless you think the stock is actually worth this, and it's not a short squeeze, then your diamond cock could switch to selling puts after cashing out. Taking a similarly bullish position but collecting premiums every period, and then getting saddled with shares later."
2021-05-29 08:00:49,wallstreetbets,No one says c*ck anymore.
2021-05-28 22:04:06,wallstreetbets,"Market value minus return, is so easy a 2nd grader can do it. Either why tho"
2021-05-28 21:54:23,wallstreetbets,The?
2021-05-29 11:42:03,wallstreetbets,"That's cool. never heard of it before now, and the streaming market is pretty saturated"
2021-05-28 20:48:46,wallstreetbets,I’m hoping to timing the peak and throwing down some major puts. Gotta hold for a squeeze first though
2021-05-29 08:04:26,wallstreetbets,You just said cock?

2021-05-29 00:36:24,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit. You actually didn't take the profit on the 40C or 30C. You took no profit. What do you think is going to happen on Tuesday when they're <4DTE bud? May trade flat or go up slower maybe dip and moon again but the 40C won't likely only see greener days. As in, you should have sold and bought back for half off on Tuesday and rinse and repeat. 

I was impressed at first because you made a lot off shares with a super high avg cost. With weeklys, you're trading not investing. This should be flaired yolo. I hope it works out, I want you to make money so I can say fuck you but idk if you're fucked or not. Wouldn't want to be your wife on Tuesday if it's red."

2021-05-29 14:29:21,wallstreetbets,"Normally you wouldn't know until the votes come in, but Adam Aron is taking special measures to get the data on votes being sent out. The theory is that the initial vote was postponed because too many votes came in for the number of shares that have been issued. Since not everyone votes he is getting the data on votes being sent out to get an accurate picture of how many shares there are actually moving on the market rather than an estimate based on votes that come in. This can also potentially help track down where these additional shares are coming from.

This may not be the case, its just speculation. The only information we have to go off of is that as of last count there were 3.2 million investors in amc in the us & canada, another 850,000 in south korea. Being ultra conservative, even if the German exchange and everywhere else in the world only adds another 1 million investors that is 5 million, meaning the average shareholder would only have 100 shares. It's possible, but not probable, polling suggests the average is closer to 250 shares."
2021-05-29 19:52:29,wallstreetbets,We’ll see. Clearly haven’t been following AMC. I’ll come back to check this next week.

2021-05-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why I'm Buying DRAFTKINGS options ( Playoffs + Legal in FL) I bought draft king options because sports are hot right now (NBA + NHL playoffs + UFC)

Also, Florida just passed legal online sports betting which is HUGE.

This is not financial advise just telling you why I made my choices! YOLO at your own risk

&#x200B;

More sports betting on the Draftkings sportsbook and the Draftkings Daily fantasy will increase earnings for the company which is almost always good for stock growth. Since the stadiums are open now there is a more emotional energy with sports right now and that is making people make emotional bets on DraftKings.   


Also now that Florida is on board that is a huge new market that will allow DraftKings to grow significantly too. What do you guys think?"
2021-05-28 20:08:36,wallstreetbets,Draft king seems like it has a good future.  I think it’s kind of in a show me mode right now. $50 has been a brick wall this week and 200 day sma is a key to retake.  I think the start of the nfl/college season will be one possible catalyst.   If their betting ramps then up up and away probably through the super bowl.   The concern is will gambling be big or will travel and attendance such cash away from the betting.  Another catalyst would be states like NY actually legalizing.  That would grow their customer base.  If they could get several states to legalize in time for football season the this stock should take off.  Until then I think it’s just stuck in neutral.   Now you know states are hungry for new tax revenue so legalization is just a matter of when not if.
2021-05-28 20:08:37,wallstreetbets,I'm long draft kings shares. Gambling is addictive and this is going to be a cash cow. Plenty of room to grow. Ka Ching!
2021-05-29 12:23:37,wallstreetbets,"Any positions?

It’s not like it showed up earlier this week and SHOCKED everyone. It’s been talked about for years and everything has pointed to this outcome for months.

2021-05-29 09:38:34,wallstreetbets,well i bought it at 44 cents and it jumped up almost 20% since then so I bought at it's lowest point in a LONG TIME a week before the playoffs even started. I think its just gonna continue to surge through the playoffs
2021-05-29 15:40:35,wallstreetbets,"All growth stocks were at their lowest point in a long time and have rebounded since. It’s just a coincidence. Growth got hammered all feb-April. Last few weeks, they’ve rebounded around 20%."
2021-05-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"""Bulls make money, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered"" At what point should you sell your call options when a volatile stock is on a major run? 

I’m asking for a retard friend who saw his in the money AMC calls fucking ballon on today’s opening run up then fall to shit and expire worthless. 

(Some context) purchased 1 day calls options expiring on 5/28: 10 26$ calls 10 27$ calls 10 28$.
Note this was the retard’s first option trade so he was going bananas seeing all the fucking 🤑 tendies. The retard was bullish and let the stock run. At the height of AMC’s run at opening he was up over 500% until it got smack down. Instead of rolling the calls and taking a profit he was hopeful and waiting for the stock to bounce back up. After AMC dropped to 31 then to 26 he said fuck it let it run till then end hoping for one last minute run. 

What are your options risk and strategies to keep your P&L from going tits up?

Update: Being obsessive and calculating unrealized gains at the time. 

Total cost for all 30C = $3,869.92
Max value of contracts with AMC @ 36.72  was 24,248.

Fuck me how much of a retard was I for not selling? I mean my friend."

2021-05-28 21:22:17,wallstreetbets,CNBC Jim Cramer says in his book if you're up 20% it's time to sell. Hmmmm.
2021-05-29 01:31:01,wallstreetbets,"I lost my ass on GME calls doing that very same thing.  Watching the chart at work, puckered so tight you couldn't drive a nail up my ass with a sledgehammer.  It was an emotional amount of money gone.  I quit doing options for a minute after that.  Been much more successful lately.  Buy closer to the money, and further out, sell when you're comfortable with the profit because you can always go back in.  And if it's far enough out and you don't think it'll get there, you can still sell an OTM contract in some cases rather than let it expire worthless and cut your losses.  


My basic strategy has become buying a year or more out, close to the money, and if it hits a few dollars above the strike, or even in some instances a dollar above break-even, just selling it and moving on.  It's not huge wins, but it keeps my asshole from looking like I suit-cased a Sourpatch."

I got semi burned today with AMC And here’s why. If you do some technical analysis, aka basically draw some bollinger bands, that would have shown you that the $36~ price target at market open was right in line with the next resistance point that started forming between $14.30 and $18.60. Just keep drawing these two lines up parallel with each other and you basically have your future price channels. 

Don’t listen to the retards here that don’t believe in technical analysis. Some guy on here called the $TSLA correction back in February 2 and he got ridiculed in the comments."

2021-05-29 09:47:08,wallstreetbets,"I learned a long time ago trades aren't all or nothing. If you set out with a $1000 profit target and you log into $2000 profit, sell half if your feeling risk or sell all but that excess $1000 and play with house money. Scaling into high conviction investments and scaling out of top heavy stuff that's running is a great way to learn patience.

2021-05-29 10:00:42,wallstreetbets,So fucking true. As a noob to options I did t even think of selling some contracts. Had a stock mentality of diamond handing them till the end forgetting they expire worthless.
2021-05-29 11:05:11,wallstreetbets,Oh shit you got them fucking cheap! Need to wait for IV to dip again to buy cheap calls
2021-05-29 12:45:49,wallstreetbets,Yea man. First option trade no solid exit plan. They were printing at opening and ended up worthless
2021-05-29 12:47:36,wallstreetbets,My boy had a chance to take his money yesterday and is swinging to June 18th hoping it looks so bad after yesterday I would wait dor a dip and then do it all over or just day trade at the money Tuesday it’s all good at least I made money that’s what counts
2021-05-29 15:24:46,wallstreetbets,Yea being retarded and diamond handing after the initial run.
2021-05-29 19:50:20,wallstreetbets,Will do!
2021-05-28 20:01:35,wallstreetbets,"Lol you are correct sir 

“TOP DEFINITION

2021-05-29 08:20:08,wallstreetbets,At least I’m not the only retard who didn’t take profits. Big diamond balls abound!
2021-05-29 10:51:36,wallstreetbets,No they were bought the day before on 5/27  when IV was still low. Wasn’t listening to anyone just was betting AMC was going to shoot up on 5/28 which it did. Just didn’t sell. If I had sold I would have taken well over 200% in gains.
2021-05-29 13:36:12,wallstreetbets,I got put swings for next week lol
2021-05-29 01:45:53,wallstreetbets,That is how casinos work afterall
2021-05-28 21:09:00,wallstreetbets,Good you have learned
2021-05-28 22:04:53,wallstreetbets,"Nothing wrong with chasing gains, just dont do it on your LAST DAY before expiration if youre already green. Or at least paperhand that shit at the first sign of trouble if youre gonna ride the day out a bit.

To be fair, She was on one hell of a run and its hard for anyone to leave the blackjack table when the cards be droppin hot."
2021-05-28 23:36:10,wallstreetbets,Bought 2023 near ITM leap. Godspeed
2021-05-28 20:43:04,wallstreetbets,Got more NOKIA it's still listed as high% buy on alot of the trading platforms
2021-05-29 14:23:09,wallstreetbets,"Had some extra cash in my account. See bought an amc call Tuesday before close, sold it Wednesday. Granted I could’ve held and sold Thursday for much more but when you’re up over 100% on something like that you just take profit and run"
2021-05-29 03:08:45,wallstreetbets,Get out of here
2021-05-29 03:09:58,wallstreetbets,I got puts today on. Bynd any thoughts?
2021-05-28 22:15:16,wallstreetbets,Options can only be traded during market hours.
2021-05-29 13:16:13,wallstreetbets,It’s the only way that works for me
2021-05-29 13:34:34,wallstreetbets,"I had to check, but on average between 40-100$.  Stocks with lower volatility seem to be a *lot* cheaper.  And I'm not buying a lot of options either.  At most maybe 3-4 contracts.  And I try to stick with stocks I already have shares in because I know more about those companies and I have a better feel for whether they'll hit the mark or not.  But hell, I'm no expert.  I just started back in Feb, and much of the time I've spent investing has been learning, the hard way, how options work and how to fight FUD and FOMO.  And compared to where I was and where I am, I'm a lot better off now.  I mostly lurk here reading the losses and treating it like people sharing at an NA meeting to help me not make those same mistakes...or to not make those mistakes again."
2021-05-28 21:20:08,wallstreetbets,brah...double order!
2021-05-29 08:42:56,wallstreetbets,Congratulations you fucking retard! That was a beautiful trade execution!
2021-05-28 21:07:58,wallstreetbets,"That wasn’t an AMC specific comment. Typically, options that expire in a day or less than a week I would only be buying to scalp. Most scalpers use TA, which doesn’t apply well to meme stocks."
2021-05-28 22:20:29,wallstreetbets,To sell means to lock in loss or profit. So never sell for a loss. You should never be invested in a company that doesn’t have sustainability. Therefore never lock in a loss. It will always  come back to a gain.
2021-05-29 05:49:59,wallstreetbets,It's not greed.  Not always anyways.
2021-05-28 21:52:48,wallstreetbets,I don’t think he knows what he was doing either but props to him for big diamond balls
2021-05-29 16:18:24,wallstreetbets,"Yeah when I was sitting on a 600-1000% gain I took it. 
It's okay to sell early. You take those profits and wait for the next opportunity next week.  There's opportunities every week."
2021-05-29 17:44:02,wallstreetbets,"I just uploaded a screenshot of my technical analysis if you want to go through my post history. TA is pretty useful.

You can't just draw these lines anywhere, these lines are actual resistance points that will support future trend lines, until the correction of course"
2021-05-29 15:32:11,wallstreetbets,Ya dude. Rn I’m balls deep in TLRY. Bought .01 100 calls for June 11. Had to after I saw how I effed up AMC ...again.
2021-05-29 12:46:24,wallstreetbets,Printing at open means run lol
2021-05-29 15:32:42,wallstreetbets,"It's hard to time the top... Me Ape - I usually pick one of 1/2x or 2x and stick to it. And then watch how I've missed 4x, 5x"
2021-05-29 17:12:29,wallstreetbets,I did exactly what your friend did. 😂
2021-05-29 11:05:16,wallstreetbets,"Ah ok, the strike price was just too high then and you got hopeful for an even better squeeze"
2021-05-29 03:05:21,wallstreetbets,You never lose if you only hold.
2021-05-29 11:52:31,wallstreetbets,"Idk I just turn the printer on. 

-JPow"
2021-05-29 08:02:23,wallstreetbets,So fucking true. This was my first options trade. Bought the calls before the market ended on Thursday and I was in the red with them. Woke up to them printing and with my exit plan to sell at opening went out of the window as soon as AMC passed 35. Won’t make that mistake again meme stonk or not. I’ll take my tendies and buy some more calls for another week.
2021-05-29 13:13:41,wallstreetbets,"I had a single 15 dollar call option for 5/28 I kinda bought as a “I haven’t sat down at the ultimate Texas table lately so I need a gambling fix”

Waited til 240 to sell. 

Thought I’d hit Quads and ended up with trip 10s instead. 

Lame."
2021-05-28 21:55:10,wallstreetbets,I might just have to
2021-05-29 14:27:01,wallstreetbets,"Bears make money, bulls make money and pigs get slaughtered...

Yep"
2021-05-29 14:49:26,wallstreetbets,I’m up 1100% on 6-18 $40 call and I’m still holding ion give a fuk
2021-05-29 09:45:28,wallstreetbets,I bought some as well. I wouldn’t go full commitment on them yet. I think it’ll hover +130 for at least one or two more weeks
2021-05-29 08:03:05,wallstreetbets,Yea I’m retarded and read before even though he wrote after market opens lol
2021-05-29 14:02:40,wallstreetbets,Lmao I hear that. Same for me. Lurk for life and learn from others mistakes
2021-05-29 08:56:19,wallstreetbets,It was totally greed for me. I saw that shit hit 36 and make 100% profit and wanted more to the point I let it turn to shit
2021-05-29 16:41:12,wallstreetbets,Nice that’s amazing. I totally let those profits slide. In total I was managing 70 orders on two different platforms. It was a bitch to keep managing them. Did you manually close your orders or did you set a stop loss limit for them?
2021-05-29 19:51:24,wallstreetbets,Nice located them on Webull! I’ll look for your TA.
2021-05-29 15:35:41,wallstreetbets,At least you got them for cheap! Hope they fucking print for you you retard!
2021-05-29 12:47:33,wallstreetbets,Yea now that retard knows. Going to sell covered calls and make up the loss.
2021-05-29 15:34:39,wallstreetbets,Profit is better than loss so either way you win. Not knowing when the top is is a bitch but as long as your green you win. I should have sold at opening like I planned but good experience and hard lesson to learn for future trades
2021-05-29 19:47:50,wallstreetbets,You know my pain! I mean his pain!
2021-05-29 11:07:20,wallstreetbets,Exactly! Good Yolo but failed to execute the sell and take profits waiting for another run up
2021-05-28 21:16:37,wallstreetbets,Only to lose it again
2021-05-28 20:12:27,wallstreetbets,I no longer feel alone.
2021-05-28 21:02:27,wallstreetbets,"I think it depends on how many contracts you hold. I doubt market makers will give 2 shits if you have a stop loss for 1 contract. If you have 100+ contracts though, they'll probably look to grab the contracts up."
2021-05-29 16:54:09,wallstreetbets,Manually but a stop loss might have been better to capture more profit.  I try to limit my trades to 2 tickers at a time. After I sold my pltr calls I bought amc puts.
2021-05-29 17:05:08,wallstreetbets,"They don’t com more retarded, bro!🙏"
2021-05-29 12:48:13,wallstreetbets,Covered calls lol he will get got if the market runs up again Tuesday
2021-05-29 11:32:33,wallstreetbets,Yep. Sometimes it's better to buy calls around the SP. Less gain but less chance of hoping for ATHs while you watch the security drop to $0
2021-05-29 16:59:09,wallstreetbets,Nice! When exactly are these opportunities throughout the week to buy options/calls do you mean on read days with low IV?
2021-05-29 12:49:49,wallstreetbets,Unless the strike price is high and never reached. Still make a profit from the difference. Of course it it squeezes past that then it’s not as much of a profit.
2021-05-29 12:53:45,wallstreetbets,"Nope and not worth it, I would think it’s smarter not to trade till you see a setup of know a bit bit of market dynamics to me I will wait till Tuesday if it looks bullish and holds and starts to reject 27 I’m buying 30 or a little higher call options for Friday as soon as the run up 100 percent I’m out half lol then at 200 I take another 25% off and I’ll wait till Friday to run up the rest if it looks bearish I’ll wait because I’m not dumb enough to short that too volatile tell him to join a trade group or something because he will loose money thinking like the way he is, when your up you walk always this game is played 240 plus days a year you always have a chance to do it again the next week"
2021-05-29 12:56:22,wallstreetbets,Also my dumb friend had a chance to take his money Friday he is holding still for sept 21 calls but still walk when you can you can do it again the next week no biggie you maybe loose a few bucks on the upside but you lock in money in the end
2021-05-29 13:00:19,wallstreetbets,Trade group sounds dope I’ll look for one. Goal is to make money anything to help that process I’ll take it. Hopefully we can retake 27 and then 29 and 30 again. To the fucking Moon! Until then make money while I sit on shares.
2021-05-29 13:01:28,wallstreetbets,"Yea first timers mistake, not removing initial investment or walking away when green in order to take more profits."
2021-05-29 13:05:11,wallstreetbets,I follow one or two they are good but I learned options before following them and did super well on my own and I know wall st bets has a discord I follow too
2021-05-29 13:34:02,wallstreetbets,Yeah but if not holding is worse unless it’s stock stock is cool cause you can invest forever and not worry about the expiration date and sell calls when the market will and does turn
2021-05-29 13:03:34,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I used to do that cause my dads and old school investor buy the dip and wait forever lol but my goal is money all the time fuck holding forever, I rather be sure I got money in the pocket and buy again later, the only contract I normally feel super comfortable dropping money in is the SPY I got 4000 bucks on it for June 18 425 calls and all the signs look good like we about to rally again lol"
2021-05-29 13:17:46,wallstreetbets,Can you point me to any recommend treads? I’ll do a quick search for the groups.
2021-05-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"All ya'll who are positive should sell AMC Unpopular opinion, but I can have those. So if you don't agree or want to cry to the mods to bring me the banhammer, go F*** a horse.

What did everyone see three months ago with the initial squeeze? A lucky few who got positive and exited, and hundreds and HUNDREDS of retards who bought the peak, or near or, or ON THE WAY DOWN, , and were down thousands/tens of thousands of dollars because they got caught up in the craze. AMC reached the peak of this little run yesterday. Sell now and lock in your money so you actually GAIN something instead of HOPING you will gain something.

Chasing more profits is going to leave ya'll fricked. Risking for the biscuit is only cool when the consequences don't ruin your life. Be smart, take what you can, and reinvest."

2021-05-28 23:59:23,wallstreetbets,"Regardless of the negative people with agendas and generic haters on here this is a huge movement. There is tons of support beyond this forum involving millions of people. Some people scalped the stock today before the 3 day weekend, so what. Honestly the same exact thing happened to GME before it exploded the following week (also a 3 day weekend). Short interest only increased. If anything this will only make the bear trap more dangerous.. The real party hasn't even started yet. You didn't see a massive sell-off AH. This thing is still live and hot. A lot of cynical people on here who act know better are going to look like fools once again (just like they did with GME). 

I could of sold for a profit today but didn't and will be loading up some more at the very beginning of next week. Bet you a lot of people who sold today are also coming back next week to push. This is just the beginning. It took a lot of dedicated people to get this far and you can bet your ass they will see this through if they haven't sold by now. Billions are at stake and those on the other side of this will try to discourage through all forms of manipulation over this long weekend. Chin up and stay the course. You are on the right side of history.

2021-05-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Homebuyer Demographics Shift towards single and male. How to bet? TLDR:

I have leading indicators telling me that there are two concurrent shifts underway when it comes to who is purchasing homes.

\- Massive increase in unmarried people buying houses alone. This used to be somewhat unusual, now it's becoming very common.

\- Massive increase in unmarried men, in particular, buying houses alone. Traditionally, the female-to-male ratio of unmarried homebuyers was about 5 to 1. For the last 3 months, it's been closer to 50/50.

Source is my own closed real estate purchase transactions. Am a mortgage broker (btw this means cash purchases are ""invisible"" to me). It takes 3-6 months for [HMDA data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act) to become accessible to journalists and academics, and thus ""visible"" to the general public (assuming journalists deem it worthy of commenting on), but I can see the trends live in real time.

How would one go about placing a bet that in about 3 or 6 months, the media, journalists, academics, etc, will pick up on this, publish articles, and potentially cause a lot of people to buy certain stocks. Which stocks would that be? Is there a ""Mancave, Inc"" out there that would potentially get an uptick? Or maybe a company making smart-home stuff that is particularly suited to renting by the room (the single men are not buying 1 bedroom condos, they are buying proper houses with 3 bedrooms, etc)?

EDIT: oh, and to be clear. It's not just an uptick in single men. It's an uptick in women too, but a massive surge from the men. It used to be that for 15 banana sales, 10 are to married couples, 4 to single women, and 1 to a single man. Now for the same 15 banana sales, it's 6 to married couples, 6 to single women, and 3 to single men, something like that."

2021-05-29 06:28:07,wallstreetbets,This goes both ways. Trust me. If you have a home before a marriage get a pre-nup to protect it. Do NOT put spouse on title if it your separate asset. You will lose your separate equity acquired before marriage. Men can be just as awful when it comes to divorce and what they feel they are entitled to. Marriage is also a business transaction and most people don’t see it that way until it’s too late.

I’m sure the government will just bail them out again and pretend like it didnt cost us anything.

2021-05-29 04:16:58,wallstreetbets,Wtf is a condom?
2021-05-29 00:36:26,wallstreetbets,"Shit me too, what are the odds."
2021-05-29 02:47:56,wallstreetbets,"Did everything myself except for the quartz counters and the roof. I’ve wanted to hire out for more because I’m so swamped with work but quality labor is so expensive, especially since COVID started. Currently doing the windows and then exterior paint and the house will be fully finished. Only thing original on/in this house is the structure and the fireplace, everything else has been torn out and replaced."
2021-05-29 09:08:16,wallstreetbets,"Yeah we’ve outgrown the house with 2 kids and 2 dogs now. Problem is, what we want in a decent school district is over a million now so even with 300k equity from the current house, we’d be stretched super thin. We’re staying for now and considering moving to a cheaper state."
2021-05-29 03:09:32,wallstreetbets,"Women have higher credit scores, and less consumer debt, than men. By a lot."
2021-05-29 08:43:11,wallstreetbets,"It will go on until legislation fixes it. Artificial scarcity of housing due to predatory banks and monopolies. If the value tax Warren wanted ever passed, it’s game over. I’m actually all for it tho. It would be better if hedge funds, holding llcs, and rich assholes couldn’t own more than 3 properties. Because fundamentally, how can you “own” land that you only visit in the summer once a year?"
2021-05-29 02:01:44,wallstreetbets,"It's only insider information if it hasn't been made public, and seeing how we, members of the public, are currently talking about it, seems fine to me."
2021-05-29 12:56:11,wallstreetbets,"First, just because the info has not been aggregated into an easily digestible format for journalists does not mean the info is no public. Second, to which entity is the author of this an insider? The general housing market? Nope, that’s not how the rules work. Finally, for which company is this purportedly nonpublic information material? Lots of companies being discussed on this thread, but no evidence that this info is material (aka market-moving) for any individual company (to which the author would need to be an insider for this to constitute insider trading). I know more than you about this. Go fuck yourself."
2021-05-29 06:42:40,wallstreetbets,The things my wife’s boyfriend doesn’t use
2021-05-29 02:49:39,wallstreetbets,"Damn, that’s awesome. I’ve started attending a makerspace to learn how to do some of this stuff, but feel like it’s too late to really get the ability to do full scale work like that ( 33 years old)"
2021-05-29 08:48:14,wallstreetbets,"You might even resell ur property for a really high price, and with doing all the work yourself, you've saved a ton of money"
2021-05-29 13:57:04,wallstreetbets,"I work in construction and I can confirm.  Quality labor and skilled labor is expensive. I'm getting tired of folks thinking that they'll fix their whole house under 5,000 dollars."
2021-05-29 13:52:14,wallstreetbets,"I have a lot of friends in this situation. If your considering mixing to another state, sell now when it's high, right? Even if you have to rent for a few. Max price for your current place, and lowest interest rate on the next one. We just bought our first place a year ago at 3.5, refied 6mos later for 2.7. We're in the same boat, tbh, can't decide, haha"
2021-05-29 03:07:01,wallstreetbets,"I grew up around tools and cars so I sort of have a knack for building/fixing shit. Lots of house stuff isn’t rocket science, it’s just knowing how to properly do it. I never installed windows until this last week but I watched a bunch of YouTube videos on different techniques and tip, and read through the manufacturer’s manual, then tackled them myself. YouTube helps a lot because it gives you ideas on what might work for you. You just need to learn how to sift through the bullshit as well because there are plenty of videos of guys doing shit complete wrong too. I always double check the manufacturer’s installation instructions."
2021-05-29 12:55:47,wallstreetbets,"Hackerspaces and Makerspaces and Community Workshops are based AF. 

Support them however you can, and you’ll casually pick up both un-YouTube-able knowledge and just wild creative energy. I found one when I was 30 and never looked back."
2021-05-29 09:04:28,wallstreetbets,"Yeah conservatively I’ve saved about 100k by doing it myself. Realistically, a good contractor that didn’t cut corner would’ve cost quite a bit more for a full remodel like this."
2021-05-29 03:08:48,wallstreetbets,"That’s awesome - I was lucky enough to grow up around my genius tech parents, so I got some cool skills by osmosis, but left my childhood with zero practical skills.

I have been learning more and realize that a lot of it is pretty much taking the time to do it right, but struggle with knowing what is a quality source of info and what isn’t - that’s why I’m very excited about this makerspace, it’s filled with wood workers and people who make things who all seem super willing to teach. Covid froze my plans to get some awesome life skills from there."
2021-05-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,I am the worst option trader in the history of option trading 
2021-05-28 21:44:57,wallstreetbets,"I don't know....

I had some $24 pltr calls that didn't expire till next Friday.
I bought them weeks ago, literally because they were a cheap bet that had some potential to pay off.

I sold them on Tuesday of watching them get more and more worthless even as the price ticked up, and I sold them at a slight loss.

I sold them at $13/contract.

Earlier today, those same contracts were going for $125 each.

I accepted a loss when I could have had a massive gain."
2021-05-28 22:56:52,wallstreetbets,if you still have money in your account you are factually not the worst options trader.
2021-05-29 17:50:56,wallstreetbets,"Move some cash you can lose to an account, like Think or Swim, Robinhood, whatever.  Wait patiently.  Buy only when you feel fear that the market is crashing.  Later, when you feel elated and happy that you’re doing so well, sell before it’s too late.  Buy on the fear.  Sell on the greed.  This is the way."
2021-05-28 21:17:46,wallstreetbets,I'm down 65 of my 66K. You're not the worst
2021-05-28 23:25:22,wallstreetbets,"Me too bro. Me too.

I bought an option for 250. Instantly it was 200. Instantly. Then I waited and it was 260, and instead of thanking God and selling I held. The it dumped to 99 and I panicked and sold. Then the next morning it spiked. FML. I'm quitting options for a while. Maybe I'll paper trade again."
2021-05-29 13:35:36,wallstreetbets,"In last 12 months, In paper trading I turned $1M into $20.5B, yet I lost $130K in real money ☹️"
2021-05-28 22:43:35,wallstreetbets,Rice paper hands.
2021-05-28 22:47:03,wallstreetbets,"I would like to tell you you are, but honestly most people who play options lose money. I've lost a ton myself, but I had one really good play thats keeping me above water."
2021-05-28 23:27:27,wallstreetbets,Switch to puts and use same strat
2021-05-28 23:45:52,wallstreetbets,Really sucks about the loss... I absolutely love the visual form - is this an app or did you put it together yourself? I would love a report like this!
2021-05-29 05:34:00,wallstreetbets,Next time you buy some options let me know so I can do the complete opposite of you. Thanks I’m advance.
2021-05-29 10:45:57,wallstreetbets,Just buy a leap n let that bitch ride

2021-05-29 13:19:34,wallstreetbets,I felt this post was challenging me.. no way anyone can be worse than me
2021-05-29 13:32:49,wallstreetbets,Also wall street has extremely fast internet.. So they can see whats happing and jump in front of all the cell phone buys or sells.. Atleast thats my theory..
2021-05-29 13:53:32,wallstreetbets,Now I know that's not true. I AM the worst options trader in the history of options trading. I ain't trading any more options until I have enough shares of GameStop to sell covered calls.
2021-05-29 15:16:03,wallstreetbets,NOK any one?

2021-05-28 21:40:47,wallstreetbets,"What was your catalyst for buying on 05/03 ?

2021-05-28 22:31:59,wallstreetbets,ACB is better
2021-05-28 22:37:58,wallstreetbets,That's because you're choosing a direction.
2021-05-28 22:55:36,wallstreetbets,The ticket is ‘AMC’ not ‘AMD’.   You’re just off by one letter. Fix that and you’re ‘to the moon!’
2021-05-28 23:27:06,wallstreetbets,It’s AMC....Not AMD.  And only calls please.

2021-05-29 00:52:42,wallstreetbets,Ah damn. It’s not you. You chose a stock that they kept slamming the price down.  I did the same thing. I’m retarded too

2021-05-29 01:39:07,wallstreetbets,In Germany we Call it “Dirk Mueller- Approach”. The core is to buy high und sell low or at least to avoid making profits. Superb execution!

2021-05-29 11:02:30,wallstreetbets,Pro trader here. Money on options are made on the decay.  Always be short one near dated option against a longer dated one.  No home runs but take dollar profits and limit losses to the same.
2021-05-29 11:05:00,wallstreetbets,Damn dog🙆
2021-05-29 11:06:44,wallstreetbets,Not entirely true. The worst option traders are convinced they are very good.

2021-05-29 11:40:00,wallstreetbets,Well o think i am in a close second place
2021-05-29 12:04:18,wallstreetbets,I don’t even know how to sign up for options trading so you’re one up on me 😂

2021-05-28 23:27:17,wallstreetbets,AMD was a long hold. In 2017 when hype around the new CPUs was building was the time to buy. I'm up over 450%. Glad I went with my gut on Ryzen and Dr. Su

2021-05-29 13:43:08,wallstreetbets,DOOM
2021-05-29 13:52:06,wallstreetbets,"Nope.

Not true at all.

You guys just don't know what the fuck you're doing.

You need to use technical analysis to time your option sales and purchases or you'll get screwed."
2021-05-29 14:18:14,wallstreetbets,Nope nope nope.  I think I got that title.  Lol
2021-05-29 14:35:48,wallstreetbets,U shouldn’t be trading if u think amd is impossible. It has a consistent pattern
2021-05-29 14:50:06,wallstreetbets,My first option ever was AMD and it scared me to never try again lol

2021-05-28 21:01:45,wallstreetbets,You should buy LEAPs instead....takes a lot of stress out of options. Unless you don’t have the capital then YOLO away
2021-05-29 05:51:01,wallstreetbets,"That’s what u get for buying short dated options u dumb fuck, unrealistic returns with unrealistic expectations ends with nothing"
2021-05-29 00:15:54,wallstreetbets,i had that happen to me a few times. i couldnt even believe it. sold right before it came back up.
2021-05-29 11:20:00,wallstreetbets,"I have not one but stories on if I had held till next day I would have been up big. Like Mike Tyson said, “Everyone has a plan until they get hit.” Many thougts and pat experiences creep into your thinking. Well imma thinking about next week to have a go at it again."
2021-05-29 12:56:05,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the money bro
2021-05-28 23:51:28,wallstreetbets,I feel much less alone being here with people like you

2021-05-29 00:21:51,wallstreetbets,Happens to me al the time. I went shares the other day while I recoup losses and try to learn more in the meantime.

2021-05-29 02:39:37,wallstreetbets,"I like what this guy said.  This is how you make money on AMD

1.) buy some Nov 100's 
2.) masturbate yourself raw for a few months
3.) Profit

Or

1.) Buy 100 shares
2.) Write a call to morons every week until you can buy another 100 shares"
2021-05-29 00:18:06,wallstreetbets,"> Or you finally claw back to breakeven and bail, only to realize that was the move you were waiting for and you just took yourself out for no reason other than you were mentally exhausted by the trade. 

this exactly thing happened to me on qqq and amzn. i saw it reach break even like 3 times and on the fourth i'm like ok, it's time to get out. 1 month later it was up 10%. it spent almost the entire time i invested in it at -10%. how annoying was that?"
2021-05-28 22:12:06,wallstreetbets,that's when the market will change direction 😂
2021-05-28 20:12:34,wallstreetbets,I'm so poor and stupid I can drive fast in an oval and turning left sumtimes!

2021-05-28 23:28:38,wallstreetbets,stick to plan. I was supposed to hold until June 4th initially
2021-05-29 17:43:35,wallstreetbets,Now? It always has been
2021-05-28 23:01:44,wallstreetbets,Gotta be high to be buying at those prices
2021-05-28 21:49:38,wallstreetbets,I somehow ended up 63 bucks this week but left 17 thousand on the table by selling low
2021-05-29 04:00:30,wallstreetbets,"I held some +200% 95c back in jan until they turned into -90%. I just plum forgot to close them, turned +60k into -25k. Too distracted by gme shenanigans. You know you're fucked up when you see 60k profit and you're like ""heh. kid money"""
2021-05-29 00:15:43,wallstreetbets,And is still a long hold... not was. Intel will never catch up to amd. And amd is cheaper.
2021-05-29 01:47:10,wallstreetbets,"Agreed on the first part, not that I disagree with the second, just...went in a little earlier and finally closed my position fully just before (what ended up be one of the more minor drops) the pandemic was in full swing up just under 2400%.  I'm stilll big AMD as a custom builder plannning a new Threadripper based workstation later this month, but they haven't really had a place in my portfolio for a while now."
2021-05-29 00:13:21,wallstreetbets,"amd is a long hold. it looked like it has support around 75 to me so i rushed and bought at 77 afraid it would go up. it went down to 74 and now back up to 80. i learned my lesson with oil. if i can spot the bottom, diamond hands that shit. i bought cvx at 80 and sold at 70 because analysts saying oil is over then like 3 months later it went up to 110. this time if i don't have anywhere else to put my money, i'm holding the ones i know are bottoms until it goes all the way up. there is no way amd wont go higher if we just wait."
2021-05-29 12:47:48,wallstreetbets,"You had 500k, lots of us don't. If you gamble your money with options, for sure will fail."
2021-05-29 00:16:39,wallstreetbets,lol we all got a plan until we feel it in our stomachs. luckily i followed it this time and bounce through the correction. almost sold too.
2021-05-29 00:18:50,wallstreetbets,I bought almost leaps on riot I lost 10k. Bought like weeks ago. They expired 1/22. Yes Elon and China just happened to knock corn down right after I went in

2021-05-28 23:45:26,wallstreetbets,"‘Oh shit they’re expiring worthless, time to bail’ isn’t a plan. Before you get in. Before."
2021-05-28 23:19:26,wallstreetbets,"Stick to the plan.

I am going thro the same thing with LOGI options

I had june 18 125s since february. They were down 75%. Traded then in for May 125s cuz i wanted to play earnings more efficiently. 

Logi stays under 120 just long enuf for my options to expire worthless in May. They are at 123 now and those options would only be down 60% with 18 days to go

I swear im going to kill someone if logi gets to 132 before jun 18"
2021-05-29 00:20:48,wallstreetbets,And a percentage of that will still make 6-7 figures based on luck
2021-05-29 03:20:04,wallstreetbets,Im now inversing myself when i want to sell. Thinking goes - if these guys know where max pain is that’s exactly where id want to sell to stop the pain. So i should buy. It actually helped. I think the idea is to sell quick when its down 10%-15%. But not when down 50%. Anyway thats your stock astrology for this month lol
2021-05-29 00:14:22,wallstreetbets,"the only way i see options working is buying very strong companies and buying 6months -1 year out. for example, you can do it with nvidia when it drops and it'll bounce back for sure. i've made most of my money so far on nvda but i didn't have the guts to play it big so i only made a little."
2021-05-28 20:34:52,wallstreetbets,"It's worked for me, personally"
2021-05-29 05:20:44,wallstreetbets,Thats fuckin gay as hell! Obama pisses me off!

2021-05-29 07:12:26,wallstreetbets,i'm at -3k in stocks and droping.

2021-05-29 10:58:43,wallstreetbets,did you sell your gme calls right before the big run this week too cause i lost out 12k on that lol luckily still an okay week up 7k..could have b een a way better week though :/
2021-05-29 10:02:18,wallstreetbets,"Yup, what were we one on."
2021-05-29 00:28:14,wallstreetbets,"Oh for sure. What I meant was the growth was a lot more exponential if you got in back then. It's still going to go up (even though it's off slightly from start of this year) but it's not rocketing like it did after the Ryzen 3000 series. I'm interested to see what Intel has, they're promising 20% IPC improvement. Competition is good, it keeps both companies from getting lazy. The last thing we need is AMD becoming Intel circa 2015-17, giving us nothing new and charging more. Zen 3 was still an improvement, but they also bumped the price by $50 over last gen."
2021-05-29 00:17:27,wallstreetbets,AMD floors a little bit higher after every new launch. It took four years to get from $10-$15 to $75-$80. New chips coming soon too.
2021-05-29 12:49:06,wallstreetbets,I know I did that and my family’s gonna kill me when they find out.. hey hopefully I’ll get some money back from taxes!!!
2021-05-29 17:35:16,wallstreetbets,"That happened to me when Elon went on SNL.  I was getting ready to sell my options for a bit of a profit and got distracted and next thing I know I'm taking a fucking bloodbath on them and Elon just wouldn't stop tweeting and crashing the stock.  I learned a good lesson that day, if an options starts turning to shit like that just sell and take the small loss versus the big loss if you try to ride it out."
2021-05-29 12:02:59,wallstreetbets,"How did they expire 1-22???
When it's 5-29-21 right now u lost me cause I have CVS,PLTR,HPQ& NIO
JAN 22 leaps & there still there trading away up big on CVS BOUGHT 85S AROUND 2 MONTHS ago when it was 70ish 
What am I missing here 
🦧🦍 help a Ape out will ya!!!
I did make bonehead move of the century this week put 1k in short term amc puts when it was around $20 --if I bought 1k of the calls expiring yest my 1k would be worth 20-30k depending where I got out!!!! Another typical move!!! Was a 4mg Xanax night last night!!
Good luck fellow apes stay strong!!!!"
2021-05-28 23:49:17,wallstreetbets,"I've been making consistent profit with it. Just been selling put options at conservative prices for stocks I want to buy and that I think are undervalued. Once you get assigned, it's okay, just wait for the price to go up, and then sell. Or just sell call options every week if you don't want to hold long term. Once you have more money, sell puts again

with amc now, it's super easy. look out a month or so ahead, and sell puts for $9, $10, $11 or so. The prices are so high for such a cheap stock, you can make some big returns. it's almost better if you can get assigned at such low levels too. Just ride the bull train back up once the hype is back"

Also, I will put you on the path to recovering your losses of the 500k.  As you mentioned, you lost a large sum of money with aggressive bullish call options on tech heavy stocks, FANG stocks.  To turn things around, and put yourself on the road to recovering your 500,000 k losses you must implement specific options trading rules that must be adhered to.  You must better select the right sector at the right time and at the right price.  The right combination of both stock investing and options trading combined with the proper risk management strategies will put you back on track.  With 50k you can make all of your money back but you have to change your perspective and approach."

2021-05-29 16:34:50,wallstreetbets,I edited my strategy. Now I make money off riot puts. Lol. And I buy corn and friends on sale/dip and hold. And bought some riot shares and Coinbase shares.

2021-05-29 14:18:47,wallstreetbets,One day I was down so much I decided I better lose my money on something good at least and bought a 30 K golf simulator It was just installed barely used it yet
2021-05-29 15:13:22,wallstreetbets,Yes. You are an emotional trader. Let a fiscal planner help. As after you've established rules and risk tolerance (many moons from now) slowly edge back in

2021-05-29 12:45:10,wallstreetbets,I think the problem is I just buy and hold them until they expire and most of them end up out of the money even if I buy them in the money how the fuck am I gonna come back from the loss of 450 K
2021-05-29 14:08:28,wallstreetbets,No joke I caught her being a seven-year-old dude and she was only 35  and actually were divorced now LOL

2021-05-29 12:49:15,wallstreetbets,"You need an exit strategy. Set a risk tolerance. Obviously this is Monday morning QB shit but seriously.

Decide when you will get out. Whether it’s when you option goes down 20%, or once it hits like 50% profit whatever. Make a plan and stick to it

If you really think it will go up, stop and think. How much is on the line. 

Are you emotional, do U think it’s going to go up because you want it to? Because that’s a trap a lot of traders fall into. Many can’t separate personal feelings from calculating probability. 

Anyways that’s what I would do. Don’t focus on the 450k loss. Think of it as a learning experience I suppose. 

Be forward thinking, but please learn from past mistakes lol."

If that were to occur, with its over 490 million shares outstanding, AMC's market capitalization would be about $245 trillion.

It simply ran into the drywall and left like a 6 inch gap between it and the exterior vent.  Laziest and most careless thing I've ever seen.

So I opened the drywall.  There was lint in there, all stacked up looking like blown in insulation.

2021-05-28 22:55:04,wallstreetbets,"I've been down a bit of a rabbit hole, and I'm gonna post the most conspiratorial shit I have had banging around in my brain in a while.

-Saw a certain Friday DD.  If you know, know.  Didn't like what it said.

-OIP showed us a few weeks ago what the bots over on subreddit simulator act like.  Eerily similar to here.  You ever get in conversations where you're not really certain the person you're talking to is even directly responding to what you wrote?  Not even just bad logic or differences in opinion..  Like, the words just don't make sense as a response.  

-I went back a few months to read how we were all talking about GME and our potential to move markets, when it was clear that GME was going to blast the fuck off but BEFORE the squeeze.  We were still in the 40-60 range.  We got a visit from an actual hedge fund manager at that point in time, telling us we were headed in the right direction.

How many of the apes around here are just bots?  We never really moved on from ""the two stocks.""  I know lots of people here made money this week, but...

1) how much of the diamond hands sentiment is just to ensure retail plays its useful idiot role for HF's to make money on low liquidity stocks, and to ensure they can liquidate into the strength of frenzied buyers.  I.e. the big boys realize gains at the top while retail buys the top and holds it all the way down 

2) the thing we were so giddy about, the strength of retail, is never going to happen if retail at large is fixated on two stocks that aren't very important, keep all their liquidity locked up, and drown out other potential plays.

Anyway,

Alexa play Ignition (remix)"
2021-05-28 22:57:01,wallstreetbets,Let me let you in on a little secret. You want to know why people are say “AMC 100k” or “GME 1 million.” It’s because gullible financial illiterate investors will believe sky high price targets and not sell even when they have life changing profits. The traders are making bank and leaving newbies holding the bag. All these complicated intricate theories are speculation at best. They sell you on something you don’t understand and convince you to buy at the top of a parabolic rally. They will keep saying “that wasn’t the squeeze” when there wasn’t and won’t be a squeeze. These stocks will fall twice as fast as they climbed and before you know it you’ll be asking what happened. Be rational and remember it’s ONLY about making money. Don’t let others make you a martyr.

>Norton initially made a living as a businessman, but he lost his fortune investing in Peruvian rice to sell in China due to a Chinese rice shortage. He bought rice at 12 cents per pound from Peruvian ships, but more Peruvian ships arrived in port which caused the price to drop sharply to 4 cents. He then lost a lawsuit in which he tried to void his rice contract, and his public prominence faded."

2021-05-29 16:36:31,wallstreetbets,"I hate the GME/AMC short squeeze crowd.

Not because they're new, or because they spam the daily threads with unoriginal bullshit all week long, but because they're supporting the antithesis of wall WSB means to me.

You see, classic wallstreetbets was a place for autistic burger flippers and office workers to engage in extremely speculative high-leverage stock gambles. It was a place where regular internet trolls could come to engage in hard-core ruthless capitalism for the chance of making tendies. Regular people could cosplay as a coked up 80s stock broker.

Part of the beauty of the community was the ruthlessness of it all, and the solidarity behind that ruthlessness. We were all well aware that we were communicating with other autists who were also trading super leveraged options positions, sometimes on the other side of the same stock. The bears teased the bulls on red days, and the bulls called the bears gay every other day. We all knew what was on the table, and everyone was competing against each other.

Then these GME kids flooded the sub. They don't want to take highly leveraged positions on random companies. They just want to hold shares. They don't want to take a gamble in the market, they want to take a strategic position on a specific company to guarantee a short squeeze for profit.

Now putting aside all of that boomer shit, the real major offense is the desire to work as a collective. These guys just want to have a common enemy in ""the hedge fundsl"".

The beauty of the WSB community was that we don't make enemies or work together or work against each other. IDGAF if anyone else's MU calls print, as long as mine do. And if your MU puts print, I can celebrate your gains while you celebrate my losses. The tendies aren't in the profits you take, they're in the risk you take.

Wu Tang Forever. Short $SQ till the day I die.

Also someone remind me tomorrow morning to never drink vodka again."

2021-05-29 14:37:37,wallstreetbets,"Here is a game I like to play over the weekend. It's simple and everyone can play.

1. While sober, roam the internet and make a list of things you would love to purchase but *could* potentially get you in trouble with the wife. Look for items that you *could* undoubtedly justify to your friends that you have known the longest after a 15 minute debate. Pro-Tip: it helps if your friends live within a 25 minute radius in case shit hits the fan.
2. When you have narrowed it down to 5, leave the websites up on your browser but minimize it to the bottom of your screen and go about your day as well as early evening as you normally would. 
3. Now....its game-time. When you arrive at the portion of the evening that you are on that drink that you know is taking you to the land of the lost......open that browser and purchase your favorite item you saved from earlier in the day. Keep the purchase confirmation up on the browser and minimize it to the bottom of your desktop.
4. Pour Yourself that next drink and enjoy the rest of the evening.
5. The next morning open up your laptop and enjoy!

Currently on my list....... a $3500 tipi made in Montana that fits 6 people"

2021-05-29 12:24:12,wallstreetbets,">Schrodinger's Cat was simply a teaching tool that Schrodinger used to illustrate how some people were misinterpreting quantum theory. Schrodinger constructed his imaginary experiment with the cat to demonstrate that simple misinterpretations of quantum theory can lead to absurd results which do not match the real world.

>In quantum theory, quantum particles can exist in a superposition of states at the same time and collapse down to a single state upon interaction with other particles. Some scientists at the time that quantum theory was being developed (1930's) drifted from science into the realm of philosophy, and stated that quantum particles only collapse to a single state when viewed by a conscious observer. Schrodinger found this concept absurd and devised his thought experiment to make plain the absurd yet logical outcome of such claims."
2021-05-29 12:25:58,wallstreetbets,"It's an allegory of sorts.  The cat isn't in a state of being alive and dead at the same time.  The cat is either alive or dead, and without observing the state of the cat, one could use heavy math to describe the state of the cat in terms of probabilities - a superposition of states.  That is the whole 'quantum physics thing'.

However, all that shit goes out the window the moment someone observes the cat, because either the cat is very alive or very dead.  This is the whole 'classical physics thing'.

There is a point at which quantum physics becomes irrelevant because classical phyics (observing the state of something) gives one all the info they need to know, and Schroedinger's Cat just raises the question, ""where is the precise point at which we should disregard quantum physics in favor of the more mundane stuff?""

The answer to that is when you observe it

Edit: there's more though, the act of observing the cat can kill the cat and that's an extra layer of the breakdown between quantum and vanilla physics but it's the same idea, the moment you observe the cat is when you shift towards vanilla physics

Double edit: by not observing the cat you are forcing yourself to rely on describing the state of the cat in the quantum sense and by observing the cat you change the outcome but can describe the cat in the vanilla sense and that's the paradox, how do you truly know about the condition of the cat before you observe it, without observing it because by observing it you can change the outcome and that is where the paradox comes from... And right in the middle of all of that is the breakdown between quantum and vanilla, and highlights the frivolity of attempting to know anything that can not be observed, or attempting to be ignorant of things that cannot be observed.  The paradox is a real shit show if you try to wrap your brain around it because it pretty much makes you face the fact that despite attempting to know the condition of the cat, it's impossible"

**I hate the GME/AMC short squeeze crowd.**

Not because they're new, or because they spam the daily threads with unoriginal bullshit all week long, but because they're supporting the antithesis of wall WSB means to me.

You see, classic wallstreetbets was a place for autistic burger flippers and office workers to engage in extremely speculative high-leverage stock gambles. It was a place where regular internet trolls could come to engage in hard-core ruthless capitalism for the chance of making tendies. Regular people could cosplay as a coked up 80s stock broker.

Part of the beauty of the community was the ruthlessness of it all, and the solidarity behind that ruthlessness. We were all well aware that we were communicating with other autists who were also trading super leveraged options positions, sometimes on the other side of the same stock. The bears teased the bulls on red days, and the bulls called the bears gay every other day. We all knew what was on the table, and everyone was competing against each other. 

Then these GME kids flooded the sub. They don't want to take highly leveraged positions on random companies. They just want to hold shares. They don't want to take a gamble in the market, they want to take a strategic position on a specific company to guarantee a short squeeze for profit. 

Now putting aside all of that boomer shit, the real major offense is the desire to work as a collective. These guys just want to have a common enemy in ""the hedgies"". 

The beauty of the WSB community was that we don't make enemies or work together or work against each other. IDGAF if anyone else's MU calls print, as long as mine do. And if your MU puts print, I can celebrate your gains while you celebrate my losses. The tendies aren't in the profits you take, they're in the risk you take.

https://preview.redd.it/nb8ozukrpw171.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd5a515f831dedcc57b25d717c5c133c0c74299d

So - let's summarize - prices are rising at their fastest pace in almost 30 years and incomes just plunged by their most ever! We're gonna need more stimmies!""  

Plus  to above; 

Last year, Hirschman Capital noted that since 1821, 98% of sovereigns that hit 130% debt/GDP have defaulted on their sovereign debt.   

The US hit 130% late last year. 

Simple Conclussion : The Fed can’t go “hawkish” and raise rates without sending markets –and economies–to their knees; by extension, they now have nothing left to “cut” when the current everything bubble implodes.

And that  is a *real problem*.

 There are only two ways for sovereigns to default: 

Inflation or collapse.    

The latter is not an option. 

 As for a solution, what’s so tragic is that the only option before the Fed is an even bigger problem—current and inevitably more inflation. 

 That is, if the Fed wants to keep markets (and their job security) breathing, they no longer have the foregoing template of “rate-hike-followed-by-rate-cutting” at their disposal, which means they now have no choice but to dovishly keep rates near the zero-bound indefinitely.

But the only way to keep rates “controlled” and nailed to the floor of time is to purchase otherwise unwanted bonds to keep their prices elevated and hence yields and rates repressed.

Such bond “accommodation,” of course, costs money, and as we already know, the only “money” the Fed has to spend is the kind they create out of thin air– the very kind of money (and policy) which leads to the kind of inflation discussed above—namely, the brutal kind.

 As for that fake money, the evidence of the Fed’s desperate (and only) direction is now obvious, as the following M2 money supply makes equally clear. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v774ta55sw171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e73c839beb67a67eea9aed7de4ac61d86813840

 

Fed is so embarrassed by this “printing solution” that they’ve stopped *weekly* reporting of M2 data, and frankly, since March, have even stopped *monthly* reporting of the same.

That, of course, is both telling as well as disgraceful… The Fed literally has something to hide, and that never bodes well, does it?

&#x200B;

 The correlation to central bank balance sheet (i.e., money supply) expansion and rising markets is now beyond dispute. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sgizb6xcsw171.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad2fe681fe0c49ac20368aba77e86c118b22959

 In short—do you see the correlation and pattern? Do you see how the Fed’s market sausage is made? More importantly, do you now see the Fed’s self-made conundrum? 

 

Given that the Fed bows to the markets not the people, which choice do you think they’ll make?

In other words, expect more money printing and more yield curve control—and hence more money creation, more inflation, and by extension more fiat currency debasement.

 More money supply to keep rates monetized simply means more currency debasement and rising inflation."

2021-05-29 17:00:18,wallstreetbets,"re: Japan... yes they peaked in 1990, but it had nothing to do with bond rates, their bond rates at the time were fairly normal around 5% or so... their collapse had to do with overheated real estate bubble, or at least that's the standard narrative, but there has been research (including by Bernanke who was the FED chair during 2009) that it was less about that, and more about liquidity and deflation crisis... precisely what FED is trying to avoid, partially as a lesson from Japanese lost decade. Japan has been very close to 0 rate since early 2000s, but the didn't experience significant inflation during that time, and their market is \~4x of it's level so not too bad all things considered.  


re: monetizing corporate debt... sure, but that may or may not lead to major inflation or dollar devaluation... the evidence so far seems to suggest that it's possible to maintain very reasonable inflation even at zero rates and with significant injection of cash into the economy.... is it possible that we are just ""loading a spring"" and it will come out at some point? sure... but it seems more likely that this can be kept going more or less indefinitely with no reprecussions"

We are seeing the repercussions as we speak. Real estate appreciation is through the roof worldwide.

This is not transitory inflation, no matter how much the Fed wants to will it into existence."
2021-05-29 02:17:38,wallstreetbets,"The Fed bought $120B/day of MBS and T-bills for a week back in March 2020, and has been buying $120B/month of the same since.

$3T in reserves were added to bank balance sheets. 

$700B more of MBS has been purchased since March 2020, that is as much as TARP from last time without the preceding decline in home prices.

Frankly, if this monetary policy does not cause inflation, then the United States of America does not need to collect taxes anymore. We can just print the money infinitely."

2021-05-28 21:05:06,wallstreetbets,I’d assume that’s part of it for sure.   I know they stopped pick up truck production for a while and prices here are insane. My 2 year old truck is currently valued at 15% more than I payed for it new.
2021-05-29 17:31:12,wallstreetbets,"Is real estate appreciation a problem though? It does hurt people who don’t own real estate in the short term, but it also incentives development and construction, so longer term it should balance out.

2021-05-29 12:58:53,wallstreetbets,MMT’ers would say that’s exactly what you could do but honestly it’s just shifting even more of the tax burden to the workers via the lag between price inflation and worker pay.
2021-05-28 22:20:45,wallstreetbets,As someone who went to rehab in 2021 your customers definitely consumed a lot lot more during the pandemic haha.
2021-05-28 21:11:23,wallstreetbets,I mean there's a massive chip shortage and they've had to stop a lot of car production lines. I'd imagine prices will get even higher for trucks soon. the
2021-05-29 17:45:34,wallstreetbets,"> Is real estate appreciation a problem though?

I mean, ask someone who bought the top in 2006 whether or not it was a problem? Further, housing costs drive wages. If housing continues to go through the roof, then wages will go up, then prices will keep going up, and then we get runaway inflation.

When it is organic, real estate price appreciation is not a problem. When single family homes appreciate 20% in a year for no reason, yes, that is a big problem. 

> And especially now with post covid remote work it should be easier to get a place and have a good paying job without being limited to few select locations

If the case was that people were in fact fleeing cities in numbers significant enough to matter, real estate prices in those cities would be declining. That is not the case. San Francisco, the worldwide boogeyman for expensive real estate, is up 15% Y/Y."
2021-05-29 18:08:18,wallstreetbets,"Most people who bought in 2006 and kept the house are up at this point

San Francisco is a weird one, because the prices in the city itself have actually declined as a result of covid and the BLM stuff, as people moved out from the city to the suburbs. The prices in the suburbs have increased significantly as a result, but historically Bay Area real estate prices are mostly self inflicted wound and have to do with very restrictive zoning and construction compared to actual demand. 

And yes housing does also drive wedges to some extent… but it’s not a question of if, but rather how much… 20% annual increases are not sustainable but even Bay Area with all the craziness didn’t experience that… the jumps can be that quick, but are mostly followed by a period of consolidation when the prices remain mostly stable or increasing fairly slowly"
2021-05-29 18:20:52,wallstreetbets,"> Most people who bought in 2006 and kept the house are up at this point

It only took 15 years to make 30%. 

Solid return on that, plus now the place almost certainly needs large-scale capex to keep up.

> the prices in the city itself have actually declined as a result of covid

This is not true. I invite you to look up home prices in the city proper, they are up substantially.

The idea that people are going to leave any given city in large enough numbers to matter due to BLM protests is a fairytale."

2021-05-29 04:16:36,wallstreetbets,What are the best call options for amc right now
2021-05-29 04:17:04,wallstreetbets,I purchased at $12. MSM is saying its only shorted 20% so no chance of skrocketing from here. Is that BS ?
2021-05-29 04:38:32,wallstreetbets,can I do that too?
2021-05-29 05:05:26,wallstreetbets,Post updates daily lmfao

2021-05-29 09:08:28,wallstreetbets,I hate how people toss around the term FOMO on this site. Aren't all stock purchases made with a level of FOMO? Asking for a broke friend.

2021-05-29 11:00:58,wallstreetbets,Cheering for AMC to be at $15 or less by EOW and then you can shoot past Pluto for all I care 🤣. I am trying to make some money to take this stray cat outside of my work to the vet!
2021-05-29 11:01:08,wallstreetbets,bought at 13 got 60 shares 30 with me 30 with my mom we holding strong together
2021-05-29 11:17:36,wallstreetbets,I snagged AMC before it was trending as a part of a greater strategy of snagging stocks of service industry companies I expected to bounce back once people emerged from hiding. 😁 much gain from the pandemic low much gain indeed.
2021-05-29 11:57:17,wallstreetbets,Is AMC  good to buy in I'm new

2021-05-29 17:16:33,wallstreetbets,Don’t worry guys! Just bought some tickets to the movies tonight. Gonna get out and push this to the moon if I have to
2021-05-29 17:22:02,wallstreetbets,This is my first time interacting on the site and if someone could direct me to the  venue best suited for discussing the developing BBBY squeeze. I have been in the businesss operating independently for almost 20 years as a contrarian focusing on distressed debt and special situation. I believe the opportunity to squeeze BBBY is absolutely enormous and would Like to chat to get feedback from the users of this site. I continue to be amazed how much pull this site has created.
2021-05-29 03:25:12,wallstreetbets,WSB does not have a place for AMC stock. Your in the wrong subreddit.
2021-05-28 20:03:54,wallstreetbets,Dude I love the support! Let's go AMC
2021-05-28 21:13:30,wallstreetbets,Is BB the next AMC?
2021-05-28 22:58:23,wallstreetbets,It was holding $21.85 ... it was holding $10 and looked powerful. . So you buy $27 ... that makes total sense!  At $34 I entered two put spreads.  One that expired today and I made a double.  The other is for JUNE Expiry... $30.$21 Spread... I see the stock of this NOT FOR PROFIT company being too high at $21 but seems like a reasonable place for it to land after this amazing rally. If it can hold $20 for any length of time I will be happy for all that want to own the name as this is around 4x what a fair price is. Best of luck to all! I hope it goes to $100. I will laugh my face right off if it does as the trade I am in is from the profit I made on the trade I cashed today.
2021-05-28 20:25:01,wallstreetbets,58 @14.14 This is just a tease fellow apes

2021-05-28 21:18:08,wallstreetbets,Genuine question...realistically how high can AMC stock go due to the inevitable squeeze?
2021-05-28 21:18:20,wallstreetbets,"Dude, why? 

How much do u think it’ll go up?"
2021-05-28 22:13:48,wallstreetbets,"diamond hand to the moon , at least $100"
2021-05-28 22:32:19,wallstreetbets,It's retards like you who make us paperhands the money. Thank you for your service.
2021-05-29 01:47:20,wallstreetbets,I just FOMOed in 1300 shares lol

Can you suggest some good alternatives 
Thanks 🙏🏻"
2021-05-29 04:59:31,wallstreetbets,"Oh nice so u support Citadel, making them richer"
2021-05-29 05:18:57,wallstreetbets,I have 900 shares and on Tuesday  i will add more at blackberry BB 🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-28 22:19:31,wallstreetbets,Are you stupid or new here? It’s buy high sell low.
2021-05-29 14:10:35,wallstreetbets,"It goes the other direction because you are buying on RH and listening to WSB. On Fridays, the HF's will _always_ find a way to drop the price before expiry to fuck you. They know there is a max pain point where the PUTS get fucked and the CALLS get fucked. They can short the upward momentum to park the price right at the pain point. They know how, and do it every Friday. They either buy or sell short to get it to land in the exact to the penny spot to hurt. So, you have to sell your position Thursday EOD otherwise you will get fucked on Friday. Chances are you opened your new position on a Monday, because it almost always rises Mondays because of the T+2 and they usually can't/don't short Mondays. So if you buy Monday/Tuesday, you are buying high setting you up for a loss. Best time to buy is usually Wednesday, Thursday and sometimes Friday Dips. The dips generally happen right after open. It often spikes up, and then spikes down. Sometimes spikes down, then up. There is always price volatility between 9:30 and 10 and it settles down after 10. If you have giant balls, you can wait til Friday for the short attack and buy the super dip, but that's dangerous. You should get in the habit of buying mid week and selling mid week because Friday is just too volatile and shorts go out of the way to fuck you. I find buying EOD Friday if the shorts crushed the stock is a good time to buy as Monday it generally moons and I can close my positions Tuesday for some quick profit, or if they are strong, wait til Thursday EOD as Friday it's likely to sink.

2021-05-28 21:19:53,wallstreetbets,Losses aint losses til you sell.
2021-05-28 21:06:52,wallstreetbets,"Cause you need to “hold”!!!  
Wrap you arms around it and hold it tighter than your truest love…"
2021-05-29 00:02:31,wallstreetbets,"Little late to the game but... why did u buy? If the thesis still stands then buy / hold. 
Ps. If you don't sell you never lose $$
Pps. This is not financial advice. Just coloring tips"
2021-05-28 22:35:10,wallstreetbets,"Buy NNDM it has 110% shorts float as of 5/15/21 and priced at 7.10, if we buy with huge volume next week it will cause bigger short squeeze compared to AMC. Good Luck!"
2021-05-28 23:56:15,wallstreetbets,There’s a million people with less crayons up their ass and a lot more experience that could explain better but when I BUY any shares that’s not a limit order it adds a few dollars more per share that I’m “willing to buy in at” if you check your avg cost per share after doing it you will sometime notice that you bought in at a price the stock isn’t currently at ( Robinhood adds almost 10% ) You have to set the limit order at the stocks current price ( or lower if you’re willing to wait )
2021-05-29 06:00:25,wallstreetbets,"Because most of the winners here enter before the hype and when “stock was dead” All the loss porn you see is from people who hopped in the rocket when its on top because of FOMO. Just hold and believe in your positions, I am full in on BB and we are going to visit ISS next week"
2021-05-29 12:14:35,wallstreetbets,Not sure when you bought but its pretty stable right now. I bought when it was like 8$ then 14$ so its up up for me and a few other's. It did not drop much so hold on my friend and anything below 50$ at this point is a good buy.
2021-05-29 12:41:55,wallstreetbets,I buy high sell high.
2021-05-29 12:46:18,wallstreetbets,Let us all know when you’re selling so we can buy😀....just kidding 😜
2021-05-29 10:23:50,wallstreetbets,"The rich will never allow another Gamestop to happen again.  Save the   
headache.  Holding AMC since Jan, sold yesterday and made back the   
little I lost from GME.  No more headackes."
2021-05-28 20:03:04,wallstreetbets,Buy and hold
2021-05-28 20:09:55,wallstreetbets,No joke i was watching iwm today and bought some calls after it looked like it it was gonna continue a slow upward trend. Try and guess exactly which time i bought it at.
2021-05-28 22:38:37,wallstreetbets,"Trust it, I bought 10 shares for 100 bucks a few months ago during GME round 1"
2021-05-28 22:40:01,wallstreetbets,"Same. Thought about trying reverse psychology on the market...If I think a stock is going up, I'm going to short it...couldn't do any worse than I already do lol"
2021-05-28 22:59:35,wallstreetbets,Could you give an heads up when you buy these again?
2021-05-28 23:10:17,wallstreetbets,That’s most of us I think lol 😂

2021-05-28 23:44:00,wallstreetbets,Wait for a pull back to the 34 EMA/50EMA. That will get you a trampoline move
2021-05-28 23:52:29,wallstreetbets,I feel your pain lol
2021-05-29 00:40:30,wallstreetbets,"Probably because by the time you buy or sell, you already missed the ride. YOLO dont FOMO. This is not financial advice."
2021-05-29 01:45:40,wallstreetbets,Because you are a fomoing ape
2021-05-29 02:07:57,wallstreetbets,"The value of the stock is always the same when you buy it, because that's how you valued it. However the current trading value fluxates based on what others value a stake in the company is. And so when it dips it's because people are trading for less than it's worth. When the value of the stock rises it's because there are not as many shares available and the demand is higher. When a stock is really high it doesn't necessarilly mean  you can sell it for that value either. Sometimes it has to sell for less than it's ticked value is in order to liquidate the stock.

Hedge fundos can't sell when noones buying because the squeeze on their gamble is too high for them to profit. They are loaned the stock at a higher value in the anticipation that the stock will drop so that when the hold expires on the stock they are required to buy it. This is how hedge fundos lose their money.

Honestly though it probably should be illegal to gamble on loss. Often people lose tons of money in risky stock ventures because some hedge fundo was gambling with their money."
2021-05-29 02:24:09,wallstreetbets,"And when you go out it will skyrocket? 
If so then Maybe in the right moment you can do it for the 🦍?"
2021-05-29 02:57:44,wallstreetbets,It’s because you were already too late

2021-05-29 04:13:44,wallstreetbets,Hold! I’ve been mostly in red the whole time I held AMC and when it went to green it wasn’t a good price to sell and will still think the same until I decide my right price.
2021-05-29 04:54:06,wallstreetbets,If you're hearing about it going up... you're too late. By the time it reaches main stream you are seeing it hit the top and you're buying... wait a bit and you'll see it dip. Don't buy on an up swing.
2021-05-29 05:18:38,wallstreetbets,Same for all ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)

Now they turned profit and I keep buying dips over volatile time. I have AMC in my portfolio, for the reason that enough faithfulness to prevent me from the sell button. believe ourselves to the moon is the destination"
2021-05-29 14:06:26,wallstreetbets,It’s called hold

2021-05-29 18:15:23,wallstreetbets,I know the feeling. Found if I use trailing stop losses and buy after a 5-10% dip I’m normally not disappointed. Try not to buy on the way up unless it just started 😂
2021-05-28 21:41:57,wallstreetbets,"Do you really not get it? You’re getting your fucking investing information off of a massive public forum full of other novice investors. 

It’s like this whole thing is set up to milk you dry...

Edit: downvote me all you want, doesn’t change the fact that you’d have to be a fucking moron to think that getting investing tips *last on Reddit* is a good way to make money. The only thing that will ever do is get you fucking hosed, and it’s not even remotely up for debate - it’s obvious."
2021-05-28 22:24:14,wallstreetbets,"I've been doing the same thing with AMC, for me it's because I was responding to news of increases and dumping if it dipped. One sees a spike, one buys in, the stock corrects from the spike. But the spike doesn't happen if the sentiment isn't there (in this case only, and sweet God this is so not financial advice) so just ride it out. AMC is potentially volatile with all the *gestures broadly* but it will short or it won't and panicking doesn't help either way"

2021-05-29 01:54:09,wallstreetbets,FOMO. WSB was anti AMC for months until the run up now. People are shitting the bed and trying to jump on as fast as possible. It was the same with GME before January lol

2021-05-29 14:13:43,wallstreetbets,Dude tickets here are like $20. I need it to moon to be able to buy the damn tickets.

Check out Treys Trades on YouTube."

If everyone votes, we have a real chance to legally prove that AMC is being naked shorted, triggering an SEC investigation and if they try to sweep this under a rug I expect guillotines."
2021-05-29 03:02:10,wallstreetbets,First week of June is when AMC shareholder meeting happens. They are supposed to count total shares. They may expose a massive amount of synthetic shares out on the market. Look up “Trey’s Trades” on YouTube. He is great at explaining this. His technical analysis is pretty spot on too. We need another pile on like Thursday.
2021-05-29 14:15:03,wallstreetbets,Stay in til 7/4 or later. Independence day!

2021-05-29 01:30:05,wallstreetbets,The dip? Lol How’s that going?
2021-05-29 12:06:17,wallstreetbets,This should be higher up lol.
2021-05-29 01:56:33,wallstreetbets,I dont want to actually go in the theaters so I'll just buy tickets and popcorn and turn around and go home.
2021-05-29 02:22:32,wallstreetbets,Got shares between $9-14 and just kept holding and buying to average down.

2021-05-29 14:55:25,wallstreetbets,9.20 here. I get what you mean.
2021-05-28 22:06:58,wallstreetbets,You forgot the K
2021-05-29 09:14:04,wallstreetbets,I agree.. Is it possible AMC can hit GME numbers?
2021-05-28 20:55:04,wallstreetbets,"This makes us 2, buddy! I got mine at 32.8 - 1000 shares and I am left zombie! I am still holding the faith and so should you! Let’s rock AMC!"
2021-05-28 23:40:25,wallstreetbets,"Same, I took some other apes seat on the rocket ship today! Hold!"
2021-05-29 02:14:50,wallstreetbets,Might be too late depending on Tuesday premarket but consider selling covered calls on your shares. The premiums were insane during the run up. I sold CCs for $600-800 which lowered my cost basis by a lot. Adds a layer of security so if it crashes next week I can buy the contracts back for pennies on the dollar and just hold until the next surge.
2021-05-29 01:25:42,wallstreetbets,You made a really bad decision to buy at $31
2021-05-28 20:14:52,wallstreetbets,Fuck yeah it is
2021-05-28 20:55:52,wallstreetbets,Hell yes! Hold the line!
2021-05-28 22:19:35,wallstreetbets,The squeeze hasn’t started yet. Hold
2021-05-29 00:09:42,wallstreetbets,How can you tell it’s a demo account?
2021-05-29 01:09:31,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-05-29 04:26:02,wallstreetbets,so you believe its shorted 20% now ?
2021-05-29 01:29:35,wallstreetbets,Stop buying out of FOMO after a big run up. That’s a poor decision
2021-05-29 02:34:04,wallstreetbets,"My price is their head.  


I'm not selling until Citadel is scrapped for parts."
2021-05-29 06:00:36,wallstreetbets,Good luck with that. 🤡
2021-05-28 21:46:12,wallstreetbets,Last time I bought 1k GME @45 and I sold 300 @ yesterday
2021-05-28 23:33:25,wallstreetbets,Market closed on Monday. You're looking at Tuesday
2021-05-29 03:45:22,wallstreetbets,I hope you’re joking.
2021-05-29 12:07:02,wallstreetbets,"Just do some research. No one was born knowing how to invest/trade, and probably 90% of people on /r/WSB only lose money lol."
2021-05-29 06:04:11,wallstreetbets,Bot alert
2021-05-29 12:04:39,wallstreetbets,"The difference is when you buy in... If you bought into AMC at $10 following a pandemic crash, probably a decent idea. If you bought in at $30 after a 100% run up in 2 days, that's purely fomo because you saw how fast it gained and you think you're missing out."
2021-05-29 14:17:31,wallstreetbets,If you buy a stock that is down 30% that day is FOMO motivating you?
2021-05-29 12:02:54,wallstreetbets,The FOMO is strong with this greedy boy.
2021-05-29 12:01:40,wallstreetbets,"I would not do it right now. It just had a MASSIVE run up and you don't want to FOMO in. Sure, it *could* go up some more on Monday, but it's pretty risky. If it drops like 50% in one day, that might (might!) be a better time to buy in. This is not financial advice."
2021-05-29 10:48:40,wallstreetbets,Could be both
2021-05-29 11:02:28,wallstreetbets,This logic would indicate that my partner is a stone cold GME pro.
2021-05-29 14:38:04,wallstreetbets,No wonder why you don’t make money
2021-05-29 14:58:48,wallstreetbets,He’s definitely one are the other🤔….or better yet upper echelon stupid🤷🏽‍♂️
2021-05-29 12:43:07,wallstreetbets,it’s always buy
2021-05-28 21:25:12,wallstreetbets,What about the people who bought gme at $420 😅
2021-05-29 12:16:08,wallstreetbets,I’ve held my 400 shares since January at avg of $14 I seen it at $5
2021-05-29 01:10:43,wallstreetbets,"How will you know when to sell though? I always hold for a long time, buy when it’s right and sell but it never goes well."
2021-05-28 22:41:10,wallstreetbets,"Some of us were up 20k this morning, listened to this dumb advice and held, finished the day down 2k :/![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)"
2021-05-29 14:50:42,wallstreetbets,Sometimes you have to take yes for an answer. Pick a reasonable profit point when you buy the stock and set your sell limit and a stop loss so you don't end up married to a shit stock for months hoping it will recover some day.
2021-05-28 23:02:02,wallstreetbets,"Actually, NO. You buy low and you sell high. You learn to buy low. I bought NIO @ $2 .. .Then I sold it at $40 ... This company never made money before the pandemic, during it and will not after it.  So, buy and hold this and watch your shares get taken away by those that hold the debt. Those that hold the debt own the company. Shareholders are just along for the ride and get cleaned out in the event the company is forced by the bondholders to end operations.  TRADE is the game... Not buy and hold with a zero sum company like AMC."
2021-05-29 10:17:17,wallstreetbets,I have shares of Sears I’ve had for YEARS. My $2 call expired in January as a matter of fact
2021-05-29 10:48:59,wallstreetbets,6 months here 🤣🥴
2021-05-29 02:25:08,wallstreetbets,"If you think this is the high of the hype, you're high as a kite."
2021-05-29 05:50:16,wallstreetbets,FOMO IS REAL
2021-05-29 11:41:19,wallstreetbets,high at the time of the buy?
2021-05-29 11:40:58,wallstreetbets,I will never SELL!
2021-05-28 21:53:59,wallstreetbets,Can’t see that shit when you’re trading on RH... Trade with a real broker.
2021-05-28 20:36:07,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-29 02:52:52,wallstreetbets,"In the case with AMC right now all of that is out the window. If people would have piled on like the day before we may have caused the squeeze. It’s sooooo fucking close. Bots telling people to sell Friday didn’t help either. People sold instead of checking to see if any short positions were forced to cover yet. If the shorts aren’t covering, there is no squeeze."
2021-05-29 10:25:53,wallstreetbets,"hm... I'm curious to see if that's really true in regards of BB for the next days and weeks..
i think for AMC the party is over and i have to accept the loss..

maybe the reason that i skipped to buy at under 5€ last year put me in a FOMO mode yesterday when the news reached my ears... couldn't resist to buy at 22€..."
2021-05-29 03:34:07,wallstreetbets,what is rope?
2021-05-29 10:18:00,wallstreetbets,it depends... but mostly on the back
2021-05-29 09:44:37,wallstreetbets,"Less then a year, to fuck your self

You are a gay bear"
2021-05-28 21:54:25,wallstreetbets,I know- I missed the 40% run up this morning so I just went back to work… looked again at the end of the day and saw a buying opportunity
2021-05-28 23:10:23,wallstreetbets,"No laws, just generally not a good idea especially since it’s all based on hype"
2021-05-28 22:17:06,wallstreetbets,Name checks out. Can I have my manhood back please?
2021-05-29 08:44:40,wallstreetbets,You got the same issue too
2021-05-28 22:22:50,wallstreetbets,Close enough! When it goes to the moon it doesn’t matter what price you got it.
2021-05-28 22:26:45,wallstreetbets,"let's see how relaxed you are next week. 

Jesus christ what's wrong with your types, like there are several targets, $wkhs is the number one shorted stock now, or $spce, $bb, $ride, $tlry, there are so many other targets that aren't insanely priced at the moment and will have their day as well.

I'm all for fucking the hedge funds but that FOMO will kill you."
2021-05-29 14:24:48,wallstreetbets,I hear you and I get it. I’m just doing what I can so it can go to the MOON!!
2021-05-29 01:06:45,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-05-29 02:32:40,wallstreetbets,\^This guy fucks.
2021-05-29 10:54:59,wallstreetbets,fomo at its best. some dummies
2021-05-29 09:31:19,wallstreetbets,"People are thinking this could hit 5-6 figures a share....  GME could hit 7... Just buy and hold, hedge funds are gonna pull fuckery next week as there is a share count for AMC that will expose naked shorts and force them to buy back.... If we don’t sell, price just rockets until we name our price"
2021-05-29 02:24:42,wallstreetbets,![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grimacing)
2021-05-29 01:11:26,wallstreetbets,I think we’re all aware this is speculative. We know they have debt and were incredibly close to bankruptcy.
2021-05-29 05:39:06,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely not, just saying that Buy it’s the easy part. You gotta hold"
2021-05-28 21:54:51,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-05-29 02:41:07,wallstreetbets,Big F to that
2021-05-28 23:35:40,wallstreetbets,Oh haha By Tuesday do you expect AMC to be above $30? What's your thoughts.!
2021-05-29 14:41:00,wallstreetbets,I would say yes... Fear of Missing buying the dip
2021-05-29 12:54:46,wallstreetbets,"Ofc it is interchangeable, depends on the day tho"
2021-05-28 20:07:44,wallstreetbets,"You and me both.  I managed to FOMO my way into buying high and it's just now started moving up so that I'm not at a net loss.  


Holding 200@12.35"
2021-05-28 21:41:08,wallstreetbets,8 straight and this week was glorious 👍
2021-05-29 00:00:57,wallstreetbets,I wish I could have just on principle. I’d never sell those. They would be passed along to future generations to show how much of a retard their ancestors really were.
2021-05-29 08:15:16,wallstreetbets,I still hold some GME I bought @ $311.
2021-05-29 11:16:58,wallstreetbets,"In regards to GME, it’s either a life changing amount, or hold until it is."
2021-05-29 11:21:26,wallstreetbets,"Have to make a choice so you want to sell at a lose or hold out for gains, then hope that you make enough that it was worth it and you can pay your capital gains."
2021-05-29 07:35:28,wallstreetbets,You’ll know
2021-05-29 12:39:02,wallstreetbets,When you've made the money you want or you join in and sell the dip
2021-05-29 00:07:20,wallstreetbets,But the end of next week you'll be above 20k
2021-05-29 10:59:49,wallstreetbets,honestly the hedge funds are bleeding we did not drop substantially. They are scared soon it will be time to cover the costs they have lost billions
2021-05-29 04:07:33,wallstreetbets,I was up like 70k and I'm holding for the long run 150k+ baby
2021-05-28 23:07:10,wallstreetbets,Hold!!!
2021-05-29 04:29:34,wallstreetbets,Keep holding you'll b up 200k soon enough
2021-05-29 04:51:12,wallstreetbets,Same. Like in hindsight what the fuck were we thinking. Sure it may go up next week and it better fucking go up. But man I was just looking at a quick 10k profit and just let it go cause I got greedy as fuck.
2021-05-29 05:46:44,wallstreetbets,You have to learn that the people that are saying hold are the ones that are selling
2021-05-29 06:53:54,wallstreetbets,FUD
2021-05-29 13:11:06,wallstreetbets,same
2021-05-29 08:57:03,wallstreetbets,I actually agree
2021-05-29 02:24:44,wallstreetbets,username does not check out.
2021-05-28 21:42:14,wallstreetbets,They work for scalping weeklies for me
2021-05-28 22:48:34,wallstreetbets,"the previous short squeezes peaked then they crashed and burned, we'll see, monday it could keep going or start dying down.

&#x200B;

I watched amc bounce around a couple dollars in 20 seconds this morning.,  how do you T/A that?"
2021-05-28 23:03:30,wallstreetbets,"listen to Lou. help will help you feel more confident.

2021-05-29 07:23:22,wallstreetbets,"Charts dont mean shit here. Your technical analysis should be looking at short float, and synthetic shares done by naked shorting. Buy. Hold. Wait for it."
2021-05-29 08:58:32,wallstreetbets,Its not lol
2021-05-29 13:12:22,wallstreetbets,fibonacci and past resistance levels do work and are significant.
2021-05-28 23:06:28,wallstreetbets,"100% TA worked here .. open a weekly chart ... put up the 13 and 52 SMA .. Put up a 26,2 Bollinger set up. Study it and you can see the stock was setting up for a bullish explosion once it gained $10 again.  I gave the alert to one of my followers and he bought calls when I bought shares. He killed it .. I did not. However, I now killed it in a couple of put spreads I got when it failed at $34 today.  If you put up a weekly chart that goes back to 2016 you can see why the stock failed at the price it did. Best of luck with your future trades."
2021-05-28 22:45:25,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it does, cause buying a dollar ain’t gonna make it. Or is?"
2021-05-29 04:12:43,wallstreetbets,Try buying 5000 at 33
2021-05-28 21:51:46,wallstreetbets,Added more today too. Been buying a few every week all year.
2021-05-29 04:14:23,wallstreetbets,Why did you sell at all I can see no balls on this guy j got 5000 shares @28
2021-05-28 22:42:19,wallstreetbets,Bro it’s a gamble where the roulette ball stops rolling on June 3rd. Just because you didn’t buy in at $6 doesn’t mean you should let your salt spill out so hard.
2021-05-29 17:34:14,wallstreetbets,Thanks... I think
2021-05-29 11:14:22,wallstreetbets,"Dude if you're worried about me losing money then, thank you! You don't have to call me a dummy for my decision which won't affect you in any manner 🍻"
2021-05-29 09:41:30,wallstreetbets,Thanks for answering ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|smile). I bought shares of AMC is it good to do a call to? I don’t know how to do it but I see a lot of people making a lot of money of it
2021-05-29 04:59:35,wallstreetbets,You cant answer with „yes“ to my question
2021-05-28 23:38:36,wallstreetbets,"Really wish I had a crystal ball! I've only got 💎🙌🏻💎

That being said I went full retard and bought in at 31.5"
2021-05-29 14:55:56,wallstreetbets,That’s a stretch lol. Fear of catching a falling knife is much stronger.
2021-05-28 20:23:42,wallstreetbets,"Yep, luckily I lost so much (to me) on gme and amc that I was like, I’m never selling these fuckers lol. It was a quick way to harden my trading skin and learn to just hold"
2021-05-28 21:57:06,wallstreetbets,Same. It was hard seeing it hit $7 as well. Kept the faith and it has been rewarded.
2021-05-28 20:32:18,wallstreetbets,thats in the past now bucko
2021-05-29 01:42:04,wallstreetbets,Bro same I feel you on that
2021-05-29 10:58:02,wallstreetbets,same lost faith at one point but if you play the long game and have patience it will all work out in the end
2021-05-29 00:11:12,wallstreetbets,How did u know to buy in January? I’m still learning.
2021-05-29 02:06:39,wallstreetbets,I did too
2021-05-29 06:53:03,wallstreetbets,Same here. I knew it would come back. Time for another red wave soon.
2021-05-29 11:46:14,wallstreetbets,Bought Feb at 6$. Knew itd be back up one way or another
2021-05-29 11:59:53,wallstreetbets,"Same here. Had my order in and at close it was 9 something, by the time the stock was purchased it was at 14 something. Diamond hands holding 60 shares"
2021-05-29 14:59:50,wallstreetbets,I’ve been holding from 7&8 dollars respectively….
2021-05-29 14:08:41,wallstreetbets,This!
2021-05-29 13:42:26,wallstreetbets,You got it. Only will lose for selling.

2021-05-29 04:50:13,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I can't recall any posts where people are talking about how such and such stock is absolutely washed out, sitting on the floor right now and can't possibly go any lower.

2021-05-28 22:49:27,wallstreetbets,"BRO you guys can't seem to handle and common sense criticism. I made 20k on AMC but got out safely. Too many noobs get burned and some even ruin their lives on this shit. 

There is responsible speculation and insane FOMO gambling. There is a difference."
2021-05-29 11:16:21,wallstreetbets,"Sorry my friend, i wasn’t calling you a dummy lol. I was replying to OP on the fact that now amc is running up, apes are buying when they’ve had the chance to buy at such a discount for so long. May you’re tendies come soon!🦧"

2021-05-29 10:55:22,wallstreetbets,I just did
2021-05-28 23:43:02,wallstreetbets,Woww. Did you sell at $35?
2021-05-29 10:58:06,wallstreetbets,Good speed ape. And keep it up. We’re not to our final battle yet. See you on Pluto. 100keasy
2021-05-29 14:08:59,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-29 00:23:02,wallstreetbets,"I bought because I was a noob to WSB and AMC and NOK were the other supposed rocket ships. I held for two reasons. Number one is it's not a loss until you sell and two because I figured all the extroverts would fling themselves at seeing movies in theaters again once the pandemic eased up. It's been a few months watching these stocks bleed but again number one is you haven't lost yet until you sell at a loss. I sold a couple of shares of AMC today to get some profit and recoup and funnel that into other adventures. I still hold a few in hopes it rockets to the moon.

Tldr: bought because meme but held because seems like a good long play."
2021-05-29 01:20:54,wallstreetbets,Buy?
2021-05-29 08:50:48,wallstreetbets,"Buy the rumor, sell the news"
2021-05-28 20:07:21,wallstreetbets,How do you vote with shares? I use cashapp for my amc and clov shares and I really have no idea what’s going on
2021-05-28 21:01:54,wallstreetbets,Thanks brother 🦍
2021-05-28 23:36:13,wallstreetbets,"I truly dont think AMC will hit 300 - 400 like gme. GME has a way lower float, and I would say better revenue options as well."
2021-05-28 23:37:37,wallstreetbets,And you call yourself an ape with those gains? Pfffff weeeak
2021-05-29 11:17:57,wallstreetbets,"Same to you dude, wishing you all the best!"
2021-05-29 13:53:32,wallstreetbets,Exactly!!!!!
2021-05-29 12:25:35,wallstreetbets,What the hell?
2021-05-28 23:48:24,wallstreetbets,Nope. Holding
2021-05-29 10:20:32,wallstreetbets,how is it possible to distinguish rumor from news...
2021-05-28 21:40:55,wallstreetbets,Well the one area you are mistaken is the fact you think a squeeze occured this week. The short position only grow larger. This was pure market buying. More than likely from HF to boost up to mimic a squeeze to then sell today to see if they could start a fire sell to act as if the squeeze was over. Unfortunately it didnt work still over $25 at end of day. The month of June is going to be a fun and interesting ride when the number of synthetic stocks are caculated.
2021-05-28 22:50:33,wallstreetbets,"Squeeze hasn’t even started. The price has gone up while the short interest has gone up as well, and that doesn’t even tell the whole story when counting the countless synthetic shares hedge funds have created. There has been zero covering so far, this price action is due to fomo. You paid bashers will get what you deserve."
2021-05-28 21:16:47,wallstreetbets,This guy doesn't fuck.
2021-05-28 21:23:25,wallstreetbets,"Excuse me, but when did GME squeeze?"
2021-05-28 20:20:12,wallstreetbets,I'm gonna buy more 🤪
2021-05-29 04:45:23,wallstreetbets,Same
2021-05-29 08:52:33,wallstreetbets,"Holding from Europe too, previously I received a message from Revolut where they provided the link for me to vote on the AMC options, it was some days later than the guys from US posted here, so I guess that will be same."
2021-05-28 22:10:28,wallstreetbets,"People throw around completely random number, pulled from their asses. I'd learn not to listen to reddit comments for investment advice if I were you"
2021-05-28 23:26:58,wallstreetbets,"I never would have guessed it could jump 10 fold in the past. No reasoning just that it did it once and so I think it can do it again. Maybe 10 fold is more like 8 to 80 this time around I don’t know, but I didn’t buy at the bottom.  Yahoo finance seems to indicate that ~94M shares or ~20% are short as of May 14th, similar to what was held short as of Apr 14th but I’m in no way qualified to give advice but it seems to me that we are not at the top yet. 

Please note I’m in this to make money myself, I’m not giving advice and I’m not trying to convince you or anyone in anyway to make a decision. I simply saw someone who also bought near the higher end and was trying to show solidarity."
2021-05-28 23:42:18,wallstreetbets,">I bought 940 shares @ $31. You know how many i sold? ZERO

Lol ^ that's you, you have only lost thus far. While I like the community here when it gets too retarded it's just too much. 

There needs to be a bit more logic with the fun. You can make fun of my 20k gains (it was actually 23k lol) but you know damn well it's more than 95% of the apes here make. 

If too many of us FOMO at the top we won't have enough apes to take down the hedge funds, we have to be smarter or we die out."
2021-05-28 23:49:28,wallstreetbets,Nicee. I bought yesterday at $26.06 and overslept to sell at $35 😔 LOL big loss
2021-05-28 20:20:45,wallstreetbets,"Why not buy more, since either gonna be cheap asf according to him."
2021-05-28 23:45:43,wallstreetbets,"You scalped your fellow ape. Not cool! But you do you, I’ll wave back from my Tesla in space"
2021-05-28 23:50:24,wallstreetbets,Yeah I'm with you. Let's see how Tuesday plays out!
2021-05-28 20:44:53,wallstreetbets,Yea That’s the plan for me until I see 100k I ain’t selling🚀🚀
2021-05-28 23:52:02,wallstreetbets,Can't! #Payday! Just bought more !!🤑
2021-05-28 21:34:23,wallstreetbets,I wasn’t around back in January to reap the benefits of GME and other profitable investments but I have read about it and you are correct. Things can change in an instant. I’m hoping it does go smoothly. My feeling is that it will take everyone holding on to their shares and not panic selling. I feel like that’s what happened today. What do you think?

Tl;dr

This is an extensive, in-depth due-diligence document, and I realize that “ain’t nobody got time for that”. So I have decided to do God’s work for him and put the tl;dr at the start, saving you all a couple hours read.

* Henrik Fisker is a God among men in the automotive industry - trust him to do right
* Geeta Gupta-Fisker is a solid Chief Financial Officer with experience in investment banking - she will ensure the shares are valued right
* Henrik has learned from all the mistakes he made with his previous attempt to create Fisker Automotive, and will certainly do everything in his power to avoid that mess again. He has designed systems into the intricacies of the company to avoid failure - meaning Fisker Inc is guaranteed to succeed
* Henrik Fisker on shorting $FSR - “You will quickly understand that you stand to lose a lot of money if you show it against Fisker”
* Production of Fisker Ocean expected to start in November 2022
* 250,000+ units a year expected by 2025
* Partnerships with Foxconn and Magna Steyr, both giants in their respective industries, among others
* Large Fleet market in Europe gaining momentum, and 700+ Fisker reservations in this market alone
* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)
* Designing the first ever all-electric popemobile - Massive, soon to be historic, event!
* I give $FSR (currently $13 a share) a price target of $100 by end of year 2022, if not sooner
* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

In 2007, Tesla Motors hired Henrik Fisker to perform initial design work on the Tesla Model S electric sedan, which was introduced in 2012.

Fisker stated in 2018 that, with the growth of car-sharing, ride-hailing, and autonomous shuttles, he believes within 10 years private cars will be used for less than half of what they are currently used for.

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/59vfj5wa8w171.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1c03d1e1254fea00c195776122de2b26099dd35

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker’s business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn’t own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn’t until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker’s hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities’ fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call “pay to play.” As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker’s next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 — a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities’ internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will “suffer no dilution,” and was “a dream scenario.”

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire — salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public — and in a presidential election year — Fisker’s struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn’t seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce — in the end, Fisker didn’t deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker’s funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with “industry names.” But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries — that’s the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** “Now he’s back–and three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker’s stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday’s market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.’s CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector’s first husband and wife power couple.”

Wealth isn’t the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. “I never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO’s)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn’t with his earlier company.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yzhded6pfw171.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=54b30259720cf853a8efeacf058f2f74315260b9

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta’s background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

“When I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,” Henrik remembers. “I'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.”

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings–an enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik’s prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

“She got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,” Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, “she only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.”

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s87j6bdsfw171.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=e40add9ce53319d31db242cce73a303afb03cbab

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: “The idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It’s a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.”

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He’s a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project — an all-electric luxury SUV — and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don’t pollute while driving, but that’s it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them — and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it’s a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it’s a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me “sustainability” adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that’s really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so … brief. Now it’s back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting — and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It’s not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he’s works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn’t mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he’d transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, “Why don’t you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.” Most people don’t understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don’t understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that’s going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there’s nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn’t have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we’re going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don’t have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that’s closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that’s on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we’re really thinking about now as we’re nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We’ve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything — supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself — in terms of the type of materials there.

**Fisker Flexible Platform Adaptive Design (FF-PAD)** \- FF-PAD is a Fisker proprietary process that allows the development and design of a vehicle to be adapted to any Fisker-qualified EV platform in the specific segment size. *It de-risks the business model and significantly reduces time and capital intensity associated with vehicle development and manufacturing engineering*.

Benefits / Proof-Points:

▪ Built drivable prototype in 7 weeks from receipt of platform data

▪ 29-month Ocean development timing (2-3 year savings)

▪ Magna architecture in development since 2018. Without FF-PAD, Fisker would have needed to be involved from that date.

Fisker targets 4 unique vehicle models on the market by 2025YE

MEDIUM-TERM OPERATING MODEL:

Targeting annual volume of 200,000-250,000 units by 2025 (under review pending finalized agreement with Foxconn)

Projecting mid-$50k Avg. selling price (ASP) at Ocean maturity (slightly below midpoint of price range)

Platform-sharing, contract manufacturing, outsourced service, digital sales / distribution, and organic marketing supports meaningfully lower OpEx spend vs. competitors.

2021-05-28 21:09:31,wallstreetbets,"""$1bn cash with a $3bn market cap is a sign of obvious undervaluation. ""

&#x200B;

Absolutely not true. You are buying $1 at a price of $3. These company doesnt even have revenues. 

You are banking on Fisker to crush the manufacturing and execution in the next three years. 

&#x200B;

Everyone else is coming with their EVs already. he is behind the power curve.

2021-05-28 22:42:12,wallstreetbets,"Yep seems like it to me too

Had made some boasts about solid state batteries and patents awhile back, need to dog those out see if anything good in there

Solid state batteries that actually are full term tech might be able to accomplish a 100$ share price at end of 22, electric car companies are nothing about cars or design... It's electrical components and frame engineering dozens of companies can do that... The differentiation between companies has everything to do with batteries, everything else almost any car company could do better or dozens of start ups could do.  Batteries and Battery management systems are everything 

Will look into what patents fisker got on solid state batteries, but it looks more like a hype play then a undervalued play or short squeeze, but what the fuck do I know, my brains wrinkles keep disappearing or I never had any"
2021-05-29 03:16:13,wallstreetbets,"Large legacy actually way behind.. It’s going to be extremely difficult for them to make room for these EV with their bread and butter vehicles.

2021-05-29 19:11:42,wallstreetbets,"You guys are misunderstanding some very basic aspects of “squeezes.” 

Institutional volume is the majority of daily GME volume, not retail. Retail isn’t doing anything to hedge funds besides giving them more and more money on that one. 

AMC lacks the float and the share distribution to “short squeeze” in any real way. What you’re seeing is just regular buy/sell traffic and the occasional tweak to get you to buy more. 

Both have a retail buy/sell ratio that says retail holders (specifically) are running for the exits and getting other people to hold their bags. 

Institutional is under zero pressure from any of this. Unless the pressure is “where do we put all this money they’re giving us?” 

This is all page 1 stock info. Go look for yourself."

2021-05-29 03:25:40,wallstreetbets,WSB does not have a place for AMC stock. Your in the wrong subreddit.
2021-05-29 06:22:26,wallstreetbets,"Bought £230 amc at $10 and sold just before the market closed for the weekend. Made £300. That’s good enough for me. Don’t be greedy if you’ve made a profit, you’ll get shafted otherwise"
2021-05-29 07:10:09,wallstreetbets,My god. Do the movie stock people actually think they are anywhere near the same situation as GME? Jfc. That’s a Hf play for sure. Y’all gave them billions on Friday. Buy GME and stop funding our nemesis please.
2021-05-28 20:11:14,wallstreetbets,What did y’all do to. NOK
2021-05-28 20:58:02,wallstreetbets,Let's meme it up this weekend!

2021-05-28 22:34:42,wallstreetbets,"Buy NNDM it has 110% shorts float as of 5/15/21 and priced at 7.10, if we buy with huge volume next week it will cause bigger short squeeze compared to AMC. Good Luck!"
2021-05-28 23:57:02,wallstreetbets,500+ next week its coming
2021-05-29 00:25:05,wallstreetbets,"Opinion: I don't think that GME will break 300 again. Wall Street shut down trading when it did last time and nothing is stopping them from doing it again. If by some miracle it does go to the moon, it will simultaneously kill the market and the dollar. With that said, it's a great stock to day trade on where you can easily make a minimum of 120% of your overall investment every day on average with very little risk given the situation."
2021-05-29 01:58:46,wallstreetbets,Or hold for my dumbass that bought in at $31
2021-05-28 23:37:53,wallstreetbets,💎
2021-05-29 07:51:05,wallstreetbets,I'm holding AMC but I'm nervous as hell. This is week 3 of investing for me and it's my first chance at at short squeeze. Is AMC really going to keep raising after the holiday?

2021-05-28 21:54:43,wallstreetbets,"I especially hate it when people argue that x blockbuster movie really sucks and asks ""WHY DO THEY KEEP MAKING THESE!?!"". Then they see the movie in the theater and still go ""yeah it's a really really bad movie."" But guess what, you, and millions of others, went to see that movie regardless 8f it was bad or not

2021-05-28 20:12:17,wallstreetbets,Your past comments said you have 1500 @ 10.40 and will sell at 20$. So I think you got 20k profit roughly which is pennies.

2021-05-29 10:11:13,wallstreetbets,Hey I'm new to this also...I lost alot of money but I am now making money with amc..I am officially in the green up 1000 bucks..but what I can tell you is that when I first started I bought into stocks because they were what people were talking about...not because I did my research on them..the best way to invest is by having patience and due diligence..do your homework before anything on the company you want to invest in..do not just jump in because it's popular..look at how the price is moving...look at the history...then look at the news regarding said stock...what is the company doing...what do they have planned..wait for the price to go down before buying in..its like shopping...you buy things you like when they are on sale...dont get involved in too many stocks for now..pick 3 to 5 the most...and keep your eye on them..and sell when you feel comfortable..SET your limits..sometimes we get so busy and lose out because we didn't notice a stock dropping or going up...YouTube can help alot in learning how to set your stop loss/take profit tool...lots of help on youtube...and never feel shy about asking questions...there are lots of good people willing to help newcomers..I hope I was able to help...again..keep your eye on your investments..as far as amc goes...I will hold no matter what...do your homework on amc...lots of things are happening..once in a lifetime things..be patient...we are not going to get rich over night...Feel free to hit me up whenever...take care and good luck

2021-05-29 10:15:51,wallstreetbets,"Ouch, I had to let that sink in for a minute.
There isn't no middle class, but it's rapidly shrinking. I mean there's always a need for doctors and lawyers, but that ain't what it used to be.
Working professionals are losing the big picture game to inflation. My biggest fear is ending up married to a business that I don't even own. On the other side smaller businesses have to pay out near boss level wages to keep their talented employes around, that ain't sustainable. Also, labor unions are a whole other f'd up ballgame.
I'm just going to end this rant here, if I really knew what was going on with the dragon level wealth hoarding I wouldn't be headed back to work next week."
2021-05-29 10:04:56,wallstreetbets,And it’s going to be much worse with a dose of super inflation this year
2021-05-28 22:37:09,wallstreetbets,If that means 10k amc I'd still take that! Especially with 4255 shares at 13.57. That's 42mill! Still holding. Let's go! 🚀🚀🚀💎🤚💹
2021-05-28 22:30:38,wallstreetbets,"I did the same at 260. Rode out negative 6k profit. Sold at break even. Then i retarded back in at 140 🤘 learned what a margin call was, had to throw money into my account and get rid of margin. What a ride. I thought the stock market was boring lol"

2021-05-29 10:06:20,wallstreetbets,"Considering the size of this like-minded ape community I’d say we are in good shape. I’m planning to hold patiently. As far as the return, I’m optimistic the short squeeze will stabilize at $26ish and then we should see another big jump :)
Per HF, GameStop shouldn’t be valued more than a couple bucks soooo AMC should slingshot if we stick together"

2021-05-28 20:22:28,wallstreetbets,"You think short sellers can just drop the price like this with the insane volume on AMC?

More likely institutions helped drive this up and are taking profits. There are tons of retailers and institutions alike buying and selling at all levels. The diamond handers are nowhere near a majority but they do propel these huge pop events we're seeing as the frenzy to buy and cover hits and there are fewer shares to go around. My perspective anyhow."

2021-05-29 08:51:12,wallstreetbets,At least on Fidelity it is impossible to short AMC any more.  GME has like 300k+ shares available to short

2021-05-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL & $TLRY Potential What up peeps. I want to cover two tickers here, $SNDL which currently meets the sidebar rules with today's move. 1.6B market cap and is trading above $1. I get it mods, you gonna mod but I'll keep writing. The other is the infamous $TLRY.   


The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there."

With assets, employees, and systems i believe it is massively undervalued $SNDL imagine how apeshit the hype machine would go if tilray or cgc said they are debt free, had a billion in the bank, formed a banking/ investing joint venture and possible spac, AND bought 90 stores soon to be 120 by years end? Then sprinkle in any of their ceos being able to match their sales output with realized capital gains and interest fees from lending.... Enough of this sundial has poor fundamentals shit. We have the beat fundamentals in Canada maybe the world and folks won't know about it til YOU tell them. Dont sell them a squeeze. Sell them the Swiss Army knife that is sundial growers. Super

2021-05-28 21:05:17,wallstreetbets,I have SNDL and Aurora (ACB). Aurora is currently the top 5 shorted stock in the market. They are calling a short squeeze next week.

Yessir 😂"
2021-05-29 09:51:02,wallstreetbets,"Honestly bud.... You own enough that I would just sell a couple at a time until you get the hang of it. Your loss risk is low that way. you can feel out how selling covered calls work. Then once you understand how to do it scale up. I mean if you invested 2500$ initially you could potentially double it on the run up selling covered calls and then sell an at the money leap when you've had enough... That atm leap adds time cost to your investment. A 1$ strike leap has .42 contract cost currently. That's 42$ x 50 contracts for a total of 2100$. That's just contract premium. Then if your average was .50¢ you made an additional 2500$ profit when they exercise. So In this scenario you  would have taken 2500$ investment and doubled it on the way up selling bi monthly covered calls, then made another 2100 in premiums selling an ATM leap to close, and to top it off assigned for a total of
5000$. So a grand total of 9600$ essentially gaining a fucking 4 bagger. 7100$ profit on a 2500$ investment. 

Worth a look bud. And who knows... This could save your ass from a bad investment one of these days."

1. Thou shall always take 100% daily gains or 200% all time gains.
2. Do not fall into temptation and buy during the first 30 minutes of market open. (Selling positions is still permitted)
3. Thou shall not buy calls on green days.
4. Thou shall not buy puts on red days.
5. Avoid greed and do not buy consecutive options on 1 company.
6. Give thyself at least 3 weeks time to play the option.
7. End your suffering and sell if down 50% all time on an option play.
8. Avoid gluttony and do not day trade options. (Unless it interferes with #1 and #7, Swing trades allowed)
9. Be fruitful, multiply earnings and sell covered calls if holding any.
10. Celebrate and binge drink after big gains (or losses)"

I fully admit I have no idea what I'm doing. Went and bought a put option on AMC at $25 around 10:00. Probably going to get creamed, but I figured AMC went up a bit too fast, and I got to ride it up. It's a June 18, so it'll have a couple of weeks soaking time. I'm considering it tuition. I learn by doing. Most I'm out is $610.

I did notice later today that it had a lot of volume at that price, so we'll see. I have no idea where I would see profit on it. Again, I learn by doing, so...

...BTW if it pays off, I'm buying more AMC with it."

#2 some stocks have a history of gapping up from 9:30 to 10  and then trading flat or falling the rest of the day.

Some of my best trades have been seeing high volume at open and saying okay this is a buy day or sell day and then closing half hr later.

#3 sometimes you see a stock go completely vertical with no idea why, buying calls as soon as you see that is a good idea. Don't wait, just do it. Then go read the news and find out why it popped. You won't beat the algo's if you waste time.

#4 same thing but in reverse.

Disagree with #8 too. It's not for the faint of heart though and don't do it unless it's near a resistance support line."

I'm a primate who sold 50 GME short at 234.08 on Thursday last.  Back into money by the end of Friday.  Made 6249 so far since 2/25 on GME!

2021-05-29 14:24:30,wallstreetbets,Yes lesson learned. I closed my calls option the on the 25th and missed out on the gains. So I paid my $12k tuition for the mistake.

2021-05-28 21:58:41,wallstreetbets,"Shares are just one form of collateral. A call option gives you the option to buy the underlying at a certain price, so you can sell a call against that at any higher strike price. In this case your bought call becomes collateral for your sold call. Obviously this limits how much you can make from your option, but can be a useful strategy; to hedge your risk for normal people, and to avoid DT rules for us degenerates."

2021-05-28 21:28:39,wallstreetbets,So it's ok to make super risky bets with a lot of money but not with a little? I'm pretty retarded but that's not making a lot of sense
2021-05-28 23:42:28,wallstreetbets,"Yes, 25 grand and margin borrowing."
2021-05-29 12:14:39,wallstreetbets,"Read my other response, but yes you can just resell the call because you don’t hold the obligation to sell shares. Whoever initially opened the contract does.


When you buy a call, generally what that means is that someone with 100 shares of the stock is selling it to you. Once you sell it, they’re then obligated to sell their shares to whoever buys it from you. Options are fungible so it doesn’t really matter who specifically the buyer and seller are for a given contract.

Edit: look up Kamikaze Cash’s theta gang tutorial on YouTube, he does a pretty good job of explaining it"
2021-05-29 12:11:41,wallstreetbets,"Call options are a contract between you and whoever originally sold it, whether they were a market maker or a trader. You pay them the price of the option as premium in exchange for the contract to buy 100 shares at the strike by the expiration.

Options have intrinsic and extrinsic value. Intrinsic value is what they’re worth if immediately exercised, so only ITM calls have intrinsic value. Extrinsic value is calculated using the Greeks, with Delta determining the amount by which the value of the option changes based on the price of the underlying, gamma is the first derivative of delta, theta tells you how much value the call loses every day before expiry, and Vega tells you the option’s sensitivity to IV (which you can also see in the options chain). Delta and theta are the most important by far.

If you resell your call, the person you originally bought it from is now obligated to sell shares to the person you sell it to. The buying end of the contract has changed, but the selling end is the same."
2021-05-28 22:38:12,wallstreetbets,I could have sworn I sold a 0dte option (put credit spread) that turned against me at one point and I didn’t get the PDT flag. Maybe I was mistaken.

2021-05-29 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"SPDR FTDs jumped to 500k on April 30th up from 130k the day before Are they short attacking the SPDR? Im not sure what exactly this points to, scientist of rockets I am not. But my smooth brain could be forming a bump? Why would the FTDs jump to 526,000 on 2021-04-30 up from 130,000 the day before? Maybe someone who is superior in that sweet sweet knowledge of these matters could help explain this.

EDIT: I cant post the link because it got the previous post removed as spam? hell I dont know. But its on the fintel website, look up SPY and go to the Short Interest tab and down to the FTD section.

EDIT 2: Probably HFT and Limit Orders being hit once the price reached 420, I could see that.

EDIT 3: short attacking isn’t the right term, Smooth Bain typed it too fast. Obviously a short attack isn’t the case. I definitely think it’s hitting the nice round number at 420 **giggles**. What’s fascinating though is the more research and reading I do the more I’m realizing the sheer amount of data available to us. This is what I take from this honestly. Read, research, can’t stop won’t stop, something something. Knowledge is power.

Seriously, I’m surprised no one has picked up on this before. I followed his advice once and only once I lost £15 and was quite angry, but I did invest in a company he was hammering (virgin) and made a chunk. From that day I just do the opposite of what the cretin says. When he says sell I buy when he says buy I run in the opposite direction.

I would not call it a cult. That’s just dumb. They did the same shit with CrossFit. What because people enjoy something that’s exclusive it’s a cult? Absolutely not. It just sounds like you’re gatekeeping fitness. Now if all the members started committing murders in the name of Emma Lovewell or mass suicides because Cody Rigsby told them to we can have a serious debate. Until then, I think the whole cult thing is overblown and needless gatekeeping."

But yeah i see value in peloton since they’re growing in emerging markets and Asia but also skeptical. Over values for now until I see better expansion in those markets

2021-05-28 21:21:02,wallstreetbets,Big hedges are in this time pushing price advise take profit got a feeling they’ll sell all at once probably trying to recoup what they lost in squeeze. Check who owns shares for yourself  minimum verify yourself who’s buying big chunks! And good luck

2021-05-28 23:15:59,wallstreetbets,If you are thinking about doing option go ahead and paper trade. It's easier to stumic paper money being lost over your hard earned money. I know first hand. Even after paper trading and moving to the real thing you can easily fat finger a nakef put sell. Realize right after to lose $100 for a mistake. I wouldn't know anything about that though....

2021-05-28 23:26:06,wallstreetbets,The key is repetition when your learning something new. A few get things mostly the 1st time. Most of us including me need repetition to get something. Basic call options are fairly easy once you see it. The explanation here he gave was excellent.
2021-05-28 23:35:50,wallstreetbets,Best explanation yet
2021-05-28 23:36:01,wallstreetbets,2 more weeks of this and you'll be a millionaire!!

2021-05-29 13:40:20,wallstreetbets,"If you're totally confused by calls and puts - try [investopedia.com](https://investopedia.com)

You can look up topics by word, and they have articles on everything. Some are a bit  difficult to read, but if you want to know, hang in there, (hell, draw yourself diagrams, set up a fake trading account) look around other places, ask other people

.. it's not **the way it works** that is really difficult .. in fact it's really pretty easy to understand how it works - that's the problem.

It's you **doing it right at the right time, making the right decision** so you don't lose your underwear.. THAT'S what it's about. THAT'S the difficulty.

It is hell of an easy to lose your underwear, or your testicles, or whatever you had yesterday.. So if this kind of trading tempts you - THINK ABOUT IT A LOT FIRST.

2021-05-29 10:32:14,wallstreetbets,"Great job......simply awesome.......Options can be such a tricky thing and I had many times that the price of the underlying share went up significantly and the value of my option went down and I lost my entire investment as the volatility changed and the Delta ate up all the gains........So nice to see someone make a nice profit........I learned that the key to options is ............make sure you buy at low volatility, high volume and I usually don't hold too long to make sure the greeks don't eat my profit.......If I expect a big price movement, I buy way out of the money as the gains are so much better........also carries a much bigger risk.......there is a great website (https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com)    it calculates pretty accurately your profits when buying options"

2021-05-28 21:16:22,wallstreetbets,.... I think I finally get it!!! Holy crap. Thank you!! Now I know an ever better way to lose my money quicker. Now to go play with Options!
2021-05-28 21:31:19,wallstreetbets,Where you get 17c from! And what’s c?
2021-05-28 21:36:59,wallstreetbets,What does 17c mean?
2021-05-28 21:39:27,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the information. So right now AMC is at 26.12. If I bought call with a strike of $28 and the stock jumps to $35 that’s in the money correct and I must sell the contractors before they expire right
2021-05-28 21:39:32,wallstreetbets,"It looks like the contracts were 59 cents each, not 0.59 cents each."
2021-05-28 21:41:46,wallstreetbets,Thank you sir this made it a lot easier to understand
2021-05-28 21:43:19,wallstreetbets,Don’t you have to have enough money to cover 100 shares¿
2021-05-28 21:43:50,wallstreetbets,Question- as a guy that hasn't followed AMC's pricing at all.  Did he need collateral for those 1800 contracts? How was the contracts so inexpensive? I don't think it was ever into the 0.xx right?
2021-05-28 21:51:02,wallstreetbets,Thank you old holey wrinkly brain!  Us smooth brains are happy to see this!
2021-05-28 21:51:36,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for the explanation it helps a lot. But then how do you actually purchase the options? My only options are to buy or sell, I don't have an option, option."
2021-05-28 21:57:05,wallstreetbets,Oddly enough I learned options this week and made a profit. It wasn’t as scary after a little research
2021-05-28 22:00:12,wallstreetbets,How do you by contracts for .59 cents when the stock is trading for  $30 something dollars?
2021-05-28 22:09:29,wallstreetbets,Why did you multiply the amount of contracts by 100 instead of the price of the contracts 😂
2021-05-28 22:13:55,wallstreetbets,Got it I’m buying my first contract this Monday YOLO
2021-05-28 22:14:30,wallstreetbets,"You must have explained that poorly because now I'm more confused, makes no sense at all"
2021-05-28 22:17:29,wallstreetbets,Options are simple 1 box of crayons = 100 crayons those crayons can be red or green eat enough crayons and you might have a big giant crayon shit
2021-05-28 22:28:38,wallstreetbets,Dude listed as a mod!
2021-05-28 22:29:17,wallstreetbets,"But he has to have the money to buy the contracts at the end right? Like he has to have 30k to buy the 18 contracts, and since those contracts are worth 50k+, he makes 20k+ instantly?"
2021-05-28 22:29:22,wallstreetbets,He made 28k on 1000? Where the fuck do I learn how to do this??????????????
2021-05-28 22:30:56,wallstreetbets,I don’t get how do they work?
2021-05-28 22:31:35,wallstreetbets,Never seen any options on Monday for that cheap though. What am I missing.59 cents x100 was way more per call for me on Monday
2021-05-28 22:41:11,wallstreetbets,"As someone learning, I'm not up to speed on all the shorthand yet ... what's the 17C? $17 strike price at the time of buying the call option?"
2021-05-28 22:44:09,wallstreetbets,This is probably the best explanation i ever got. Thanks bro!
2021-05-28 23:03:57,wallstreetbets,Thank you for explaining. I have been watching videos on this very topic. My lingering question was about how to calculate earnings. This was great!!
2021-05-28 23:07:42,wallstreetbets,Worst eli5 I’ve ever read in my life
2021-05-28 23:14:49,wallstreetbets,Still don't get it
2021-05-28 23:56:19,wallstreetbets,Sent you a dm asking a question cus im a moron
2021-05-28 23:58:01,wallstreetbets,"Hello sir…so 14 day call options were purchased correct? Also, what duration do you recommend? Trying to find that balance between premium cost and time decay. To the extent possible, it’d be nice to have the opportunity to sell options back into the market before expiration to recoup initial investment."
2021-05-29 00:07:00,wallstreetbets,How does $33 - $0.17 = 16?
2021-05-29 00:16:17,wallstreetbets,Where can I buy contracts? Is it on trading apps? I’ve never invested into the market & would like to start my journey in this contract business - would love any help
2021-05-29 00:33:24,wallstreetbets,Were 17c on monday that cheap this week? $59 per contract?
2021-05-29 01:01:25,wallstreetbets,Do you simply wait for the expiration date and the transaction concludes all by itself if you're in the profit? Or do you absolutely need to do a trade (sell the options before the expiration date) to conclude the deal and cash in the profits?
2021-05-29 01:06:51,wallstreetbets,Im trying to learn
2021-05-29 01:09:52,wallstreetbets,Ok
2021-05-29 01:28:48,wallstreetbets,"But in order to exercise this call, wouldn’t he need ($17 * 1800) in capital? I get he’d immediately sell it but wouldn’t he need the capital to foot the bill first? Or are there services that would just pay out the profit ($33-$17)*1800 to you?"
2021-05-29 01:36:55,wallstreetbets,Okay but the price shown in the picture is $17? Why does it already show as if it was $33? I'm just a primitive ape trying to learn😁
2021-05-29 01:58:58,wallstreetbets,Thank you for explaining g.  I’m trying to learn about all this right now
2021-05-29 01:59:19,wallstreetbets,"So he pays 1k to exercise and can make 25k. So how much does he pay to exercise? Thats the part I don't get. Does he just get to have the shares for the new price at the 17 price he paid originally? So does he just exercise, then sell those shares at the new price and make 25k when he sells them?"
2021-05-29 02:04:51,wallstreetbets,"I've made 10's of thousands of dollars just selling puts & then immediately around and sell the covered calls. Pick up .50+ cents a share Xs 1,000 & turn & burn em for 10 or 15+% is sweet pickin's. I prefer to stick w/ 1K at a time & trade options on 3 or 4 companies at a time. I base my entry & exits on Relative strength primarily. I dont over complicate it & its fairly is easy to learn, but similar to chess in mastering. After 15+ years investing on buy & hold forever strategy, I found trading stocks & the options can be very rewarding. It's def worth learning, So is chess. Full disclosure... I did get to trigger happy on $RIDE in the mid 20's & then got struck down 50+%. So it certainly comes w/ some risk, but what doesn't. Peace!"
2021-05-29 02:29:50,wallstreetbets,Just explain to them how selling and simple spreads work. Probabilities of earning profits by buying options are lot less even considering the unlimited profit potential. If they can afford the collateral its always better to sell and wait for the theta to do its magic.
2021-05-29 03:08:31,wallstreetbets,"just commenting to review later for reference, thanks!"
2021-05-29 03:35:27,wallstreetbets,"Looking at this specific case, would you need the liquidity to actually buy the 1800 shares at 17? Because if you just sell the contract it will only net you the premium values right? Sorry if Im Looking at it wrong."
2021-05-29 03:48:48,wallstreetbets,This would make a great dd for the newbies and aa great refresher and reference for everyone xxx
2021-05-29 03:49:30,wallstreetbets,"Effn lousy explanation 
You have to do it in a ELI5 scenario…"
2021-05-29 04:03:04,wallstreetbets,Thank apes.
2021-05-29 04:06:04,wallstreetbets,"Still i do not understand... unninstalling trading apps in 3..2...1....

I think options are not for me, with normal trading since jan 2021 i made 35%.

Prob is a shit compared with some posts here but i am still happy.

2021-05-29 11:08:38,wallstreetbets,Don’t you have to prove to your broker you kind of know what your doing going?  When I looked it up with Schwab it was intimidating as hell.  I’m an ape I have no idea what I’m doing

I have been using Robinhood, bought AMC. 

Is this calls and puts using some kind of platform that can be downloaded and then be used ! 

If someone can explain as what to install and how to begin with calls and puts system? 

I’ll appreciate. 
Thanks"
2021-05-29 14:24:11,wallstreetbets,"thank you ive been trying to understand it , my wife asked me about them last night and I sure could not explain them well at all"

2021-05-29 16:14:57,wallstreetbets,Bought or sold contracts ?
2021-05-29 16:46:47,wallstreetbets,"At that point do you sell, exercise, or let it expire?"

Sorry if you have answered something like this before. I feel like I'm finally about to understand how selling calls is profitable compared to exercising them."
2021-05-29 03:02:03,wallstreetbets,Then buy double the amount of AMC ;)
2021-05-28 23:36:47,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-29 11:31:17,wallstreetbets,Closed the whole thing actually at a little higher than the screenshot :)
2021-05-29 11:03:17,wallstreetbets,That I did
2021-05-28 23:09:57,wallstreetbets,"Most likely sell the contract. If you're very close to the expiration date or you're deep ITM, the extrinsic value of the option is very little compared to the intrinsic value. Here that is not the case because of the high implied volatility (lots of value) so you're better off selling the contract."
2021-05-29 05:58:36,wallstreetbets,It is a good stock 🤔
2021-05-29 11:02:54,wallstreetbets,Yes sir
2021-05-29 11:30:21,wallstreetbets,Lol read the thread fully and you'll see what price I closed out at
2021-05-28 20:24:56,wallstreetbets,"how do you screenshot your trade details that show your profit/loss gain? On the executions tab on Questtrade, it just shows value of total investment when closed and doesnt include the actual profit/loss you closed at."
2021-05-28 20:58:48,wallstreetbets,You bought calls? Or sold them
2021-05-29 16:19:54,wallstreetbets,How much did you actually profit

2021-05-28 22:05:09,wallstreetbets,Jannies are grouch.
2021-05-29 11:10:14,wallstreetbets,"I have made money by owning options that did not change much in price but the volatility went up and lost a lot of money the same way. I also had options where the stock went up every day but the profits were eaten up by Theta. If you buy options it is so very important that you know the greeks as you will lose all your money if you don't pay attention to the greeks. 

Here is a broken-down list of the greeks and I wrote next to each greek how I remember them quickly.  Delta, Theta, and Vega have the most impact.

Delta - (Days left + change in the value of your underlying stock combined) Delta is the amount the option goes up or down as the price goes up or down of the stock.  
The rule of thumb is an at-the-money option has a delta of 0.50. That means if the stock goes up by $1, the option goes up by 50cents when the option is at the money (meaning your option is the same as the current stock value) It is very important to understand delta is not fixed. It is a function of the underlying stock price and the time remaining until expiration. As an option moves further into-the-money and time decays, the delta increases at an accelerated rate. Conversely, as an option moves further out-of-the money and has more time remaining, delta decreases at a slower rate. So on a Friday shortly before 4:00PM an option at or in the money will move up much quicker almost double than an option at the same strike price that is 4 months out.  
Theta- (Time - This is the cost per day for owning the option/fixed amount)  
is the expected percentage change in an option's price for a one-unit change in time. Options are decaying assets in that their value decreases as time passes. Theta, or time decay, is not influenced by any of the other variables but is defined on a slope. That is, it accelerates as expiration approaches.  
Vega - Volatility  
 is the expected change in an option's value for a one-unit move in implied volatility. Again, the strict formula is defined as a 1% move, but for practical purposes, it will typically be expressed in dollars per one-point move. For example, if a call currently implied volatility of 25% and a vega of 0.30. If implied, volatility increased to 26% the value of the call would increase from 30c to $10.30, even if the underlying share price didn’t change.  
Gamma is the rate of change in an option's delta for every one-unit change in the price of the underlying. As such, it is a derivative of a derivative (a second derivative) and moves in minuscule increments.  
Rho is the expected change in an option's price for every one-unit change in interest rates. With rates near zero and not going much higher for the foreseeable future, this will not have much of an impact on options pricing.ng.g..

2021-05-28 21:17:42,wallstreetbets,"Like I'm researching, I just don't quite get how buying options is ""safer"" than outright buying stocks just yet. And then there's puts. So like it gives you the opportunity to buy a stock but ONLY if it's set to make you money..?

I thought I was buying into a re-opening stock. Seriously! A re-opening stock! At the least, I just walked into a wall of money. At the most, I just discovered the necessity for understanding all the parts that go into this shit. So, hey, Actually-Yo-Momma, I don't know a thing about options, but damn it, I'm gonna learn!

2021-05-29 01:48:31,wallstreetbets,Delta being at .70 meant you bought deep in the money. This is generally a safer call as it is more likely to expire in the money but it gives you greater exposure to the underlying’s volatility.
2021-05-29 13:49:55,wallstreetbets,Pagan...How many contracts did you purchase at each strike? I'm looking to buy on Monday. Which strike would you choose? Asking for a fellow ape that just likes the stock. 😉

>You can either exercise the option (so for a call, choose to purhcase the stock) which means you need 100 \* Strike Price to buy them....then you can sell the stock to make your money or you can sell the contract directly to someone else.


Here's where I get confused - say I have a single contract (100 shares) at $100 share, it's in the money on the strike date at $120, but I don't have the $10k to actually purchase the stock option- what then?"
2021-05-28 21:40:15,wallstreetbets,What about when we fling poo?
2021-05-28 21:22:43,wallstreetbets,Ok I get it. So the above example did he sell the contract or did he exercise his option. Second if you excessive the option do you have to have the money to purchase stock in your account. Or can you sell it at market value and keep the difference
2021-05-28 23:11:52,wallstreetbets,"But if the price doesn’t hit 17$ by the expiration, can you lose more than the premium you bought that call for?"
2021-05-29 02:07:02,wallstreetbets,Can’t you sell that contract if it doesn’t reach the strike price at a loss instead of letting it expire worthless? Is it not possible to get any of the premium back?
2021-05-28 20:31:22,wallstreetbets,Thank you for responding. I think I got certain things confused.
2021-05-28 21:43:25,wallstreetbets,"You do the math. If the contracts cost less than a penny each, he would have to have bought 100 times as many to invest $1,000."
2021-05-28 21:47:58,wallstreetbets,"Do you mean $33?

So you're saying his contact was inexpensive because it only cleared if he hit the $33 threshold? So how much would it cost to lower the bar some? Is there an equation to determine that or???"
2021-05-28 22:42:20,wallstreetbets,"So if he doesn't exercise how does he make the money? Can he sell them to someone else? 

Say he doesn't have the money to exercise the contracts. They're worth 25k, so can someone who does have the money to exercise just buy them from him for a lower price and then cash in?"

My wife's boyfriend is gonna find this hilarious.
2021-05-29 01:16:22,wallstreetbets,Call vs Puts. Calls are you are bullish and think it will go 📈 in price. Puts are bearish and think the stock will go 📉 in price. Wrote this in less then 5 minutes drunk 🤷‍♂️
2021-05-28 23:34:56,wallstreetbets,"For buying a basic call like this yeah thats how it is.

Why does executing that option not actually generate a profit? Just what the hell is the point of these things?

Its why these contracts have such huge returns because of the far otm play(cheap options), intrinsic value when it breaks out, and IV spike (the premiums moving up even if the stock price stays the same)."
2021-05-29 16:51:50,wallstreetbets,"Options are offered in weekly, monthly and yearly offerings. I'm not great at choosing which to buy. But in general I see options like I'm casting a net. The fish I'm trying to catch is volatility. So if you believe a stock will spike up in the next couple of weeks then buy an call that's 3 weeks out. The sooner the upward movement the more you make. If you have to wait for week 3 then your play might just be to make back your initial investment. But if it happens in week 1 then you can 5x your initial investment. This is just my mindset, I'm sure some one will pick apart my strategy. But it seems to work for me more often than not. I am a wimp and usually sell my calls at around a break even price. But these meme stocks are easy to predict - so they are an options traders wet dream."

2021-05-29 07:40:57,wallstreetbets,The price of the option is not the same thing as the share price. It's the premium you pay for the contract. The strike price of the option is what you would pay for the stock should you choose to exercise the option to buy (for example in a call option) you would only exercise the option if it's in the money. No matter what you pay the premium for the contract so at most you'll lose that amount (when buying options that is).
2021-05-29 00:42:29,wallstreetbets,Did you think AMC would hit 17+ by the end of next Friday by the way it was trading. That’s why.. and I wish I bought too.
2021-05-29 07:09:18,wallstreetbets,"That is $59 per option contract.  The $59 does not pay for the 100 shares; that comes later if you decide to execute the contract and not sell it before expiration.  The $59 you pay for the option contract only gives you the option to buy 100 shares at the strike price per share if you decide to execute it.  Most people don’t execute, they sell before expiration, if it’s in the money.  If it’s not, you loose the price you paid for the contract, $59."
2021-05-29 09:33:22,wallstreetbets,".59 is just the premium. If you actually want to own the shares, you still have to buy them at the strike price. Remember you need to sell the option, or exercise your option. Your broker will likely exercise them automatically but you’ll only own them if you can cover 1800 x 17."

2021-05-29 13:53:24,wallstreetbets,"So… Finally applied for options trading on webull. So higher the IV, the more expensive contracts are? The closer to expiration date, the less it’s worth? So if were to buy a $35 call and AMC goes to $40.50 on Friday, then selling my contract would net me $727 in profit? According to conditions I entered? http://opcalc.com/vkh Oh it goes to $15 and basically lose it all. 

So guess best time to enter is with low IV and a further out contract when you expect the price to go up when buying calls?"

And selling a 17C when the stock price is let's say reaches $33  would give out close to $1600 (=33-17\*100) in premiums?  
I don't know how options are priced exactly, but I'm guessing the IV heavily affects it as well.

2021-05-29 12:56:26,wallstreetbets,"\- and you lose it if you don't buy - it's the price you pay to have the option.

This guy put out 1062 dollars (gone forever, whatever happens) to **buy** his options.  
He bought 18 **contracts =** standard bundle of 100 shares per contract. The **option** is priced at 0.59 per share = 59 dollars per contract)

When he has the contract in his hands, he can decide to buy the shares at the strike price set in the contract, or not buy them.. or even sell on the contract to someone else.   
He can do any of those things before the expiry date of the contract. If he doesn't do anything before the expiry date, whoever had the shares when he took out the option on them, keeps the shares - **and** keeps the money he paid for the option.

In this case he did well to buy these options .. definitely"
2021-05-29 00:45:37,wallstreetbets,"No but it has been steadily around $8, so just considering that"
2021-05-29 13:01:38,wallstreetbets,"\- good point! - if you sell on the option you also recover the contract price - in this case that's $1000. Damn! Jeez  I don't sell on enough, I like to stay simple. It's a weakness."
2021-05-29 08:15:03,wallstreetbets,"> lose an unlimited amount

That's an EXTREME case though. If you sell a put, then the stock goes from $100 down to $0...then yes you lost an ""unlimited"" amount. 

But as long as you are trading decent stocks, your risk of massive losses is actually minimal. If you get assigned, just flip and sell calls on them. No matter what you will have something to show for your money in the end. Either the premium or 100 stocks. It's a tedious way to make steady money but it works.

When you buy options you have a great chance of losing 100% of your money with nothing to show after. This is the ""get rich quick"" strategy which burns way more people than it makes rich."
2021-05-29 01:25:34,wallstreetbets,"It depends on if the call or put is naked or covered.  If I sell a single call and I actually own 100 shares of that stock, then it's a covered call so at most I can lose my shares if I get assigned.  If I sell a single put and have enough cash to pay for 100 shares at the strike then I'm out at most the cost of 100 shares of stock at the strike of the put.  However, if I sell a call and do NOT have 100 shares of the stock and then I get assigned, I have to pull 100 shares out of my ass somehow which means I have to go buy them at any price and thus there is unlimited loss potential."
2021-05-29 01:22:09,wallstreetbets,Totally understand why one would just think it's over if you're on a margin!

Once you are comfortable using it then you can switch over to the real thing. That would be my advice anyway"

Do your ZEN .. wtf .. it''s only money, if it ain't there any more  you can walk away and go play with the cat.

IMO -It's a great idea to have a notebook, keep it up to date, know what you are doing and why,  AND have your objectives and prices today taped to one of the screens.. so you don't like ""accidentally"" forget the target when you get excited.

2021-05-29 17:11:02,wallstreetbets,If you have any value in the option on the last day brokers will close it out. Like RH closes your trade with an hour to go. But it is better to close it yourself. If you have a winning trade you usually don’t wait until The last day because theta is kicking your ass. Check my profile there is a newb guide that I wrote.
2021-05-28 20:17:32,wallstreetbets,Nope look at the average price

2021-05-29 15:23:18,wallstreetbets,"Depends on if you don’t mind losing all of your money. If you are just starting to invest I’d get shares. Maybe one call if you want the rush. But could blow up. I wrote the following to another person. He had 1,500 to invest. 
————————-
Dude buy shares if this is all your money. And don’t put it all in at once. Average in.

If you have tons of other stocks and 1,500 go for it have fun.

Later this weekend I will post something about what happened to BB on Friday. Some apes for wrecked buying calls. Like they lost 75 percent of the value in hours.  I am posting it to help newbs. As you can see from my flair.

Profit is profit. Don’t let these stories make you greedy. For every success story there are 100 dudes that get blown out. If you want to trade for a while you need to survive the ups and downs.

If you are trying options and have no idea read this.

2021-05-28 20:47:12,wallstreetbets,Shoulda averaged down when it went down to like $8
2021-05-28 23:56:15,wallstreetbets,"No one can really predict the future. I also bought near that range, around $12 to $13. Almost even. I think that’s why it was up a lot then fell by end of the day - people likely selling at break even. This is a very volatile stock, like a lotto ticket - it could fall 30% or more and it could also be up 30% or more. Roll of the dice."

2021-05-29 19:28:10,wallstreetbets,Hang in there. Can always sell more calls and your average cost isn’t so far away from the current share price. I do hope it hits 30 though!
2021-05-28 23:27:37,wallstreetbets,"Well. Compare to the other stocks, and bb still cheaper then others. BB makes security software for EV cars-ATM-hospital, so that’s why I bought BB. I see the potential of it!"
2021-05-29 16:03:59,wallstreetbets,Some meme but it is a real company that has a future.

2021-05-29 11:06:48,wallstreetbets,Mainly because I’m to dumb to understand them but if the hedge funds can lose billions then I’m sure I’d lose my investment.
2021-05-29 17:07:40,wallstreetbets,It everything. Look at nvda yesterday. This was a result of amc apes selling and buying bb and that drove it to 12 and FOMO kicked in. Then those amc guys bailed. I’m writing something for newbs as a warning. People who bought calls yesterday around this run to 12.09 got rekt.
2021-05-29 19:51:41,wallstreetbets,Yeah i'll probably just sell them OTM to slowly get that cost basis down. If I get called at a big profit then whatever.

2021-05-29 02:41:09,wallstreetbets,honestly I don't think that is an awful move.    long term I'm very bullish on BB.  I'm not shocked the quarterlies aren't great yet but I like what they're doing.
2021-05-28 20:15:20,wallstreetbets,Just a few more cars Alice and then... To the Moon.

2021-05-29 12:44:50,wallstreetbets,lol you can control whether you place a call (you think the stock will go up) or a put (you think itll go down). If a hedge fund stupidly shorted a stock and the investors collectively raised its value thats the hf’s loss and my gain 🤷‍♀️

2021-05-28 23:56:44,wallstreetbets,"It could also just be a break even or slight loss. I could see them doing that for a deal that would secure large orders of AI driven vehicles in the future. Market share is everything and there are a lot of players on the field.

2021-05-29 00:14:24,wallstreetbets,6/2 . Next wed market close
2021-05-29 07:55:56,wallstreetbets,This should be a 100+ stock within the next 3 months so don’t sell for less than that if you are buying stocks. Options are heavily manipulated though and market is so volatile right now - will depend on if there is a growth stock sell off on the days after earnings due to inflation worries or something else . Should pop to 80 minimum
2021-05-29 01:40:23,wallstreetbets,I saw you post a few weeks back !
2021-05-29 00:17:57,wallstreetbets,For C3 A.I correct? It says 9/9 earnings for Q4 pre market. Where are you getting 6/2??
2021-05-29 00:21:21,wallstreetbets,Lol real question is where  are you getting 9/9 . You need to find better sources . Or check the company investor site
2021-05-29 00:23:39,wallstreetbets,"On Robinhood, I’m not trolling I’m interested in picking up some calls/shares.

2021-05-29 00:10:45,wallstreetbets,Amazon is 100% moving into Healthcare. Whether it's via Riteaid is all speculation at this point
2021-05-29 04:26:45,wallstreetbets,Holy shit the whole RAD fiasco part 2
2021-05-28 23:17:46,wallstreetbets,If Amazon wanted brick and mortar pharmacies why don’t they just stick them in Whole Foods instead of buying out Rite Aid
2021-05-28 23:42:37,wallstreetbets,Whole Foods stores are nowhere near the locations Amazon Pharmacy would need to make a serious play in the big boy Pharmacy sector. Remember they  started Amazon Fresh long before they bought Whole Foods. Amazon Fresh  couldn't compete with Walmart. If I'm not mistaken Amazon paid around $14 Billion for Whole Foods. Whole Foods even today doesn't have anywhere close to RAD's revenue. So to build out the infrastructure of what RAD already has in place would take Amazon many many years and twice the money. Why when could buy the whole operations. Merge them with Amazon Pharmacy and still place them inside Whole Foods. Along with their existing location. Amazon Pharmacy would jump to the number 3 Pharmacy overnight. That's $24 Billion in revenue for $10 Billion with a PBM. This is a no brainer.
2021-05-28 23:59:52,wallstreetbets,"It’s too late for WBA to buy the rest of the Rite Aid...With this Amazon news, institutional investors won’t entertain any kind of lowball offers!"
2021-05-28 20:29:21,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been a medic since 2006 making judgement calls where you hold the ability to bring someone back to life or accidentally killing them is a “judgement call”.  
We push narcotics on people without having a dr to talk to."
2021-05-28 20:44:59,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think you’re understanding me. You have the “right” to push a single dose of narcotics, but when frequent flier comes in weekly with a script for enough norco to put down a pack of elephants 100 times over for an entire month, the pharmacist makes a judgement call not to fill. Even if it’s a valid real script, if he fills his, he could lose his licenses (Atleast in California). 

Not only that, my friends cvs is next to a pain management clinic, so they have to constantly check the state database to see if a patient has already received a max allotment.  

Occasionally I have lunch with him and so I go into his cvs. Every single time he’s been in an argument with one person or another because he refuses to fill a narcotic script. Sometimes it’s because one was filled last week or other times it’s because he feels that the script is fake and doesn’t want to deal with liability. 

On the other hand, you make a judgement call in an emergency situation, that’s what you are trained to do. Give a drug seeker 100 norcos or 10 doses of Dilaudid and let him walk away and see if you’re still a medic in a months time."
2021-05-28 21:01:04,wallstreetbets,Aww man I didn’t realize the bean counters had to check a database that sounds tough bro. I get it your bud argues with people over the phone. I argue with knife yielding meth heads. It’s probably about the same amount of stress. Don’t worry when your friend gives out to much I’ll be there to push the narcan
2021-05-28 21:10:06,wallstreetbets,"Again I guess you don’t understand. Not about treatment. About losing a license. Always on your toes. State board secret shoppers checking if you will fill a purposely suspicious script. FDA busts. It happens more often then you think. It’s like saying you sit around and get paid driving a meat wagon. Half the time the one parked down the street from my house doesn’t move, but I know that job isn’t easy, because when it’s time to go, you’re on your toes to save a life. You wouldn’t get paid what you do if it were easy. Same goes for pharmacy, nurses, and pretty much any support staff in the medical field. They all deal with bs, for some it’s physical, for some it’s mental or emotional. 

Now as for pharm, this is coming from the same friend, retail sucks, especially at cvs. Mail order is a piece a cake, but hard to get. He’s been trying to get a Amazon mail order pharm job for a while, but never makes the cut."
2021-05-28 21:26:12,wallstreetbets,"Sorry but I’ve been to court multiple times and sat before a board my over license review. I’ve been sued twice once because I saved someone’s life go figure. I can lose my license just like your friend. It just sounds nice to sit in an office and count pills all day arguing with patients and doctors over a phone or across a counter. your buddy lifts a phone I lift 500lbs of grandma off the shower floor. And you’re right I might sit on my ass for hours straight day trading and lifting weights. But that’s cause one call could be more work than your bro sees in a month. 

Nobody’s going to win here. In closing your bud can hand out drugs that if used inappropriately could kill people. Unfortunately I give drugs to people running the risk that I might actually kill that person. There’s a big difference in knowing you fucked up and killed someone when you personally have administered the drug. 

Say your peace and have a good night."

But going up 3% yoy is not that big of a deal considering we had deflation due to lockdowns a year ago. If this continues, nobody can deny inflation though."
2021-05-28 22:31:11,wallstreetbets,"hhhhHHhhhhHHhhHHhhhhhhHHhhhhHHhhHHhhhhhhHHhhhhHHhhHHhhhhhhHHhhhhHHhhHHhhhhhhHHhhhhHHhhHHhhhhhhHHhhhhHHhhHHhhhhhhHHhhhhHHhhHHhhhhhhHHhhhhHHhhHHhhhhhhHHhhhhHHhhHHhhhhhhHHhhhhHHhhHHhhhhhhHHhhhhHHhhHHhhhhhhHHhhhhHHhhHHhhhhhhHHhhhhHHhhHHhhhhhhHHhhhhHHhhHHhhhhhhHHhhhhHHhhHHhhhhhhHHhhhhHHhhHHhhhhhhHHhhhhHHhhHHhhhhhhHHhhhhHHhhHHhhhhhhHHhhhhHHhhHHhhhhhhHHhhhhHHhhHHhhhhhhHHhhhhHHhhH

2021-05-29 12:13:43,wallstreetbets,Yea there's already inflation. It's easy to deny until it isn't

2021-05-29 00:47:41,wallstreetbets,Does anyone know how the support and resistance lines are drawn for the second to last photo?

2021-05-29 12:17:28,wallstreetbets,Figured...That’s ok because it was a very small hedge.
2021-05-29 01:42:10,wallstreetbets,I’m guessing it’ll be red in honor of the good news
2021-05-28 20:04:26,wallstreetbets,Decent news. Nothing to write home about
2021-05-28 20:28:08,wallstreetbets,Good news = price dips for PLTR
2021-05-28 23:02:42,wallstreetbets,"So is PLTR the go-to for all government contracts? Basically our government is saying, “never go against PLTR” os that right?"
2021-05-28 20:29:23,wallstreetbets,I cannot wait till this stock actually pops.
2021-05-28 21:03:39,wallstreetbets,YeaaHh boi 100 dollars a share here we come

2021-05-28 22:54:31,wallstreetbets,Wow good news. Stock should go down.

2021-05-28 23:55:39,wallstreetbets,This sounds correct. There is an old adage we used in the military that goes all the way back to WWII:” Always remember that your weapon was made by the lowest bidder.”
2021-05-29 16:39:46,wallstreetbets,"Considering they sued the army to prevent them from blowing a shitload on copycat software, makes sense the fees are low right now."

i think its a bait and switch, as always"

2021-05-29 01:08:17,wallstreetbets,"for all the types of government contracts they deal with, yes. they also have a direct tie or three to the biden administration, and their business is based on retaining/milking existing clients, not in acuiring new ones and doing one-off deals. Can easily become a trillion dollar company."
2021-05-29 01:00:49,wallstreetbets,"we know, and we don't care"

Apparently this is WSB style DD."
2021-05-29 01:02:24,wallstreetbets,that's not what they do at all lmfao
2021-05-29 01:04:01,wallstreetbets,average down and sell CCs you fucking monkey. I've gotta 28 cb down to 22 and plan on getting it to 0
2021-05-29 01:05:45,wallstreetbets,"no we don't, shut up, buy it, hold it for a decade+, sell CCs on it, achieve financial freedom."
2021-05-28 23:02:52,wallstreetbets,What?
2021-05-29 00:54:37,wallstreetbets,"this is how they make their money: through long-term relationships with clients. The least profitable phase of their business model is in the acquisition phase of a new client relationship, and over time, as the client can no longer function without palantir's support, palantir makes more money."
2021-05-29 18:02:16,wallstreetbets,Did they? Hahahaha... Defense contractors sure do love biting the hand that feeds them...
2021-05-29 01:00:16,wallstreetbets,I'm going to retire off pltr. 800 PT in 20 years is conservative if they keep doing what they're doing.
2021-05-29 01:45:58,wallstreetbets,"im a minor, my dad operates my account. he doesnt allow me to buy more pltr because im already all in on it (20k) and he doesnt want us to go banktrupt lololololol"

2021-05-29 02:38:58,wallstreetbets,"Yes but PLTR will still go down, because that's just what it does"
2021-05-28 21:11:23,wallstreetbets,"Also it undercuts the competitors,
Keeping them out of the game longer.
Take a look at Boeing and NASA 
Boeing is shit but government does not care as long as it's short
Term cheap."
2021-05-29 03:30:37,wallstreetbets,SELL. COVERED. CALLS. YOU. FUCKING. MONKEY.
2021-05-29 12:59:08,wallstreetbets,"Everyone is excited about Palantir for gains, but when Skynet goes live and drones start flying into your pee-hole... 
There won't be enough cream for that kind of chaffing. 

(Yes, pee-hole drones are priced in.)"

The whole thing frankly smells like nigerian prince email BS."

2021-05-28 21:38:07,wallstreetbets,"Kind of easily triggered bud... what's up? Someone left you with blue balls?


BTW... The Obama administration in two terms spent more money then all the president's before him combined. Dont be upset with facts Dems are know to be liberal with government spending and conservatives conservative with spending."
2021-05-29 10:41:21,wallstreetbets,"Yeah fair enough.

 I think the big difference is the amount of implied risk. “We really like them” to me implies low risk of the contract changing hands. “We have a duty to allow others to bid if they can provide the same services in the future” implies a lot more risk of the contract going away."
2021-05-29 15:44:28,wallstreetbets,"if you have 100 shares, you can sell an option to a retard gambler. When it expires, you keep your shares and the profit. then you do it again. and again. and again. and eventually you'll have made $20k and your shares are basically free. you can use the 20k to make other plays or just keep reinvesting in pltr and averaging down that way too."
2021-05-28 23:34:26,wallstreetbets,2016 called...
2021-05-29 16:44:20,wallstreetbets,sorry i may be an idiot but i reallly dont understand lmao can u link me some youtube videos?
2021-05-28 22:07:57,wallstreetbets,Is it true that the CEO flight on July 18th?
2021-05-28 22:11:57,wallstreetbets,"Rumors are they are writing ""to the moon"" on the next flight"
2021-05-29 14:29:34,wallstreetbets,I would buy the dip for 4 weeks out if I can afford it. I think it will go up over a 4 week timeframe. Not financial advice.
2021-05-29 17:03:33,wallstreetbets,I sold a bunch of calls to cover my initial cost. Ended up with 10x 40c and 5x 31c (july 16 )for free.💎🙌 🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-29 19:12:43,wallstreetbets,You call expires just in time for the Branson flight!
2021-05-29 12:25:39,wallstreetbets,SPCE is going to crash on Tuesday. Huge dilution and lawsuit both announced after hours Friday.
2021-05-28 20:18:34,wallstreetbets,How do you propose they scale the business for commercial operations this story is garbage it’s for over the next 3 years
2021-05-29 00:16:42,wallstreetbets,"You do know that they get cash in exchange for the shares, making it value-neutral to the share price, and that they're using it to grow faster, right? That's usually a good thing and a bullish indicator."
2021-05-29 08:59:40,wallstreetbets,This does not affect share price
2021-05-29 12:31:18,wallstreetbets,"I smell coordinated attack with that bs lawsuit pr on friday after market close. 
Thats how tutes and hedges manipulate. We havent even started the real squeeze with the fact that such old trick is being played."
2021-05-28 21:42:15,wallstreetbets,Umm from time to time retard . . . .
2021-05-29 12:07:27,wallstreetbets,That's why it sank after close
2021-05-29 12:08:08,wallstreetbets,it dilutes the share price . . .
2021-05-29 11:58:08,wallstreetbets,Look at the price
2021-05-29 15:15:09,wallstreetbets,Let's get a beer
2021-05-29 12:36:29,wallstreetbets,"Maybe, but they are issuing $1 billion in new shares. Going to definitely affect the share price. I don't see how it can squeeze with such a large dilution hanging over it."
2021-05-28 21:47:06,wallstreetbets,That’s what I just said fuktard it’s over 3 years
2021-05-29 13:11:23,wallstreetbets,"No, it doesn't. It dilutes the percentage of the company that you own.

But if the company has more assets (because it has all the same assets as before, plus the extra cash now from the people who purchased the shares), then it evens out."
2021-05-29 12:40:25,wallstreetbets,Working over time on the weekend? lol
2021-05-29 12:39:56,wallstreetbets,"Fuck off, you hedge."

2021-05-29 12:03:18,wallstreetbets,Lets go get a beer!!!
2021-05-29 15:14:48,wallstreetbets,Let's get beer!!!
2021-05-29 12:42:48,wallstreetbets,I wish I was a hedge fund millionaire. Just don't think it has anymore squeeze left in it. It tanked after hours. It will be interesting to see come Tuesday for sure.
2021-05-29 12:46:52,wallstreetbets,Good luck with your trade asshole! Just because I don't think it will squeeze anymore doesn't mean I work for a hedge fund. Why don't you put a little more effort in explaining why a $1 billion dilution won't negatively affect share price?
2021-05-29 09:15:51,wallstreetbets,It’s a shelf offering for the future but you can’t argue with stupid
2021-05-29 09:46:54,wallstreetbets,You fucking idiot...learn what a shelf offering is before commenting about shelf offerings.
2021-05-29 12:44:56,wallstreetbets,"We havent even started. When short attempt is still made and hedges havent given up, its just the beginning. All gives me more confidence on my position, and may even double down to run you over shorty."
2021-05-29 15:22:52,wallstreetbets,"I can help explain here. $1 billion dilution is a bullish move for a growth stock.  Experienced investors know this. TSLA did this leading up to the moment they finally stock split. Now *that* was a time period when I do remember a stock negatively affecting share prices in the days that followed.

Dilution? Barely affects a stock in my experience. Just another day in the life of a publically traded company, especially one that is building a foundation for long-term growth."
2021-05-29 12:02:20,wallstreetbets,Let's go get a beer!!!!
2021-05-29 12:49:14,wallstreetbets,We will see. I do have several short positions. Mostly long term puts that should print nicely with the huge dilution scheduled. And the worst thing about this company is it only exist to let millionaires fly through space for a few minutes. You are literally donating your money so they can have cheaper tickets to space.
2021-05-29 15:36:52,wallstreetbets,"SPCE market cap is $7.5 billion so this offering is an almost 15% increase. I don't see how this doesn't move the stock down at least in the short term. I totally see being bullish for the long term but short term I think it will make the price fall. Tesla has income, a pretty good amount of it. SPCE has none until 2022 at the soonest. I don't like helping the top 1% develop nothing more than a tourist attraction. If they want to fly in space so bad let them pony up all the cost. Why did Branson sell his stake? He doesn't even put his billions on the line."
2021-05-29 12:04:33,wallstreetbets,Regardless of a shelf offering or not it took a spill after closing.
2021-05-28 22:42:27,wallstreetbets,"Love BB. Seems kinda like GME pre sh. squeeze. Entry price seems doable. 🤔 We are one. If we keep buying all the short sellers shares, then ....."

2021-05-29 08:04:53,wallstreetbets,"Well main stream media would say it’s a meme stock, some people say that hedge funds are manipulating the stock price, I say it’s wildly misunderstood and undervalued.
There are multiple layers to bb; 1. Patent sale(short term moon) bb has a patent sale in the works that effected... affected... iffected? Fuck it, that fucked with their earnings last quarter chase they could included patent revenue hence their miss. The patent sale could be for billions, could be for millions. We will see.
2. Ivy- ivy is a cloud based software solution for automobiles. It could be revolutionary fir automobiles finally making cars smarts devices. Think of app stores on phones but for cars and the revenue that could come in, but also think about sensor data collection, self driving data collection, I mean everything that has to do with driving. It’s a big deal imo.
3- cyber security, bb cyber security is top notch and they’ve been winning contracts left and right. Tons of good news for bb. There’s more to it, might write a dd later, but that’s the jist of it."

2021-05-28 20:56:30,wallstreetbets,"GameStops January squeeze closed belows its Thursday price going into the 3 days weekend, only to sky rocket the following week. Stay bullish on AMC🚀"
2021-05-28 22:26:08,wallstreetbets,Jesus the AMC volume today was 653m. Average 3 month volume is 98m. That’s nuts.
2021-05-29 06:25:08,wallstreetbets,We need more permabans
2021-05-29 03:22:30,wallstreetbets,Technical analysis coming through

2021-05-29 05:18:40,wallstreetbets,I think it’s in the rules that you need to post your position.
2021-05-29 01:27:13,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been explaining this non stop to people
Who wrote calls on amc and GME. Sometimes it pays to understand how to thetagang.

Shit depending on the strike/current stock price  sometimes it’s even worth taking a small loss rolling the strike up and keeping the same expiration date. Youll initially take a small loss rolling but if you can get an extra few dollars per share out of a contract that is gonna be ITM anyway then at least make the most of it and get more when your shares are called away. (This is very situational though and isn’t always possible. Not really feasible when delta is 1 or super close to 1)"
2021-05-29 01:34:51,wallstreetbets,Should have rolled it out 🤷🏻‍♂️
2021-05-28 21:07:53,wallstreetbets,Not if you're making money every week.
2021-05-28 21:09:45,wallstreetbets,Wheeling memes has been incredibly lucrative over the past 12 months. Nothing like collecting a few grand of premiums ebery monday that theta decay by friday.

2021-05-29 17:42:49,wallstreetbets,"I haven't done a lot of CC trading, but I didn't see any harm in doing it.  Sure, those 100 shares are tied up and I can't write another call on them for a while - other than that, I couldn't find a reason not to.

I am not a GME zealot who believes in the $10m base price.  But I was trying to get everything I could out of the asset I own."
2021-05-29 01:36:20,wallstreetbets,And not if you understand how to roll a cc
2021-05-29 09:50:34,wallstreetbets,Glad to hear you are still in the Game!
2021-05-28 20:06:47,wallstreetbets,"I sell covered calls on stock I'm planning to hold regardless. If it goes down or stays flat, Im insulated via premium.

Nobody buys shares to sell CCs to try and profit on a downtrend."
2021-05-29 17:47:45,wallstreetbets,IMO I think it was the right play. The  premiums for GME are too juicy to let your shares get taken away. Yeah you could always buy back in but that might cost you more depending on what happens to the stock price
2021-05-29 17:45:41,wallstreetbets,"That's what I was trying to point out.

That selling CCs definitely isn't bearish."
2021-05-29 17:50:29,wallstreetbets,thanks for the support.  It's not the only 100 shares of GME I own.  I love collecting my  own weekly dividend.
2021-05-29 18:12:24,wallstreetbets,"There’s a couple different plays you could have made here. If you think it’s gonna keep going down, you could have also rolled out but dropped it deeper ITM to collect a huge premium and the wait for the stock to go down and buy it back cheaper. With that there is assignment risk too but it would work similarly to shorting the stock, just with your own shares and a deep ITM call"
2021-05-28 21:48:57,wallstreetbets,Next week will be 15 for BB
2021-05-28 22:20:57,wallstreetbets,15 next week

2021-05-29 09:04:26,wallstreetbets,"It is not easy to push BlackBerry as high as with GME and AMC because BB has far more outstanding shares.

2021-05-29 19:41:10,wallstreetbets,Yes to BB
2021-05-28 22:02:32,wallstreetbets,I had 36  11cs bought at an avg of $.11 expiring today they were worth $.03 each on Tuesday and I sold them for like $120 because I thought there was no hope... today I could have sold them for like $1.50 each around 10am. Although after I sold them I bought 10 11cs for July which made me $1800 today so it wasn't all shit.
2021-05-29 12:58:45,wallstreetbets,Are you guys done commenting on this please let's start another chain
2021-05-28 23:35:59,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha. I buy my company shares at 15% discount, then sell it for a quick buck. Move those profits into BB."
2021-05-29 18:07:42,wallstreetbets,"They aren't. Other companies are better at productization and sales than BB. Look at Crowdstrike, Palo Alto Networks, Z-Scaler, Rapid7.

If you were a tech company in the last decade and did not experience any growth whatsoever (this is BB). You're an absolute trash company.

I say this as someone who owned BB leaps and dumped them at the height last of yesterday.

Also can't wait for the retards to tell me that the deal with AWS is suppose to be ""amazing."" When it actuality it's just listing an app on a marketplace. For the new degenerates it's equivalent to selling your game on steam and saying you're partnered with Valve.

This place blows now, I mean FFS this technical analysis is tea leaf reading. At least the prayer threads were hilarious and retarded in a good way. This is just sad retarded."
2021-05-29 10:11:48,wallstreetbets,Yesterday BB only took us to the atmosphere and back down. It has been like that for awhile now. One day BB will make us all proud and pass the moon. I just know it. They have so many good things coming for the electric cars.

2021-05-29 09:16:05,wallstreetbets,"Me too bro. Don't feel bad, it happens. Sold 10 BB $9 weeklies for $0.12/each on Tuesday. On any normal week that's free money. By Wednesday I was a little  nervous but not sweating it, mostly just bummed out that I left so much money on the table. By Friday I was sure my goose was cooked. The buyer waited literally 3 mins until midnight to execute yesterday. Depending on the price I might jump back in on Tuesday."
2021-05-29 07:17:47,wallstreetbets,I am positive at least 25% of the people that threw money at $BB didn’t know anything about the company.

2021-05-29 14:30:31,wallstreetbets,You can always hop back in. Chances of a drop Monday (on the Toronto exchange) and Tuesday are likely. That's my plan but just gotta see how things pan out.
2021-05-28 20:56:14,wallstreetbets,"Damn this is so confusing. Are those options? Calls or puts? Or what is it? I have no idea what I’m looking. All I know is just buying shares, it goes up I make money it goes down I lose money."

2021-05-28 20:57:48,wallstreetbets,"Is it really though, it went down today. I suspect it will go down even more on Tuesday when market opens. It’s already Friday and they already covered their shorts no? Anyone care to explain?"

Point being, very often the great gains come with great risk.  I like the stock and any money i put into it i am completely willing to lose if that be the case.  Your attitude towards the stock suggests you bought in back in Feb and lost big so now your disgruntled at people making gains on the stock because you bought in at the wrong time"

2021-05-29 00:07:07,wallstreetbets,Their fundamental business is terrible. Many affluent customers who can afford to buy food this way either do not want to cook or can cook just fine without everything showing up in a box and would prefer it that way.
2021-05-28 22:00:04,wallstreetbets,"HelloFresh is doing well. Are people too fucking stupid to read or what? They’ve grown sales very consistently and they’ve increased profits- that’s right, profits. They’re selling those dirt cheap meals and turning like a 15% net profit.

I’m so sick of “meal kits are stupid” as every response, when there is literally a peer that started smaller and is executing extremely well.

Every competent human being should be able to cook from the internet. The fact is, people are buying these meal kits. The question is not whether or not this is a sustainable business model, I’ve written at least a dozen times to look at hellofresh which is not only a ten bagger after a few years, but is actually fundamentally sound as well.

The question is whether or not Blue Apron can escape bankruptcy or not. Do they sell the business to a larger competitor. Do they refinance the debt. Do they die. That’s the only thing in question. They very well might die, but it has nothing to do with the viability of meal kits.

Edit- before you respond with something else stupid. Do a 3 second google and see if hellofresh is probable and growing. There are reasons why this is the case, and it’s not a one for one, but it proves the point that the issue isn’t meal kits themselves"
2021-05-29 14:53:13,wallstreetbets,"Google “HelloFresh Income Statement” and come back to me.

This is a stupid ass business model, but for some reason it works.

I’ve also explained this a dozen or two times so maybe try reading before tossing in your uninformed two cents."
2021-05-28 22:02:14,wallstreetbets,"I mean, was it? It still might not survive. They got a few board members who have added nothing besides speculation. If anything, the stock price will save them because they can do their ATM raise with Jefferies."
2021-05-28 21:54:26,wallstreetbets,Wow. Went right over your head.
2021-05-29 00:29:11,wallstreetbets,Just curious why you don't use HelloFresh....
2021-05-29 14:59:12,wallstreetbets,"Oh, I thought you were trying to reinforce your point.

I like to cook, but I enjoy grocery shopping, picking out my meat, etc. I also don’t follow recipes 1 for 1.

I also have not been impressed with the recipes for the price point. It’s just not for me. Like, I could make a better dish for less with superior ingredients.

I did try it once and everything that wasn’t 5-10 bucks extra was chicken or pork based (cheap). Honestly, I WOULD use something like this if they provided international recipes. For example, I’d love to cook some Ramen or Thai Noodles, but I’d have to buy a whole new spice rack for something I’d rarely use. I also don’t have sensibilities for those flavor nodes, so I’d need a recipe.

I would have thought hellofresh would fail given how they give away all those promos (I paid next to nothing for my trial) but they’re actually doing really well and have been since pre-Covid. Beats me, but I can’t pretend I’m a proxy for the average consumer when the numbers don’t lie."

The infrastructure is actually there for H2 via pipelines.  Its quite brilliant actually that they can tie into existing NG infrastructure.  At one time in the 1800s America used Hydrogen as a fuel source.

These times are amazing for what the future can hold.  Im quite optimistic that one day everyone will have all the power they want very cheaply.  Batteries are great and portable, but I have some reservations about wide scale adoption (worldwide)  They are disposable, prone to danger, made from materials that are unsustainable.  At least in its present state.  No doubt there will be millions of battery operated vehicles in the next decade, but I think ICE can still and should be a viable option.

Think of an apartment complex.  Hundreds of people needing to charge at the same time (for work or school) it would be a disaster if they dont get things figured out.

Also, I hope H2 can be made locally and tie into the grid.  That is somewhat of a pipe dream but wouldnt it be cool if you powered your home and made your own gas for driving?  While feeding back into the grid for others.

H2 incidently has been around longer than battery tech.  There is a major misconception that H2 is some a new and novel concept.  But its been with us for centuries.  Decades ago, car manufacturers tried to make it a thing but incidently the oil people you spoke of kept it from being mainstream.  
Check this out (bottom of the page is the oldest H2 cars):

2021-05-29 00:39:08,wallstreetbets,"Clearly you're a true believer in H2 and ICE. Good luck with that. I think you're wrong on a number of accounts and your history lesson is interesting but not a good argument for the viability of H2. I'd love to see H2 as a viable fuel via electrolysis, but the money just isn't there. No one's willing to build the infrastructure. Maybe some parts of the NG network will work, but it will require retrofitting, plus transport, plus the high-energy process to make H2. For what? lower efficiency and higher cost. 

It just doesn't make financial sense. And that's why we don't see a rush of capital to H2. It's all going to the wildly more efficient technology. And we witness the factories being built all over the world, global supply chains being secured, recycling and mineral capture partnerships running in tandem, capital being accumulated and spent in the pursuit of BEVs. 

We agree that the current grid is shit and needs major investment to upgrade it. Good luck with your investments."
2021-05-29 00:55:37,wallstreetbets,"I dont think you are looking at any of the links Im sending you.  Because if you did you'd see there is huge interest in H2.  It's not some history lesson but a fact of life now and into our future.  I mean just look at the headlines for today.

A plan to fund clean energy technologies.
Mr. Biden’s budget proposes more than $800 billion over the next decade in new spending and tax breaks in a bid to accelerate the deployment of clean-energy technologies aimed at fighting climate change, from hydrogen fuels to the next generation of nuclear power plants.

2021-05-29 01:06:44,wallstreetbets,"Oh, I see, this is BrokerageLink at Fidelity. that's how you did it. Interesting. Your 401k must offer BrokerageLink

Fidelity’s BrokerageLink® option is a self-directed brokerage account within the 401k or 403b plan.

What is BrokerageLink®?BrokerageLink® gives you the ability to open a brokerage account within your 401k. This opens the universe of available investment choices to a much broader spectrum of securities. Some companies limit the types of investments you can own or the percentage of your 401k that can be moved into the BrokerageLink® account. Still, the wider selection of thousands of investment choices increases the level of diversification you can achieve and may give you access to investments that are superior to those offered in the standard 401k plan.  


Not all BrokerageLink 401(k)s at Fidelity have the same rules though, your employer may limit certain types of investments or even the percentage of your 401(k) that can be added to your BrokerageLink account."

2021-05-29 13:55:27,wallstreetbets,You try? I was able to
2021-05-28 21:57:05,wallstreetbets,In a tech hub like Seattle starting new grad pay for engineers can be closer to 150k. Not hard to max a 401k with that. If you get a decent employer match that can easily bring you up to like 26k/yr. At 15% avg growth (also not hard past few years) thatd end up around 200k on year 5.
2021-05-29 12:31:04,wallstreetbets,"While I agree for the most part I dont think its 100% that black and white. For me, my brokerage dwarfs my tax advantaged accounts even though they are maxed annually. I  decided to gamble inside a small roth ira for 2 reasons:
1) it places a hard limit on how much of my NW I can gamble with
2) with frequent rebalancing or trading, not incurring cap gains is much more efficient (doing a leveraged ETF 70/30 UPRO/TMF play there, rebalanced quarterly) whereas the buy n hold of VTI and the like can still be very tax efficient in a regular brokerage account.

That said, I also have a roth 401k that also dwarfs the roth ira being used for gambling, so the gambling roth ira is about 5% of total and 10% of my roth space.

If someone is gambling via something that involves frequent trading, and can afford to give up some tax advantaged space if it goes to 0, id say doing that gambling inside an IRA or roth IRA limited to 5-10% of total/total tax advantaged space is probably the most efficient. Though I probably wouldn't advocate that for someone who isn't able to put more into their brokerage than their maxed out retirement accounts."

Listen here fed boy"
2021-05-28 20:23:24,wallstreetbets,"had 500K and turned that 500K into another 500k.... 

how hard is that to explain?"
2021-05-28 20:57:45,wallstreetbets,Those companies are out there.  I work at Northrop Grumman and they match 8%
2021-05-29 07:11:47,wallstreetbets,I’m at Honeywell and match is effectively 7%.
2021-05-28 21:02:45,wallstreetbets,"Dang, pretty annoyed at my 4% match rn lol"
2021-05-29 15:00:38,wallstreetbets,">Taxed when you took it out

its going to get taxed either way when withdrawing, whether its traditional or roth 401k"
2021-05-29 01:26:03,wallstreetbets,"It’s obviously different for every individual, but you are simplifying it a bit too much. Just because you have a more active lifestyle and have more expenses does not mean that you have a higher income. 

I may also have more expenses during retirement than I do now while working, but I make a lot of money and save a majority of it, so I’m in a high tax bracket. Even though I may be spending more during retirement, I don’t believe that I’ll have a higher income, therefore I will be in a lower tax bracket."
2021-05-29 13:07:05,wallstreetbets,"So... Do you want it or is the thumb up the ass lifestyle really work well for the extra 8 hours a day you probably weren't energetic enough to use

Burnout's not a thing when you can retire in 5 years!"
2021-05-28 21:04:35,wallstreetbets,"Don't feel bad, my wife has a good job and they only match 4% as well"
2021-05-29 15:01:46,wallstreetbets,Roth 401k isn't taxed on withdrawal. It's like a Roth IRA in that regard and is post tax...
2021-05-29 13:28:21,wallstreetbets,"If there was a job offer, I'd do it. I don't have anything else do to with this mediocre life."
2021-05-28 21:33:22,wallstreetbets,Ya 4% is okay and my job is pretty good. Not to much complaints but 8% would be super dope
2021-05-29 15:05:38,wallstreetbets,"oops, my bad on the miswording.  

yeah, my point is that the the money in the 401k is going to get taxed either way\*  

So assuming traditional 401k, u/0Bubs0 was going to have his withdrawals taxed either way, regardless if he did an early withdrawal or not"
2021-05-28 21:41:14,wallstreetbets,"Yea, I have to agree 8% is awesome. That is the main thing that keeps me there"
2021-05-28 22:09:54,wallstreetbets,"Use your power of deduction.

Your 401k allocation is bad. My advice is to change so it is safe. It is your retirement after all.

Most of us dicking around with GME and AMC do so with play money. We can afford to lose and that's why all the self deprecating jokes. You went and bet your 401k."
2021-05-29 02:10:13,wallstreetbets,"The fuck are you even talking about?  You have no idea what my 401(k) is doing.  I haven't touched my 401k, you fucking karen.  I have $2500 of my own money in AMC and I mentally lit it on fire.

Where did you get the idea that I bet my 401k?

You're literally delusional.

Can you fucking apologize for being this stupid in public?

I can't wait for you to delete all your messages like the fucking coward you are.

You're not part of an ""us"" and I'm not a ""them"" you tribalist donkeybrain."
2021-05-29 06:19:01,wallstreetbets,Sorry. I thought you were op.
2021-05-29 09:30:38,wallstreetbets,I see that now.  I'm sorry for being so heated and confrontational and abrasive during the exchange.  I think my anger prevented us from getting to that conclusion sooner.  <3

2021-05-29 01:46:45,wallstreetbets,"Agree and good advice, but at what point is buying below cost basis a “good deal” as in, don’t buy below cost basis unless it really makes a difference of average share price.  Rigut now, I’m at 26.90 a share so I am def. within a margin where a few hundred shares would drastically help, but I still think we are one pullback away from pltr form going north of 24.50-25 where I know a lot of calls are sitting"

2021-05-29 11:06:26,wallstreetbets,"We don't not run any LTL as everything needs dedicated service but sometimes do run Box Truxks or Sprinter Van's with few pallets. 

Almost none of the product we run goes to Costco.

I am not sure of what I could get in trouble for speaking on but I can assure you they have BIG things on the horizon that we are working on."

2021-05-28 21:17:46,wallstreetbets,"Casinos always win because the odds are in their favor. The more you play the better the chance the outcome is in line with the odds. Play a few times with a lot of money and you have a decent chance of coming out ahead. Play a billion times with $1 and it'll slowly work out to the houses favor.

If there was a game where you had the odds the casinos would dump it the next day"

2021-05-29 13:15:24,wallstreetbets,"I see, but how can you tell that? When I add up the bid and ask data they are usually way lower than the open interest numbers which I guess makes sense since it only shows highest bid and lowest ask numbers. Sorry for all the questions I’m still relatively new."

 Congrats bdw! I did not take profit and ended up holding. You think it will cross $15 next week?"
2021-05-29 14:29:17,wallstreetbets,"It is hard to tell when it will cross $15, market is unpredictable but the decision that ford is making will definitely bring them profit which in turn will make retail and institutional investor to invest and drive the stock price up, based on my research if they are able to figure out the chip shortage and battery issue they should be around $50."

2021-05-29 16:01:13,wallstreetbets,Huge difference between buying in at $9/ share and $36/share if it hits 100. Difference is 1000% profit verses 300% profit. A $9 by in yields considerably less risk but higher payout
