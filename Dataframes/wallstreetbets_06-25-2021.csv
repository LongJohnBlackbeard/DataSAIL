2021-06-25 19:52:49,wallstreetbets,"Congrats, but $100 in commission??"
2021-06-25 19:58:40,wallstreetbets,I'll be waiting for the post when you try again and end up where you started üòê
2021-06-25 19:52:05,wallstreetbets,Nice!
2021-06-25 19:59:32,wallstreetbets,"Worth it to pay commission for better execution any day when dealing with options.

You do know 1 contract is 100 shares, right?

The 'free option' brokerages like Robinhood have garbage price execution quality. And when it comes to contracts, even 1 cent off share price is equivalent to 100 shares of that 1 cent off volatility hence far greater than fee itself. I rather pay fee than have a 'free' traded contract that executes prices at a couple cents worse on both buy and sell (that's a lot of money lost per contract).

That said, there are other better brokerages for options (e.g.: Schwab, Fidelity, etc. are only $0.65 and are solid brokerages)."

2021-06-25 19:23:53,wallstreetbets,We have something called Delta Sonic here in Buffalo and it also prints money. These companies also recycle water so that‚Äôs not a major concern going forward. Delta prints money too and people refer to it as Delta Chronic because they‚Äôre so addicting. They recently added food options and oil changes. People do love washing their cars.

2021-06-25 18:55:15,wallstreetbets,Don't buy at IPO wait a week or two. No reason to bag hold if you don't need to
2021-06-25 18:23:43,wallstreetbets,"Also, I just saw 2 DD's pop up about this ticker minutes from each other by two different people. Both by months old accts. This is looking like one of those pump and dumps that we have been seeing these past few weeks being pushed here in WSB."
2021-06-25 18:19:10,wallstreetbets,"I just don't understand, it seems like it's everyday that a new ""short squeeze"" DD pops up in WSB. Seems like there is over 20 of them mentioned in the last month alone. It used to only be GME and AMC since the beginning of Feb. How in the fuck are any of these ""short squeezes"" suppose to happen when there is so many people posting DD's trying to get people to invest in a new ""Short squeeze"" This shit is just starting to seem super duper sus to me. Also, every time I see a new one I check the poster and 9 out of 10 times their acct is either 4 months old or younger. I think this is proving more and more that wsb has been been infiltrated hard by paid for shills working for shitadel and or other hedge funds. It's not all a coincidence. They don't want GME to squeeze, they don't want AMC to squeeze. So, they're out there like ""omg, look at this ticker, it's a thort squeeze"" come join in, it's really cheap. People seeking some bananas jump in and they end up holding the bag and their money tied up in a dead end stock with super slow growth because they don't want to sell at a loss. Anyone that reads this, I remember the WSB of old, the one that saw REAL short term plays and attacked. Don't let yourselves be played by these paid for shill idiots. Pay attention to these DD's do some of your own research. Look at the next ""short squeeze"" DD plays that pop up and you will see that it's made by people with very very young accts."

2021-06-25 18:18:00,wallstreetbets,Doesn't start trading until Monday I don't think. Currently it's FRX. I've got a small position but might add next week if it dips

It's not going to be the next PTON imho, but it looks promising to take a decent slice of the market, and could easily be a 2x or 3x bagger around merger or, failing that, within a year. I invested in it in February. My account is around 2 years old if that's any help."

2021-06-25 18:47:40,wallstreetbets,Do some more research because this is a good play and not because of the short squeeze. Beach body has a cult like following and we all know how these cult like companies do with their stock prices.

2021-06-25 18:33:56,wallstreetbets,Same. I've been sitting on it for a while at about 10$ per share. Very undervalued. Glad it's finally taking off.

2021-06-25 18:43:56,wallstreetbets,I have 3000 shares. Will add some 2023 $7c on Monday. Still dirt cheap for now but I also feel like GSAT has potential
2021-06-25 17:26:13,wallstreetbets,My personal price target on GSAT is 10.00 by end of year. For the record.
2021-06-25 19:16:17,wallstreetbets,2023 call options are cheap AF
2021-06-25 18:20:19,wallstreetbets,"My TDAmeritrade account says there are 77.8 thousand OI calls at the $2 for July 16. Also, 44k at $2.5, 77k at $3, 11k at $3.5 and a whopping 133k at $4!

Either somebody has big expectations or there are just a hell of a lot of gamblers in this one."

2021-06-25 17:10:05,wallstreetbets,Far OTM is the only way to go for exponential gains üöÄ
2021-06-25 19:06:27,wallstreetbets,Deep ITM leaps have more intrinsic value relative to time value where as deep OTM leaps have basically only time value. If you were such a dumb fucking degenerate autist you'd know that. Hence why the stock could be flat and your deep ITM will still gain value. The lack of understanding of basic option fundamentals makes my brain hurt.
2021-06-25 17:06:42,wallstreetbets,What is all that green stuff?
2021-06-25 17:07:43,wallstreetbets,But you lost $37 dollars on the June calls. How long are those kinds of losses sustainable. üòÇ

2021-06-25 17:57:47,wallstreetbets,"If you look at the charts you can see that 2 of those were being heavily shorted during the day to drive the SP down.  


Look at the charts for both $GME and $WKHS and what do you see at the very end of the day?  MASSIVE increases in volume and a huge spike at the end of the day.  


These are selling throughout the day to keep the price down, and then they cover or buy back at the close.  This is the 2nd Friday in a row for WKHS.  Also, $RIDE that is closely tied to $WKHS also shows the same activity."
2021-06-25 17:43:27,wallstreetbets,CLNE forever

Daily moves of 8-10% on the super thin volume are very common.  Paradise for scalpers.  Lots of long term holders in the stock and if it really does have a lot of shorts a squeeze would become a mania real quick.

2021-06-25 16:42:42,wallstreetbets,What is it useful for? Honest question
2021-06-25 16:44:36,wallstreetbets,"Finding dispensaries, certain strains or brands of weed, and reviews. It‚Äôs basically like Yelp for weed."
2021-06-25 16:49:09,wallstreetbets,Hmm idk google works fine for finding a dispensary. I mean if you can nerd out on the app that is cool but there are also tons of online and off line sources to read up on strains and brands. So many reviews already out there on other websites. Anyway I have no stake in it and I hope you're able to make some quick money but I dont really get it being hyped as a great company or investment. I don't think any of my stoner friends are going to care enough to use it.
2021-06-25 16:56:01,wallstreetbets,"Google is shit for weed. On WM you can find out where the best dispensaries are near you, which kinds of payment methods are accepted (super important) , if they deliver, which brands they have, reviews of brands, and so much more. Currently not invested but will be as of tomorrow."
2021-06-25 18:05:18,wallstreetbets,Why skip around to all of those different online sources when you have a one stop shop with $MAPS?
2021-06-25 18:14:22,wallstreetbets,Because you're not buying a new car you're buying weed. My biggest stoner friends treat it like going to the liquor store. Usually use the same store maybe go to a couple different ones once in awhile usually get the same 3 products and once in awhile try something new. Nobody goes to check out the rating of a liquor store before going into a new one and if they are looking for something new or just want some opinion the will ask the person working there or do a quick Google. There might be a few super into weed culture people that will check it out but the rest of the people won't be bothered because they know what they like. Like I said youre not buying a car if you don't end up liking it you'll not be out of much money. I think people will get the app because people like having interesting little app to look at for half an hour but then the novelty wears off.
2021-06-25 19:00:22,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre not considering the saas aspect of their business which is a major factor. Also the app allows you to look at sales going on near you, find shops that have an item you‚Äôre looking for in stock, and order delivery. A lot more than just google for weed"
2021-06-25 19:01:55,wallstreetbets,Yeah sales are nice. I'm going to keep an eye on this company just out of curiosity.

- **18 had unusual flight patterns:** ""Some UAP appeared to remain stationary in winds aloft, move against the wind, maneuver abruptly, or move at considerable speed, without discernable means of propulsion. In a small number of cases, military aircraft systems processed radio frequency (RF) energy associated with UAP sightings.""

Around Sept/Oct you need to be proactive as that is when things will get spicy. Also look at oversold companies specifically, these will rally like crazy(**examples being DXCM/NICE; I've posted about them weeks and weeks ago to pretty much 0 discussion. Those options are now 200-600%**)

Other than that just go look for oversold companies that have strong fundamentals. DXCM was oversold because they made 15% increase QoQ instead of 20% and it dropped the price over 30%. That is what oversold means. I bought in at the dip, and when it dipped I bought more. 

Pretty simple process so long as you realize it was oversold due to something like that and not because the company is dying."

2021-06-25 17:32:49,wallstreetbets,I'm pretty sure that it's not a wash sale. Look at the cost basis on your shares ? Is it more than your strike?
2021-06-25 19:42:27,wallstreetbets,Got to Bangkok. Go down to the BTS sky train. Get on it and take the ‚ÄòNana‚Äô stop. I have never seen any shit like that in my life. You will definitely want to pay for some sex. Makes Las Vegas look like Mr Rogers Neighborhood.

2021-06-25 17:37:26,wallstreetbets,It shows 14... but its holding the cash... probably until the seller of the call turns in the shares to me?
2021-06-25 16:03:03,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôll go up for like 30 minutes then crash

2021-06-25 18:14:12,wallstreetbets,This is a seriously risky call.  What‚Äôs the big thing tesla is doing to breakout in the market rn? Nothing.    Delaying production and that doesn‚Äôt make a stock leap.  Neither does all your competitors coming after your income.   Neither does lucid having stores in downtown Miami all over the place.    Tesla is a great stock.  But it didn‚Äôt randomly raise like it did and without the right catalyst won‚Äôt be.

2021-06-25 15:25:11,wallstreetbets,What goes up must come down. Definitely true for spce!!

2021-06-25 15:48:24,wallstreetbets,"I have spce. Earlier this year, I was up 200%+. Then into the red. Now back above 200%+. This is not by any means for sure a buy and hold 1 year +, or doesn‚Äôt have to be. Hence I‚Äôm asking HIM the question."
2021-06-25 16:01:33,wallstreetbets,Theres your awardü§™
2021-06-25 16:04:30,wallstreetbets,"This to me is a sell half to cover my original investment Plus a little extra..: let the rest be house money while keeping an eye out to potentially re-enter before the next important catalyst (Richard Branson Flight)‚Ä¶ then sell all after those gains‚Ä¶ and then wait 5 months of it bleeding red (VG maintenance period) and before 2022 (Commercial flights) i look to buy back in, for then a longer timeframe hold. Thats my plan"

2021-06-25 17:33:05,wallstreetbets,"I just made a similar play this week on AMD, but with much smaller values. It doesn't have to be volatile if your play only requires the stock to move by 1-2% in a week."

2021-06-25 16:36:58,wallstreetbets,Merger for what?
2021-06-25 16:50:13,wallstreetbets,"AMD entered into a definitive agreement with Xilinx in October 2020 to acquire the semiconductor company in a $35B all-stock transaction. 

The approval process is currently underway for the AMD/Xilinx merger and is set to be completed in the European Union and the United Kingdom next month. The EU is set to make a decision by the end of the month. The European Commission, the EU‚Äôs top antitrust regulator, is said to have no objections to the AMD/Xilinx merger. The UK‚Äôs Competition and Markets Authority is also evaluating the merger proposal now and will make a decision by July 6. 

If AMD breaks out expect to see close to $100 a pop."
2021-06-25 19:02:08,wallstreetbets,Imagine researching something for yourself right?

2021-06-25 17:02:28,wallstreetbets,Ah I remember that around the same time NVDA acquired someone. I also remember AMD having to dilute the hell out of their stock. Probably part of the reason why they've been flat for a whole year. What does Xilinx do that AMD can't?

Looks like buying Puts or going short on Wish and Clov was the right call but all the new accounts on reddit would have you think otherwise.
2021-06-25 17:46:12,wallstreetbets,"I just looked at your karma, and I totally would accuse you of being an influence operator if you were pushing some moneyed interests goals.  They have actual people with real accounts that apparently lay low until they are activated and they cycle through them to manipulate us, and it works.

It's not just for intelligence agencies and oil companies anymore, everyone is doing it."
2021-06-25 15:37:08,wallstreetbets,The problem is that whatever post you want to make is on the heels of a ton of different pump and dumps that burned the fuck out of a lot of newbs here. The past will inform the present generally speaking.
2021-06-25 19:55:47,wallstreetbets,Napster. Wait. Did I just show my age? Crap.

2021-06-25 16:34:13,wallstreetbets,"Like I said, its not a light switch. Some are BS clearly, others may not be. All of them that have run proper have needed to start with 1 post. I'm sorry you are such a pessimist. I made some folding money on Wish, happy enough with that."
2021-06-25 17:49:56,wallstreetbets,"I get it. My karma is low because I almost never social anything in life so I never post, and I have shitty opinions!"

2021-06-25 18:07:07,wallstreetbets,"Correct. The organisms being modified is perfectly fine. Some are modified to be more productive, resist drought, etc. Pesticides, not so good."
2021-06-25 16:37:37,wallstreetbets,My Puts will print which will be nice as well. I'll continue calling out the bullshit when I see it. There was no world wish was ever going to go above $15 when the posters only started commenting after that initial pump on June 8th. Maybe if they care so much they'll bombard this sub before institutional investors have complete control over the price action.
2021-06-25 17:51:09,wallstreetbets,Exactly.

2021-06-25 18:42:17,wallstreetbets,"To be fair he could be starving if he simply just doesn‚Äôt eat. With all the money in the world you can still starve by not eating? Op might be an asshole, but he is not a liar‚Ä¶."

2021-06-25 19:33:11,wallstreetbets,Starving and YOLO‚Äôing $300k shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to be together.
2021-06-25 19:33:16,wallstreetbets,Starving doesn‚Äôt always refer to food‚Ä¶.  Sounds to me like he‚Äôs starving for love
2021-06-25 19:33:16,wallstreetbets,Im sorry to hear that you feel that way. There is always something to lose but sometimes the perspective to see the value in it isnt there until its lost. Be that as it may... CLOV is a good stocküöÄüöÄüöÄ i hope you find success and peace in your hard times
2021-06-25 19:34:22,wallstreetbets,"""Starving"" with $310k lying around.  ""Nothing to lose"" with $310k lying around.  Nice BS flex.  Starving for validation from strangers.  You're probably a Keynesian."

2021-06-25 19:37:19,wallstreetbets,"Yup, no idea what I'm looking at. 300k is legit 400 shares on Tesla (most likely going back to 900+ in a year or two, maybe sooner) selling 4 covered calls when 90% of them expire worthless, let's say low end 5k a week. Get exercised? Flip the wheel and get em back. Hm.

2021-06-25 19:47:13,wallstreetbets,He‚Äôs in grad school. Which you have to do with Econ because no one takes it seriously as a major or profession.  Probably to teach Econ.

2021-06-25 15:22:16,wallstreetbets,Well it‚Äôs probably a fake screenshot so he‚Äôll probably lose the $120 he actually has invested. Because a least 1 part of any post like this is always a lie.

2021-06-25 18:46:37,wallstreetbets,No I think he buys in and then sells right after
2021-06-25 15:13:59,wallstreetbets,Ok?  That‚Äôs because you invested when AMC was probably $15.  Someone who invested on AMC on Monday is down 12%.
2021-06-25 14:29:44,wallstreetbets,Um do you know how to read charts?
2021-06-25 17:28:55,wallstreetbets,"Yes.  People made a ton of money when they bought in really low.  But instead of moving on to the next target where the price is low, they continually pump this idea that $50-60 is low because the stock is going to the stratosphere.  They try to lure in new people with that idea and they‚Äôve built a confirmation bias in themselves.  AMC or nothing else.  When I started all I had was AMC, but I took what I got from it and put it into other things.  I bought in at a lower price and I have more chances to win."
2021-06-25 18:29:05,wallstreetbets,"Exactly...he's a bag-holder who bought in the low $20s in that initial run up and is so narrowminded and/or clueless about how to trade that he thinks everyone is losing money.   If the stock closes unchanged from these levels in 2 weeks then I will have made a total return (stock appreciation plus short call option premium) of +70%  in a little more then a month.   But ""no one is making money off CLOV.""    Admittedly, this pales in comparison w/ the moves in AMC and GME but certainly better then a kick in the ass...or being a bag-holder who bought in the low $20s."

2021-06-25 17:15:20,wallstreetbets,"Take a step back and ask yourself. Does anyone actually give a shit about 5G? Sure, the telecom companies are shoving it down our throats like it's the Next Big Thing‚Ñ¢ but did you hear many people complaining about 4G? Unless you're going for Google Stadia levels of latency, it's damn near negligible to 4G outside of technical benchmarks and costs way more money for telecoms to implement. And then caps and throttling completely squander its potential for 90% of consumers.

Nokia will still grow, but it probs won't be because people are thirsty for 5G."

2021-06-25 19:38:00,wallstreetbets,But is it faster phone data to watch autistic ape memes?
2021-06-25 18:23:47,wallstreetbets,"You clearly don't use mobile data very often. I have been loving my 5g service. Latency has always been an issue with cell data and when you start seeing latency comparable to some home connections it's quite nice. I don't know about other people, but when I go to google something while on the go I prefer to start getting results immediately vs waiting for the request to actually make it out of the network and over to google's servers."
2021-06-25 18:34:37,wallstreetbets,"Damnit, take my angry upvote."
2021-06-25 17:53:17,wallstreetbets,"leaps here too, since february"
2021-06-25 19:35:20,wallstreetbets,Nokia isn‚Äôt a tower co.  And Neither Samsung nor Nokia is the biggest network equipment supplier anyways.
2021-06-25 19:44:19,wallstreetbets,Obviously NOK isn't a tower co. Thesis is that tower cos will benefit from 5g more than any other type of company and they also pay a divy.

2021-06-25 15:00:14,wallstreetbets,I think Foley's company Cannae $CNNE is the better play. It's been called Baby Berkshire. It's sitting near a 52 week low for no reason. I have shares and calls for August and November.

2021-06-25 15:36:30,wallstreetbets,you guys do realize that hedge funds have a massive PSFE position right? I thought WSB was against hedge funds? Part of me thinks they started this PSFE pump on here lmao

2021-06-25 13:52:06,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve run the numbers on PSFE like 300 times before investing. I think $250 a share is out of reach unless there are stock splits or otherwise. 

But I do think I‚Äôll get a 3 bagger here. It‚Äôll take some time. But i intend to see it through"
2021-06-25 17:27:02,wallstreetbets,Wall Street bets only against hedge funds recently. The number one goal of every single person in WSB community is to make more money.

2021-06-25 14:37:59,wallstreetbets,Impressive year. Congrats. I'm in on this. Thanks.
2021-06-25 14:17:22,wallstreetbets,"The rumor is United will order 100 Boeing jets--which SPR benefits from.   


When the news ultimately drops, unless all 200 jets will be Boeing, I suspect the price will drop too which will make an excellent entry point on Tuesday."

2021-06-25 14:31:00,wallstreetbets,your positions?
2021-06-25 15:10:55,wallstreetbets,you think it can push 70 by july?
2021-06-25 16:04:14,wallstreetbets,How the fuck did you turn 100K into 14M..?
2021-06-25 14:01:01,wallstreetbets,SPR is the poor mans BA
2021-06-25 13:26:56,wallstreetbets,You could. Boeing just has a lot of debt and so it has less upside IMO.
2021-06-25 14:32:12,wallstreetbets,"Clarifying, are you saying SPR would drop in price if they announce a large order on Tuesday? Wouldn‚Äôt the price go up?"
2021-06-25 13:17:44,wallstreetbets,Linked in their OP. First sentence.
2021-06-25 15:04:19,wallstreetbets,"Assuming OP hasn't changed them, it's in their $14M yolo likk"
2021-06-25 15:15:02,wallstreetbets,"The only way it hits 70 by the end of July is if China decides to recertify the 737 Max by then. Or some large money moves into the stock. I think 55 to 60 is reasonable for the end of July, especially if the United 737 order is confirmed soon."
2021-06-25 16:27:28,wallstreetbets,"Went all in on e-commerce in March 2020. YOLOed all of my account into OSTK calls when it was at $35 and sold near $80. That netted $6-7 mil. Then YOLOed into around 10 recovery plays 2 days before Pfizer announced their vaccine. Then YOLOed most of my account into SPR and AER in late November, which is where I stand now."
2021-06-25 14:34:46,wallstreetbets,"The expectation--and what's currently priced in--is for United to order 100 Boeing Jets.   


In order for the price to go up because expectations were beaten, the order from United would probably need to be 140-200 Boeing Jets.   


As I don't expect these expectations to be beaten, United announcing 100 jets, will cause a small selloff in SPR and other Boeing suppliers which in turn creates an entry point for me."

If you legit made 14 mil off 75k or whatever your initial investment was. More power to you, my man. I was just repeating what I read.  

Unless you plan on sliding me a couple thousand out of the goodness of your heart, I don't care either way and I personally assume you are telling the truth."
2021-06-25 15:29:00,wallstreetbets,"I mean yea I did have 125k around may 2019 at least according to etrade. That chart is directly from them. And if I go years and years back I had 20k. Not sure how that's suspect, and I guess I don't really care as I now have 14 mil. 

I mean you can't always believe what you read online, I get it."
2021-06-25 15:35:48,wallstreetbets,"> and I guess I don't really care as I now have 14 mil.

Yeah I hear ya. If I had 14 mil I wouldn't really give a shit what randos on reddit think. Hell, I don't have 14k in my brokerage and I'm already there lol."

The only difference in today's movement seems to be the BUY rating adjustment, which does make a difference.  But NOK does the same shit...releases a ton of average piddly PR all the time, moving +/- nick and dimes."

2021-06-25 15:18:20,wallstreetbets,"VIAC needs to close above 43.50 today so that the 44,000 + call options (strike price 43.50 and belowe) that would be expiring ITM today could fuel a good momentum into next week and encourage more FOMO from other investors. Hopefully the holders of the ITM call options would excercise their options to squeeze those holding naked shorts or those selling covered calls that has been pushing the stock down for the past couple of months. My personal PT is 50. Hopefully it reaches that target before September."

The FAA approved them for commercial flights this morning. We knew that decision was coming and that it would impact the stock price significantly. It was just a matter of time and patience.

The next big jump will be right after they land from their first successful commercial flight with paying customers. That will be coming very soon and would not be surprised at all for it to break $80 after that flight. I would still buy now because I like the stock."

The successful flight is good and I welcome that we‚Äôre getting closer to space travel - but the success had no effect on the stocks price as a result successful flight. It was only in the last week that we saw this huge increase. Today is another victory in the FAA granting approval. 

I say all this to say fuck the market. I‚Äôm salty that I could do my due diligence on a company, and see my money sideline for months.

Investing in ANY first to market product will always be an unpredictable stock as there will always be unforeseen delays and problems. These are also the type of stocks that promise the biggest gains (or biggest losses).

You cant have a good balance sheet while the product is under development - and once you do, it means that your product has reached market stability and unlikely to make a ton of money for investors.

2021-06-25 17:54:21,wallstreetbets,"Well, yes. But thankfully playing the markets successfully is a bit more favorable than Vegas if you really put the time into your research before placing your bet. Plus, the markets really want you to make money - while the house wants to take it from you.  The success of capitalism depends on investors making money.

The problem is that most of us are apes and we put all our money in meme stocks instead of putting in the research before making the bet.  If you treat the markets that way, then you might as well be playing it in Vegas.

Meme stocks should only be a small part of your portfolio. This is not financial advice. Ape no give financial advice. Ape just like money."

It very much confuses me that even Reddit and WSB kind of looks the other way when it comes to Cannabis. A site for all but used by a primarily younger generation... It's just an assumption of course but you cant tell me the Fed wouldn't have been moving at least  A LITTLE BIT faster on legalization if cannabis stocks got as much reddit/news attention as the same 4-5 stocks they spam about everyday. It would be alot of attention. What if those 4-5 stocks were cannabis? Cannabis actually has a huge blinding bright future. But hey, that's just my opinion."

2021-06-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Where my PLASTIC people at? Danimer Scientific ($DNMR) is a leading company in the biodegradable plastics field! DD!! I want to tell you a story, it involves plastics, Pepsi, Skittles, and David Einhorn beefing with a fat-titted short seller.

But first‚Ä¶

**Why Our Current Plastics Suck Ass**

Plastics currently take HUNDREDS of years to biodegrade in the environment 
Nearly 300 million tons of plastic wastes are produced annually, with over 91% not recycled. 
Just twenty companies are responsible for producing more than half of the single-use plastic waste in the world. 
Microplastics have recently been revealed to be in the placentas of unborn babies (https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/22/microplastics-revealed-in-placentas-unborn-babies).
The chemicals in plastic are reducing our fertility, it's reducing our birth weights, and increasing cancer risk in all of us, not to mention lung disease, heart disease and diabetes.

The debate over plastic usage has veered into camps of people who debate paper vs. plastic straws AND butch women complaining about birds in the ocean that have plastic soda rings around their neck ‚Ä¶ people are complaining but it feels like nothing practical is being done to fix this issue.

Enter Danimer Scientific (from here on, $DNMR)!!

**What $DNMR does**

$DNMR manufactures a solution called NODAX, it is a plastic that is 100% renewable, and they use it to make their products (cups, straws, bags, containers) which have been bought already by billion dollar companies (more on this soon). Their products are able to effectively biodegrade in both anaerobic and aerobic environments such as a waste treatment facility or the ocean. Their PHA (polymers) is 100% biodegradable in the presence of bacteria in all environments. Whereas most plastics take 300 years to biodegrade in the environment, $DNMR's takes 9 months, tops.

How it‚Äôs made: They use plant based oil to create 100% biodegradable and compostable biopolymers. Waste-free processes utilizes 100% of the canola oil to ensure optimal sustainability. It also meets their goal of full circle life cycle for plastics without relying on recycling. Three Step Production Process seen here for people who like science words: https://imgur.com/a/HzQuxHy

**Who are their clients?**

1.Pepsi ‚Äì in addition to bottled soda, they also own the chips companies‚Äô Frito Lays, Ruffles, and Gatorade (I‚Äôm getting hard) etc. (Here‚Äôs Pepsi recently giving a shout out to $DNMR: https://twitter.com/pepsico/status/1384252988823199753?lang=en_) 2. Bacardi ‚Äì SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS! 3. Mars Wrigley ‚Äì own Skittles, Orbit gum, freaking M&M‚Äôs etc. 4. Mysterious Major partner ‚Äì $DNMR only hinted at them in their last earnings call, because the client is so big that they don‚Äôt want their competitors to know what they‚Äôre up to at this time. Could be anyone.

**Targeted hit piece by Spruce Point Capital on $DNMR causes David Einhorn to flex**

The year was 2021, Danimer was riding high, things were good, a turtle somewhere was thinking about one day not being killed by plastic, and then‚Ä¶

Enter Ben Axler, the only hedge fund guy who could get cucked by Andrew Left. This guy - who looks like a diabetic parking cone ‚Äì released a ‚Äúsmoking gun‚Äù report about Danimer. ‚ÄúClaiming‚Äù that Danimer had fudged their numbers. Here‚Äôs the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P91YWxbeslI

The guy is literally unable to speak and read. His claims are so far-fetched that they‚Äôre hard to even articulate a rebuttal. He lies about something that happened, and then mischaracterizes a theory based on his lie‚Ä¶so to argue against him, you would have to force him to go back and admit that his initial thought was a lie (which would never happen). Really brain-pounding stuff.

Never the less, g@y bears gonna be g@y, so the stock really nosedived after this short ""report."" (it‚Äôs crazy how Yahoo finance can report this stuff as fact and it gets gobbled up, but I digress).

His report, and overall demeanor was so shady that David Einhorn himself (who has a position in $DNMR) called out Ben Axler: https://twitter.com/davidein/status/1395751453189410816
The whole thing is worth a read but in closing, Einhorn states ‚Äúthese reports [by Spruce Point Capital] represent the worst elements of the short selling profession.‚Äù

$DNMR‚Äôs percentage float shares that are shorted = 16.75%. A pretty decent amount. Proof: https://imgur.com/a/8GEYTCS

In regards to the shorting. I think there‚Äôs something so extra fucking bad about intentionally trying to take down a company that‚Äôs literally making plastics so that less people will die and the environment will be better.

**Financials**

In 2020, revenue jumped 46% to $47.3 million from 2019, driven by stronger demand and incremental PHA production-capacity brought online last year 
The Winchester plant‚Äôs annual 65 million pounds of capacity is sold out through 2022. 
Danimer‚Äôs ultimate goal is to build two to three production facilities simultaneously, each with production capacities of 250 million pound per year. 
Danimer‚Äôs CEO Stephen Croskrey owns nearly 5.1 million shares or 5.8% of the outstanding, making him the second-largest shareholder in Danimer after Vanguard, according to Bloomberg data. 
Danimer has a 3-to-5-year lead over competition. 
They just completed their Kentucky facility debottle-necking initiatives on time, which will enable them to significantly scale up production from previous levels. 
Pepsi has a board seat 
$DNMR is joining the Russell 3000 index today! 
Their CEO has long hair (rare these days) -% Mgmt Owns=5.5% >Financial Summary: https://imgur.com/9uynOPi 
Growth Plans: https://imgur.com/a/QCJZMRH

**Gossip**

Jeffries (who have given $DNMR a Buy Rating with a target of $42) went on a tour of $DNMR‚Äôs Kentucky factory today and apparently some big boys from Coors and DuPont were there and were highly impressed, https://imgur.com/a/gZXajs3

**What‚Äôs next**

In this current climate of social causes and companies wanting to do something about the environment, I've read that companies will soon begin listing facts about the plasticity of their products on the package itself, like how they do with calories and stuff. This means that companies who package their products using $DNMR will get to brag about it on their products and in their adds. Other companies will get jealous and want this as well. The market of companies who want to better package their products - raising environmental and social awareness - is endless.

But here‚Äôs the thing.  These guys are first to market AND depending on the feedstock, they can potentially sell renewable fuel credits because plastics would otherwise be made from natural gas.  That last part can be a significant portion of overall revenue.  Tesla would be an example of a company that‚Äôs been trying to monetize these credits (https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/news/tesla-seeks-entry-into-us-renewable-fuel-credit-market-by-tapping-biogas/ar-BB1gLloF)

Yeah the guy shorting this looks exactly like a diabetic parking cone.  And OP totally call MWA 3 months ago."
2021-06-25 13:49:21,wallstreetbets,I like it as a buy. But closer to $22-23. 14 day RSI extended.
2021-06-25 14:30:11,wallstreetbets,Having Pepsico on board gets me piqued (so piqued) thats a big name that wants to get to the ecological distribution before Coke. That would really help market their position as the sugar sludge for a New Generation.
2021-06-25 14:49:28,wallstreetbets,"Don‚Äôt under-estimate the liquor companies.  The company I was working with had contracts with Suntory to buy the plastic.  They were using pine bark to extract BETX and in their case the renewable credits on the BETX alone paid for the manufacturing cost.  Digesting what was left and making plastic was just a bonus - at least in the near term.  There is a so much opportunity in renewable fuels but the Biden administration is currently re-working the RFS so there‚Äôs some near term downside risk.  Biden is far less anti O&G than what most sensational media suggests.  Google ‚ÄòBiden Renewable Fuel Standard‚Äô.  Once that shakes out, I‚Äôm diversifying across multiple renewable fuel plays."
2021-06-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The case for LZB, and why you slept on it Right off the bat, that P/E ratio. It's about as stable as the S&P clocking in at about 16.9. But thats not what you fools want to hear. You see that drop recently? 10% dive on 6/15? That was a reaction to them saying they would be impacted by transitory inflation prices. Overreaction?? Thats what I'm thinking. No way LZB doesn't come back from that alone in the next two weeks. No loss in revenue, no loss in profits. In fact their sales are up 41% as of 6/15, yet people freaked out about increased supply chain prices. Seems like papi Powell is taming that beast with his massive beater anyways. Main argument for bears is the also increased demand during covid. I don't buy it, in my personal circle I didn't hear of anyone splurging on furniture due to being stuck inside. I think as the economy re-opens and people are more willing to visit one another, there would be an increase in demand due to visitation from friends family. Overall I like the stock. 5k 7/16 45C, 5k shares."

2021-06-25 15:29:09,wallstreetbets,"Up 69% (nice) on my 8/20 40c - probably still time to get in as this  looks like it will correct up to the $40-45 range in the next few weeks. Someone posted about this in r/options trying to get it to blow up like $GME lol, not gonna happen but it looks like a solid short term play. 

I'd get 40-45c for August to give it time to rebound without too much theta decay. My target price is $42 and then I may let a few calls ride if this picks up momentum. Would not hold for long above what seems like strong resistance around $45

Edit: dropped like 3% during power hour - should be a pretty enticing entry point if it doesn't look like it's tanking on Monday premarket/open (though that might actually be a good thing for this short term play...). I'll probably pick up some 7/16 40c and try to ride the momentum since it seemed like there was steady buying pressure all week prior to this mini-dump."

2021-06-25 19:10:37,wallstreetbets,"I think if it opens between 37.50 to 38.00 or under, you can get in on July 16 calls. I expect the stock to open between this range."
2021-06-25 19:11:07,wallstreetbets,"Lmao, I dunno if it was intentional or not, but this was great"
2021-06-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The stock you love to hate. RKT data for 6/25 exp. What up Peeps.

I'm here to talk about Open Interest data on RKT, not to give false hope.

RKT is currently sitting with 13,881 ITM calls for 19.50 to 20 for 6/25. It has grown exponentially over the last 24hrs. The more interesting factors are the slightly OTM levels between 20.50 and 22.

There are currently 24665 open interest between those levels exp this friday.

The current highest interest is the ITM 20c with 10,164 volume alone. With 9414 following that strike at the 20.50c

The New Open Interest seems bullish IMO.  Najarian from CNBC bought into RKT live on air at the end of the Fast Money broadcast. That may be what brought in the secondary spike. Mortgages are increasing with 9 percent increases in the last 2 weeks. That along with the new supreme court ruling, which helps more people get mortgages(I'm paraphrases the meaning). There seem to be a couple different factors that have led to this spike in interest.

Again. DYOR I know where I've bought calls but I'm also a degenerate gambler so take that for what it is.

Edit. Seems to be alot of strange after hours volume. Could be the Russell 1000 reshuffle or the ITM options exp today. Rkt closing above 20 was good."

https://preview.redd.it/q1daqypajf771.png?width=225&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd1612de07c3c011e38111ed4be8b0d5206de435

 I want to introduce you smooth brains to a company called Vuzix. Vuzix is a crazy fucking eyewear company that are essentially the future of manufacturing and surgical tools. Now, why is this important? Google tried to do this shit like 8 years ago and nobody cared, right? Yes, that's correct. There‚Äôs one other thing that's correct too. Google's attempt absolutely sucked and they did not pursue improving their product. Vuzix remains on the leading edge of smart eyeglass technology with over 146 patents. So, it‚Äôs too late google, you already lost this one. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/czqvyeqgjf771.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc7fcc46d770489304b2090036d56895d0e230d4

 

Anyway since I took one semester of an entry level laser course in college, I‚Äôm going to explain this technology to you. The waveguide technology employed by vuzix deliver high quality, full color images directly to your fucking eyeball. Now, these images are completely transparent so it allows the user to still interact with natural reality. This differs from other products, which deliver a useless opaque image.

Now how can this help with surgery? Do you remember when Tony Stark goes into repair mode while in the iron man suit?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vyrb1kyjjf771.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8fcee5ffcd29dc9d6fec61a83031e0094ef534b

 Yeah, that‚Äôs what these glasses do. They can provide a whole digital map of whichever part of the body they are working on. That‚Äôs not all. They can also provide a live video stream with an augmented reality presence in order to assist surgical techs in helping their surgeon. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yjujg42njf771.png?width=1417&format=png&auto=webp&s=622d7f16edb9c84a3d8224121077358f89714a02

 Now that I've showed you some of Vuzix's tech lets take a look at the third graders their up against:

* **Thirdeye Gen** \- really cool name, where‚Äôd they get that at? *Hot Topic??* Anyway, this company doesn‚Äôt hold a candle to Vuzix. They aren‚Äôt even attempting to use this crap in surgical applications yet, but they do have some implementations in healthcare by basically doing the same thing a tablet can do. This can also be said for their manufacturing applications as well. Plus, just look at these things:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bh6vfbhxjf771.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ebd116fe95f02e689942efd6209343ca8fc47b0

 

* **Microvision** \- Need I say more
* **Vrteek** \- Mainly just focused on virtual tours and videos. That‚Äôs cool, stay in your fucking lane.
* **Manus VR -** this is actually a really cool company, but their applications are more focused on digital production applications. This wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be a competitor at this time but since its along the same lines it should be mentioned

&#x200B;

 **Time to look at some numbers for you viewers with more then 10 brain cells:**

In 2020 Vuzix experienced very rapid growth. This can be attributed to technology finally catching up to the product as well as a lot of new big orders from reputable companies. In 2021 Vuzix saw sales increase 2.4 million dollars, or 177% year over year!!

* Data interpreted from Vuzix website show Quarter 1 2021 results at a 49% improvement year over year.
* Sales of their products show an improvement of 2,383,000 year over year as well..

**So , expenses.**

* Vuzix operating expenses reported in Q1 of 2021 were reported to be $7,654,000. Yes, these rose compared to the same quarter last year where operating expenses were $5,339,000. Obviously this is related to increased production.

**What does this look like per share?**

* Vuzix reported net loss per share of -$.12. Year over year, this is a -$.06 improvement.
* Vuzix is becoming more efficient. With increased sales and lower operating costs this company is pushing towards positive cash flow in the coming quarters.

**See below from vuzix website**:

I want to talk about this stock over the past few months. Vuzix saw an amazing run up in their stock price following both their quarter 4 2020 results as well as the q1 2021 results. Following q1 2020 the stock price rose an incredible 443% to an at the time high of $23.59. Q1 2021 results brought a slight dip in the stock price followed by another run-up of 30% to an all time high of $30.57. Sounds like some real fomo territory right? Following this impressive all time high this stock has seen a decrease of 43%. It now sits at $17.48 per share. A bit of a drop from its ATH (aqua teen hunger...force).

A drop in this territory is completely natural for a growing company. During a press release on March 26 Vuzix announced that they were offering 4.1 million shares of its common stock at $20.50 a share (compared to the stock price of $26.32 at this time). This was beneficial for the company to raise funds to put towards further r&d (ranch and dicks). Although this initially dropped the stock price, it then rose to its ATH of $30.57 just 2 weeks later. The following drop from all-time high can be related to natural selling of the stock as well as a maxim group downgrade from a ‚Äúbuy‚Äù to a ‚Äúsell‚Äù. This downgrade was most likely due to a dude with a less than average sized dick. It might also simply be attributed to the stocks very fast run up earlier this year, and is based solely on valuation.

So, where are we today? Definitely not the Wendy's bathroom...anyway. Over the past five days, the stock price seems to have bounced off of a new low of $15.64 on June 22nd back to a price of $18.05 on June 24th. It has remained within this range over the past 3 days.

 What am I driving at here:

Improvement in operating costs and increasing sales quarter over quarter show this company is becoming more efficient and are carving their name right into the fucking side of the augmented reality industry. Personally, I‚Äôm expecting to see killer earnings in q3 2021. A new (as of 06/02/2021) medical electrical equipment safety standard certification will push this equipment directly into the new remote medical environment created by the COVID epidemic. Anyway, I‚Äôm running out of steam. Maybe just ask Cathie Woods who bought the dip and added $13.5 million in Vuzix (as of 06/01) to the ARKW etf. She has previously added shares of Vuzix to the ARKQ fund as well. (I know, she didn't buy the top which in of itself shows some real development of her character)

TLDR: Laser image eyeglass company lets surgeons cut people open better. A recent drop in share price provides a great entry point for a company with a great future.

Positions:

2021-06-25 18:23:37,wallstreetbets,But can it run Minesweeper??
2021-06-25 19:32:42,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for feeding my confirmation bias. I already made a nice profit on VUZI during its previous run up to $30 (though sold a bit too late), but when the price had dipped to 15 something went long again because it still feels like a solid play, and unlike MVIS they have actual revenue from finished products. Believe it can actually run higher this time with a little help from FOMO, but the fundamentals support the idea too, the AR market is still largely untapped so there's little in the way of ceiling the stonk could hit."
2021-06-25 19:47:44,wallstreetbets,‚ÄúObviously this is related to increased production‚Äù LMAO how the fuck would you know that..

2021-06-25 14:57:57,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve used all of their products while testing an application and they all pretty much suck unless you‚Äôre wearing a helmet. Maybe surgeons will like it but the Blade and M4000 are garbage compared to google glass. The m400 is ok, but bulky af and it‚Äôs basically just a tiny tablet in blocking part of your vision. Intel made a bet on them, but this wearable stuff has a very narrow range of use imho.

That being said, you can play Free Doom on the Blade series. So there‚Äôs that."
2021-06-25 17:27:53,wallstreetbets,"The price is already $17.5 per share. Dude has all $18 calls, all I see is him trying to pump the stock to meet his calls."
2021-06-25 18:54:24,wallstreetbets,Most of these posts are bots.
2021-06-25 15:24:06,wallstreetbets,"I'm not a surgeon, but I've watched a lot of surgeries, and sometimes they let me hold a retractor or something like that.

If one is doing regular surgery, they don't want anything like this.  
If one is doing orthoscopic or laproscopic surgery, or robotic surgery then they only want to see the artificial world.

Also, patents don't last forever."
2021-06-25 16:43:44,wallstreetbets,"If you think that a 20+ year old company that hasn‚Äôt turned a profit in 16 years using tech that belongs in the same category as 3D TVs and whose main competitors are Google and Microsoft that‚Äôs currently up like 500% this year is a good investment, than you‚Äôre retarded. 

This DD is terrible. It leaves out huge, important facts about the company, including their inability to turn a profit since 2006, and that it‚Äôs a mature company (founded in the 1990s) run by its original founders that sucks.

They exist purely through stock offerings because actual AR tech sucks. You can buy Chinese headsets on Amazon for cheap that do everything Vuzix sets do. 

And Google has a whole enterprise business for Google Glass, and it‚Äôs been around for years. There‚Äôs just no business in the space because real AR isn‚Äôt the Vuzix photoshopped PR that OP is giving you. 

Do we all not remember the whole ‚Äúpeople couldn‚Äôt wear Google Glass anywhere because people would try to fight them thinking they were recording them because AR functions with a forward-looking camera?‚Äù 

And if the pandemic would make Vuzix profitable, why didn‚Äôt it? Sure, revenue was up a bit during the pandemic, but they did less business than a busy suburban pizzeria does. 

Snapchat released some new AR glasses just a few weeks ago. Big splash they made, huh? Honestly, when was the last time you heard about HoloLens or Glass? 

The ‚Äúoh their patents‚Äù stuff is bullshit too. None of those patents are for related, useful technologies. How do I know this? Because the company is 20+ years old and if they had such a profitable patent they wouldn‚Äôt be doing 40m in revenue a year lol. 

It‚Äôs a shitty company and this is shitty DD. I‚Äôll probably buy some calls anyway because you retards are going to anyway."

However, though - check out TILT5 https://www.tiltfive.com/

They're about to launch their tabletop glasses. I don't think this company will ever go public(unless Hasbro buys them out), but I'm glad it exists.

I've been following a lot of ar technologies these days. Next big thing."

I have no doubt AI will be used to record and replay particularly attention grabbing performances. Future of entertainment is very interesting when you consider it could be anywhere in augmented reality. All your favorite characters right there on your cereal box dancing or talking to you or whatever. Through social media actors could be hired to play any character, if you think about it branding is about to have a golden age. At least in my opinion."

2021-06-25 11:46:55,wallstreetbets,I had strong faith in spce but bought at the wrong time around $50 a share. Feels good today let‚Äôs go!

2021-06-25 14:31:32,wallstreetbets,100$ here we come

2021-06-25 17:18:38,wallstreetbets,What a poverty platform - but congrats bro.. What made you dump 50k into a retarded company like SPCE?
2021-06-25 18:35:41,wallstreetbets,if you consider a suborbital flight space i got some airlines you should invest in
2021-06-25 12:34:24,wallstreetbets,You did it wrong. I bought in at $56. Now just gotta wait for it to drop to $28 and sell the minute before it rockets to $84.
2021-06-25 18:28:08,wallstreetbets,I bought gme at 300 sat on my losses when they where at 50 and made profit in the end.. . . you and I could be related. . .

2021-06-25 13:02:12,wallstreetbets,link or bullshit
2021-06-25 19:03:30,wallstreetbets,The problem is valuation - how the fuck do you put price target on it? Is it cheap at $50? What DFCF models should be used.
2021-06-25 19:05:01,wallstreetbets,WTF is that platform showing it like you bought $50k worth of shares at $30.28?
2021-06-25 13:13:16,wallstreetbets,"Okay this is mostly a lie. But it's possible in theory, it just can't actually be tethered to earth, because you know, we spin around. It would have to start within our orbit and we would have to launch ships to a base connected to it."
2021-06-25 19:11:41,wallstreetbets,"For me it boils down to personal risk. And common sense or lack there of. I know Richard Branson. He has the Midas touch. He has been building companies before i could gamble. He will find a way to make money. 

You don‚Äôt bet against a man like that. Either you get on board or stay out of his way."
2021-06-25 19:18:01,wallstreetbets,Because it is 50k in shares.
2021-06-25 13:53:57,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't that cost more than the GDP of the entire planet?
2021-06-25 19:24:44,wallstreetbets,"you were right. I was just looking at another spce and mixed up my comments because I was talking with my dad and talking shit on reddit. other guy turned 4,000 into 68,000 today."

2021-06-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$GE: an autistic take by a degenerate So first off i wanna say im autistic and still relatively new to this forum but theres a stock i wanna talk about. Yes, you can clearly see by the title. Sorry just thought you apes were autistic as i was. This is my first DD but this stock that i am about to talk about seems like it can become a fat boner if i am hypothetically correct with my research.

So $GE as of now is at 13.13 which isnt too shabby considering its fall down. Recently i seen tremendous volume last week and got curious about so this is what i found:

‚Ä¢GE ownership is comprised of approximately 35% general public and 65% institutional investors.

‚Ä¢Hedge funds don't have many shares in General Electric 

‚Ä¢Lower share price because of high debt. They are very aggressive in paying of the debt and will have gone from $105 billion in 2020 to $45 billion in 2023.

‚Ä¢Top 25 shareholders own less than 50% of stock. No hostile positions or major sell offs. 

‚Ä¢10x higher free cash flow inflection for 2022 than in 2020

‚Ä¢Analysts slapped the stock with a high PT of $21 stating that its a strong buy 

Statistics:

Short Interest Ratio / Days to Cover: 1.5

Percentage of Shares Shorted: 1.27%

Current Short Volume: 111,290,000 shares

Previous Short Volume: 97,490,000 shares 

Short Volume Ratio	14%*

* i think i might me off but pls correct me in the comments

(source: https://fintel.io/ss/us/ge )

Some other news surfacing: 
‚Ä¢Integra Life Ceo Peter Arduini stepped down and went to GE ( useless info but makes stock boom higher)

‚Ä¢1-8 stock spilt on July 30th which would typically been seen as a sign of weakness but really the leadership team in okay, their shifted focus, and their commitment to paying of debt. This makes it seem like a position of a roaring comeback.

‚Ä¢The 1-8 stock split could make the stock share range around the $100 mark on Aug 2 (But 8 shares are combined into 1 share). This is done only because they have around 9 billion outstanding shares which is too much. This would bring it down to 1 billion which aligns with other companies in the S&amp;amp;P 500

‚Ä¢GE, Safran developing cleaner energy aircraft engines that could work with hybrid technology, hydrogen.

So Whats The Point?: 

As much as i can shove this useless information into you autistics, I think this is stock has potential for growth and is changing into aviation and energy which could come big in the coming years. Maybe a roaring comeback for $GE??? 
(I could see this as a new GME or AMC)

Positions:
20c 8/20 8buys

17c 9/17 10buys

20c 9/17 20 buys

25c 1/21/22 20 buys

I plan to buy more as my paychecks come

*as always do your DD. Don‚Äôt blame me if you end up working behind Wendy‚Äôs with me. This is my bullish instinct."

2021-06-25 11:33:26,wallstreetbets,Definitely a long-term hold. Been doing covered calls to make up for the lack of dividend. Once they cash flow enough to pay a real dividend I'm gonna get fancy honey mustard for my tendies.
2021-06-25 11:38:06,wallstreetbets,I was gifted 732 shares around 2005 and it‚Äôs plummeted since obviously. Refuse to sell it until I turn a mighty profit just in case my grandpa was on to something. I can just hear him saying ‚Äúwhat are you a fucking moron‚Äù if I even think about selling it
2021-06-25 12:31:31,wallstreetbets,"I have a mixed feeling when it comes to a company that is going to do a reverse split. From my understanding, it is artificially pumping up the stock price and with that usually the new stock price won't last, not all the time but most of the time before it is consolidated and gain momentum again after a while.....  Unless numerous people creating meme or unreasonable hype out of it which it will change the sentiment and the momentum - causing a disruption... Either way, it's interesting in my opinion since this company has fundamental that worth to be looked at and it's definitely on my radar sometime in the future."

2021-06-25 12:33:49,wallstreetbets,from my understanding the reverse spilt was done in order to match their outstanding shares to other s&p 500 companies. this shows me that they feel confident and can grow with the new ceo. this might actually might be a good move for the company

The price will have to be consolidated after the reverse split then I can safely invest my money.

&#x200B;

Short interest has been rising almost everyday the past week, and is likely above 40% right now. They do not want Canoo to go higher than 10, and have borrowing nonstop to do so. And there is more...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y0k4pj2pef771.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=68c6a13730685a7154bcc0c5b7c44e1553decd4a

The borrowing fee spiked to 46% today from 27%. What does this mean? More short sellers are interested in borrowing shares today. Why? Because they need the extra firepower to keep the stock price low, since 12 MILLION SHARES will be bought in what will feel like an instant (last 15 mins of trading). When WKHS was added to the Russell 3000 last year, the stock went from $9.90 to  $20.91 in less than 3 days.

**Result:**

Canoo is one of the least talked about reconstitution plays right now. On the day of reconstitution, volume is still under 1mil at 11am ET! When volume jumps (which it will), the shorts may not have the firepower to keep the price down, and you know what that means...üöÄ

""The newly reconstituted indexes take effect after the market close on June 25.""

So, there was no russel inclusion today as OP stated would happen. There was no 12mil shares bouyout in last 15minutes as OP claimed would happen and IBKR, Yahoo Finance and TradinView all agree on that.

I really, really do not know what are you looking at and what are you reading.

On the plus side, no it did not happen today but it could happen on monday if anything that OP has written is true, since now we know that a lot of it is not."

Inclusion happens after market closes, so for any purpose of (forced) trading it did not happen today.

2021-06-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"‚ÄúThe Great Resignation‚Äù + 401ks I‚Äôve been considering the spike in resignations recently and concluded this:

With new hires new 401k accounts are being set up with default account management portfolios set up per the agreement between the Employer and the 401k Companies like Wells Fargo.

As people get these new accounts, many will keep defaults or neglect the accounts completely. By examining the prospectuses for the default trusts, we can identify which securities will be purchased by those accounts.

People are buying stocks and don‚Äôt even realize it. Given that these accounts will purchase these default securities we can purchase them because the accounts will buy them regardless. 401k accounts don‚Äôt worry about price jumps, they just consider it doing a good job.

Haven‚Äôt aggregated that data yet but will soon.


Thoughts?

TLDR; 401ks are buying default stocks according to their servicer, so buy them and let them inflate the assets themselves, profit."

I understand the concept of buying calls, but the gains above (1282.25%), is that the gains from the price of your call going up rather than the stock price in and of itself? Basically when Nike stock price went ip, your calls became more valuable and people started bidding up the price of your calls? To realize the 1282% gain, you would sell your calls?"

2021-06-25 11:37:40,wallstreetbets,Using slavery in one part of the world to profit while promoting wokism in another is well beyond poor ethics.

2021-06-25 11:22:24,wallstreetbets,But a movement can. And believe me when I say there's a lot of folks that won't buy Nike and are spreading the word about their business practices. When you see New Balance shoes on someone remember this conversation.

Nice hit but this could have gone the other direction as well."
2021-06-25 12:24:57,wallstreetbets,Not big enough for nke. Nke has about a 250b market cap. GME at its highest was 24b. Amc is currently 24.78b. Our 2 biggest is only 20% the market cap of NKE. Fighting nke would be a losing battle
2021-06-25 12:31:33,wallstreetbets,Fighting them by turning their customers off isn't. There's several companies that where huge in their industry that the start of their downfall was a boycott. Look at their profit margin all it takes is a sustained reduction of that and they'll collapse. It could all start with a email campaign to the sports figures that take their money.
2021-06-25 12:39:05,wallstreetbets,"And as much as I would love that to happen, the free market of america would never allow that to happen. Too many people buy their products.

Do that mean more inflation? On top of massive government spending not seen since WWII. #transitory What do you think?"

2021-06-25 11:06:56,wallstreetbets,"Gold never should have fallen from the 2011 highs, never should have sold off last September, never should have sold off last week. The problems of 2008 were never solved. They Fed was unable to raise rates and sell off their balance sheet BEFORE all the covid spending, the dollar was fucked BEFORE all the covid spending. I don't understand how everyone can be this collectively retarded and put their money in literally bankrupt companies or companies with 500+ P/E ratios. Gold companies beat earnings every quarter, increase dividends, have P/E ratios under 20. One day gold is going to pop, the longer it takes the bigger the pop.

I am hopeful that if we can get the vaccines fully rolled out in the developed nations and a good start on the developing nations then we should have the global economy fully opened and the supply chain should smooth out over the next 6-9 months depending on source of supply.

Mid 2022 will be when we see what actual inflation is and hopefully it will be moderate but there should be wage inflation as the global economy has lost millions of workers but the price inflation should be moderate as the world has lost millions of consumers due to early deaths.

Let's just hope the virus doesn't mutate further and reduce or eliminate vaccine efficiency."

  I believe it is, with the expected IPO valuation between $21-$24 a share. Although in the short term demand has been up, and Krispy Kreme has been playing big in the retail space, it's lack of profitable and large amount of debt will leave this stock with a target on its back. I expect shorters to try to exploit this stock, and it seems that it could have potential as a ""momentum stock"". 

  Plus, the ticket is literally DNUT, doesn't get much better than that."

My personal take that yes they are huge companies, and they so carry so much cash, however, without these big companies, the US economy wouldn‚Äôt be the same‚Ä¶. Thats just my take on it.

And then as people buy they pull out before the big news flash that WKHS won't be getting anything from USPS, their model isn't making money even if bought, no international business model, etc etc. Stock plumets.. us retail morons are left bagging.

EDIT: PS- is it WISH or WKHS up 18% vs 4% WKHS in 5D?"
2021-06-25 11:02:22,wallstreetbets,"CLOV is ready to moon, btw the ortex data is \~ 2 days behind."

2021-06-25 11:15:20,wallstreetbets,"The one question you actually asked me was written backwards, so I'll ask you.. why is WKHS doing worse than WISH and CLOV if it's so good?"
2021-06-25 11:16:03,wallstreetbets,Have you looked at the stocks today? If anything CLOV n wish are pump n dumps
2021-06-25 11:18:08,wallstreetbets,"Zoom out a bit there, eagle eyes. All 3 of those stocks will tank in the next few weeks because they're P&D's."
2021-06-25 11:19:34,wallstreetbets,"How is WKHS a pump & dump with very little volume, your going to regret backing the wrong horse üôåüèºüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
2021-06-25 11:22:45,wallstreetbets,"Low volume is only going to hurt you when they pull the rug out from under you.

Just look at the name of everyone pumping WKHS. Just type WKHS in the WSB search bar and read names... You will see ""adjective-noun-number"" and account ~ 5months old on 99% of the posts.

If that's not an obvious P&D idk what to tell you man."

2021-06-25 11:27:32,wallstreetbets,"Y'know, I just looked and I was wrong about the WKHS posts. Most of them were not from the typical Adj-Noun-# manipulator..

Maybe it'll moon, idk, good luck mate!"
2021-06-25 11:29:50,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm very confident in this stock, I was on it before the high shorted %, if you believe in a different stock that‚Äôs cool, good luck to you too"
2021-06-25 11:31:42,wallstreetbets,"I don't really have an exciting stock pick at the moment. I overlooked WKHS because of all the potential downfalls, like if they don't get USPS to suddenly change their mind for no reason then they're kinda screwed? What makes you confident in them as a business to hold their stocks?"
2021-06-25 11:38:10,wallstreetbets,"A lot of catalyst, this board hides a lot of DDs but they just past 300m towards EV charging stations and biden wants all EV, they have been testing drones that deliver packages to houses then comes back to truck , passed all the tests and they are working with UPS not postal on it, look at ups drone video. Also this price is reflected of the loss of a contract that minimum I believe will get a partial contract, definitely worth your time to do a little research and see what you think"
2021-06-25 11:44:35,wallstreetbets,"The drone videos made me do a hard 180. Those drones were faster in 2017 than 2020 and none of the problems have been solved.. I'm confident in the idea, and someone else will come up with a better docking and releasing system and make it happen, but this ain't it.

I've read the DD but they're kinda the same things, ""trying to get contract back"" and ""high short low volume""

What else is there? What makes you think with such low volume they the shorts aren't legit in thinking that WKHS will go down?"
2021-06-25 11:57:11,wallstreetbets,Also I believe the market cap is very low compared to similar companies that haven‚Äôt produced 1 delivery vehicle yet
2021-06-25 11:53:57,wallstreetbets,"If you don‚Äôt believe the drones how about the fact that this was a $42 company based on speculation, I strongly believe they‚Äôre getting minimum a partial contract from USPS and although there delivery numbers are low they actually have some Companies using their trucks, Ford GM Vans are not the same as WKHS what they call step vans , yes there are things like low production, but look at GameStop & AMC 2 dying companies and just on volume & üíéüôåüèº they both had squeezes, I strongly believe a little bit of good news & if it had 1/2 the volume that CLOV n wish have it‚Äôd be minimum $30/45 right now and that would scare all the shorts but it‚Äôd be too late and I see very similar #s as GameStop if not higher. If the companies stock goes up that just gives them more cash in hand and they‚Äôll be able to increase production significantly"
2021-06-25 12:13:24,wallstreetbets,"Okay, I am almost on board, gonna think about it more. I like that they actually have electric trucks out.. even if some stuff falls through they could do something with it.

2021-06-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"BMW x PALANTIR [DD] $PLTR  Hey /r/wallstreetbets I want to share the newest information on the BMW Palantir rumour. It is almost 100% certain that BMW is using Foundry at this point, here's why:

**NEW:**

Three days ago [this article](https://businessam.be/bmw-wil-de-productie-van-een-auto-een-kwart-goedkoper-maken/) was released. (NOTE: It's in Dutch (Belgian site)), I will give translations of the important parts. The German newspaper HandelsBlatt has interviewed Milan Nedeljkovic (CEO of Production at BMW and board member).

**Some translations:**

In doing so, Nedeljkovic emphasized that the company wants to reduce production costs per vehicle by 25 percent by the middle of this decade - compared to the level of two years ago.

**25% DECREASE IN PRODUCTION COST**

""Among other things, the introduction of software for better planning of production processes should lead to a reduction in cost price,"" Nedeljkovic argued.

**""The introduction of software for better planning""**

Alright, for the people who are reading this that think ""But why would this be Palantir?"" let's see what we know already.

**Job Listings:** [**https://www.bmwgroup.jobs/en.html#fullText=Palantir**](https://www.bmwgroup.jobs/en.html#fullText=Palantir)

**Let's look at the description for the Big Data in Electric Mobility:**

Proficiency with Azure & Kusto Data Explorer, **Palantir**, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and other data analytics tools.

**Let's look at the description for the Data Analytics in Vehicle Architecture:**

For this purpose, **we use** numerous internal and external data assets as well as tools such as ImpACT / **Foundry by Palantir** or Tableau to analyze and visualize our data.

A quick Google search leads to the LinkedIn profile of Antonio Bauer, who is a Senior Data Scientist at BMW Financial Services. Guess which platform he has listed under his skills? Palantir Foundry.

**Finally**, and finally because this one is hard to confirm, a link to an earlier Reddit post where someone claims to be working at BMW Munich and using Foundry. (And Indeed job listings from BMW x PLTR like the ones above)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/PLTR/comments/m8o8cx/next\_big\_automotive\_contract\_bmw/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PLTR/comments/m8o8cx/next_big_automotive_contract_bmw/)

TL;DR:

BMW uses Foundry and **aims to reduce production cost by 25%** over the next few years."
2021-06-25 10:12:04,wallstreetbets,Buy more PLTR
2021-06-25 10:46:45,wallstreetbets,"If anything, this article made me realize how behind BMW is the data revolution and how little they know about it. A 25% reduction. Either their existing systems are pathetic or they don't know what data science can really do."
2021-06-25 10:29:33,wallstreetbets,Thanks for sharing and translating it. There are information about what it seems a Tesla and Palantir parnertship. I‚Äôm long with $PLTR and not selling in the coming months.

2021-06-25 15:39:01,wallstreetbets,"Why are we talking about every single pltr deal? Ffs, companies similar to palantir, let's say other ERP makers, make sales every few days and it's normal. Having a new client isn't newsworthy IMO"
2021-06-25 12:44:02,wallstreetbets,Fake News. Just a fucking Pump.
2021-06-25 12:26:31,wallstreetbets,"I worked in Germany for a somewhat big corporation in general and auto industry. They are really lagging behind, going oldschool for a lot of things.

I tried suggesting to use PLTR but they were too lazy to make an analysis on it, and told me to do it. I said fuck it.

It will take really long for a lot of companies to accept it. But eventually they will"
2021-06-25 12:13:09,wallstreetbets,Not selling ever cause i. BELIEBEEEEE
2021-06-25 10:32:36,wallstreetbets,Super weird
2021-06-25 15:48:17,wallstreetbets,"Why? Because reducing total cost by 1% would already be huge for BMW and here we are talking about 25%, literally billions of dollars each year. This would put them in an excellent spot against competition and is simply way more efficient. If just Foundry can reduce 25% of production cost then this isn't 'just a new sale' . Palantir isn't any other ERP maker, check the already realized success stories on SkyWise."
2021-06-25 13:42:44,wallstreetbets,Same. I honestly wish Reddit would forget this ticker. I don't want their stink on my beautiful prize pig.

In the first screenshot the shares are definitely too old, GME hasn't traded that low in a long time. Some of the options plays might count but it's hard to tell. We would have to do a lot of inferring from past price action to figure out if the positions are fresh enough (like, this week).

2021-06-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"ThredUP - The world's largest online thrift store (Easy DD for retards) **TL;DR:** Online thrift store operating through consigment sales. They are vertically integrated (unlike all of their competitors) and are able to buy clothing for pennies on the dollar, process them in distribution centers and resell them online, netting them 72% gross margins. They have a *RAAS* (Resale-As-A-Service) with Wallmart, Gap, Abercrombie & Fitch, etc..  

Short interest is 31% with 4.56M shares shorted and 6.7 days to cover.

**BASIC INFO**

&#x200B;

* ThredUP has a **huge moat** in the resale industry. Many people (especially those with nice clothes) are not interested in reselling their clothes through websites like Poshmarck, Depop, and the others. For them time is money, and getting a few bucks trying to sell 4-5 pieces of clothing to end up getting $80-100 after spending weeks making listings, deal with customers, packing, shipping, returns, etc..  is not worth it. They would rather package it in a box, send it to ThredUP and earn a percentage depending on the selling price ([PAYOUT TABLE](https://cf-assets-tup.thredup.com/luxe/luxe_payout_structure.pdf)). In 2020 they had 428,000 active sellers and the CEO stated they can't keep demand. 

&#x200B;

* As Gen Z grows up, many of them will shift from selling their clothes personally in Poshmarck and Depop to consigment sales. As supply starts to go to ThredUP, the demand will follow.  

&#x200B;

* In Q1 2020 they had 1.29M active buyers and proccessed 1.13M orders. 

&#x200B;

*  The company is heavily focusing on **automation and AI learning** . They understand that working in economies of scale volume is not the only factor to profitability. 

*""We believe that the order economics that we currently observe in our DC02 and DC05 facilities illustrate what our full platform could achieve over time, as we complete ongoing technology and engineering improvements and replace our legacy non-automated and lesser-automated facilities with new automated facilities"".*

**UNDERVALUED**

Depop was bought by Etsy for a premium of 20x revenue 1 month ago while having absolutely no moat against other websities like Poshmarck or Mercari, which are all the same.

While Depop only had $70M in revenue Etsy paid $1.6B for the whole company. ThredUp will have $220M revenue 2021 and is trading at 10x revenue.

2021-06-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"OCGN Due Diligence. Disclaimer: This is for my personal use I'm just sharing what I do and this is one of one of the first times doing due diligence my self I would like to hear destructive criticism about what I could do better or what I should try. Anyways time to get into the news!

&#x200B;

As seen on the OCGN chart, the stock dropped 40% from June 7 - June 14 due to Covaix pursuing a  license application for (‚ÄúBLA‚Äù) instead of what was intended originally which was the Emergency Use Authorization (‚ÄúEUA‚Äù). As seeing this I saw a easy 40% to be made, but then I realized there was going to have to be very good catalyst for it to bounce back up or even go to new highs. Taking this into consideration I like to look at the past catalyst and news and charts.

[OCGN 6 Month Graph](https://preview.redd.it/owkrxynlye771.jpg?width=742&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8890ed2547e9581ab1087397c157b916b51f0b1a)

Now seeing this I tried to make up what's next for Covaix and that's the actual approval for the BLA plan which takes 74 days. This could be a potential boost when that comes out in the mere future but until then I believe Investors will take notice which they have been! OCGN is up 34% every since it bottomed out in Jan, 14 and its 5 day graph looks like its not going to stop any time soon.  


All in all, yes this is a risky trade which OCGN's price targets being lowered after its new intention to go BLA but so far Investors think different. OCGN to the moon and thanks for reading some of my first ever made DD. Give me feedback and have a great market day!"

I started in the 8s and ended up with an average in the upper 6s.when it finally did pop I paper handed and sold too early and missed the run up to 15 again.

2021-06-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Benefactors of the Infrastructure Deal - $CAT $CX $HON $KKR $X  It's been a long time since I posted on WSB. Tbh I got distracted and lost motivation to post. Maybe it was the meme stock deliria. Maybe it's because I have been hiding on $TWTR. Regardless, I come to you all today with 5 stocks that will benefit from the infrastructure bill.

Biden announced yesterday that Congress has agreed on a deal for a $1.2 TRILLION bipartisan bill to renew the infrastructure of the United States. The bill will be a two-step plan that is linked with another bill focused on home healthcare and child care. $1.2 trillion might seem like a lot but it falls grossly short of the $6 trillion that many progressives were hoping to secure to tackle all of the country's pressing issues and ~~siphon billions to members of Congress~~ ensure a brighter future. Further, it's likely that there will be more backlash from the right as the President declared there will not be one without the other - both bills must pass. In summary, this bill is not guaranteed to pass and will likely face scrutiny from both sides in the coming months.

The eight-year proposal contains $109 billion for roads, bridges and major projects; $73 billion for power infrastructure; $66 billion for passenger and freight rail; $65 billion for broadband access; $49 billion for public transit; and $25 billion for airports, according to a White House statement. That's roughly $400 billion. Where the rest of the budget will be siphoned off to I do not know. One thing I'm sure of is that I'll be closely watching Nancy Pelosi's trades for the rest of the year.

So let's get to the stonks that could benefit the most from the large spending plan:

**$CAT**

Caterpillar is probably the most iconic and well-known manufacturer of construction, mining, and agriculture equipment. When you see a yellow 100,000lb vehicle rolling by you should immediately think Caterpillar. This company makes asphalt pavers, compactors, excavators, pipelayers, bulldozers, backhoes and pretty much every other machinery you would need for a major infrastructure overhaul.

CAT struggled for a long time due to weakness in commodity prices, construction and mining projects, and emerging markets activity. All of this changed last year when investors warmed up to the idea of infrastructure spending sparking an economic recovery. Commodity prices have recovered, construction and mining projects will increase in number, and it is likely that emerging markets will spend more on infrastructure in the next 5-10 years (the company sells to over 180 countries).

The market cap is 120B. The dividend yield is 2.08%. The stock is up \~77% from the 52 week lows.

The recent drop in price looks very similar to the COVID-19 crash last year. Note that the price rallied >30% from the lows of that crash. RSI is signaling the stock is oversold in this territory - it hasn't been this oversold since the COVID-19 crash. The stock responded really positively today to the news as soon as the President announced it.

Possible plays:

More risky - CAT 9/17 260C

Less risky - CAT Jan22 250C

Least risky - CAT shares collect that dividend

**$CX**

Mexico's jewel, CEMEX, is a producer of cement, ready-mix concrete, and aggregates. It also offers various industrial services. Recently, CX has been moving higher with tailwinds from the housing boom. Additionally, investors have been piling in with speculation of higher infrastructure spending. If the infrastructure bill is passed there will be copious amounts of money spent on roads and highways. CX is pretty much a can't lose play as it is both a pandemic and re-opening place and the stock was trading at all-time-lows a few months ago.

CX operates in many countries but has a larger presence in Mexico and the United States (note that its business in Mexico also indirectly benefits the US and vice versa). Numbers attributable to the US in 2020:

29% of revenues

45% of assets

15% of production capacity

The company has a market cap of 13B. The dividend yield is low at 0.63%. Management is optimistic as it raised its 2021 EBITDA guidance to $3.1B and cut net debt by $2B driven by increased FCFs, sale of CO2 credits, and issuance of $1B in debt.

I love the chart. Remember previously I mentioned that the stock was trading at all-time-lows. Check out that solid base build up since mid-2019 followed by a sharp increase and higher average volume. RSI is trending up since the beginning of 2020 but it's not currently signaling that it's overbought.

Possible plays:

More risky - CX 8/20 10C

Less risky - CX Jan22 10C

Least risky - CX shares - short volume is at 13% for all you squeezers

**$HON**

Honeywell is not as directly tied to infrastructure as some names, but without a doubt many of its diverse products will benefit from an infrastructure deal. Specifically, the Building Technology and Performance Materials & Technology business segments will benefit the most.

I'm getting lazy and Honeywell has a large variety of products and services so here's a description of the two business segments mentioned above taken directly from the 10-K:

""Honeywell Building Technologies is a leading global provider of products, software, solutions and technologies that enable building owners and occupants to ensure their facilities are safe, energy efficient, sustainable and productive. Honeywell Building Technologies products and services include advanced software applications for building control and optimization; sensors, switches, control systems and instruments for energy management; access control; video surveillance; fire products; remote patient monitoring systems; and installation, maintenance and upgrades of systems. Honeywell Forge solutions enable our customers to digitally manage buildings, connecting data from different assets to enable smart maintenance, improve building performance and even protect from incoming security threats.""

""Performance Materials and Technologies is a global leader in developing and manufacturing high-quality performance chemicals and materials, process technologies and automation solutions. The segment is comprised of Process Solutions, UOP and Advanced Materials. Process Solutions provides automation control, instrumentation, advanced software and related services for the oil and gas, refining, pulp and paper, industrial power generation, chemicals and petrochemicals, biofuels, life sciences, and metals, minerals and mining industries. Through its smart energy products, Process Solutions enables utilities and distribution companies to deploy advanced capabilities to improve operations, reliability and environmental sustainability. UOP provides process technology, products, including catalysts and adsorbents, equipment, and consulting services that enable customers to efficiently produce gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, petrochemicals and renewable fuels for the petroleum refining, gas processing, petrochemical, and other industries. Advanced Materials manufactures a wide variety of high-performance products, including materials used to manufacture end products such as bullet-resistant armor, nylon, computer chips and pharmaceutical packaging, and provides reduced and low global-warming-potential materials based on hydrofluoro-olefin technology. In the industrial environment, Honeywell Forge solutions enable integration and connectivity to provide a holistic view of operations and turn data into clear actions to maximize productivity and efficiency. Honeywell Forge's cybersecurity capabilities help identify risks and act on cyber-related incidents, together enabling improved operations and protecting processes, people and assets.""

[https://sec.report/Document/0000773840-21-000015/#i8bfcf46146ba43fc956d0412589a6718\_13](https://sec.report/Document/0000773840-21-000015/#i8bfcf46146ba43fc956d0412589a6718_13)

In summary, HON products and services make homes, offices, plants, and other buildings and infrastructure better and smarter. Although Honeywell won't be building large structures and paving roads, it's products will be used in many aspects of the building process and final product of the infrastructure plan.

US Government sales increased 24% in the last 2 years. The company has a market cap of $151B. The dividend yield is 1.71%.

Average volume has decreased since the March 2020 drop. RSI is trending down but the stock is unlikely to dip below support in my opinion. I like HON because it's a lagger; it didn't get much attention today.

https://preview.redd.it/8t9dx44fze771.png?width=1909&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9dd1b0f46e5bbec6bf6f58606855abda0f21953

Possible plays:

More risky - HON 9/17 250C

Less risky - HON Jan22 280C

Least risky - HON shares collect that dividend

**$KKR**

KKR is a reputable name that benefits largely from scale. The company is a leading global investment firm that manages PE, credit, and real assets. KKR first established its Global Infrastructure strategy in 2008 and is one of the most active investors in infrastructure around the world. The firms manages over $27B in infrastructure assets and has made over 40 infrastructure investments around the world. KKR is very interested in renewable energy assets that support a clean and sustainable future. KKR will benefit from infrastructure demand in the US and internationally.

""Over the last 10 years, KKR has executed $19.5B in renewable assets with a power generation of 12.5 GW. In the past year, KKR made investments in Caruna, Finland's largest electricity distribution company, NextEra Energy, the world‚Äôs largest generator of energy from the wind and sun, Virescent Infrastructure, a newly created platform to acquire renewable energy assets in India, and First Gen, one of the Philippines‚Äô largest independent power producers.""

[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210412005123/en/KKR-Enhances-Focus-on-Renewables-Investing-with-Appointments-to-Global-Infrastructure-Team](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210412005123/en/KKR-Enhances-Focus-on-Renewables-Investing-with-Appointments-to-Global-Infrastructure-Team)

As of March 2021, the company's Private Markets business line had $177.6B AUM, $49.7B of which was in real assets (real estate, infrastructure, energy). For the three months ended March 31, 2020, the infrastructure investment portfolio, which is comprised predominately of privately held investments, increased 6%. The company has a market cap of $35B.

Please note that I touched on KKR infrastructure in this post. The company invests in way more than just infrastructure.

I like the short-term chart. This is a nice cup with a wide base and increased volume on the way up. The RSI is signaling that it could be overbought, but that would be expected at the end of a cup pattern. I would expect the price to dip a little (maybe form a C&H) before moving up.

Possible plays:

More risky - KKR 8/20 65C

Less risky - KKR Jan22 75C

Least risky - KKR shares

**$X**

U.S. Steel is a reputable name in the industry. The company is well diversified in steel, petroleum, construction, real estate, chemicals, etc... With such diversity, the company has cemented itself in the supply chain. U.S. Steel will most definitely gain from a large infrastructure bill. We saw how steel reacted earlier this year when commodities were really hot. U.S. Steel and others in the industry will benefit.

Note that the stock has struggled in the last decade and higher risk of dividend cuts. The company has a market cap of $6.6B

U.S. Steel is a good play - but it's a boring play. So do your own DD on it. Here's the 10-K go wild:

[https://sec.report/Document/0001163302-21-000013/](https://sec.report/Document/0001163302-21-000013/)

The stock has been trading up on higher volume. Falling below support a little but bouncing yesterday on the infrastructure news.

Possible plays:

More risky - X 7/23 28C

Less risky - X Jan22 30C

Least risky - X shares

&#x200B;

TLDR check the possible plays sections for options plays. If the infrastructure bill passes then these stocks will boom."

2021-06-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$CLF - Looking Bullish - No triangles, lines and circles only - I promise. Part 2: 4 days later. Last Sunday I posted CLF TA that analyzed positive momentum to start early this week. It did, from Monday onwards. In this post I want to look how the situation has developed, and introduce few points why I believe that CLF has broken the pattern and will break its channel in the coming weeks.

*I suggest that you will have a quick glance at the* [*Part 1*](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o44912/clf_looking_bullish_no_triangles_lines_and/) *TA (3min read) - the information in Part 1 will aid understanding why I propose what I propose in this Part 2.*

***TLDR; Channel will break - Rockets and Bananas***

# 1 Day Chart

**Intro:** CLF has been in a rigid channel for 4 months now. The price movement has been quite predictable, but I am expecting that to change in the near future and that is also why I opened my call positions last Friday although that was quite a speculative play, and this week has made my speculations to have stronger ground. Lets look at the indicators first though.

**Indicators:**

* **Heikin-Ashi** has been on the green for two days now - upward momentum
* **Volume** is higher on average than during the past 6 months
* **MACD** is turning around - Also higher low (the blue arrow)
* **STOC** turning around - upward momentum
* **RSI** indicating CLF has room to grow

[1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/cd9vt08cne771.jpg?width=1415&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abb258ceb37d4905bdedf69c248faf5142695bae)

**Blue 1 - Orange 2 - Yellow 3 - Green 4 - Breaking the Pattern.**

In each run up CLF has recently done the pattern is similar: after colliding with the top of the channel there is a consolidation that takes roughly 1 month and somewhere in the middle it hits the bottom of the channel.

This new pattern is different. As per usual after hitting the top of the channel the price came down, but it came down really fast, especially after **June 16th**. Remember that date. That was unusual so I opened my positions around $19.95.

Look at each of the colors. It should be evident that 1 is the most similar to our current situation 4. Orange & Yellow look very different to the situation now, and early last week I was expecting the exact same thing to happen, it didn't.

I'm not going to go through each indicator in each event, take your time to look at them in detail if you  want. Our current pattern most importantly has lower crossover at STOC than 1 had, it had crossed earlier. This in theory means we have more room to grow.

# 4h / 180d Chart & the thesis

The indicators are not important here although they are looking very promising.

1. Around **June 14th - 16th** everything was looking normal, the usual slow drop to hit the bottom of the channel was evident. Then on June 16th CLF raised financial outlook for Q2 & FY21

*"" The company now expects second-quarter and full-year adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion and $5 billion, respectively. This compares to the prior estimates of roughly $1.2 billion for the second quarter and around $3.5 billion for the full year. ""*

2. Also on **June 16th** JP Morgan initiated CLF price target to **$39**.

Great news for CLF! So the price should go up right? Wrong! After the 16th the price dropped hitting the bottom of the channel in accelerate pace.

*In my personal opinion* the reason for this event is obvious and the follow-up is *speculatively very positive*. CLF is looking much better than what the channel has been aiming towards to.

In order to aim much higher, CLF had to consolidate and quickly hit the bottom of the channel so it could start accelerated upward momentum that will breakthrough the top of the channel.

After that, a price discovery phase begins and new channel is formed.

*But this is all personal speculation.*

2021-06-25 09:53:25,wallstreetbets,"I think people tend to forget that ArcelorMittal sold \~ 38 Mio CLF Stocks (or about 7.5% of all shares outstanding) between 9.June and 18.June, which certainly resulted in huuuge selling pressure. 

On the other side there was high buying power involved to soak those, which is bullish af.

30$ until ER on 22 July should be realistic, then with still freaking high HRC Steel Futures and further increased guidance, market will see that this company will literally earn itself multiple times in the comming few years.

I just hope that they will use the free billions not for some stupid shot-term shareholder gift, but rather to erase its really high debt, which will destroy every shorty investment case."

2021-06-25 17:31:55,wallstreetbets,"Since reaching zero net debt is highest priority, I think dividend will be on the table once this goal is reached.

Cash would otherwise only be needed for M&A Activities. But since they recently bought 2 companies (thats why they are so highly levered in the first place) and the fact that they already are completly vertical integrated, I dont see any need for that. 

It will be hard to do more horizontal expansions because every steel company in the peer group will have really high valuations by the time they reach zero net debt, so just paying out dividend from a money-printing, 0 debt company should be the best way to create shareholder value."

2021-06-25 14:47:41,wallstreetbets,Him doubling down after nothing changed during the crash of Feb allowed him to add another 10 digits. Which was neither luck or timing as loads of apes jumped ship as the discounts went to $40-60.

2021-06-25 11:19:42,wallstreetbets,I actually bought 200 shares last month and sold 50% away last week for some gains.

2021-06-25 11:27:45,wallstreetbets,Finally some small comeption to spacex and huge competition for blue origin.

2021-06-25 13:28:00,wallstreetbets,"I have 100 shares of SPCE, and sold a $40 1/21/22 call for $700. Now it is worth $2200. What are my options to get out of this? Do I buy it back and sell another for a higher price? Any autists out there?"
2021-06-25 13:58:08,wallstreetbets,Really wish I had bought my shares two days ago.  Been trying to wait for AMC to run off.  Hasn‚Äôt happened.
2021-06-25 14:01:39,wallstreetbets,If SPCE goes below 40 I'm yoloing $1000. Will be my first purchase of over $1000
2021-06-25 15:05:50,wallstreetbets,"Finally I called something right. 156% up and climbing, bought in at 19.50 üòé"

2021-06-25 17:26:22,wallstreetbets,I like this a lot... I bought SPCE at \~$26 a share and it popped almost $16 today. I was thinking of dumping it but glad I held.
2021-06-25 18:38:37,wallstreetbets,I randomly chucked money on this at 31.29 cos space is cool. Not too shabby
2021-06-25 18:53:22,wallstreetbets,"Hey guy who told me not to buy when it was at 20, remember that I succeeded by not listening to you"

2021-06-25 18:51:21,wallstreetbets,How many rides do they need to sell to justify the market cap?
2021-06-25 18:52:24,wallstreetbets,Ridiculous that this stock went up over 300% in a month. Market euphoria on full blast again.

2021-06-25 11:03:33,wallstreetbets,"I am retarded, I sold all my stocks at 46.50 bucks, thinking there's no way it can go up after 20% pre-market gain..."
2021-06-25 11:09:46,wallstreetbets,"Sold this one at $29 and thought I was a hero. Sold TTD two days ago, just before it jumped $10. I'm never selling anything again."

2021-06-25 11:51:30,wallstreetbets,"Sold my JAN 23 37s when it hit 47 this morning, figuring on rebuying on the retrace. Given how consistently this has been gaining, I should've known how stupid that was. Profit is profit but it's hard not to regret what could have been. Back in with 500 shares, will switch back to calls once IV dies down."
2021-06-25 12:00:41,wallstreetbets,Slingshot. Engaged.

2021-06-25 12:21:56,wallstreetbets,"Been holding since Dec 2019 a little after the IPO. Only regret is not buying more back then, but still massively up.

2021-06-25 13:11:00,wallstreetbets,Last night I planned to sell today when i woke up. Glad i didn't do it.
2021-06-25 13:16:23,wallstreetbets,Only 50 shares but at 190% up‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ never been in this position
2021-06-25 13:18:23,wallstreetbets,Bought this last year at 19.26. Rode the wave to 59 and crash back to 17. Held. And now I think if the next flight goes well it will stay high. WOOOOO

2021-06-25 15:26:49,wallstreetbets,Up for 41 percent already trading higher than AMC. Madness
2021-06-25 15:33:12,wallstreetbets,So that's why space jumped 38 percent today
2021-06-25 15:39:30,wallstreetbets,So buy?
2021-06-25 16:27:13,wallstreetbets,"I bought in at 15 bucks, have sold 2. One a few weeks ago when it was 38 bucks a share... and one a few minutes ago. I'm keeping a share... should I dump my profits back in now and hope for 100$ share?"
2021-06-25 19:35:38,wallstreetbets,Got in at 18$ a share woooo
2021-06-25 15:45:38,wallstreetbets,Getting approval is one thing. But common people can‚Äôt afford it. It‚Äôs probably more profitable in a few years. But not this year
2021-06-25 11:32:28,wallstreetbets,Just like it works in places like Amsterdam in Norway and Sweden and Denmark people want to work they will work they just want to be paid what they're worth and not slave labor like we've had in America for the last hundred years
2021-06-25 12:17:56,wallstreetbets,SPCE is a joke. Selling calls is free money right now.
2021-06-25 19:31:13,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't it be cool if the space ship blew up?

2021-06-25 17:52:58,wallstreetbets,"Previous all time high was 65. With this news following a recent successful launch, the company is clearly in a better spot now than it was then. So take that for what you will"
2021-06-25 18:43:15,wallstreetbets,Wait until that plane lands. Sell at $100 and take dem profits.
2021-06-25 09:07:35,wallstreetbets,Up 20% in the pre-market! Been watching the development of all of this since Burt Rutan made this possible during the Ansari X-Prize.
2021-06-25 09:23:49,wallstreetbets,lets goooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!! im in on that bitch it feels good to be in on a stock BEFORE it goes up

2021-06-25 12:22:30,wallstreetbets,The IV on those calls is now sky high man. Better off buying shares at waiting for the stock to trade sideways for a few days before doing that.
2021-06-25 11:17:25,wallstreetbets,"I sold my 7/16 $50c's this morning @4.20.


I tried not to be greedy and really fucked myself there."
2021-06-25 09:32:34,wallstreetbets,"Not so soon. Figured thered be at least a few more 
test flights before FAA approval. Everyone was speculating Branson would have to find a workaround to take his trip, and get arbitrary certifications and stuff to pretend to be part of the test crew. Now that they got FAA approval he could fly tommorrow if he feels like it and livestream an orgy in microgravity with a bunch of civilian hookers."

2021-06-25 11:27:38,wallstreetbets,It'll probably pull back a little between now and the next test flight. That's probably your best best if you still want in.

2021-06-25 18:27:07,wallstreetbets,Stock was ripping in Feb and they cancelled their test flight morning of scheduled flight (which was Saturday). Most people were predicting successful flight and then rip to $70 on opening Monday morning. Damn thing fell to $15
2021-06-25 11:24:33,wallstreetbets,"I put $5K in (about 25% of my life savings at the time) at $55.67 on Feb 9th. I held it the whole way down and just got rid of it on a $56 sell limit order a few minutes ago, lol."

2021-06-25 12:19:55,wallstreetbets,Not until end of July or august. Space announced summer flights are on track. Flights this summer are just going to keep pumping this higher and higher.

2021-06-25 14:54:56,wallstreetbets,Yup.
2021-06-25 12:22:39,wallstreetbets,Same here. Not being greedy pays off in the longer run.  Every time I was greedy I fucked up big time.
2021-06-25 12:29:21,wallstreetbets,"Same. Big aviation and aerospace aviation enthusiast here. I knew the FAA was looking at certifying VG, but I honestly didn't think it'd happen before the final test flight. 

Catalysts are Branson's launch and final test flight. Let's go"
2021-06-25 12:45:26,wallstreetbets,I'm banking on the OnlyFans catalyst. You'd better be right.
2021-06-25 15:42:49,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, that puts the move into much better perspective."
2021-06-25 12:17:07,wallstreetbets,Hell yeah. I think it will after this report. There isn‚Äôt a way to stop em. Like this had been coming for a while. Now wit the FAA approval it‚Äôs game on hahah üòéüöÄüöÄü¶çü¶çüíéü§≤
2021-06-25 12:03:05,wallstreetbets,Thought that was the way. No loss porn if no loss.

2021-06-25 08:52:23,wallstreetbets,or other rumor is  18.07 his B-day. For me it doesn't matter it's close enough :)
2021-06-25 10:48:58,wallstreetbets,I believe on the 4th there will be another crew and SRB will fly on the 18th
2021-06-25 15:00:16,wallstreetbets,"Will he have any paying customers on that flight? If so, then the next price jump will be huge."
2021-06-25 09:21:37,wallstreetbets,"> buy low > sell high > buy high > baghold
 
   
You messed it up a little, but ended up bagholding anyway, so that's a win in my book."
2021-06-25 19:27:26,wallstreetbets,"Text book fomo, I totally screwed my 16 dollar average buying more at 49 around the same time, I was afraid the rocket was about to takeoff and I didn't have enough tendies for the rip trip."
2021-06-25 09:47:19,wallstreetbets,It was the spike right before the first expected test flight this year that got scrubbed and pushed out until last month.
2021-06-25 19:36:23,wallstreetbets,"Horrible 
Tragic 
Planned"
2021-06-25 11:21:32,wallstreetbets,"We're here, hop on!"
2021-06-25 10:20:26,wallstreetbets,me too ive been in since january
2021-06-25 12:26:12,wallstreetbets,That's what my immediate thoughts were. I ended up putting a 10% stop loss on half my shares with the intention of rebuying them if there is a severe dip. Letting the rest ride.
2021-06-25 11:28:28,wallstreetbets,I have 1 share in at 15 and then the rest at 30 and I want to screenshot but I heard it‚Äôs bad luck
2021-06-25 11:32:43,wallstreetbets,ayooo 200% babyyyy
2021-06-25 09:58:35,wallstreetbets,Bro my dick is turning into stone rn
2021-06-25 17:37:52,wallstreetbets,$250k roller coaster rides are not the next Amazon.
2021-06-25 13:33:04,wallstreetbets,A squirter in space could probably pull some big numbers.
2021-06-25 17:46:50,wallstreetbets,"Yea man, it happened like... completely out of nowhere. They only had the recent successful test flight and the company has been hush hush about everything. They keep everything on the down low. I wasnt aware they were even SEEKING approval at this stage and I have alot of shares and follow them pretty closely. It caught me and alot of others offguard, everyone knew FAA approval was an obstacle for them SOMEDAY but as far as the public knew they were only MAYBE planning at most two more test flights this summer and thats it. (Neither has even been confirmed). Like I said, the company is so quiet about everything, and doesnt brag at all. Think the opposite of elon musk.  

So the curveball out of nowhere that the FAA up and certified their spaceplane is fucking crazy news. Thats why I bought expensive calls all the way out in october, I was only hoping for a decent bump from a couple rumored test flights that may or may not happen this summer. 

The FAA thing noone expected to happen anytime even remotely soon. Especially with their history... (There was an accident that killed a pilot in an earlier test awhile back.)"
2021-06-25 08:53:57,wallstreetbets,"Either way, we flying high in July, ladies and gentlemen."
2021-06-25 13:14:16,wallstreetbets,I'm betting on the birthday date as well
2021-06-25 13:00:41,wallstreetbets,"There's only 12 months in a year, europoor"
2021-06-25 19:24:37,wallstreetbets,"If they notched two successful flights in July it could actually hit 100, serious."
2021-06-25 15:03:22,wallstreetbets,Nope. Commercial flights start 2022 given no further delays.
2021-06-25 10:08:45,wallstreetbets,"I sold at the spike, about $56 (from an average of $24)....and dumped my profit back in for only a $2 dip before the missed window......god knows why I didn't wait until after, must have been some serious fomo"
2021-06-25 17:30:09,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt think there will be a massive sell off unless something bad happens but it could drop slowly overtime depending on how long they take to announce next flight imo
2021-06-25 12:02:36,wallstreetbets,Sweet. I'm up to 163 now. Also my dam calls sold so I made a little cash. Might buy back when they dip
2021-06-25 13:07:10,wallstreetbets,"I'm so hard, a cat couldn't scratch it!"
2021-06-25 08:55:29,wallstreetbets,that in the end only matters. Good luck spcetards
2021-06-25 14:39:36,wallstreetbets,Branson wants to beat Bezos so it needs to be before July 20.
2021-06-25 15:12:52,wallstreetbets,Cool. Thanks for the info. Looks like I will be holding onto that stock for quite some time then.
2021-06-25 10:12:18,wallstreetbets,"There was a lot of hype still, and I think we were all hoping for a new flight date announcement relatively soon after it scrubbed. I held, but was kicking myself there for awhile. Just glad my bags lightened today"
2021-06-25 10:34:51,wallstreetbets,is it too late to hop back in? I was in at like 39 but want to get back on the wagon before Bransons flight
2021-06-25 10:20:14,wallstreetbets,"Yeh, i was going to try and lower average over last few months when it dropped back into the teens but i had no spare cash"
2021-06-25 12:16:45,wallstreetbets,"Nah, if Branson flys in July you can easily double your money from here. 100$ a share easy."
2021-06-25 10:23:29,wallstreetbets,"Same. I managed to average down to 33, but I really wanted to double down when it was at 15"
2021-06-25 15:49:00,wallstreetbets,"Yeah there are basically two possibilities: he lands safe and $100 a share, or he goes up in flames and 0 a share.  His spaceship first flew in 2004 though so it's gotta be one of the safer ones by now."
2021-06-25 15:38:29,wallstreetbets,Now that's what you call  üåà**Math**‚ú®
2021-06-25 10:35:27,wallstreetbets,"Ahh well, 33 you are looking good now, congrats!"

2021-06-25 12:34:51,wallstreetbets,"It's worth more than 45 bil.

First : patents and naming : they get 365 mil last quarter, or 1.46 bil a year, free money. at a p/e of 20, that alone is 30 bil.

Now, they have their mobile networks branch, bringin in 2bil a quarter. With reefshark, that's projected to have a 10% margin. So 800 mil a year profit. In a growing industry, at pe of 20 thats worth 16bil.

Togheter thats 46bil, excluding their cloud and networking division. But wait, that's from their Q1 intrim report, which is in euros. So that 46 bil should be 55bil dollars.

Their income statement should reflect this.

Note, i have 1k shares, 15 2.8‚Ç¨ dec 25calls and 10 3.2‚Ç¨ december25 calls (or the equivalent of 3.5k shares) because i didn't want to keep myself to dates.

Palantirs whole entire business is built around making it unnecessary and unprofitable for their customers to ever develop in house solutions rather then just buying a fresh ready made palantir product. Plus rumors are spreading about pltrs potential partnerships with BMW and possibly other auto manufacturers. it just wouldn't make any sense for tesla to ignore palantir at this point.

2021-06-25 08:47:16,wallstreetbets,u/zjz has a twitch livestream with this stuff.
2021-06-25 09:24:31,wallstreetbets,Smh. What is that?
2021-06-25 09:43:21,wallstreetbets,AMC knows how u feel
2021-06-25 14:56:08,wallstreetbets,"Sad. Although i am happy that I'm on the wall as #34 biggest holder of gme on diamond hands io

Unless I've been kicked down the list."

2021-06-25 07:58:30,wallstreetbets,"That's entirely correct. 

Different strategies for different stocks."
2021-06-25 08:01:57,wallstreetbets,It's basically unstoppable at this price.
2021-06-25 10:35:04,wallstreetbets,It should jump soon. It did jump at 197 last time real hard as well
2021-06-25 11:35:23,wallstreetbets,I've seen multiple people say that.  Why?
2021-06-25 06:48:35,wallstreetbets,"A single PSFE DD after months based on ""I feel it will go up"" and all of a sudden DD's everywhere with more awards than comments"
2021-06-25 12:16:27,wallstreetbets,"How do they beat rkt? Srs question, idk how they stack up"
2021-06-25 08:51:17,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm in OCGN too. Sold a few calls yesterday. Hoping to roll them into august calls today. 

You buying 0dte calls??"
2021-06-25 09:11:16,wallstreetbets,"‚ÄúActual retard‚Äù isn‚Äôt an insult. It refers to a person who defends GME and AMC from naked shorts and ladder attacks, and who has a very low IQ and knows nothing else about the markets, sex, life, anything really. Just amc, gme, naked shorts, ladder attacks and that‚Äôs it really. That‚Äôs what an actually retarded person is. You likely won‚Äôt understand if you‚Äôre actually retarded, so no offense retard."
2021-06-25 09:26:12,wallstreetbets,Dude get a life and don‚Äôt speak if you don‚Äôt know wtf you are talking about‚Ä¶ your $200 investment doesn‚Äôt mean your cool
2021-06-25 10:47:16,wallstreetbets,"End of the day is a possibility, but that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs never worth putting dates on things. Same thing with T+21 yesterday.

Just need to relax and let it do it‚Äôs thing."

2021-06-25 07:32:32,wallstreetbets,Can you elaborate?
2021-06-25 08:32:53,wallstreetbets,Bb?
2021-06-25 06:33:30,wallstreetbets,"Well since I own no shares and only calls for today,  I guess when 4pm hits.... it'll be like I took 4 Viagras"

2021-06-25 11:00:18,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-25 10:39:49,wallstreetbets,Lol ok üòÇ
2021-06-25 10:40:43,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I've seen that but is that the only cause for the high vol right now?"
2021-06-25 10:43:29,wallstreetbets,"That's why I posted under shitposts. I know people are easily triggered about stocks they aren't being forced to buy, sell or hold. Tis a very sensitive group of individuals on Reddit aka Beta Town. üòÇ"
2021-06-25 16:57:06,wallstreetbets,Yeah no might have been premature ejaculation it died off xD
2021-06-25 13:20:43,wallstreetbets,"It's very likely a local top will see its fair share of sell off. You have time to roll a higher strike out and buy it back when it tempers off.

That's what I'm hoping anyway. Have 3 $25 cc for August myself"
2021-06-25 10:37:25,wallstreetbets,So any actual advice? Otherwise I'd have to assume you're just as retarded as me lol
2021-06-25 07:27:17,wallstreetbets,PLTR quietly  moving up while nobody is watching.
2021-06-25 07:30:15,wallstreetbets,Check out this guys comment history for a laugh
2021-06-25 07:45:50,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve had AMC since January!
2021-06-25 07:01:41,wallstreetbets,WSB has changed‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve spread our buying power too thin among many crappy stocks. GME and AMC are barely mentioned anymore
2021-06-25 09:16:50,wallstreetbets,Lmao nice earnings call yesterday ü§£
2021-06-25 07:15:54,wallstreetbets,nah i just bought some cuz i like the industry and it's treating me well
2021-06-25 07:07:46,wallstreetbets,"Im hoping for a bounce from Russell, but yeah it isnt likely going to boom like WKHS."
2021-06-25 07:07:56,wallstreetbets,Agree that no moonshot is happening (depending on the definition of moonshot.) But it's popular right now because of the Russell inclusion that happens after market close today. So there's a good chance it goes up today and the beginning of next week.
2021-06-25 07:14:08,wallstreetbets,Uwmc is that ex I keep fucking everytime she goes down.  Then she ends up thinking we are back together and over staying her welcome in my portfolio. We have had some good days together but they are far outweighed by the bad.
2021-06-25 10:14:50,wallstreetbets,"Meanwhile the volume is low too, lol."
2021-06-25 08:48:21,wallstreetbets,Ooh a whole thousand? Save me a seat in the bugatti
2021-06-25 08:39:29,wallstreetbets,On June 10th I bought 300 shares at 9.88 and have watched it pull my portfolio down for two weeks
2021-06-25 09:52:01,wallstreetbets,Lol at throwing more money at a bad stock and thinking you are doing well
2021-06-25 14:23:58,wallstreetbets,"Ya. I started this morning, and I'm thinking of buying it back now that it's dropped."
2021-06-25 09:39:27,wallstreetbets,Lol you definitely not a bot. That's good dd.
2021-06-25 10:37:57,wallstreetbets,All of em
2021-06-25 13:19:42,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that‚Äôs correct. Voting shares were the requirement they missed I believe"
2021-06-25 11:01:05,wallstreetbets,"oof, I'm sorry for your loss"
2021-06-25 11:58:23,wallstreetbets,I see and agree with you.  It's just sad to see the volume be this low.
2021-06-25 12:55:14,wallstreetbets,Incorrect. Most fund managers will buy today after the market has closed.
2021-06-25 11:40:03,wallstreetbets,Russell 2000!
2021-06-25 11:38:13,wallstreetbets,People say that about every meme stock
2021-06-25 12:26:11,wallstreetbets,"They are wholesale while RKT focuses exclusively on retail and originations, which they do week but is expensive and they advertise massively which is also expensive.

UWMC is also moving into new markets like jumbo loans, too.

Edit: I own both w RKT being about twice the size of UWMC so I‚Äôm not trying to put one in a better light."
2021-06-25 12:30:17,wallstreetbets,"Short story is low overhead (tech and broker based), will steal market share when rates rise (less focused on refinancing than RKT) and last but most importantly big dick energy from the CEO."
2021-06-25 14:18:53,wallstreetbets," Because UWM has mortgage servicing rights (MSR). This allows them to collect fees throughout the life of the mortgage. So, if rates go up and lending goes down, they still have revenue streams. RKT is more geared for refi's and doesn't have MSR."
2021-06-25 15:40:18,wallstreetbets,"From personal experience as a real estate agent Rocket fucking sucks. Probably why they are so refinance heavy- their service is too godawful to handle original loans. 

With this very long period of rock bottom rates you're running out of market for refinances. For the next bunch of years you're going to have a bunch of people holding onto their <4% loans. 

New loans however never dry up, people will always be buying houses. UWMC is much better in that market."
2021-06-25 08:52:31,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-25 09:19:27,wallstreetbets,"Are you using logic? Wtf. You're not one of us. Quit shilling your garbage uwmc. 

We're on to you."
2021-06-25 13:46:19,wallstreetbets,Very strange. Lots of pain.
2021-06-25 09:44:53,wallstreetbets,She just told me you‚Äôre definitely gay
2021-06-25 09:28:26,wallstreetbets,"Honestly now, who researches this stuff? I just follow the memes and shitposts to decide if I want to eat üñç."
2021-06-25 09:30:21,wallstreetbets,"Most of the time when I read the word bullish, in my mind I replace it with bullshit. Because nine times out of 10 that's what it is. 

Wsb has gone to trash. Cannot believe I worked for karma, just to sit here and watch spastic retards spam the thread with zero data or DD. 

SMH."
2021-06-25 07:03:22,wallstreetbets,I'm pretty sure they just have a big dart board with all the tickers on it and they have apes throw darts at it blindfolded.

Also almost 19% SI as of this morning for AMC"
2021-06-25 10:31:32,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but what is it about?"
2021-06-25 07:14:52,wallstreetbets,Wkhs isn't likely to go boom either.  Just sayin.
2021-06-25 09:57:11,wallstreetbets,lil story my friend‚Ä¶ started uwmc at dam near $12 was able to avg down to $7.77 avg up to over $8 and sold for $12k profit and now I‚Äôm back in at $9.02x 5000
2021-06-25 10:40:29,wallstreetbets,"So nothing? Your post history reads like a 101 guide on how to loose money so I thought you may be referring to a specific tweet he made.

On another note, you need to start posting more of your positions publicly so that the rest of us can inverse them and make some easy money Lol."
2021-06-25 12:57:55,wallstreetbets,I'll take a look at it again. It you are right please accept my humble upvote.

2021-06-25 11:39:31,wallstreetbets,I don't consider UWMC a meme stock as I've actually made money on it.  :)  That and it seems like a actual good company that is making a lot of money.
2021-06-25 13:07:53,wallstreetbets,"Last part especially true. He‚Äôll give you a red bull and vodka, RKT will give you a werthers original."
2021-06-25 08:57:05,wallstreetbets,"Well at least 12 is cheap. I have one of those that I bought weeks ago. Bled ~80%. I held it bc you just don‚Äôt know when OCGN might pop. If there‚Äôs news then that 12 call could be earn you 1500%, if there‚Äôs not, you might lose your 20 bucks. Seems like a good bet. Buy at noon, that‚Äôs when IV drops. I hope our calls earn 1500% next week."

2021-06-25 09:52:14,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs with the downvotes you shill
2021-06-25 08:42:51,wallstreetbets,i still bounce between the two because this one is still bigger with more users. its scary how effective their communist type censorship is though. a lot of people here are unaware because any mention of it gets a ban and comment wipe. reddit in general is pretty anti free speech but WSB mods now are off the charts stalinist tier

Meanwhile it seems you had heavy bags everywhere and sold. That‚Äôs why I said you should post more of your positions publicly on WSB; the rest of us could make some easy/free money doing the exact opposite and you‚Äôd be a legend for it."

Agreed on those two tickers. My flavors of the week are wish, bb, and a little wkhs.

I don't know why when I talk shit about uwmc, people automatically assume I'm for gme and amc. I kinda get it, but it's wrong."

2021-06-25 07:18:31,wallstreetbets,"Hey it's me, your friendly stock ~~pumper~~ your friendly ~~government official~~ your friendly friend, USFederalReserve.

This is your^probably ^one ^time pre-market scan and ban, where we scan premarket movers above 1b mkt cap and select WSB names. Remember our motto: You'll always be a disappointment to your mother. Also remember our context: these values are changing every minute (literally even as I type this) and we're still in the piss-poor pre-market phase. Do not confuse these with intraday predictions. This is to gauge early morning activity, use this to whatever advantage you want. 

**CLOV**

- Volume Delta [net shares bought/sold]: -4.2k

- Volume: low volume, trending to sell. Likely flat until we approach premarket. 

- Current bid: 13.74

- Close price: 13.79

- Next major resistance: 14.20/14.50

**AMC**

- Volume Delta: 1.3k 

- Volume: Strong, trending to buy low prices w/ large push in liquidity at low sup points.

- Current bid: 56.26

- Close price: 56.70

- Next major resistance: 56.50/57

**WISH**

- Volume Delta [net shares bought/sold]: -142k

- Volume: High volume, within last 5 minutes all of which trended for downside

- Current bid: 14.41

- Close price: 14.39

- Next major resistance: 14.76/15.00 (largest support @ 14.00, highly likely to change)

**GME**

- Volume Delta [net shares bought/sold]: -920

- Volume: Extremely low volume, almost impossible to get meaningful statistic out of it. 

- Current bid: 216

- Close price: 212.31

- Next major resistance: Unlike other mentioned stocks, GME's order book is largely absent of activity this morning, likely in an attempt to not telegraph moves. Similarly, it could be that there just isn't as much interest in the stock as you think there is. 

**Big Market Movers *above 1bn mkt cap**

Edit: worth mentioning there are SEVERAL stocks mooning at so much higher of a caliber, however, I'm not getting banned again for <1bn mkt cap stocks so you're stock with the boomer list. Learn2Scan if you want to see the lower mkt cap stocks. 

**SPCE**

- Currently up 10.38% to 44.58, prev close 40.26. Volume is trending for higher prices as this pump is less than 30 minutes old. 

- Volume delta reached a staggering 60k at pre-market high, however in this flag formation it's made that volume delta has fallen to 6.8k. It is of my opinion that this indicates a large number of shares were purchased and rapidly sold by a single party. Could be fodder for a higher gap for whales to unload, could be manipulation to short at a higher price. 

**NOK**

- Currently up 2.7% to 5.29, prev close 5.14 

- Price increase came before after hours trading completed, pre-market trading has held up this price on much smaller volume. 

- I'm a NOK shill, I like it alot. DYOR. Not a fast money stock.

2021-06-25 15:03:54,wallstreetbets,"When you buy a call with an expiry several months out, say 6-8 or maybe even longer, and soon after you buy it the stock has a huge pop, what do you do? Do you sell or keep it knowing that it probably has an 80% that it'll drop? What's a good strategy for long dated calls that go really green soon after buying?

Edit: I should have pointed out I'm talking about when you only have 1 and you can't find a cheaper call to buy back. If I have more than 1 I'll sell 1 and let the rest ride. Or if I can find a cheap one for 1/2 the price further up the chain, I'll swap it. But there are times when I can't do that and it kills me to sell it when there's so much time left. lmao"

GS receives both underwriting fees and then sells shares on the stock market after pumping them. Furthermore, with cash received form SPOs SHOP is purchasing stakes in companies (Affirm, Global-e) that later do IPOs. Those IPOs are underwritten by‚Ä¶¬† GS. SHOP investments in these stocks are meaningless, they don‚Äôt have more than 1%, they can‚Äôt even appoint a director to the board. But those investments are very close to yearly R&D expenditures of SHOP. Why they do purchase stakes instead of developing their own system? The only reason why they do it is to support high valuation of these companies for underwriter - GS.
I suppose that situation is even worse. Shopify doesn‚Äôt have cash to purchase those meaningless stakes. The cash and cash equivalent balances in audited financial statements 90% consists of marketable securities that GS borrows them for annual audit to put them in the balance sheet. This is the reason why SHOP did SPO so early this year, to purchase GLBE and Stripe that if I am correct will be underwritten by GS. When there will be no more IPOs to pump, SPOs of SHOP will stop and it will declare bankruptcy because that have around 50 USD mln. The companies that SHOP has stake in are their suppliers, so when SHOP declares bankruptcy because it won‚Äôt be able to cover its payables to suppliers, those companies will just offset stakes against liabilities. Those companies received their cash and they are good."

2021-06-25 07:34:22,wallstreetbets,"SPCE might be a good play but only if it keeps pushing higher. Pretty dump to buy the top of a pump that happens in premarket. 

You might see banks push hard on stress test results, could see some good 0dte plays there with decent liquidity. 

TSLA is always a go-to for 0dte's. High liquidity, big swings, justifiable volatility. 

You can try falling/low volume during premarket meme stocks in premarket, such as CLOV, WISH, AMC, GME. Someone would have to double check IV, but I'm fairly certain that CLOV would have the lowest IV, if not then WISH. 

Don't play 0DTE's on SPY, its extremely likely we stay stuck in a rangebound holding pattern like yesterday. We may see some large volatility going into close, but I wouldn't be surprised by a totally uneventful .5%+/- day."

But every now and then we get a breach of those edges. Now there are billions of dollars on both ends of that range and what happens when you get a breach of the upper edge is trading firms start buying S&P futures contracts en masse to hedge their gamma risk. Their emergency servers kick on and the algos just buy which caused an explosion to the upside.

in terms of % change. no data to back it up, just observation. plenty of reasons for rotatoins, but i guess my question is actually is there a play to be made when those stocks complete rotation between those two scenarios? o ris this just something not worth reading into?

edit i guess i kinda answered my own question by asking. if those stocks actually  alternate like that and im not just imagining, then for example if you believe that they naturally gravitate to the first scenario and rotate to the second scenario on news or whatever, you could just wait to see the second one established then buy the tits off qqq."

2021-06-25 11:48:26,wallstreetbets,"yeah mine is shitty also.  i'm going to get on the board because mine is being run like a retirement community and in the past year we've had a lot of families with young kids move in (mine included), and the HOA is just straight up complaining about it and telling people they cant put playsets in their back yard, that kind of shit."

2021-06-25 13:35:24,wallstreetbets,"This is the lowdown according to rep:

Not only do you need $250K, you need it in one account and fully owned (not on margin). You cannot request to lend out shares, they reach out to you. I also confirmed that they don‚Äôt lend out your shares, and if they do you they reach out to you for agreement. 

I requested to lower my margin interest, and they said that hardly ever happens, but if bringing in new money they might offer you a carrot. 

I previously looked into becoming an Accredited Investor (AI) to get into IPOs early before the poors. Well that takes $500K and even if approved I am sure they rank order those offers as well. 

Really is motivating me to retire early and claim Active Trader Status (ATS) and move over my 401K so they give me a little better reach arounds and accommodations."

 A House subcommittee on Thursday approved a large-scale funding bill that includes provisions protecting banks from being punished for working with marijuana businesses and allowing Washington, D.C. to legalize cannabis sales.

The move by congressional Democrats to let the District of Columbia set its own marijuana policies is in contrast with a budget released last month by President Joe Biden, which proposed continuing the longstanding Republican-led rider that has prevented the city from spending its own money to regulate adult-use cannabis commerce.

The banking-related provision is less far-reaching than more robust standalone bills the House has passed on four occasions, but would still provide some protections to banks that work with state-legal marijuana operators.

This is just my opinion but I have been doing the DD on this for about a year and everything points to these 3 companies starting with Curaleaf to be by far the leaders of the industry for at least the first decade Curaleaf bought the largest European provider a few months ago to become the world's largest provider Sundial is not going to be a bigger more profitable company then them ever."

2021-06-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Alexion (ALXN) / AstraZeneca (AZN) merger. Hi all. 
First time poster here and trying to get some clarity on my first experience of a merger where I hold both stocks. 

The acquisition of ALXN by AZN is due to be completed by the end of Q3 2021 from what I have seen.

The merger will result in ALXN share holders being given shares of AZN and $60 cash which equates to a total value of $175 per ALXN share. 

With the value of ALXN currently at $180 (as of today) is now a good time to sell ALXN whilst the value is higher than shareholders can expect to achieve at completion of the merger? Or is this a good sign of future value?

Does anybody have any experience of a similar situation that might help me understand what I could expect?

Fully appreciate that no one has a crystal ball. 
Just looking to get more informed before I cash out or hang on for the ride. 

Thanks"

2021-06-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$250K FATE YOLO (119k in options) - A bet on Cancer-Murdering (Biological) Nanobots &#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hm12grn7wc771.png?width=1039&format=png&auto=webp&s=ede6248636eb677be808a7748dc3c7997588253f

I have a YOLO on $FATE with 90x $90C for November (\~ $119k), as well as 1750 shares (\~$150k). I didn't post the shares because no one would find long 1750 shares interesting. But, total of \~$269k

I roll calls every couple months since no LEAPs (made money a few times before).

My target price is them getting bought out, or holding until it's such a disgusting amount of money I can't help but sell some of it - that to me is a 10 or 20 bagger hopefully.

Most of you have not heard of this stonk. It has very little short interest, and aside from expert gambler Bill Hwang's ally Cathy Wood buying it all the time, it looks like another speculative cancer biotech stock sporting a large market cap ($8 billion), years from having a product they can actually sell. So yes, this is not a short-term trade, it's an investment.

So why am I doing this? Three reasons.

1. Fuck cancer. Really, progress against it is one of the best things that can happen.
2. I want to make money, and I think they are an excellent buyout target this year. If they don't get bought out or don't want to be bought out, I'm happy to ride the stock forward. If they succeed at their mission to make programmed immune cells that wreck solid tumors, as the arguable frontrunner, as I said, I think the stock could possibly be a 10 or 20 bagger over a \~5 year range.  And, I think they have a very good chance of achieving the solid tumor side of this.
3. We've all talked about how in 'the future' we'd have cancer-murdering nanobots and how awesome that would be and how we'd definitely want to invest in that kind of thing. Well, they are here, in biological form, and you can in fact invest in such a thing with $FATE.

&#x200B;

**VERY LONG EXPLANATION**

The longer explanation is that they are in a really hot space - cell therapy for cancer. The best way to think of this field is that it's the art and science of turning normally occurring T Cells and natural killer cells into highly engineered psychopathic nanobots that eat cancer in a murderous rage, while not doing the same to healthy tissues (and having a programmed suicide switch just in case!)

There was a rush on this tech a few years ago with companies like KITE and BLUE, and it involved harvesting some sort of immune cell from patients (usually T-cells, but sometimes Natural Killer cells), modifying them a bit usually (With CAR-Ts, which have to do with the recognizing targets), proliferating them, and then re-injecting them. This did work pretty well against some types of blood cancers, but its slow, expensive (artisanal per patient), doesn't accommodate a lot of gene edits, and can't be ""off the shelf"" - you put it in another person, and there's a good chance those immune cells recognize EVERYTHING in the new body as cancer (""Graft vs Host Disease"").

There were some intermediate versions that are still in development that solved this GvHD issue and are 'off the shelf"" - so they can be mass produced, are a lot cheaper, etc. Those are what you might consider gen 2.0. They are pretty great, and may get approved before FATE's stuff, but most of these have limited gene edit capacity, so will be much less versatile and much less able to work into beating solid tumors (lung cancer, liver cancer, etc) which are expert at resisting immune responses. They are also clunky to work with, so if you want to buy some gene that someone developed and use it, it's a real pain to integrate it...

Enter the solution to all of that, which Fate is using. The newest tech involves using immortal cell lines (that thus can be gene edited an unlimited amount of times), and then engineering them until you get something even more effective against cancer... also with the off the shelf properties of gen 2. FATE is one of these companies, and is using ""induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which are made by hacking normal adult cells to become stem cells, which can then be engineered to have appropriate genes, then differentiated into their natural killer cells for fighting cancer.

I feel they are the leader of doing this with Natural Killer cells. The current public company alternatives are TAK (large market cap, fairly far along), IPSC (less far along, but similar approach), and ALLO (which licensed from Notch which is similar). There are some various other alternatives using other approaches that are similar, but I see those as the most advanced. And there are other companies focused on a similar idea with T-Cells (FATE has an early T-Cell IND but there's not a lot of info about it) Overall, it's a very hot space, I just think FATE has the best momentum and a stream of good results and good scientists.

About those results - you can read about them, but what has been happening is that they are doing a 'dose escalation' where they try a low dose, check for safety, mid dose, check for safety, then one or more high doses, also checking for safety. In their earliest phase 1s, they are seeing a surprising amount of strong remissions along with almost no side effects or safety issues on the lower doses, which means there is room for better results still on the higher doses which are being tried currently. When you think of purging cancer, you always think of the worst side effects. With chemo, you can sometimes get remissions too... but that's chemo. In comparison, immunotherapy is amazing - can be the same or better results, and side effects of this type seem very low. And you can mix them together as part of a treatment plan - cancer when you can't eradicate it becomes a fight of having enough new therapies so that the cancer can't keep evolving to outpace what you are throwing at it. Immunotherapy will practically be a large number of new 'drugs' against it.

Right now, their demonstrated good results are against blood cancers that already have existing immunotherapies (The custom ones I mentioned before). But, they are on track to do solid tumors soon, and their platform can do a lot and should be just better in most situations once completed than all of the currently approved ones.

Here's the pipeline where you can see the successive layers of gene-edits + adding features on the same concept.

[https://fatetherapeutics.com/pipeline/](https://fatetherapeutics.com/pipeline/)

A few other comments:

\- One other concept that isn't clear here is that they can add different CAR-Ts and I think TCRs which cause their cells to target different proteins (and thus cancers), so they can license tech and use it onto their product as a platform. But, natural killer cells are pretty smart and just spot suspicious behavior and react, so you can also combine it with existing antibody therapies that bind cancer cells and see an amplified result (I think). I suppose there may be ways to apply this to other non-cancer problems as well, since you can mix it with an antibody that is targeting something, but I'm not a NK cell biologist, not 100% sure.

\- Analysts are worried that their therapies will fall down on solid tumors. We have to wait on that but their pipeline says it's in phase 1.

\- Analysts are also worried that their cells will suffer 'immune exhaustion', thus making remissions not durable, or at least requiring a bunch of new doses. However, they've made gene edits to their lines that may address the exhaustion piece, and they had some early positive indicators. I'm skeptical that this is really the biggest risk for them at this point.

\- FATE does put out regular research updates as data comes in, so every couple months, you get a new update on how something in their pipeline is doing, at least, this year. And, they are currently in dose escalations on stuff that worked well AND didn't have safety issues, so the results have a good chance of continuing to get better with the next result (instead of waiting for the full phase 1 completion).

\- However much I like it, it's a speculative biotech stock, there's always unknown unknowns, and the whole thing could lose a ton of value very quickly for unexpected reasons.

Here's the corporate presentation if you want a very long read, longer than this:

This kind of stuff sounds cool but it is likely DOA for actual clinical use. Happens all the time. As of right now immunotherapies are a supplement to surgery, chemo and radiation. I can‚Äôt see immune cells destroying malignant tumors all over the body without serious deleterious effects to the patient. The problem with cancer too is sometimes the patients entire genome is compromised, ie germline mutations or a large area of tissue is compromised, called a ‚Äúfield effect.‚Äù Novel tumors can arise even after treatment, happens all the time with mesothelioma, for example. Tumors are Generally very heterogenous and comprised of multiple types of cells with different gene expression. So first you would have to do single cell RNA seq to get an idea of everything going on in the tumor. This is experimental and poorly understood technology‚Äî especially in the clinical setting. Maybe this tech can help in a few niche cases but will most likely be cost prohibitive and hardly ever see the light of day."
2021-06-25 10:20:43,wallstreetbets,"Like it overall.

Blue is struggling. I know they do a lot of things now that are interesting but their older product lines of gen 1 immunotherapy approaches work but will be superseded by fate and others. Just be sure to put a shelf life on their original blood cancer immunotherapy products. 

Diagnostics are interesting too. Exas is large but solid."
2021-06-25 10:02:38,wallstreetbets,TIL BMY is so low.  They're such a name brand I figured they'd be in the hundreds at least.
2021-06-25 09:55:47,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for engaging on this.

Gen 3 tech solves or mitigates a lot of the legitimate issues you are raising.

Gen 1 is 500k sometimes because it‚Äôs custom per patient and requires a proactive hospitalization usually. The marginal cost is still very large and the addressable market is small. 

Gen 3 is off the shelf and has marginal cost in the low thousands and is out patient. 

As for supplement to surgery, yes, all cancer therapies supplement all other cancer therapies and surgery first line is usually done. But as a systemic control, this is showing results like first time chemo or better sometimes, when used on heavily medicated patients, very sick patients who are several treatment courses in. They had a really late disease I think B cell lymphoma trial where they got 2/3 response and half of those had strong remissions? May be slightly off on numbers, was one of the recent press releases. And that was not even max dose on their dose escalation and also was an earlier version of the edited cells they are using. 

As to your other point, of course, any mutation could potentially evade any therapy, but NK in particular can sniff our suspicions behavior without a pre existing match and also lock on to more specific issues with a CAR-T or with an antibody that is hitting some surface protein the cancer needs to proliferate well. NK cells kill cancer all the time but cancer learns to tell them to chill out. Engineered NK cells should be able to not chill out. 

As for destroying tumors all over the body without negative effects on patient, they just did that in their last press release against B cell lymphoma that I mentioned:

https://ir.fatetherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fate-therapeutics-highlights-positive-interim-data-its-phase-1

Some patients had blasts all over their bones before it. 

There‚Äôs no cure to everything cancer, but I think this will render a lot of the realm of immunotherapy economical and should create improvements similar to what was achieved with chemo started getting effective, snd be cumulative with those benefits."

2021-06-25 03:08:45,wallstreetbets,Overvalued Meme stock.
2021-06-25 06:28:19,wallstreetbets,"Unbelievable, so many shorties in WSB. What‚Äôs up? Are we building anti TSLA group here.I see so many downvotes to people who are saying anything in favour of TSLA. 
To OP- reason for growth is because 2nd quarter is ending, people are speculating good sales from TSLA, and want to buy it before TSLA says numbers around 1st week of July. So definitely going up till we gets sales figures and might keep going on BULL RUN till earnings."
2021-06-25 04:54:09,wallstreetbets,"sad to see tsla bears infiltrated WSB.

We in here for mama Cathie and papa Elon"
2021-06-25 09:28:19,wallstreetbets,"Damn wsb has changed. People betting against tsla again lmfao. If and when Tesla releases FSD, 1k is undervalued."
2021-06-25 03:54:08,wallstreetbets,"Market in general is ripping, FED isn‚Äôt raising rates and inflation is transitory so growth has the green light to rally for the time."
2021-06-25 02:07:12,wallstreetbets,Pomp and domp rug pull.
2021-06-25 01:57:30,wallstreetbets,Rumor has it Tesla will perform a stock split
2021-06-25 02:06:49,wallstreetbets,Shorties covering to build capital/leverage against GME.
2021-06-25 01:37:33,wallstreetbets,"Tsla is more than ev cars, also do you think Facebook , Google , Apple and Microsoft deserve such wild valuations . Is the market that sets up the price .."
2021-06-25 09:31:10,wallstreetbets,"Surely it's overvalued as fuck, that doesn't mean that i'll short it tho, ape knows better"
2021-06-25 02:41:55,wallstreetbets,"Tesla is undervalued ... if you like money, buy calls. This is the OG meme stock and it‚Äôs coming back

2021-06-25 09:50:39,wallstreetbets,Fuck Elon
2021-06-25 07:03:29,wallstreetbets,"The federal subsidies prop Tesla stock up. If they disappear and carbon credit sales went away would Tesla be profitable?

I think Tesla (The company) has a lot going for it. Personally I really like the power wall system and may be installing a few units In the next year. That said I will be waiting for it to go down and track sideways first. If Musk wasn‚Äôt a ceo of it I would be all over it.

I don‚Äôt think the jump was solely because of the infrastructure plan making progress. If it was then Ford should have increased as well."
2021-06-25 08:44:31,wallstreetbets,I wonder is burry still has those puts??
2021-06-25 04:06:34,wallstreetbets,"$TSLA crosses $700 tomorrow, I‚Äôm thinking."

2021-06-25 05:57:17,wallstreetbets,"Hahahaha ... Fact is sometimes stranger than fiction.

Above could not be truer."
2021-06-25 13:24:37,wallstreetbets,in my eyes tsla is a bet on their self driving tech. it also serves as an elon musk project etf

2021-06-25 04:39:28,wallstreetbets,"Cybertruck may look ugly to some people, but it‚Äôs designed for production efficiency. Can be pressed with a massive giga press very fast, and at low cost. It‚Äôs genius and great ‚Äúfree‚Äù marketing."

2021-06-25 03:02:15,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre delusional
2021-06-25 02:09:10,wallstreetbets,"Lol, you just compared Tesla to a few companies that make shit ton of money, like really lots. Off the top of my head: Facebook - $10B, Google - $20B, Apple - $25B, Microsoft - $15B. That‚Äôs off the top of my head and only for the last quarter. Tesla? Well, they sold some carbon credits and made $0.5B, while still loosing money on their primary products (unless that product is selling carbon credits)."
2021-06-25 03:29:02,wallstreetbets,you're telling me a P/E of 1000 is normal but a P/E of 30-40 is a wild valuation? hahahaha
2021-06-25 04:48:12,wallstreetbets,$TSLA will open at $700 tomorrow üöÄüöÄüöÄ

2021-06-25 09:50:31,wallstreetbets,When the hell is it coming out? The showcased it 2 years prior to the ev f-150 and ford will probably realease their ev before tesla even if tesla made like 20b from dillutions last year.
2021-06-25 15:18:28,wallstreetbets,">Can be pressed with a massive giga press very fast

Cut/etched and bent stainless, not stamped. Very different. But there will be huge 8000 ton gigapress's (casting machines) used to create the sub-frame for the front and rear."
2021-06-25 07:46:31,wallstreetbets,LOL no.

2021-06-25 03:49:48,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs sad that you are being downvoted for calling out a conspiracy theory‚Ä¶
2021-06-25 02:20:43,wallstreetbets,Lmao go easy on em
2021-06-25 02:31:25,wallstreetbets,they do not lose money on their primary products. i don‚Äôt know where people get this info. they have >20% automotive gross margins even excluding regulatory credits (compared to ~10% industry average). https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2021/04/28/tesla-stock-slips-post-q1-results-but-auto-margins-are-encouraging/?sh=735ab49be218

2021-06-25 15:15:10,wallstreetbets,">The preorder were like 300$

He means (Average Selling Price of each CT) x $100 x (# of CT reservations)

Call it 50k x 100 x 1,000,000 orders = $5T

I have no idea when it'll come out and what run rate they'll be able to get to over the course of 2022... but I'm very confident that Tesla will be the 1st company to have sold 1M BEV pickups."
2021-06-25 09:56:12,wallstreetbets,"Production starts this year, I could be wrong as it was a while ago, but I believe the release date was always planned to be 2021.

There are so many differences between the lightning and cybertruck releases, hard to compare them. Ford is also rushing to production as they are finally starting to understand just how much trouble they are in."
2021-06-25 15:32:57,wallstreetbets,Yup
2021-06-25 11:11:22,wallstreetbets,"Think about this. Tesla has not even spent 1 dollar on advertising, yet you and tons of people already know about it.

1 million people have put down $100 for a pre order on the CT."
2021-06-25 09:24:53,wallstreetbets,"You are incorrect

Explain how you think what I said is not true, it‚Äôs pulled directly from Tesla"
2021-06-25 08:36:29,wallstreetbets,"If they didn't have sex things, where the fuck did subsequent generations of people come from?"
2021-06-25 09:52:43,wallstreetbets,Because you would be talking to elon 24/7? You could maybe rent a room in his 50k house.
2021-06-25 03:59:46,wallstreetbets,Knew it would happen
2021-06-25 03:52:09,wallstreetbets,"While I stand by my statement about their loses (I really don‚Äôt care enough to get into it), the guy still compared Tesla to companies making shit ton of money, like really lots."
2021-06-25 02:58:06,wallstreetbets,Numbers. Ugh. Why.
2021-06-25 03:43:09,wallstreetbets,"Their factories, existing and in process of being built, being capital assets, do not go through their income statements other than depreciation account. So no, that isn‚Äôt the case."
2021-06-25 09:59:03,wallstreetbets, I am a little interested by them. Got a model last year just before I moved out of the city. Would need something a little bigger now. I might get the ford mostly because I hate the look of the cybertruck.
2021-06-25 11:25:43,wallstreetbets,"I wasn't talking about the marketing.  Elon's a marketing genius.  They may not have a PR department but don't lie to yourself and believe they spend \*zero\* on marketing, by the way.

I was talking about the CT being designed for manufacture.  It's not.  It was whatever cockamamie idea du jour was pinging around Elon's head.  You don't even know what the CT looks like at this point - he said it himself with Jay Leno that it needed to be re-designed (obvious to anyone with automotive industry experience) because it was oversized."
2021-06-25 09:54:06,wallstreetbets,"As someone who designed stamping Dies for living; no.
Stainless is a pain to form and tool wear can be problematic.
Also the shapes of the cyber truck don't make for good forming. But we'll see. I wonder if they put it in production as presented."
2021-06-25 12:37:54,wallstreetbets,From under a rock.
2021-06-25 07:53:40,wallstreetbets,And their capex is relatively tiny vs industry average; aided further by Chinese government capital and scamming politicians into paying for their plants. (NY state got soaked for that Buffalo disaster.)
2021-06-25 10:07:07,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs fair, the look is pretty out there. I hate the ass end of it but think it‚Äôs face looks cool. It will be interesting to see how the lightning production vehicles actually perform vs what they claim. Either way the cybertruck will have higher performance in both base and tri-motor models."
2021-06-25 10:04:52,wallstreetbets,"They will be using a giga press, the largest on the market currently. And it will be much faster to produce than your average vehicle, it is going into production and will look exactly as it does now. Statements directly from Tesla, and the giga press manufacturer."
2021-06-25 15:20:42,wallstreetbets,"The SS body will be etched/cut and then bent. It WILL use a gigapress, an 8000T model vs the 6000T model in use for the Model Y. But that's to make the rear and front sub-frames."
2021-06-25 10:29:26,wallstreetbets,"Yea, I will probably wait a few months and see how they perform. Just annoying to transport all my stuffs in my model 3 at the moment haha."
2021-06-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"David Portnoy called a ""paper hands"" and ""little bitch."" cut for time... "

Bashing people for staying in through the lows to the new high, while he quit as soon as he saw some loss. It was a gamble and he lost. And then he reacts like this."

2021-06-25 02:05:42,wallstreetbets,"I can‚Äôt overstate my hatred for Portnoy

He honestly outcries against social media. You mean what you made your entire career off of you stupid bitch? That‚Äôs literally why you‚Äôre famous. Being a whiny asshole that gets his shenanigans shared on social media because some dipshits find it amusing 

You tried to continue your grift as a man of the people, but despite being worth millions, pussed out when you had actual skin in the game

Nobody should‚Äôve ever been throwing their life savings into this shit, but you grifted on those that did and encouraged it, then abandoned it almost immediately and went running for your binky. 

Now you‚Äôre sad you get called out for not being able to pretend you‚Äôre a man of the people? Fuck you bitch"

2021-06-25 10:17:02,wallstreetbets,"HOT TAKE: he pulled out his $ as soon as the MMs changed the rules, which is fairly understandable.

 Portnoy is a little bitch - though I do have to give the guy a hand for his pizza reviews as I have seen the amazing things it can do for businesses. Too bad  taking it on the chin isn't something he's known for (at least outside the bedroom)"

He slipped in the following to Portnoy:

Side note. Fuck Dave Portnoy in particular. Fuckin trust fund little bitch. I honestly didn‚Äôt realize he made that big of an impact because it‚Äôs clear he‚Äôs just a dumbass spoiled rich fuck with a bunch of money to spend."

Instead of saying something like 'yeah I realize I sold out early, that's a tough choice I had to personally make like everyone else does at some point' he lashes out at the community. 

Hyper defensive actually.

2021-06-25 19:31:28,wallstreetbets,"Honestly don't know why all the hate for Portnoy. The problem is people following other people who are unqualified. If Dave Portnoy turned out to be a false financial idol to you, that's more your problem than his."

2021-06-25 06:53:21,wallstreetbets,Portnoy is such a thin skinned loser.
2021-06-25 08:02:49,wallstreetbets,Portnoy is such a clown. Insecure whiny little brat who‚Äôs always just wanted to be seen as the cool guy despite having zero cool in any fibre of his being lmao ü§°
2021-06-25 08:03:06,wallstreetbets,Just learned who Dave Portnoy is a couple days ago. What an unlikeable person.
2021-06-25 08:35:03,wallstreetbets,"""he made the word stonks popular""

no he fucking didn't lol

Man this was an exceptionally bad interview from Dave, a man who once said ""never bet against the internet""

LOL at the end where Charles finally snapped and said ""you're being a little bitch"".

Well fucking said my man.

2021-06-25 06:25:38,wallstreetbets,"I take it 'paper hands' is code for you are exiting your trade at a loss to prevent more losses? As opposed to I didn't use a stop loss at all, and am balls deep, and I can't do anything until the prices rises back to where it was and I'm too emotionally engaged to accept my mistake and wait for the bottom of the dip. 

And I'm betting the price will rise again based on my expert knowledge of the market... that didn't see this current dip coming?

AKA paper hands = trading logically as opposed to emotionally?"
2021-06-25 05:43:32,wallstreetbets,Portnoy did more to help small businesses with the barstool fund in a few months during the pandemic than the United States government did in 2 years so you all can fuck right off.
2021-06-25 02:33:34,wallstreetbets,I do not watch anyone on Fox.  This guy Charles is an idiot.   I know why I don't watch anything on Fox news.
2021-06-25 03:05:35,wallstreetbets,Not a good look for either of them. More so for portnoy because he really couldn‚Äôt explain himself clearly

2021-06-25 09:50:59,wallstreetbets,Why so much hate for Portnoy on here? He doesn‚Äôt owe anyone an explanation for why he sold his shares. He‚Äôs not the face of a movement he was an investor and he brought massive awareness to the robinhood issue. Portnoy is a stand up guy and about as great a man you‚Äôre going to find. During covid he helped save small businesses from going out of business with his fundraiser. Most of you probably dislike him because he leans right on his political views. If you cannot tolerate 50% of the country bc of their harmless opinions then there is something wrong with yourself. Many of you were calling for all businesses to be shut down during covid simply because you are insecure about your work and career life and covid provided relief for that. Portnoy was out there saving small businesses while most of you were contributing to their demise. Keep blindly hating the rich while being a bitter broke bitch. That‚Äôs the way!

Charles Payne wasting time with this interview accusing Portnoy of ""misleading"" people and needing to apologize is just silly imo. Who would actually listen to Portnoy for trade advice anyways? I honestly feel like Portnoy is right here. No way he should have to take the blame for people's losses when he does sports media and pizza reviews.

2021-06-25 03:35:35,wallstreetbets,"One thing I can agree with Portnoy on is that he didn't start anything, but he did give it some big momentum cause (apparently) he's famous.

However, if he did paperhand while others held on and it went from 5 to 50 bucks, he's also right about the ""why are you complaining?"" bit.

It's eaay to have hindsight guys. Doesn't matter what now that the dice are cast so just buy and hold. We're all in the same boat here against the most evil of fuckers who don't care abojt anything but money."
2021-06-25 03:36:47,wallstreetbets,You could tell he was mad about that

Also why does he always have this touting face expression, you know what babies have? The one before they talk it looks like they will spit as soon as they open their mouths, he looks like such a baby face, AND THEN if you add his voice and intonation oh my god haahahahaha. And let's not forget about that surname - portnoy? Are you for real? Can someone make a pun about this because i know there's one but i just can't seem to find it.

Portnoy... Lol sure buddy, go get a real surname/voice/hands/opinions

2021-06-25 06:51:36,wallstreetbets,Well he does have the right approach to dealing with haters to be fair. Mr. Payne was clearly just trying to get a rise out of him here. Also not a fan of Mr. Payne claiming this is any sort of movement organized behind certain faces.
2021-06-25 06:52:12,wallstreetbets,"Why does anybody listen to any of these idiots? Barstool is only successful because of BigCat and PFT, Fox News is only successful because the children left family guy on last night. Both of them wouldn‚Äôt be on tv if they actually knew anything about how this works"
2021-06-25 06:52:31,wallstreetbets,Why‚Äôs he yell talking. Seems like a lil bitch
2021-06-25 06:52:55,wallstreetbets,"He will always be known as the guy who talked a bunch of shit, then blinked first and sold.  Paper hands Portnoy hahaha"
2021-06-25 06:54:11,wallstreetbets,95% sure they were breaking each others balls for fun/views.
2021-06-25 06:57:16,wallstreetbets,"Portnoy is the original Paul Brother. The sooner people realize that, the better."
2021-06-25 06:57:30,wallstreetbets,"Ain‚Äôt nothing wrong with selling unless he was trying to push the us vs them stick it to the man sentiment. We‚Äôre all here to profit. 

That segment was kind of embarrassing. Like an startup youtube channel."
2021-06-25 06:59:15,wallstreetbets,He‚Äôs not wrong.
2021-06-25 07:00:10,wallstreetbets,"Gah damn he is a little bitch. Best part is he claims these 5 cent trolls don‚Äôt bother him and he seems mentally disturbed by them. Lol

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs GG!?‚Äù Ok bud."
2021-06-25 07:00:25,wallstreetbets,Don't be a little B!!! Bwahahaha
2021-06-25 07:02:03,wallstreetbets,"He is calling people a moron, and then saying shit like most people didn‚Äôt have e more than 5 cents‚Ä¶. I mean I know we are not rich in here but Jesus 5 cents!!!! Gives us some credit!"
2021-06-25 07:03:05,wallstreetbets,This is why I continue to live.
2021-06-25 07:03:52,wallstreetbets,I lost $700k and pulled out even tho I said I‚Äôd ride the $1m to the ground.

2021-06-25 07:05:47,wallstreetbets,"Bro inject this into my fucking VEINS. I‚Äôve literally always wanted someone to call Portnoy out. Charles Payne has a new fan even if I despise everything Fox News does, at least SOMEONE is sticking up for retail. Dave Portnoy aka Paper Handed Little Bitch ü§£ü§£ü§£"
2021-06-25 07:06:46,wallstreetbets,"Someone need to invent Salad Portnoy, just lettuce & a bitter dressing"
2021-06-25 07:07:29,wallstreetbets,Love Charles Payne
2021-06-25 07:08:08,wallstreetbets,This is hilarious! Portnoys reaction to being called paper hands is gold. I poured my life's savings in GME and watched it go down 70 or 80 percent. He's a paper handed bitch. No way around it. I'm still a fan of his and I like him but Charles is right he definitely lost some of my respect for sure.
2021-06-25 07:08:16,wallstreetbets,I love the little bitch part so funny
2021-06-25 07:08:34,wallstreetbets,‚ÄúYour rich and you complain a lot! ‚Äú

2021-06-25 07:10:04,wallstreetbets,Dustin ‚ÄúNo‚Äù Diamond ‚ÄúHands‚Äù lookin ass
2021-06-25 07:10:05,wallstreetbets,"Starts by saying ignore social media, ends by telling the guy to check what they‚Äôre saying on social media. Def sounds like a little bitch to me."
2021-06-25 07:11:26,wallstreetbets,I think we should all flood Dave's Twitter with screenshots of our receipts and show him were still holding and most of us have been buying more when we can. Maybe then the realization that he is a paper handed bitch will set in.
2021-06-25 07:12:50,wallstreetbets,"He‚Äôs so upset üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠

Charles Payne is now officially epic. Straight up called him a little bitch on the air. Fuuuuuck yes üôåüèº"
2021-06-25 07:12:51,wallstreetbets,My make a wish foundation wish would be: to slap this grease ball in the face with a piping hot piece of pizza like the ones he stuffs his face with. Pizza slap that paper handed little bitch.

""You're being a little bitch! Dave""---Charles

Bahahaha"
2021-06-25 07:18:39,wallstreetbets,People actually watch Fox Business? Only saw it because Portnoy posted it to his social media page
2021-06-25 07:20:55,wallstreetbets,"Damn, Fox Business winning out for journalistic integrity. I did NOT see this one coming."
2021-06-25 07:21:05,wallstreetbets,A spineless worm sitting on his stool defending his cowardice and pointing fingers to distract from his hypocrisy..what he's really saying: why papa don't love me?
2021-06-25 07:23:35,wallstreetbets,I think he fell off his bar stool and conked his noggin.
2021-06-25 07:23:56,wallstreetbets,Portnoy Airlines a la Buffet
2021-06-25 07:24:30,wallstreetbets,Portnoy is the biggest clown ever
2021-06-25 07:26:01,wallstreetbets,Why does Portnoy only speak when Charles is speaking
2021-06-25 07:26:06,wallstreetbets,And who is David portnoy again?
2021-06-25 07:26:44,wallstreetbets,He only had 280k in it when he sold. Not 700k.
2021-06-25 07:27:26,wallstreetbets,I don't know who portnoy is but he does seem like a little bitch. Also his lack of understanding is hilarious ü§£ü§£ dude explained to him why people were mad like 8 times and it all went right over his head
2021-06-25 07:28:15,wallstreetbets,"This is funny as shit.  The interviewer didn't realize this paperhanded bitch also has the mental age of a 6 year old.  He not only bounced on his stonks at the first sign of danger, he also got triggered at the first sign of accusation. 

Note: SIGN.  It wasn't even an accusation.  This interviewer asked a legitimate question based on observations from reactions on social media about this person.  He never once said he firmly believed on the one sided story, and literally he asked him what he thought, gave him a chance to explain why it's fine to walk out and take a huge loss.  Instead of answering the question, he just took it as a direct insult and went off completely crazy.  He yelled as if this interviewer was suddenly a representative of those ""haters"".  

Dude can't stock, can't comprehension, can't conversation, don't know WTF he can honestly.  I've never heard this guy before and now that I've watched the interview it just makes me wonder, THIS GUY was a meme stock leader?"
2021-06-25 07:29:52,wallstreetbets,"With regards to Portnoy, short everything he touches."
2021-06-25 07:31:28,wallstreetbets,"""I live in a kinda big house"".....love that little dig"
2021-06-25 07:31:43,wallstreetbets,"Man, this guy is so rude...
I mean first polite rule: let someone speak. When he finishes then its your turn."
2021-06-25 07:32:47,wallstreetbets,"Lol, Fox Business makes CNBC look like Bloomberg."
2021-06-25 07:33:54,wallstreetbets,Can‚Äôt expect much from a lil bitch who dissed Casey‚Äôs pizza
2021-06-25 07:34:07,wallstreetbets,That was the peak of autism
2021-06-25 07:36:51,wallstreetbets,"Guys skin is as thin as hands. You know, cus they're paper."
2021-06-25 07:38:18,wallstreetbets,üßªü§≤
2021-06-25 07:38:23,wallstreetbets,"Portnoy is allowed to lose 700k.  Someone will just give him more.  Its fun money for him, it give him exposure.  He could lose it at the bus stop, set it on fire,  it doesn't matter. And yet, with literally nothing riding on that cash, David Portnoy was STILL a paperhanded little bitch.

Now, for those of us for who 700k would mean a great deal, yeah, its a different comparison, Davey boy.  That shit could pay off houses, debts, fucking lololol medical bills so expensive I could swear they are a joke but aren't.  Does Dave Portnoy ever have to worry how he'll get money to pay for that kind of shit?  No, and for that reason Dave, you're the definition of a paperhanded bitch.  Because you sold with nothing on the fucking line.  You empty, shit gargling fuck."
2021-06-25 07:39:26,wallstreetbets,Props to Charles!!
2021-06-25 07:39:58,wallstreetbets,Life after saved by the bell has been hard on screech
2021-06-25 07:41:00,wallstreetbets,"I forgot about this foooking paper hand. Cried when he lost 700k, while DFV calmly uploaded his daily fluctuations of potential 10-30M losses."
2021-06-25 07:43:01,wallstreetbets,He tried to spin a narrative and it didn‚Äôt work‚Ä¶ Dave was 100% right in saying he didn‚Äôt start it‚Ä¶ he just joined it
2021-06-25 07:43:03,wallstreetbets,"Damn, he really got mad. Lol I had no idea who he even was before this, tbh. He got reeeeal heated, though."
2021-06-25 07:43:30,wallstreetbets,Portnoy is such a douche. The whole covid relief fund raiser was such a PR stunt.
2021-06-25 07:43:48,wallstreetbets,What a douche canoe.
2021-06-25 07:44:23,wallstreetbets,"More lessons from the DYOR University, and proof that it's really not hard to make money in America, even an idiot can do it."
2021-06-25 07:44:33,wallstreetbets,We just going to ignore that fox business is now using South Park memes as headlines on cable television? Matt and Trey should probably throw a cease and desist over there. Ya know. For 'tegridy sake.
2021-06-25 07:44:46,wallstreetbets,I am so confused about what is going on atm concerning the stock market since I'm new to investing. Can someone fill me in

2021-06-25 07:49:22,wallstreetbets,"Man, just watched this. This dude makes me sick with all that paper handed bitch whining. His reactions are hilarious. He was genuinely butthurt.

2021-06-25 09:03:16,wallstreetbets,The guy was trying to help him save face and he was basically biting the helping hand. Hope the caster doesn't get reprimanded for calling him what he was very clearly behaving like.

2021-06-25 09:05:46,wallstreetbets,Is portnoy drunk? High on something? I can't stand the guy and this might be the first time I've actually heard his voice. He seems impaired.

2021-06-25 09:19:45,wallstreetbets,I called him that back when he first announced he sold GME for a loss. I said it to him on his Twitter. I had a few thousand in it. But I did sell for 100% gains a few weeks ago. Just felt like moving on.
2021-06-25 09:19:47,wallstreetbets,Makes me want to throw up when I see those laser eyes on Portnoys twitter. Dude doesn't deserve laser eyes...
2021-06-25 09:19:51,wallstreetbets,Just the way he handles himself is embarrassing
2021-06-25 09:20:21,wallstreetbets,Imagine selling at a loss

Can‚Äôt even grow a real beard. Nobody is losing 5 cents. If you‚Äôre losing $700,000 you can stand to lose $700,000. A $2000 loss is likely more impactful on someone like me. 

Go get fucked by a shark you discount Richard Dreyfuss looking fuck."

2021-06-25 09:42:44,wallstreetbets,"To be honest the only one sounding like a little bitch is everyone else. Charles tried so hard to put the blame on Dave, but in all reality you have the power to do what ever the fuck you want so for any one to put blame on someone for there stupidity is more of a fool than the person they are pointing fingers at. You‚Äôre grown ass adults stop pointing fingers. The person who fucked up is you cause you followed a fool."

2021-06-25 09:49:40,wallstreetbets,"I did NOT like this.  Portnoy is a whale who paper handed in February.  Why the FUCK does anyone care what his opinions are on this?  Charles is a SHILL!!!  

I guarantee when this shit hits the fan for real he will lead the MSM in saying sell.  This is my receipt."
2021-06-25 09:49:49,wallstreetbets,Portnoy is textbook paper hand.
2021-06-25 09:50:08,wallstreetbets,Guy looks and sounds like he's straining to take a dry ass shit and about to blow an O-ring mid interview.
2021-06-25 09:50:58,wallstreetbets,So funny they are freaking pissed and blaming us for shorting the stock. Don't short the stock and you won't loose its as simple as that!

2021-06-25 09:55:26,wallstreetbets,The sub might hate him but he beats wsb in being retard. He would have made a killing if he stayed with the original amc shares he bought. Instead paper hand bit**
2021-06-25 09:55:39,wallstreetbets,"who cares if he sold. lettuce handed chode. he is a little bitch because he couldn't, not once, let Charles finish talking. Dave has such a superiority complex that he has to interrupt dude every single damn time he was asking a question because his opinion is so much more important and his ego makes him HAVE to be the one talking and sounding superior at all times.

to be fair, I do think there is a delay of at least 1 maybe 2 seconds on some of these broadcasts that's why sometimes it seems awkward and I've seen other people talk over other people on accident. that said, the parties realize there is a delay I'm pretty sure and Dave Cuntly couldn't let Payne finish a damn sentence friggin once.

he's a fragile egomaniac. that's why he's a little bitch. who gives a fuck if he sold. did he really blame it on RobbingHood too? ""they stopped letting us buy"". oh so you sold cuz RH had a clearing house issue? fucking baby bitch.

barstool sucks."

2021-06-25 10:06:33,wallstreetbets,This is the same douche canoe that protested Tom Brady using deflated footballs by literally hand cuffing himself and doing a sit in. And he couldn't hold thru a 700k drop even though that shit is play money to him. You're a little puto Portnoy. Go hang out with your loser frat boy butt buddies

2021-06-25 10:07:47,wallstreetbets,Paperhands Portnoy. You wanted to lose the 700k so you can blab all over social media and the about it. In truth you are worth millions. Stfu and go away.
2021-06-25 10:08:16,wallstreetbets,Yeah we are disappointed in him for paper handing like a lil bitch. But why would he go to war for us? Sounds like MSM is just trying to paint him as a fallen martyr to appeal to apes when really the guy is just gigaretarded
2021-06-25 10:09:13,wallstreetbets,This ladies gentleman is a man who fomo and paper handed. Good example of what not to become. I'll happily show him my trades when this is all over
2021-06-25 10:09:23,wallstreetbets,I was suprised he called him little bitch on tv. That would be the most embarrassing thing to be called that in front of the whole country.

2021-06-25 10:12:59,wallstreetbets,"I don't even know what the point of that was. A financial analyst brings on a wealthy celebrity with very little financial background who likes to trade publicly.

2021-06-25 11:42:40,wallstreetbets,Portnoy is a paperhanded tool who couldn't handle a theoretical loss. He would have made so much money on AMC but gamblers be gamblers.

2021-06-25 11:48:11,wallstreetbets,"This is super cringe. I‚Äôve never respected portnoy and do so even less now.

2021-06-25 11:52:47,wallstreetbets,What date and what price did he sell and lose 700k?
2021-06-25 11:54:08,wallstreetbets,"While the clip is hilarious, this was all really just an attempt to belittle retail (including WSB). Portnoy was brought on to get flamed and played into Payne‚Äôs repeated poking at his paper hands. 

At the end of it all, the narrative is that poor retail traders were at the mercy of Paper Hands Portnoy (and other ‚Äúride the wave‚Äù influencers) and are too dumb for their own good. All the while Payne successfully gains retail fans. Read between the lines, folks."
2021-06-25 11:55:39,wallstreetbets,"Portnoy *does* have one significant point:  no one has any right to be angry at him for selling. Is he a Paper Hand?  Yes, and he's clearly embarrassed by it and very defensive. But Charles knows that Portnoy isn't a billionaire, he's far from one, actually.

I really, really disliked the way he spent this entire interview attacking Portnoy. Personally it came across like he was actively trying to discredit Portnoy, to ensure that he never tries some shit like that again.

Portnoy's not in charge of my fucking bank account, however, so *I* will be the one who determines when, and if, I buy or sell an asset.

If nothing else, though, this video has done a great job giving me reason to dislike Charles Payne."
2021-06-25 11:56:09,wallstreetbets,There are very valid critiques you can make of portnoy‚Äîbut the host trying to insinuate that he had a moral obligation to stay in the fight is idiotic
2021-06-25 11:56:53,wallstreetbets,"Lol.  Charles was about to open a can of whoop arse on Mr Paper Hands

Portnoy is nothing more than an ambitious self absorbed carnival barker who tried to enter a movement with intent to lead it.  But then tucked tail and ran at first sign of trouble."
2021-06-25 11:57:10,wallstreetbets,"Charles is the man. Portnoy is a paperhands bitch. He sold out of fear and lost 700k. I held. Doubled down. If he didn't sell and all his sheep followers didn't sell AMC could be done by now. He helped keep the rich, rich."
2021-06-25 11:57:36,wallstreetbets,Man fuck Dave Portnoy
2021-06-25 11:58:19,wallstreetbets,Little bitch. Summarizes you cunts

2021-06-25 12:00:53,wallstreetbets,I 100% get the hate for portnoy bc he‚Äôs an acquired taste and that was a douche comment but I bet there‚Äôs a shit tom of people who did the exact same thing as him and started trading during the pandemic through boredom and made a shit tom of terrible moves too. Would love to see a show of hands of people who from day one made money in the market outside of SPY and QQQ.
2021-06-25 12:01:38,wallstreetbets,That was painful to watch.  Charles ate his lunch.  Dave looks like a child.

2021-06-25 13:09:31,wallstreetbets,I get he created a popular platform in barstool but why tf do people like this asinine oaf. We joke about being retarded apes but he actually resembles one

That's rich coming from the guy who made his entire business off of ""stirring the pot"" as well as being edgy and confrontational. Same as his comments about social media, when he spends all his time on it. It's crazy how much everything Portnoy was shit-talking is just exactly what he does. 

Although to be fair; if you ever had any respect for Portnoy, or thought he knew anything about investing, you're an idiot."

2021-06-25 19:11:22,wallstreetbets,Holy crow Fox Business is a bigger joke than Fox ü§£
2021-06-25 19:13:30,wallstreetbets,"Clearly being called paper hands Portnoy cuts him DEEP. Look how mad he gets. 

People aren't mad because he sold which caused them to sell. They are mocking him because he sold and they didn't and now they made money and he ""lost $700,000."" How do you lose money on a stock like Gamestop that's up 4,700% since last year DAVE? YOU HAVE TO SUCK AT  INVESTING"

2021-06-25 03:23:30,wallstreetbets,"I could show him my receipts for fuck sake. 

First time round when we got fucked I had to sell most of my stock to make the end of the month. 

I 100% lost more than 5 cents. I thought shit, this guy knows what's he's doing, I've got no idea about trading but if he thinks you got to get out then I trust him.

I don't blame him or even for 1 second accuse him of making me sell but undoubtedly it made me more comfortable in thinking the race was run.

I appreciate this guys action helping people in need but there really isn't any need to be a cunt about it."
2021-06-25 03:28:45,wallstreetbets,Portnoy bitched this guy üòÇ

All the right wing boomers watching it probably had no idea what they were talking about and got offended by the little bitch comments."
2021-06-25 14:45:44,wallstreetbets,What a prick and unprofessional interviewer.
2021-06-25 17:07:51,wallstreetbets,I absolutely fucking despise Portnoy but whoever this interviewer is is the little bitch in this conversation.
2021-06-25 17:14:24,wallstreetbets,He can redeem himself if he goes all-in on $CLOV right now!
2021-06-25 17:22:37,wallstreetbets,I gotta agree with the dipshit on the right. The dipshit on the left is making no sense.
2021-06-25 02:52:29,wallstreetbets,Well you‚Äôre being a little bitch! Both sound like complete clowns to me honestly
2021-06-25 09:08:29,wallstreetbets,"This is a hilarious exchange. Charles Payne is one of the few honest journalists. I looooove that he called Portnoy a ""little bitch!"""
2021-06-25 10:43:16,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sad to see everyone in the comments all over Payne.

2021-06-25 14:08:40,wallstreetbets,"Dave, this just ain't it Chief.   
I followed this man for many years, even before he was rich. Once I learned he sold when he did I unfollowed from anything he was involved in on every platform. His commentary here just sealed the deal for me.   
Not all friends you make along the way are lifelong friends.   
Ok, Dave wasn't ever my ""friend"" but you get what I'm saying."

2021-06-25 04:20:45,wallstreetbets,"It's a popularity contest, Portnoy was brought on to be hated to pump Payne's stock in this community.  Portnoy fulfills press appearance contracts with Fox(cash monies), and wsb gets a reason to tune into Payne.

They only care that you tune in, they both make money through your attention not through markets and investments."
2021-06-25 09:55:46,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. Charles Payne seemed genuine with his questions to Paper Hand Portnoy. 

Incredible segment. Long time fan of Making Money."
2021-06-25 09:37:54,wallstreetbets,you should see some of his earlier segments on wsb related stuff. you can tell the dude is totally rooting for us
2021-06-25 09:53:49,wallstreetbets,Because he is
2021-06-25 07:42:00,wallstreetbets,He does live in a big-ass house apparently.
2021-06-25 10:21:40,wallstreetbets,this community likes Payne?
2021-06-25 07:18:35,wallstreetbets,Lol he prolly is low key.
2021-06-25 09:15:35,wallstreetbets,"Sound bites, and ape views, guarantee you he doesn't care beyond that."
2021-06-25 16:04:03,wallstreetbets,"He's not. He's anti retail, pro corporation.

He's the wolf in sheep's clothing."
2021-06-25 16:32:16,wallstreetbets,Prove to me that he is not Dustin Diamond (Screech from Saved By The Bell)
2021-06-25 18:31:06,wallstreetbets,Heard he's DPV's uncle.

2021-06-25 07:10:51,wallstreetbets,"He lost 700k and says that all of us aren't real traders.

2021-06-25 10:01:53,wallstreetbets,He acted like a disgruntled child the entire interview. Reminded me of The Last Jedi fake Star Wars fans who called anyone who said the movie was trash a neck beard who lives in their mothers basement. He basically said the same thing. Just own being a paper handed Bitch Portnoy.
2021-06-25 07:59:20,wallstreetbets,Dave Portnoy not knowing who David Gensler is is akin to Gary Johnson not knowing what Allepo was

2021-06-25 02:28:45,wallstreetbets,"üòÇüòÇüòÇ It's really funny when he reacts to being called paper hands. 

Portnoy: from one adult to another, I don't know who you are, I've only seen you mentioned here and on CNBC, but please don't react like that, you showed how sore you are about the whole thing."
2021-06-25 07:10:06,wallstreetbets,"Hello, I am an amateur WSB historian.

I followed what happened in Feb/March and what happened with AMC. When WSB pushed GME hard for the short squeeze, Twitter already felt they were left behind because the stock went up to $60 from ~$15. Now, the surprising thing was AMC originated from Twitter and it wasn't ""initially"" a WSB thing and Portnoy himself pushed hard on AMC. While WSB rallied to squeeze GME and thought BB was a fundamental gold mine, twitter itself spun up their own alternatives to these stocks AMC, and NOK. And Portnoy was one of the first few people that started to plug AMC alongside GME and BB. When the dust settled Portony made a profit (not a killer profit) with AMC and essentially left his followers in the dust. DFV never ever was responsible for the squeeze move for GME and he never bragged about leading the charge. Portnoy did, and he flipped."
2021-06-25 10:20:22,wallstreetbets,10 ply for sure
2021-06-25 14:11:39,wallstreetbets,"The point he made, if you stayed in the game and didn't flee at the sign of trouble you wouldn't have loss so much. 

Portnoy: ""I had to leave, I had already loss so much"".

2021-06-25 09:03:55,wallstreetbets,"Incredible that he wants to attack anyone that disagrees with him as being some internet loser while also talking IRL like he's on a message board 

Calling someone a Twitter Egg like anyone cares lol"
2021-06-25 10:52:03,wallstreetbets,I don't know why you chose this out of everything he said as evidence of him being a dick head. What he meant was that if you spend your life taking online criticism to heart then you'll have so much anxiety and fear that you'll never end up going anywhere in life. It was pretty clearly a metaphor and IMO the only sensible thing he said in the interview. It was not a jab at stereotypical neckbeards in their mom's basements.
2021-06-25 01:54:34,wallstreetbets,"Dude Charles Payne only wants the best for us apes, he clearly shows he respects what we are doing and is  willing to fight battles for us"
2021-06-25 03:22:10,wallstreetbets,"I'd never seen him before and he kinda looks like a neckbeard but I enjoyed the way he kept taunting Portnoy until he cracked.  It was like getting into a soft boiled egg, just keep beating it with the spoon until all the shell cracks away and the soft insides are exposed."
2021-06-25 01:56:00,wallstreetbets,a spade a spade
2021-06-25 11:33:04,wallstreetbets,It looks like american wrestling to me and someone was paid to be the heel.

2021-06-25 13:52:59,wallstreetbets,">I keep not wanting to like Charles Payne,

Why? Just because he's on Fox? lmao boo fucking hoo

Charles is the man."

Its a great primer for learning the basics of using fundamentals to value stocks and technicals to determine entry points.  He's a truly likeable everyman that seems to care abouthe public."

2021-06-25 08:37:32,wallstreetbets,Like a paper handed bitch.
2021-06-25 07:24:10,wallstreetbets,He just is a loser and has that mentality. He would be the one begging for a participation trophy during a loss.
2021-06-25 11:11:31,wallstreetbets,"Fun fact, the people who look up to him are the drunk idiots you meet at parties. Also known as generic frat guys"
2021-06-25 15:49:19,wallstreetbets,literally dude. the second he opened his mouth after someone showed me a pizza review I was like who the fuck is this drunk moron and what the fuck is he slurring about. when I found out he's a fucking retard frat cult leader I wanted to vomit
2021-06-25 08:12:55,wallstreetbets,I do like his pizza reviews lol

2021-06-25 08:46:02,wallstreetbets,"I got no problem with people selling, it happens. The fact that he sold is not the problem, it's how he did it. I do have a problem with people bragging about buying and encouraging others to buy using their huge social media presence and then selling the second it dips. He's not owning up to it, but there are many people who put their money into that stock because he did, and because he used his influence to tell everyone he did. When he sold, that made the dip even stronger and his followers sold at a huge loss too.

The guy even had the balls to get on later, buy some meme stock and announced it on Twitter, just to sell it the next day from the spike caused by all of his followers buying in. He then went back on Twitter to brag about how he made a quick few thousand dollars by basically stealing from his fans.

He's acting like these people lost pennies because he knows if he admits they lost more, it makes him look bad. Yeah, he lost a lot of money, but he's also a rich as hell. 700k is a hit, but 700k to him is less valuable than a few hundred to others. Fuck that guy."
2021-06-25 03:09:20,wallstreetbets,"There are other reddit posts cutting the clip, but this one is best because it provides context of how Charles Payne is a fucking LEGEND and Portnoy is a paper handed bitch"
2021-06-25 02:42:46,wallstreetbets,Thank you for posting the full clip. I wanted to see the whole smack down from start to finish. Charles‚Äô expression was priceless when he asked who Gensler was‚Ä¶bitch please.
2021-06-25 01:37:19,wallstreetbets,To where?

2021-06-25 05:13:01,wallstreetbets,No this is good. Seeing him progressively get redder and more upset as he insists he doesn‚Äôt care.
2021-06-25 03:01:29,wallstreetbets,"Posting the full clip instead of the edit you made? It's really things like this that illustrates how retarded this sub is, in a good way. Get off the cocaine before you post next time retard"

2021-06-25 02:58:30,wallstreetbets,can someone smarter than me explain what this would accomplish? the only creatures in the ocean that I know of with an affinity for lettuce are sea turtles and manatees

2021-06-25 02:37:36,wallstreetbets,His whole company literally just steals shit from twitter and Reddit and pretends they came up with it. I like how the guy even gave him credit for ‚Äústonks‚Äù and other terms that came from here
2021-06-25 02:21:00,wallstreetbets,"Was nice to see him called out for it today, fuckin grifter"

2021-06-25 05:52:00,wallstreetbets,Lmfao you‚Äôre a grown ass man crying like this over a strangers financial decisions
2021-06-25 11:04:16,wallstreetbets,"And tons of people fail to see that this is all playing into him. Any press is good press, and getting people talking about him and complaining about him keeps him relevant and making money. He loves it and clips like this are only serving his purpose. He has no problem playing the villain."
2021-06-25 16:31:34,wallstreetbets,"This entire post is exactly what portnoy wants. The entire barstool brand is reactionary and in order to get a reaction, they say/do stupid shit. Nothing that barstool does is valuable in anyway and portnoy knows that. The best way for him to make money is to spark outrage, hate, etc and get you to click on their pages. The fact people can‚Äôt see through this grifter is beyond me."

2021-06-25 11:01:36,wallstreetbets,Wdym u think they staged this? Have u ever watched fox business it is like kindergarten shark tank but instead of shooting the best shark they shoot pointless facts back and forth to try to prove who‚Äôs more retarded while simultaneously proving they are both retarded
2021-06-25 06:57:55,wallstreetbets,So close
2021-06-25 03:14:45,wallstreetbets,">How is this crap even on TV?

This - \*(the reddit revolution - the WSB Take over - the GME/AMC Saga - the APES going to the MOON on rocket ships.) - this has created millions of new retail traders and is literally the second most important thing to happen to the stock market in the past 5 years. \*(Behind COVID)

This new group of traders who have come along have created so much more volatility and added a lot of new money to the market. It REALLY is a game changer.

You can overlook the gains/losses and B.S. that came along the way - but the long term effects are going to be drastic \*(not sure if it's incredibly good or terribly bad) but it's likely very very bad in the short term and really really good in the long term

&#x200B;

That's why dave portnoy deserves a little airtime.....\*(I f..ing hate portnoy) but he helped to spread the word to radio and podcast listeners who didn't normally read reddit - \*(about what was going on with WSB/GME/AMC) - and for that he deserves a piece in the credit/blame for whatever happens next. \*(continued all time highs or a crazy bad crash? Who knows) \*\*Note - i don't mean all time highs or historic crash of GME and AMC - I am Talking about SPY and QQQ and the overall market. 

The next time the market takes a shit = Like a really bad dip in overall market sentiment....How many paper handed bitches will be selling all their stocks because they have never seen a huge market pull back before? - It's possible. I think it's likely that this new group of ""retail traders"" will make the next crash way worse than it would've been with out them"
2021-06-25 12:46:45,wallstreetbets,"I agree. This is all just TV drama and Dave is an awful trader, but he is right in this situation. Charles' argument didn't really make sense"
2021-06-25 03:18:12,wallstreetbets,"Yup was funny to see Portney get called out, but Charles just came across as an even bigger douchebag pushing his stupid agenda."

2021-06-25 07:38:33,wallstreetbets,Pretty much nailed it here. The kids on here don‚Äôt really understand how people actually trade - mostly because they are brand new to investing and their crash course has been on Reddit meme stocks and subs like this.
2021-06-25 10:45:10,wallstreetbets,"Paper hands cause he had the money to stick with it, AND talked big that he wouldn‚Äôt sell. It‚Äôs not just one thing"

2021-06-25 17:30:25,wallstreetbets,Ok
2021-06-25 09:56:15,wallstreetbets,Reddit is full of liberals who blindly hate the rich.  Portnoy is the perfect villain for them since he leans right winged. Im not going to dislike someone bc they made a personal financial decision. Personally I think the guy is a legend.
2021-06-25 02:36:01,wallstreetbets,"> This is how you know amc is about to moon !

2021-06-25 11:59:43,wallstreetbets,Disagree.  Portnoy put out vid after vid trying to take the reigns of the movement in WSB and in particular GME.  Its his $ and he can do what he wants but the guy was pounding his chest trying to rally people the day before he quit.
2021-06-25 13:16:22,wallstreetbets,He easily could've wasted years of his life on one bad trade

2021-06-25 08:05:04,wallstreetbets,It also makes people who don't come on reddit think that everyone who is here are morons. Here is a guy who lost 700k and doesn't know who GG is. Look at those reddit morons following the dumbass who doesn't even know who the chairman of the SEC is. Why would I believe any of their DD on what's been happening?

2021-06-25 07:48:14,wallstreetbets,"You're totally correct but I would still argue that overall it is a positive thing for our community and the markets as a whole.  Without the desire for ratings, they would have never started covering naked shorting after Mellisa's slip-up.  It was likely the viral nature of that clip that motivated the network to cover it more.  Same with dark pools.  Do you think Fox Business would have ever run a story about dark pools and naked shorting if the massive interest of retail traders was not up for grabs."
2021-06-25 07:39:17,wallstreetbets,100% true
2021-06-25 08:20:57,wallstreetbets,"While you may be true, I think it‚Äôs a pretty cynical view of society. I think Charles Payne genuinely is a pretty stand up guy. I‚Äôve been a long time listener"

2021-06-25 08:28:11,wallstreetbets,"I mean it was a pretty aggressive line of questioning thag was meant to escalate the tension.
 
It started with ""what do you have to say about the people online calling you paper hands?"" to which Portnoy responded ""they're idiots if they followed me to a T, but I bet most of them barely invested. I lost real money and while it wasn't a good move I got out.""
 
Then the interview became ""why do you demean the people who look up to you?"" as though Portnoy was speaking about anyone with a smaller investment or who is still involved in the stocks.
     
Then it turned into ""why don't you go to war with the SEC?"" as though the owner of a sports channel has the time or resources to do that. 
  

It was uncomfortable because it was an aggressive bait and switch line of questioning that was prepared with the full intention of getting this clip out."
2021-06-25 07:09:27,wallstreetbets,Lol no he didn't. This is who he is. It's an act that had so far made him millions of dollars.
2021-06-25 08:16:13,wallstreetbets,yeah homie's got perfect comedic timing lol
2021-06-25 12:24:11,wallstreetbets,"Pause, (eyeroll), ""He's the chairman of the SEC.""

Hes really a pretty well known guy. 

I just never got past the pizza reviews which were fun. Barstool seems like a bunch of asshole New Yorker sports snob dumbasses imo.

2021-06-25 08:11:43,wallstreetbets,I still feel like so many people bailed out because this mfer made videos like the whole GME thing ended.
2021-06-25 08:27:20,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, such a suit! Remember that one too? Hahaha!"
2021-06-25 09:31:01,wallstreetbets,"Since his surname literally translates as ""a tailor"", it doesn't hit as bad as intended. I mean, ""tailor hands"".  Sounds rather as a compliment than as an insult."
2021-06-25 04:55:03,wallstreetbets,Can we get someone with talent to super impose some flappy wavey tissues where his hands are in the end of the video?
2021-06-25 05:03:53,wallstreetbets,Lol when being called paperhands hurts your feelings and you say people are calling you names.... gotta take long look in mirror
2021-06-25 02:49:43,wallstreetbets,"Idk, I thought he made some good points. Don‚Äôt know anything about him and the situation tho. That exchange was incredible and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm taking from it."
2021-06-25 04:37:33,wallstreetbets,"The crux of his point was that the people who are calling paperhands aren't really the seasoned traders.

Which, tbh, is just echoing a lot of the old school on this sub as well.

He put it across like a child, and spiralled a bit, but that is the crux of his point."
2021-06-25 06:37:24,wallstreetbets,I'm just astounded by his ability to slowly turn red over the course of this segment.
2021-06-25 08:42:08,wallstreetbets,"He doesn‚Äôt seem sore at all hahah. He didn‚Äôt start the movement and just posts live videos of him trading. He has never said he is a good trader or expert. He actually says that he sucks and the only reason he got in was because he likes gambling and there were no sports to bet on. 

You guys are very culty. ‚ÄúSports are bad, sports are for bros, the stock market is for us outsiders‚Äù. Very weird"
2021-06-25 14:22:37,wallstreetbets,"There's not really anything that wrong with it; it just shows a lack of discipline and commitment.

The real thing that Portnoy deserves to get made fun of for is being a whiny little bitch about it. If you pussy out, just suck it up and pussy out; admit that you fucked up because you're a scared little baby."
2021-06-25 09:03:53,wallstreetbets,"I don't give a shit that he paper handed, it's the being a little bitch that I'm gonna keep poking at"
2021-06-25 10:03:47,wallstreetbets,I can think of at least 2 videos where he judges homeless people on the street while reviewing pizza
2021-06-25 09:46:20,wallstreetbets,When he was doing frozen pizza reviews during the pandemic he freaked out and had a temper tantrum because a company wouldn't send him free pizza. Then he gave them a terrible rating because of it. I haven't really watched many of his reviews since then
2021-06-25 08:40:53,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs kind of his schtick.
2021-06-25 16:24:28,wallstreetbets,"It's a shame, because the hosts of PMT seem to be genuinely good people. Portnoy is a stain on his own company."

2021-06-25 09:00:50,wallstreetbets,"You could tell him you were down 1k and he'd probably respond ""Yeah.. like I said, you could have maybe lost 5 cents""

Anyone who lost less than him ""only lost 5 cents"" so it doesn't matter

anyone who lost more than him is dumb and shouldn't have risked so much money on a meme stock

can't win"

2021-06-25 03:00:30,wallstreetbets,awkward
2021-06-25 03:33:10,wallstreetbets,Because hes a mouthpiece for fox news. I respect the man and the message right now. But I know the man behind him is not my friend.
2021-06-25 03:44:53,wallstreetbets,Cuz he works for Bryan Cox
2021-06-25 12:58:19,wallstreetbets,"Lmao what? He is throwing a temper tantrum the whole video and insults charles paynes intelligence three times (which is really interesting optics). Then he gets called a little bitch, which was an accurate description of his childish behavior, not taking responsibility, getting flustered, lashing out at strangers. He‚Äôs literally red in the face and then when he gets called a little bitch he shuts down the entire discussion because his ego got bruised and spazs out causing the interview to end prematurely. Its like watching a child throw a temper tantrum at a super market and then smiling when they provoke a reaction only to spaz out when they don‚Äôt get what they want. Thats not impressive, its pathetic, obnoxious, and clownish. The chuckle from charles  at the end says it all. This dude is a clown, he came on to discuss market manipulation and wasn‚Äôt aware who Gary Gensler was LMAO. Handled this interview about as well as he handled his shares."
2021-06-25 14:18:39,wallstreetbets,"Well yes, hes being paid by conglomerates, does that not bother you? I evaluate what he says on its own merit but if he shifts the narrative ill know why."
2021-06-25 13:09:19,wallstreetbets,"Ill give that a look, I just try to insulate myself from people ‚Äúas seen on tv‚Äù as they are prime canidates for FUD. But I definitely respect the man enough to give his book a read"

2021-06-25 12:11:41,wallstreetbets,I also like his pizza reviews. Haven‚Äôt watched them in a while but I used to use the pizza review app to find good places nearby because of him lol
2021-06-25 14:35:59,wallstreetbets,"I only know this guy due to his pizza reviews, which I do like. Whys pizza guy talking finance?"
2021-06-25 09:22:56,wallstreetbets,"Oof, that‚Äôs a bad look for the pin stripes"
2021-06-25 08:19:12,wallstreetbets,"This is literally his entire MO. It‚Äôs how he blew up in the first place. I am no fan of Dave Portnoy but the man knows how to farm attention online.  He‚Äôs the type of person who doesn‚Äôt care whether you like him or hate him. Because as long as you fall into one of those two categories, it means that you know who he is. And that‚Äôs all that matters to this guy"
2021-06-25 10:41:05,wallstreetbets,To each their own‚Ä¶ but him???
2021-06-25 04:57:23,wallstreetbets,"Yeah this version is better, only saw the short clip last night and it needed the context. Really is a little bitch."
2021-06-25 03:08:08,wallstreetbets,"if he didn‚Äôt know then, he realized at that moment he was talking to a true idiot."
2021-06-25 01:58:42,wallstreetbets,The whole thing is definitely worth the watch
2021-06-25 02:45:58,wallstreetbets,5:35 he tells Portnoy he's being a little bitch.
2021-06-25 01:52:19,wallstreetbets,little bitch @ 5:30
2021-06-25 03:24:26,wallstreetbets,100% worth watching the whole thing
2021-06-25 03:10:28,wallstreetbets,Nah you got it he‚Äôs just an idiot
2021-06-25 03:20:49,wallstreetbets,"sea turtles don't eat lettuce wrapped in toilet paper. proven fact. 

ZERO cell phone videos of this happening on google so it's gotta be true."
2021-06-25 03:59:38,wallstreetbets,"Maybe I‚Äôm thinking about this WAAAY too much, but there‚Äôs a ton of issues with it even doing anything.
1.	The toilet paper would disintegrate in the ocean. That‚Äôs why we can flush it and it (usually) doesn‚Äôt clog the pipes.  I guess he could wrap you in a foot thick of TP though, but then you‚Äôd probably just asphyxiate.
2.	How is glue going to stick to the lettuce? It‚Äôs heavy, not flat, usually mostly water, and fragile.
3.	The glue wouldn‚Äôt really be able to survive being submerged in the ocean. Well, partially submerged, since lettuce, toilet paper, and the human body are (at least somewhat) buoyant. 

At least his intelligence helped distribute his wealth to the people who are better at managing it."

2021-06-25 03:24:53,wallstreetbets,"""who gives a shit about social media?""

Um Dave. Sweety. You started an ETF that is based around companies with positive social sentiment on social media. You care about social media you silly bitch."
2021-06-25 03:11:53,wallstreetbets,Glad to finally see this sub turn on him. Dave Portnoy is the worst.
2021-06-25 02:50:23,wallstreetbets,Yeah when I heard them say that he coined the term I was pretty confused. Seen it here longer than I‚Äôve ever known who he was
2021-06-25 03:20:44,wallstreetbets,Reminds me of when Scribblenauts got sued for using memes as someone had started *copyrighting them* and waiting to cash in.
2021-06-25 03:25:26,wallstreetbets,"Watch some of his pizza reviews, he used to be entertaining and a hard reviewer that's how he got famous. Then he turned into a shill and let some piece of shit pizza joint make him give a 10/10 for horrible ass looking pizza."

2021-06-25 11:25:00,wallstreetbets,Portnoy seems pretty awful at the whole investing and trading thing in general
2021-06-25 16:15:32,wallstreetbets,Well they aren't wrong.  Nuance lies in awareness
2021-06-25 16:34:19,wallstreetbets,Just bought 300 more shares of GME.  LFG!!!  When were rich af we can waste money awarding every single GME meme.

2021-06-25 15:16:42,wallstreetbets,"I would say this is closer to the point. Payne only cares about views if it‚Äôs reaching a threshold where he might lose his job. That is *not* happening any time soon with all of his popularity as of late. 

He does not get paid directly based on views. Whereas the YouTube vultures do."
2021-06-25 08:46:12,wallstreetbets,"I make no moral aspersions about Charles Payne nor do I suggest I wouldn't do the same.  His goal is to be relevant to a market of consumers and to do that involves stirring controversy and creating appeal.  He uses guests and the investing climate to maximize that appeal and exposure irregardless of your intentions.  I am not cynical, just realistic.

So yeah, I really could have used that money.  But... since it's invested and by the time I sell, wait for the money to settle and transfer to my bank it wouldn't have been there in time.  So no point in selling.

2021-06-25 13:36:10,wallstreetbets,Kind of?!
2021-06-25 12:41:42,wallstreetbets,">they close with calling guests a little bitch too. Can't wait for next year when someone gets called a fucking retard.

man shut the fuck up before they call my wife and bring her on for a ""live review"" of her ""portfolio"""
2021-06-25 12:41:07,wallstreetbets,Lmao
2021-06-25 19:15:55,wallstreetbets,Why next year? What's wrong with this year?
2021-06-25 14:21:42,wallstreetbets,just because wsb didn't invent them doesn't mean that it didn't change fox into what it's become
2021-06-25 19:59:14,wallstreetbets,Honestly - I've never watched. I'm more of an MSNBC/ CNBC type guy
2021-06-25 03:22:17,wallstreetbets,After affirming he had diamond hands he sold the very next day
2021-06-25 05:38:28,wallstreetbets,And it went over that price he bought in at a month later so he basically handed them his money
2021-06-25 05:31:12,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure hes most well known for shoving pizza in his mouth and being belligerent
2021-06-25 03:47:21,wallstreetbets,Lol what
2021-06-25 05:33:10,wallstreetbets,Did he reall? Lol
2021-06-25 05:53:11,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve never seen or heard about this guy before in my life. Is he an individual investor or is he representing a firm? Is he a streamer?
Like. I have so many questions. Why is this guy in the spotlight?

Based on this interview alone, He doesn‚Äôt look or act like a person who can handle stress very well."
2021-06-25 06:19:56,wallstreetbets,I thought he lost 700k?
2021-06-25 06:42:39,wallstreetbets,He‚Äôs the funniest paper handed bitch ape of them all.
2021-06-25 05:49:18,wallstreetbets,"like --the highest price?

&#x200B;

but who he is--- Was he anything before people knew him?

or people just like to make fun of him, so he is a pawn to be made fun of? or both"
2021-06-25 07:21:42,wallstreetbets,"LMAO!! He‚Äôs so upset because he knows, deep down, he‚Äôs a paper-handed bitch."
2021-06-25 08:45:04,wallstreetbets,I think it was AMC and NOK that he bought and paperhanded the next day like a little bitch.
2021-06-25 09:54:57,wallstreetbets,"Not what he's known for.. thought it was for sportsing related website or something.

But around here, yes because he's a paperhanded cryass"
2021-06-25 18:50:51,wallstreetbets,"To WSB, maybe. He's been doing Barstool for a long time along with sports betting and pizza reviews. No fucking clue why anyone would interview him about stocks, trading, or finance, he'd be the last I'd go to. Guess it's because he got caught up in the meme trading."
2021-06-25 09:02:49,wallstreetbets,His face gets as red as a pepperoni as he yells at Payne.
2021-06-25 03:52:17,wallstreetbets,"One bite, everybody but me knows the rules"
2021-06-25 14:28:56,wallstreetbets,"100%

Dave is a little bitch for sure, but Charles was being a huge cunt on purpose. Virtually none of those questions made a shred of sense, especially after Dave's initial responses.

He basically said: ""I'm not shitting on people that followed me and lost for real. I'm shitting on social media trolls that no one should listen to""

The irony is... he's listening to them too... so they're both guilty."
2021-06-25 14:18:33,wallstreetbets,"Reminded me of ""And what is Aleppo?"""
2021-06-25 03:27:05,wallstreetbets,"He's just yibbering rubbish, sounds like you said maybe has taken a punch or two, he might be concussed."
2021-06-25 19:18:33,wallstreetbets,I'm doing my part. Portnoy is a paper hand lil bitch. Every little counts.
2021-06-25 09:30:18,wallstreetbets,Barstool is Boston based I believe.
2021-06-25 13:48:48,wallstreetbets,"Barstool is just a bunch of guys who wish they were still in college. 

Their entire fanbase is 18 year old college pledges.

It's really quite sad, actually."
2021-06-25 10:27:22,wallstreetbets,Cause they did not close trading. They closed buying.
2021-06-25 12:20:42,wallstreetbets,That segment was hard to watch. Guy is throwing a straight up tantrum. Hardcore cringe.
2021-06-25 04:17:01,wallstreetbets,As someone who lived through it he was in and the Robinhood thing happened where they halted buying. Portnoy sold. He later bought it again and sold again. He is a paper handed bitch period.
2021-06-25 04:28:19,wallstreetbets,Portnoy???? He made no good points. Who the fuck has $0.50 In AMC
2021-06-25 07:03:31,wallstreetbets,"Portnoy got famous by doing a sit in at the NFL commissioners office in NYC and getting arrested.

He is loud, obnoxious and confrontational, this is his ENTIRE schtick and it's hilarious watching people get all twisted up over what he said.

View him like a professional wrestler, he's living a character to get a reaction. He's very good at THAT"
2021-06-25 10:19:11,wallstreetbets,"He did make some good points. 

Like going back at the haters. 

But man did he make some really bad ones and come off like an overall dickhead."
2021-06-25 05:52:27,wallstreetbets,Also that you have to qualify by losing as much as him if you want to criticize him about it
2021-06-25 06:35:18,wallstreetbets,He's just mad momo is a lie too... Lmao

2021-06-25 10:21:11,wallstreetbets,The thought of a multi-millionaire getting salty about not receiving a free $8 frozen pizza is peak pathetic.
2021-06-25 09:54:57,wallstreetbets,"That's hilarious for how entitled it shows that he is. Ummm, spoiler alert dude, You aren't a big enough name for random companies to send you free pizza. Most likely they've never even heard of you. I know I'd never heard of him till this very thread. It isn't like he's DFV here."
2021-06-25 12:21:26,wallstreetbets,Wait... He stole that whole idea from *Community*.
2021-06-25 15:24:48,wallstreetbets,"The irony is, if you're rich and famous then you don't have to pay. Actors talk about it all the time. When everyone knows your name and you're worth millions... suddenly they want to give you shit for free!"

2021-06-25 10:19:57,wallstreetbets,Selling at the bottom is different than letting something expire worthless to be fair.
2021-06-25 11:01:11,wallstreetbets,I hope I get to use this word before I forget it.
2021-06-25 09:14:10,wallstreetbets,And the guy is right. If somebody could find me a tweet from DFV going after ‚Äúpaper handed‚Äù people...then I‚Äôll change my mind.
2021-06-25 02:07:53,wallstreetbets,He would make Kenny his bitch just like he did Dave
2021-06-25 02:12:32,wallstreetbets,"Same. I can respect statements and actions, but people like him will be used to drop giga-FUD at the most key moments. Simply the rules of the game."

2021-06-25 03:29:38,wallstreetbets,"That look on Charles' face was the same look of disappointment a father gets when he realizes his child is a moron. Payne was asking him to man up and lobby for the people he claimed to represent and what does he get in return? ""Who's Gary Ginsler?"" Hahaha"
2021-06-25 03:19:12,wallstreetbets,Yea calling him a little bitch really can't be fully appreciated without all the foreplay beforehand.
2021-06-25 02:01:44,wallstreetbets,not everyone has as many folds in their brain as you kp
2021-06-25 03:58:22,wallstreetbets,"By far, the best fox business segment I have ever seen. The last laugh of Charles is so gutteral and distinct, not only does the viewer already know he was asking tough and baited questions, yet pointless, at that point you know Charles knew he had rattled David in his rug-burned foreheaded glory."

\-Constantly uses those small businesses and the help he gives them for his own self promotion

\-Treats his workers like shit, threatens their jobs publicly for even mentioning wanting to form an union, which is illegal. 

\- Acts like he's for this movement, proclaims that he has thrown a large sum of money in these meme stocks. Sells at rock bottom, like a fucking paper handed bitch.

What are you expecting anyway? To turn that $500 into $1k? $10k? More? The probabilities tend toward the impossible the higher you go.  
What you're doing is analogous to this:  
You've taken $500 to a casino with the pretense of turning that into a more substantial sum. You've walked into an arena where the house wins more often than it's clients, and to make things worse you've sat down at a game of which you have never played nor do you know the rules. You're playing blind and don't even know how to tell if you're winning and it's time to get out.  
Do you really think you're going to walk out of there with a jackpot?"
2021-06-25 09:37:56,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm assuming Portnoy was talked to by the SEC after he hyped up all of the meme stocks right before the first peak. Doesn‚Äôt imply he knows who runs it, but he could just be acting facetious"

2021-06-25 14:40:52,wallstreetbets,"> just an 18 year old frat bro in a grown man's body

Honestly, I think he's worse. He's a grown man that desperately wishes he was an 18 year old frat boy, and now that he's wealthy he thinks surely now people will have to respect him"
2021-06-25 07:44:16,wallstreetbets,Agreed!! Why the hell is he being interviewed. Total dbag
2021-06-25 07:02:50,wallstreetbets,"Its also still gaining popularity, sadly"
2021-06-25 07:53:34,wallstreetbets,"How did anyone take him seriously to begin with? His pizza reviews are somewhat entertaining, but it ends there. The guy is quite low on the intellectual scale. He's amounted to something because he's a talker. He has kept his topics at college reading level only which kept his big fan base. I've seen him talk about stocks and it's juvenile at best. He basically throws money at what's popular and sees what sticks."
2021-06-25 06:51:53,wallstreetbets,"Lmfao. Let me tell you: WSB is 1000x more ‚Äúfrat culture‚Äù than Port-douche.

That‚Äôs frat bro behavior? He‚Äôs Gambling company $? That‚Äôs just made up.  You sound pretty jealous honestly. Considering he‚Äôs never been in a frat, I really don‚Äôt follow the point. Nobody I am friends with is a bro or was ever in a frat, we all enjoy Barstool as a form of entertainment."

2021-06-25 12:03:51,wallstreetbets,Sometimes I feel crazy when it seems like nobody remembers a few short years ago when barstool literally just was a clone of TFM operating as a media company creating frat oriented content on Instagram and YouTube. Maybe I‚Äôm old but I missed the part where Portnoy suddenly became some kind of cultural icon.

2021-06-25 05:46:17,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs an expression. Most people invest a few hundred or a few thousand and Dave has millions invested. That‚Äôs what he means. Those criticizing him don‚Äôt have as much skin in the game as he has.
2021-06-25 08:17:34,wallstreetbets,"Upvoting because you are generally correct about Dave ""el Pres"" Portnoy being a character.  But he was pretty big long before the Free Brady sit in.  Barstool was already the biggest sports blog in the world years before that"

2021-06-25 11:58:45,wallstreetbets,"Eh, not really sure about that. Barstool is a pretty big brand, definitely big enough for companies to spend like $20 to send him a pizza. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I hate Portnoy, but it‚Äôs definitely a bit surprising a company wouldn‚Äôt send a free pizza, or at least a coupon to buy one.

As far as gme i think its safe to say the shorts have covered. That would explain the price action from $12 a share up to $400. That would also explain the short interest going from 147% to 22% lol the dark pools synthetic share theory is what retail is using to lure in new retail investors, tell them theres a massive squeeze coming when the squeeze came and the shares have been covered."

2021-06-25 09:24:04,wallstreetbets,"I think you may be lost... /r/investing is that way...

At the end of the day we are all adults with our own money and decisions to make and everyone has to start somewhere with shit. You are turning this simple concept of ""stocks go up or stocks go down"" into some mystery where everyone should be a stupid ignorant pussy that is too afraid to take a chance. 

I take hearing about the guy who over leveraged themselves because of a few hundred extra dollars give it a chance then someone who just dumps it into their bank account for 1% interest annually."
2021-06-25 16:17:31,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, when I started, I could have jumped into AMC at $5 a share.  I'd say that would have been a pretty big jackpot wouldn't you say?

I've done well for myself.  Some bad trades, but mostly good.  I've learned a lot and still haven't lost my initial investment.  I've made trades where I have made a 70%+ gain.  My highest loss is 32%.  Out of all my trades, I've only lost on about 8%.  I usually never hold more than 30 minutes on a stock.  Stocks I've held longer than that I have lost the most on.  I'm a little nervous on AMC, but not enough to panic sell.

I get where you are coming from, and I really hope I'm not coming off confrontational.   You just don't understand where people are coming from and their walk in life.

I'd rather lose $500 on a CHANCE of hitting it big than the elderly people I see buying $100 worth of scratch offs daily.  Or when I worked at the local casino, a woman hit for $325k on a progressive keno machine.  And she spent it all back in less than 2 weeks trying for that high again.

This may be a gamble, but not an addiction.  It's a learning experience."

2021-06-25 07:06:12,wallstreetbets,"A hack?

Lol he's a former fat nobody patriots fan who turned a stupid newsletter into millions of dollars.

You can hate him but the guy is on CNN talking investments. He's never been MORE relevant"
2021-06-25 09:24:10,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm not a barstool guy but this comment really demonstrates a lack of understanding of just how incredibly relevant Portnoy is
2021-06-25 08:50:51,wallstreetbets,Dude is a massive asshole but he's not irrelevant. Barstool is still enormous even if it's predominantly amongst college aged frat bro types
2021-06-25 09:26:14,wallstreetbets,"Idk, Rough and Rowdy is pretty funny. Aside from that everything he does makes me skin crawl, the little creep."
2021-06-25 09:33:11,wallstreetbets,Portnoy is not clinging to relevance lol. Doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs not a hack though.

Thanks!"
2021-06-25 09:56:19,wallstreetbets,I find Pats fans to be more grateful for the last 20 years rather than pompous douche nozzles like Yankees fans are.
2021-06-25 12:42:53,wallstreetbets,Actually pretty sure you could still sell. That was a lot of the problem. Closed buying but still allowed selling which had the effect of stopping the rocket ship and actually making the value drop.
2021-06-25 13:04:44,wallstreetbets,"When they shut down trading, it usually means you cannot buy and sell. What Robinhood did was restrict buying. Restricting all trades buy/sell is to calm market volitility,  restricting buying is to manipulate people to sell."
2021-06-25 04:28:11,wallstreetbets,There's no problem with selling.  I too sold my GME.  The difference being I didn't try and become a leader of a hype train and then sell moments after encouraging my 2.5 million Twitter followers to buy.
2021-06-25 05:51:35,wallstreetbets,"He bought and aold like any other normal paper handed bih.  But consistent with his baby ego he wanted some praise and recognition for buying and ‚Äújoining the movement‚Äù but wanted to be left alone and in a safe space when he sold and left the movement.

But according to him, if you lose as much as he did then you qualify to call him names.  He only lets bigger boys call him names."
2021-06-25 06:27:31,wallstreetbets,This is technically true I guess
2021-06-25 06:04:28,wallstreetbets,I think where his argument fails is many investors are investing all they have. So % wise his millions are the same as someone‚Äôs thousands.
2021-06-25 09:52:07,wallstreetbets,"No he's talking about me guys, I invested my lucky nickel in GME to help the ""movement"""
2021-06-25 09:31:42,wallstreetbets,"Maybe...but that point is moot.  Because its only relevant IF the only people calling him that were in fact tourists...but they aren‚Äôt.  Plenty of diamond handed apes who are in this for a significantly buy-in are criticizing him too.  So thats why he‚Äôs whiney because nobody is listening to the point he wants to make‚Äîsince its a moot one.

Oh wait‚Äîwhat if you also lost 700k?  Then you qualify to criticize him? That means he believes in swinging down at people. He‚Äôs a bug baby and it shows 

He would t have faced any criticism if he didnt don himself ‚Äúdiamondhanded.‚Äù  Plenty of people diamond handed through a bit more than ‚Äúlosing a nickel.‚Äù

The nerve on this guy is clitoral in size."

2021-06-25 17:23:30,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't want to be caught sending him free shit to review for my company. He does have a decent name and following, but not even worth $20 in free food for a pizza review podcast. 

Believe it or not, some companies have a little morality."
2021-06-25 13:07:59,wallstreetbets,He also did reviews of frozen pizza's in one of the credit skits.

2021-06-25 10:00:11,wallstreetbets,"Yea where exactly am I advocating for a buy-and-hold strategy?  
You're correct in that this sub's ethos is about making big bets with leverage, but moving back in time those were done in a semi-intelligent way: options plays to capture surprise earnings or other binary events, some technical setup, or some change in fundamentals - some amount of intelligence behind the trade.  
What's going on here is not any of that, it's delusion. Cope harder."
2021-06-25 07:34:11,wallstreetbets,And he's not barely clinging to relevance. He might be a boston masshole but barstool is huge still
2021-06-25 12:27:11,wallstreetbets,I honestly wish people would just stop interviewing him and talking to him or about him. It would be the best for everyone. He‚Äôs a bitch and it‚Äôs so evident in the way he acts in this.
2021-06-25 07:31:48,wallstreetbets,All that money in his tiny little paper hands
2021-06-25 11:15:47,wallstreetbets,With the way he trades that will be 120k soon.
2021-06-25 10:14:40,wallstreetbets,You can thank spittin chiclets for a lot of that.
2021-06-25 14:39:57,wallstreetbets,portnoy commented he lost over half that on the 2020 crash cause hes a paper-handed bitch. how does one lose over 60 million in one year? portnoy has the answer
2021-06-25 07:52:46,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. All the hate making these apes blind. I find him hilarious, he helped out a local place with the barstool fund he started."

2021-06-25 05:43:08,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. The fact this sub refers to him a as a guy who's known for stock trading, just proves his point. A bunch of people with no real skin in the game name-calling.

2021-06-25 10:08:33,wallstreetbets,I've never met a grateful Pat's fan. Always end up the drunkest and most obnoxious in an away game. Was pretty funny to know my brother got to see one kicked down the stairs in the nosebleeds when he tried to pull his junk out while being escorted out by security.
2021-06-25 13:39:58,wallstreetbets,"So, that's the long way of saying that they *did* restrict me from *trading* my money for shares."
2021-06-25 04:30:59,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs on y‚Äôall in my opinion. Do your own DD and quit seeking financial advice from influencers on Twitter. Like Dave Portnoy.
2021-06-25 08:56:41,wallstreetbets,"Percentage wise isn't the right way to look at it either.  Dave is worth, say 120 million dollars.  How much would he need to lose to noticably affect his standard of living and how specifically?  First class instead of private jet if he loses 100 million dollars?   This is why very wealthy people can invest in extremely risky things with a high degree of confidence amd weather through when the going gets tough.  Namely because ""cutting your losses"" doesn't really save you anything.  

Now a guy with 20k to his name, investing $2000 into GME is a different story"
2021-06-25 13:15:57,wallstreetbets,"His claim is that only people who aren't involved in investing are criticising him.

That point is never addressed.

That's a failure of the interviewer.

It's like someone who doesn't follow football criticising transfers, or someone who has only watched the most recent game. You're 100% entitled to call out their lack of knowledge and experience.

The defence against that would be ""what about the long term fans"", not ""that's not very nice, it's a bit elitist?""."
2021-06-25 17:24:30,wallstreetbets,And a bad review does the opposite. Why put trust into a jackass who does shock entertainment?

2021-06-25 09:13:47,wallstreetbets,Explain how the price went from $12 a share to $400 if it wasnt people covering their short position. That move wasnt retail propping up the price. Since the squeeze in January youve seen retail propping up the price by saying the short squeeze is coming lol it came it went they shorting it like they were before

Responding to a chainlink investor accusing him on Twitter of being ‚Äújust a weak handed suit like the rest of them,‚Äù Portnoy wrote: ‚ÄúI make 6 figures a day like clockwork in the real stock market. No need to sit around losing money waiting for Elon \[Musk\] to mine gold from outer space. I‚Äôll have built my own house on the moon before that day comes.

Lordstown Motors has been approved for Russell Index inclusion.  This can be great for stocks!  Not only is this a sign that a company has hit a size milestone, but it also means that fund managers tracking the index will hold shares.  More investors buying, selling and holding any stock is good for liquidity and good for valuation multiples.

When there is more demand for anything, even stocks, prices tend to rise.   This year‚Äôs additions and deletions will occur on June 25.

2021-06-25 07:59:41,wallstreetbets,"The Company said this:

""The Company‚Äôs ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to complete the development of its electric vehicles, obtain regulatory approval, begin commercial scale production and launch the sale of such vehicles. ***The Company believes that our current level of cash and cash equivalents are not sufficient to fund commercial scale production and the launch of sale of such vehicles.*** These conditions raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements."""
2021-06-25 07:09:11,wallstreetbets,"It was 3 people that sold and it was like 1% of the total insider shares. The going concern is for May of 2022 after they spend $300m retooling the plant getting ready for September production in September. If they don‚Äôt get more funding by then, they will only start production at 50%. Either way they have enough cash to produce trucks until end of May next year."

2021-06-25 16:33:16,wallstreetbets,"Enjoy the pumping of a dead stock. Just make sure to get off before their inevitable bankruptcy. Might take a few years, especially if you pump the price and they raise money to continue the scam.

Someone, please, explain, how needing to do extra suspension work, strengthen the vehicle, and add weight makes sense for an EV (the weight part) and how that contributes to making a vehicle easier and cheaper to build. Nevermind 4 motors versus 1 or 2 motors does not seem like it will save much. Of course the unsprung weight and greater rotational inertia using in-Wheel motors also does not seem to make much sense for an EV.

Not saying they have no product (well nothing yet that goes over 45 mph) but the product they have is a mix of bad decisions with people without a successful track record telling you to trust them that this makes sense and will work.

As to production, good luck. Their ancient factory still needs lots of work and they will have equipment breaking down every other day."
2021-06-25 09:01:08,wallstreetbets,You keep believing a debt-free company with millions of assets cannot get a loan.  I will be making money off of RIDE.

2021-06-25 10:06:57,wallstreetbets,"The company itself said this. Not my words.

Anyway what loan are they getting?

ATVM? Lucid and others have gone through due diligence on this loan in recent years and it has gone nowhere. Steve Burns when he was at Workhorse talked up this loan and they did not get it there either.  In any case the chance of a company with a ""going concern"" getting an ATVM loan seems farfetched.

A loan against the factory? Well what is that factory worth? Old auto factories seem to sell in the range of $20M-$40M assuming a buyer can be found in the first place. Lordstown Motors did spend some money there, however only a little of that money would have value if it had to be sold to a third party. Basically, the borrowing base the factory would allow for is not going to be much, would be surprised if more than $200M (probably more like $50-100M)."
2021-06-25 10:10:03,wallstreetbets,An asset-based loan would be easy to obtain.
2021-06-25 10:41:12,wallstreetbets,"What is the borrowing base? The CFO did not answer this question last earnings call... Maybe the collateral is not worth that much...

Oh, if an asset-based loan was ""easy"" here, then there would not have been a going concern..."
2021-06-25 11:06:37,wallstreetbets,"I would guess the appraised value of the property has gone up since they purchased it since all real estate has gone up lately.

That accounting term was required since they did not currently have enough to last 12 months.  That has nothing at all to do with the ability to get a loan.

You go ahead and sit on the sidelines and watch me get richer than I already am."
2021-06-25 11:25:36,wallstreetbets,"What you are saying is fundamentally flawed. The professional standards require you to consider ability to secure financing.

AU-C Sec 570B.A8(b)

[https://www.aicpa.org/research/standards/auditattest/downloadabledocuments/au-c-00570.pdf](https://www.aicpa.org/research/standards/auditattest/downloadabledocuments/au-c-00570.pdf)

Regarding real estate going up, not all real estate has gone up, rather residential real estate has gone up. Industrial properties, especially an auto plant in a depressed area will just about never go up in value."
2021-06-25 12:37:52,wallstreetbets,"At the bottom of page 621 and top of 622 you see they would need evidence that a 3rd party intends to provide support. Being in the process of looking into financing is not evidence of the 3rd party's intentions.  Page 629 talks about financing, but without knowing terms of loan available they may not have been able to consider that.  I was in the mortgage business at a brokerage for 10 years and that included a few commercial properties.  I had some lenders that would loan them a lot of money and would close in less than a month, knowing they could foreclose and then easily sell the plant for more than they were owed."
2021-06-25 12:38:45,wallstreetbets,They would not have cared about their ability to pay the loan payments.
2021-06-25 12:55:11,wallstreetbets,"The section you referred to does not refer to being able to get a traditional loan.

To help you out, the AICPA has illustrative language (AU-C Sec 570B.A36, on page 635 of that document) of what a ""support letter"" looks like.

&#x200B;

>*(Supporting party name) will, and has the ability to, fully support the operating, investing, and financing activities of (entity name) through at least one year and a day beyond \[insert date\] 30 (the date the financial statements are issued or available for issuance, when applicable).*  
>  
>Depending on the facts and circumstances, this written support letter may be adapted, for example, by adding the following wording:  
  
*This also applies to any amounts that may ultimately be due to the Internal Revenue Service as a result of the recent judgment against (entity name)* ***and also applies should (entity name's) debt not be refinanced when the debt becomes due in the next year.***

&#x200B;

You claim to have been in the mortgage business. Does that language look like something a bank would ever write?

In any case the last sentence in the block quote above is providing support if the debt cannot be refinanced, which in my non-professional judgement seems to indicate that this section is not talking at all about a loan commitment (it it was a loan commitment, then it would be refinancing, so the language would be contradictory) but rather a commitment by the owner or some other interested party."
2021-06-25 13:08:06,wallstreetbets,"No clue what you are talking about. I referenced a section that describes considering mitigating events, of which one is ability to get financing.

The reality here is the collateral is not worth much. GM shut down this factory so they likely have no interest in it. Tesla has no interest in it as they need to build new factories designed for how they want to build EV's. Fremont was a crutch to save money, but has since become a hinderance in expanding and dealing with quality issues. Lucid, from the get-go has chosen to build a new factory from scratch. GM, Ford, etc, they all have newer factories with newer equipment with workforces in place that they would retrofit before taking an aging factory (they would probably build a new factory before taking an aging factory that in the long-run is a competitive disadvantage for making EV's). GM for example announced they will spend $35B to go electric. Their concerns are far bigger than the hundred million or so that RIDE dumped in this facility.

Bottom line it is a building that would be very hard to sell for anything close to what RIDE put into it. Banks that lend to the auto industry are probably well versed in this math as this seems to be a consistent fact that applies to auto plants, so the borrowing base here will be a very low amount."

He says he sold. So if he's up that much then he's over the 25k PDT restrictions. 

And he's using Robinhood, so it's instant settlement. Meaning he'll already be able to use that money for purchases, and the money will be available to bank transfer in 3ish days. 

I'd take being this retard."

There was a moral panic about this in the media and old school Wall Street, so they created the PDT rule. The theory was day trading platforms had to stop letting the poors join because they couldn‚Äôt make enough commissions off of them if they were blocked from trading.

Of course the market crash happened before the rule took effect and that killed the day trading fad pretty effectively."

2021-06-25 00:28:19,wallstreetbets,It means that he invested a bunch of money on bets that paid off really damm good. But since he is using Robinhood he won‚Äôt be able to cash out.

2021-06-25 00:15:19,wallstreetbets,You're in the wrong sub for that. Try r/investing or r/options for that

TSLA goes up and so does the premium to pay for the contract. Some one else bought all those contracts from him hoping the stock price would continue to go up throughout the day."

2021-06-25 00:54:57,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs give or take the money he spent, it could of been way more because of the Greeks can eat your bets in a matter of days. He didn‚Äôt show his average price. Used his total gains and subtract his total value"
2021-06-25 01:57:40,wallstreetbets,What app do you recommend instead of Robinhood
2021-06-25 07:43:48,wallstreetbets,"they are great for option trading tho, dont keep my stocks there, just easy to buy and sell options"
2021-06-25 17:00:07,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs ok to be retarded on this sub, but try not to be so stupid. He‚Äôs not restricted for making money. Don‚Äôt let your teen drama brain get in the way of seeing things for how they actually are. Robinhood sucks, but not in this way. He is restricted for day trading more than 3 round trips before he had $25,000 in his account. It‚Äôs a federal regulation. At the beginning of the day on Monday, since his account will start the day with more than 25k, the restriction will clear."
2021-06-25 00:18:32,wallstreetbets,Thanks Bro üëç will do.
2021-06-25 19:25:06,wallstreetbets,Thank you for the help

2021-06-25 08:52:50,wallstreetbets,CEOs in mature industries usually try to under promise and over deliver to keep their stock volatility down. But then retail investors act like they‚Äôre the only one who sees ‚Äúexpectations ‚Äú will be beaten and think this is actionable information. When wallstreet already has their own expectations factoring all this in so they sell the news to retail bag holders
2021-06-25 17:59:37,wallstreetbets,Last week RH showed me options from 2 weeks ago available for purchase...that's easy money!

2021-06-25 04:12:47,wallstreetbets,Fidelity is what I use. It has been good to me.
2021-06-25 12:54:34,wallstreetbets,I mean there are probabilities factored into expectations. Sometimes it‚Äôs a toss-up on what‚Äôs going to happen. That was more the case before COVID craziness and before every fuckity mom and pop and dildo shop was crushing earnings.
2021-06-25 11:19:21,wallstreetbets,Biiiiiitch lmao

2021-06-25 10:12:09,wallstreetbets,Totally agree. I HATE what they did with GME earlier this year but their UI is just soo slick. Its almost to easy to enter options positions.
2021-06-25 12:27:02,wallstreetbets,"In the TD Ameritrade app, you literally just tap the stock, tap the options tab, and scroll up and down to find the option. I can‚Äôt imagine it could be much easier than that."
2021-06-25 13:37:45,wallstreetbets,"Have you tried td ameritrade's app? I find it rather easy and fast for options and stock, it's rather slick. (Not the think or swim app, I hate that confused mess)"
2021-06-25 19:24:00,wallstreetbets,Thanks for trying to explain. Still not sure where you got the $4.75 from. What does the $36.6 in the image mean?
2021-06-25 00:50:30,wallstreetbets,"Damn. I hope I can get to a point where I can put that much on a call and not worry about it if I lose it all. Thanks again, what numbers did you use to calculate that?"
2021-06-25 12:57:12,wallstreetbets,They truly have the best app but man I rather be with the beast than with the beauty if she gonna take that kitty away when I‚Äôm almost there
2021-06-25 10:16:23,wallstreetbets,Yep. That‚Äôs why we still use it. We can hate it and love the UI simultaneously.
2021-06-25 13:14:02,wallstreetbets,precisely
2021-06-25 12:29:51,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs confusing as fuck
2021-06-25 18:50:06,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs ok.  And it‚Äôs what I use now. But RH is still so much easier and better
2021-06-25 19:31:14,wallstreetbets,"Sorry.

Forget 4.75.


36.6$ is what's the price for his 28 Contracts. Each contract equals 100 shares, which means, if Tsla's price exceeds for the calls he paid for, he can still exercise his right to purchase them at his call price. 

Let's say his call price was 750, TSLA is at 770-800 or whatever, he can still buy 2800 shares of Tesla at 750, or give up his right to buy them, at premium price of 36$ per share, per contract, hence his gains are Good"
2021-06-25 01:24:02,wallstreetbets,"It's a common misconception that we don't care if we lose the money. We care, we just do it because we're retarded."
2021-06-25 01:11:57,wallstreetbets,Generally it‚Äôs just total value - total returns or at least in this case it is.
2021-06-25 01:12:32,wallstreetbets,"Total Value less Total Return equals your invested capital.

The value of your positions it's the sum of the money you put in plus however much it appreciated or depreciated."
2021-06-25 01:27:12,wallstreetbets,Lol I wanna be fully retarded.
2021-06-25 07:10:45,wallstreetbets,"You don't. Honestly this sub is fun but if you're taking financial advice from around these parts of the internet, you're gonna be in for a sad time. Lots of people started joining after GME and tried to replicate it and lots of people lost lots of money. Just be very careful. These people on here are just gambling really."
2021-06-25 03:06:40,wallstreetbets,Everybody knows you never go full retard
2021-06-25 08:55:13,wallstreetbets,"I understand thank you for your honesty. After I dumped 20k into CLOV i realized that I am much more suited for safe low risk investments like Mutual funds. I do enjoy trading though.  But as a long term retirement vehicle, not get rich quick gambling."
2021-06-25 16:09:46,wallstreetbets,You could always just do the opposite and clean up.

2021-06-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$KBH - Cramer please stop stalking me. The market may like pulling out, but I don't. What's the point when your sperm are retarded from years of eating crayons and eating that delicious sweet-sweet? That's what me and my friends called the little crunchies on the ground of our favorite abandoned warehouse.

Speaking of houses, let's talk about KBH again. While my last two DD's caused 25% dildos, [the DD on KBH](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o5tbpf/kbh_theres_no_place_like_homo/) didn't, despite being like twice as long which just makes no sense at all. I'm sorry if anybody bought in and lost money. **But, to anyone who was retarded enough** ***not*** **to buy in, well, now you get a 75% discount on calls, and the situation is largely looking the same.**

A lot of shit has happened in the last two days since that post. So in this DD I go over media coverage, the earnings blowback, Goldman PTs, updated charts, and suggest Aug calls. This was written in a rush and I was busy losing money, so forgive me for the low quality.

TLDR:

* The thesis still holds: **Pretty much everything in the** [**previous DD**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o5tbpf/kbh_theres_no_place_like_homo/) **still holds, except the stock is now 6% cheaper and the IV is way lower.**
* Cramer apparently follows my DDs religiously, but is not a fan of green giant dildos.
* KBH missed revenue by 2.5% and the market sold it off. Their loss, your gain.
* KBH/LEN gap widens, offering even easier entry for those that are well endowed, like you and me.
* Goldman raises their 12m price target to $62, I got a copy of the report.
* I'm doubling down

# I. Hi, Jim.

Following my post on BGS, [$BGS - Green Giant‚Ñ¢ Dildos, and Cream of WSB](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nzszyd/bgs_green_giant_dildos_and_cream_of_wsb/), Cramer [tweets this](https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1404765462068707333).

**Then, he goes onto Flashy Money or whatever CNBC's market opening show is, and** [**talks about Green Giant sex toys on live air**](https://v.redd.it/mncrdbzu49771)**.**

Shortly after posting the BGS DD, I remarked that it'd be amazing to see a newscaster talk about ""retail mania fueled by green giant dildos"" or something like that... and it actually fucking happened, with Cramer of all people. Yeah, that's going on the mantle.

Next, following my post on KBH, [Mad Money's opening segment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyo_Zo1bSE8#t=52) the next day was all about residential construction. I mean, it was also the day that new home sales were posted, and yeah the industry is on fucking fire... but, please, accommodate my illusions of grandeur -- Jim's following in my footsteps. Jim, get off my dick, buddy.

Now, as much as the guy *is* a sell-out, he does tend to have a very solid understanding of the market. Like, savant level, actually. (The fact he often uses his platform for shilling is another topic entirely, and in my opinion makes him a hypocrite whenever he shits on WSBs.) The segment was decent, so, I'll recap it.

Sidenote: Jim opens the segment with a bunch of crRaAAaZzZyY sound effects and flashing animations -- is that really the type of research we want, Jim? You want to play that game?

Ok, onto the content of [the opening segment on residential construction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyo_Zo1bSE8#t=52).

## Not nearly enough houses.

>We used to build 2m homes a year when we had half the population. Now we're doing half of that with double the population. -Jimmy (aka, pennyether\_numberone\_fan)

From Toll Brother's CEO:

>It's going to take a long time for this pent-up demand to be satisfied. We think it's going to take years before we ever get back to anything close to the equilibrium that we had seen in a bunch of the prior decades.

## Demand is here to stay

From the LEN CEO:

>New home construction cannot ramp quickly enough to fill the void of the production deficit that has persisted over the past decade. ...  The bottom line is that supply is short, and is likely to remain that way for some time to come.

## Other

Jim makes some more salient points. Probably because he read my DD.

* 73m millennials entering their 30s and buying homes
* This is not like the last housing bubble, because lending standards are much more stringent.
* Last bubble was pre-COVID. COVID allows remote work, people are fleeing cities, etc.
* Jim ignores KBH, which I take as a personal attack. Fuck you, Jim.

## This morning: Jim mentions KBH, good boy, Jim.

[From this morning.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlM2oKbO8IA&t=130s)

>To sell KB Homes here, is to not recognize the longevity of what could be a secular trend, and not a cyclical trend. I've always felt that home building was incredibly cyclical. I can't say that now, the numbers are just too good.

Couldn't have said it better myself, because I already did fucking say it. Two days ago.

\---

# II. Earnings Panic

KBH missed revenues by 2.5% and the market shit itself. I don't fucking care what they do, my conviction is only higher now, and I'm doubling down.

## Earnings

Listen to the [King Stud](https://www.completedesign.cc/client-resources/dictionary-of-construction-terminology/418-king-stud). Yeah, the one who [verbally rammed his lumber into Kathy Griffin's ears](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kathy-griffin-jeffrey-mezger-kb-home_n_59c145aee4b0186c22061a67):

>With a backlog value above $4 billion, we are poised to deliver a substantial increase in revenue this year, at solid margins that we anticipate will contribute to a return on equity of roughly 20%. -King Stud

Commodity prices were of no concern, as expected. Margins widened:

>Within homebuilding, housing gross margin (excluding inventory-related charges) improved 280 basis points (bps) year over year to 21.5%. The increase was attributed to a favorable pricing environment due to robust housing market demand, increased operating leverage on higher revenues and lower amortization of previously capitalized interest. - Zack's (thanks for doing math)

New guidance:

>In summary, given the size and composition of our quarter and backlog of over 10,000 homes, along with our expanded production capacity, we expect further improvements in our financial resolves and return metrics in 2021, as compared to our expectations at the time of our last earnings call.  
>  
>Using the mid-points of our new guidance ranges, we now expect a 45% year-over-year increase in housing revenues and further expansion in our operating margin to 11.75%. This profitability levels should drive a return on average equity of approximately 20% for the full year. - King Stud

## Charts

I've updated some charts to include the new Q2 numbers.

First up, orders, deliveries, and census.gov housing starts.

[KBH orders, deliveries, vs census.gov housing starts. LEN for reference, since it popped and KBH didn't \(yet\).](https://preview.redd.it/1mekuijo1c771.png?width=646&format=png&auto=webp&s=3cb289e0576d2cd04639ef94d79ecfa3315d0018)

Ok, so KBH didn't blow out orders. They merely had one of their biggest quarters ever, but not a blowout in revenue. However, looking at deliveries, they were clearly unaffected by high commodity prices or material shortages -- their deliveries jumped up quite a bit, nearly to pre COVID levels. They also seem to be keeping good pace with the number of overall houses started.

If you're curious about the review scraping shit I did and how well it worked:

[Review count vs. # of deliveries. Q2 data is here now.](https://preview.redd.it/sbab0zuy1c771.png?width=719&format=png&auto=webp&s=89b6423d7d097c97216864eaff4bfa71f9e4c28c)

It looks like the ratio of reviews to actual orders could be seasonal. Look at 2021Q2 vs 2020Q2 -- same ratio more or less (though 2019Q2 is not). The correlation is still inconclusive, but I'll keep on eye on this the next quarter, if I remain solvent that long.

\---

# III. The Chart

Here's a compelling chart for you. It's full of crayons and, unfortunately, words that you might have to read. It's the same as in the last DD, but updated to include todays dip.

&#x200B;

[KBH eats shit while LEN dines at Wendy's](https://preview.redd.it/tzjiff422c771.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d823beb5a157fa8aabc1113f7114982aefaa1da)

This is the chart I care about the most for short term. I have faith KBH will catch up to LEN. If not now, then when all the residential constructors report earnings in mid/late July.

# IV. Goldman PT Increased

Goldman Sachs just today (Jun 24) maintained their Buy rating and updated their 12m price target to $62 from $59, based on the earnings results. Go and try to find this report yourself... bet you can't. I've included selections of it below.

>**Beat Driven by Profitability, Tax Rate**: Given this (lower than expected HB and other revenue) is supply related, and comes as KB works to align sales to starts, it is resulting in upside to pricing, margins, and returns. As such, even as seasonal norms kick in over the next few months, moderating sales on a relative basis, we believe the company remains well positioned to grow EPS through F2022 and maintain our Buy rating.

Bullish.

>**Robust Order Growth Drives Sales Pace Higher**: The sales pace of 7/month was the highest in over a decade. Reflecting its confidence in the outlook, YTD starts are running at \~8,500 homes and KB reiterated its guidance for double-digit community count growth in F2022, with upside to its 10+% target as it works to balance supply and demand.

Bullish.

>**Maximizing Margins While Holding to Affordability**: Homes are priced relative to median local incomes, in many cases below existing homes, and mgmt highlighted interest lists remain extended with FICO scores improving through the quarter, reflecting the financial health of its buyers.

Not a bubble. Credit scores high. Competitively priced and raking in the dough.

>**Healthy Balance Sheet Supports Investing in Growth**: It ended F2Q with nearly 77,500 parcels, 45% of which are optioned, the highest proportion since 2006. It is also leveraging its capital structure to enter new cities, including Boise announced tonight in addition to Charlotte earlier this year.

Expansion.

>**Revising Estimates and Price Target, Maintain Buy Rating**: In turn, our 12-month price target goes to $62 (from $59), which is based on 1.8x (unchanged) our NTM tangible book value forecast, and we maintain our Buy rating

Cool.

>**Investment Risks**: Downside risks to our Buy rating include: (1) Higher interest rates could inhibit affordability, (2) Increase in existing home market supply, (3) Supply chain disruptions impacting cycle time and pressuring costs, ($) Delays or limitations around permitting, inspections, and other municipal related events, and (4) Above-average balance sheet leverage may limit expansion plan.

My thoughts:

1. Rates increasing: Not going to happen anytime soon, and if it does, it'll be by a small amount. Demand is high enough to absorb this.
2. Increase in home market supply: Already happening at 2005 pace, yet prices are going up.
3. Supply Chain/Cost Issues: If it happens to KBH, it happens to everyone. Which means less prices of houses go up. Also, costs get passed on to buyers.
4. Balance Sheet: I don't know, I'm retarded with this. If you say it's a risk I believe you.

I think the real issue with the risks is that the market will overreact on any news indicating any of the above. I don't think it changes the fact KBH is going to crush it for at least the next year or two.

## Forecast

&#x200B;

[PT: $62. Not bad.](https://preview.redd.it/a8tu22842c771.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=d867f34ddd2d8ead8d1b6858d5a4bf0a3d4571a3)

# V. The Bet

## My Positions

&#x200B;

[My positions roughly at open today. Ouch.](https://preview.redd.it/fcw5kv762c771.png?width=972&format=png&auto=webp&s=23a24ceb50a11c7fdea448fcb6848b4b16848ca7)

&#x200B;

[My positions at close today. Also ouch.](https://preview.redd.it/nd8q0zj82c771.png?width=914&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ca8b448df19d6a966d40a2b36c9e82b86c3854b)

**Yes, I added a bunch.**

## Catalysts / Etc

* Short term: LEN/KBH spread diminishing. If you want to hedge out the market, go long KBH, short LEN. If you have balls, just go long KBH. **My Jul calls are a bet on this**, and that the stock got slammed way too hard after earning.
* Mid term: The above, plus mid/late July earnings from other builders, more housing data next month, and the realization that inflation doesn't matter to settle in. **My Aug calls are to capture this.** Sep are fine too, and might actually be better, as theta won't chew on them so hard as we wait for the Jul earnings to roll in.
* Long term: The above, plus generally continued strength in home building, summer home buying season showing up in Q3 earnings, etc. LEAPs are totally viable here. **Shares are the bet here.** There may be better home builders to be buying for long term, so look around.

IVs are low on KBH and I love the risk/reward on all of the above.

## Other Notes

**I'm a fucking retard, so take nothing I said as financial advice.** I'm also entirely delusional and believe I can impact how the market prices this stock, and as such a lot of this is a bet on myself. I write these DD's to highlight things I'm seeing in the market and to express myself artistically. Whether or not you choose to join me is on you.

Again, sorry for this mess of a DD. Read my previous one: [KBH - There's no place like homo](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o5tbpf/kbh_theres_no_place_like_homo/) for far more depth -- pretty much nothing has changed except KBH is cheaper. "

Normally people have stocks and they do and equal amount of covered calls on those stocks with high IV.  But in this case, the OP has just naked puts, which is pretty rare. Not something I would do unless you got many, many years of option trading under your belt. Even then, there are better option strategy to profit."

2021-06-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"For Options expiring out of the money, here is some consolation - Capital Losses A consolation prize I guess because hopefully we‚Äôll make our money back and then some to which the tax liability will be offset by the loses. 

Just remember that Stocks don‚Äôt expire (unless the company goes insolvent) 

Disclaimers  - Subject to change in 2021 -2022 tax season. This is not financial advice.  If you are confused (and save on taxes) always seek out a CPA, Tax Attorney, Financial Advisor, etc.

https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/investments-and-taxes/capital-gains-and-losses/L7GF1ouP8


TLDR - Losses? You can get a tax deduction up to a certain amount generally the explanation below( subject to changes obviously).

‚ÄúCan I deduct my capital losses?

Yes, but there are limits. Losses on your investments are first used to offset capital gains of the same type. So, short-term losses are first deducted against short-term gains, and long-term losses are deducted against long-term gains. Net losses of either type can then be deducted against the other kind of gain.

For example,

If you have $2,000 of short-term loss and only $1,000 of short-term gain, the net $1,000 short-term loss can be deducted against your net long-term gain (assuming you have one).
If you have an overall net capital loss for the year, you can deduct up to $3,000 of that loss against other kinds of income, including your salary and interest income.
Any excess net capital loss can be carried over to subsequent years to be deducted against capital gains and against up to $3,000 of other kinds of income.
If you use married filing separate filing status, however, the annual net capital loss deduction limit is only $1,500.‚Äù"

2021-06-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$COTY. Masks Off. Cosmetic Demand SOARING. Profits On. Reopening play still at a discount. **TLDR:** Mask mandates around the world are being lifted. The need for cosmetics (it expires) is going to soar as normalcy returns and women leave their homes without a mask. $COTY is number one manufacturer of fragrances and number 4 for colored cosmetics in the world amidst a massive company turn around along with early inning expansion into Asia and e-commerce. Still at 15% discount to pre-covid price and 60%+ upside from current price to recent upgrade to $15 target ($9.50 today). IE your wife's bf is going to buy her perfume and makeup so she is more tolerable to look at, Coty options are the play I own Jan 23 $10c and Jan 22 $8C, the latter I owned for awhile now. Do not buy weeklies, longer dated options aren't expensive and are the play.

I've done two DD's here in the past, one for FDX calls last ER that printed 50%+ gains ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2d4sh/fdx\_delivering\_you\_tendiesmassive\_upside\_going/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2d4sh/fdx_delivering_you_tendiesmassive_upside_going/)) and the second was $SNOW puts that printed 150% plus gains ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kina26/snow\_massive\_dilution\_incoming\_easy\_put/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kina26/snow_massive_dilution_incoming_easy_put/)).

My third DD is going to be on $COTY, a reopening play that is still at a discount, isn't a meme stock and has nothing to do with shorts or pants or squeezes.

$COTY is one of the largest manufactures in the world for the beauty industry (manufacturer all Gucci cosmetics), they are number one for fragrances and number 4 for colored cosmetics. Prior to COVID this company was an absolute nightmare. As you would expect, when COVID hit the price was crushed, it has been slowly climbing back during COVID but the best is yet ahead. Price is STILL 15% LOWER than it was pre-covid and LEAP options here are very cheap (positions at end).

Mask mandates have been lifted here in the US, most recently here in CA, people are openly out not wearing their masks. Mask mandates are now being lifted in Europe, most recently:

Spain:[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/spain-scrap-mandatory-outdoor-masks-june-26-2021-06-18/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/spain-scrap-mandatory-outdoor-masks-june-26-2021-06-18/)

Italy: [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/22/italy-to-lift-mandatory-masks-outdoors-as-pandemic-slows](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/22/italy-to-lift-mandatory-masks-outdoors-as-pandemic-slows)

Switzerland: [https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/swiss-accelerate-reopening-allow-large-events-with-covid-certificates-2021-06-23/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/swiss-accelerate-reopening-allow-large-events-with-covid-certificates-2021-06-23/)

As these mask mandates are lifted, more women will be leaving their home and be seen without a mask. All makeup expires and the demand for makeup and perfume is going to SKYROCKET as women re-enter society.

Compared to peers like Rev that are much more expensive than COTY, this is a nice play in the space. I own Jan 2023 $10C and Jan 2022 $8C, the latter I have owned since earlier this year. My personal opinion is that this should hit $15 early next year  ($9.50 today), which for options would be 200-300% returns, this is not a stock to play weeklies on.

Right prior to COVID, they hired a new CEO Sue Nabi.  She has an incredible track record of success with spending over 20 years at L'Oreal and eventually became their youngest CEO in their 110 company history. In 2009, she joined Lancome ‚Äì leading the brand to three years of up-to-double-digit growth and a record turnover of $3.2B. Her team and her also have extensive digital sales experience ,which **Coty** was lacking prior but will be significant as they continue to expand their global brand presence. Prior to her, there was high CEO turnover and poor management team which was reflected in the declining stock price and creates an opportunity for more upside with the new CEO. In addition, prior to Sue they had a significant amount of debt and their brands along with margins were awful, hence the declining price before COVID. She has made it a focus now to reduce debt (big sale to KKR earlier this year), substantially improve margins, cost cutting and focusing on more prestige brands. Her transformation to enter the Asian Market and build an much better e-commerce presence leave substantial room for growth. Lastly she has been quickly changing the board to bring on more industry experts.

The four talking points below are from : [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-reasons-coty-could-surprise-the-naysayers-2021-06-17](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-reasons-coty-could-surprise-the-naysayers-2021-06-17), this gives a bit more insight into Coty.

## 1. Costs are dropping, margins rising

Reining in expenses and boosting gross margin are both signs Coty is likely executing well on its strategic transformation, with top- and bottom-line improvements slightly lagging. Gross margin jumped 450 basis points year over year, reaching 62.2%, with CFO Laurent Mercier stating that regarding ""the gross margin improvement delivered this quarter, we are confident that approximately half is structural, and therefore, can be maintained."" Mercier also highlighted that Coty's ""fixed cost reduction program has allowed us to redirect capital to accelerate our brands and focus on profit delivery,"" with fixed costs dropping 15% year over year.

## 2. Aggressive product mix improvements

Rather than simply relying on its existing product mix to carry it forward, Coty is actively cutting support to brands failing to deliver adequate returns, while developing and supporting its profitable sectors. This process is strengthened by the fixed cost savings from improved efficiency noted above, with the company redirecting the money saved into investments in marketing. CEO Sue Nabi noted a ""virtuous circle of stepping up our media spending and reinvesting behind our newly repositioned brands.""

## 3. Other metrics look bullish

Driven in part by pandemic-related lockdowns of retail during 2020, Coty is continuing the development of its e-commerce segment. E-commerce sales jumped 30% in the fiscal third quarter, led by consumer beauty (56% year-over-year growth) but with good luxury sector sales improvements, too (20% growth). While Coty's e-commerce sales are still only 10% of the total, the company isn't ignoring this increasingly important channel, either.

While New World sales fell 6% during the quarter, Chinese sales soared by 27.7%, though they remain roughly a third of sales in the Americas, *Women's Wear Daily* reports. This again indicates Coty is successfully pushing through one of its turnaround goals, since increasing its presence in the massive China market is ""a key pillar in our strategy,"" according to Nabi.

## 4. The current CEO has a positive track record

Nabi has been Coty's CEO since mid-2020 and is an experienced beauty sector executive with past successes at turning around cosmetics and personal care brands from faltering to growing and profitable. Working at personal care company **L'Oreal SA** from 1993 through 2013, Nabi reconfigured its Lancome brand, focusing on the introduction of new luxury products to its line. These included a $350 facial cream, according to *Vogue*, and the high-profile La Vie Est Belle perfume.

According to Coty, Nabi's management raised Lancome's turnover to 3.2 billion euros during a three-year period, with positive sales growth every year, sometimes topping 10%. While no single individual is a guarantee of business success, Nabi's experience looks potentially well suited to developing the potential of Coty's other strengths.

You will notice the price has moved 8% or so this week after Sue's presentation at Jeffries conference hit it out of the park, the slides below are from that presentation. I suspect upgrades will be coming in soon. Most recent is below from Evercore, representing a 60% plus upside in price. This is early early innings of the company's turn around aligning with the economy re-opening where the demand for cosmetics will never be higher. YoY comps are going to look incredible, especially with all the changes made during COVID. This could be a great hidden gem going into the second half of this year and into next year. Lets also not forget the demand for travel is going to be HUGE, we are already seeing it in TSA numbers. As more women travel and see family/friends, you better believe they will be purchasing makeup/perfume for those trips. As I said earlier, the play here is LEAPS, Europe was still mostly closed for this quarter which could impact the next ER. I've been buying all dips below $9 and believe we will easily retest recent $10.50 highs soon.

*Evercore just raised PT to $15.*

*Coty seen having 70% upside with Cover Girl recovery taking hold‚Ä¢ Evercore ISI notes that sales of mass makeup skyrocketed in April as mask mandates were lifted, with Coty's (NYSE:COTY) Cover Girl posting its first market share gain in years.‚Ä¢ Cover Girl is viewed as crucial for Coty. While the line only accounts for 10% of the company's sales, Evercore says it register multiples of that in terms of investment sentiment.‚Ä¢ Evercore says Coty is seeing a turnaround after shelf space losses ended in Q2 last year. Cover Girl is said to be modestly regaining distribution, while increasing its productivity with retailers. In addition, new Cover Girl users come from Maybelline, e.l.f. and Revlon within Walmart and Target stores - suggesting to Evercore that competitive price points and displays, and innovation are working.‚Ä¢ Evercore ISI keeps an Outperform rating on Coty and price target of $15 (70% upside). The 52-week high on Coty is $10.49.‚Ä¢ The most recent bull on Coty to pop up on Seeking Alpha is Value Investor Research with its view that Coty appears materially undervalued even under conservative assumptions.*

This is a great slide to see the transformation from the old company and where they are evolving the company to

Anyone that has had a female as a room mate can tell you that most of the volume of cosmetic products purchased go into the trash.  Most of these products go bad if opened and not used.  After a year of many products not being used, women won‚Äôt just go back to buying make-up at the pre-pandemic rate; they‚Äôll replace all of the products that went bad during the past year.  In addition, professionals are going back to the office - part time if not full time.  In person conferences and in person sales calls are resuming.  Concerts and events.  Across every demographic, women are going to buy more make-up and sales will surge.  Any ape that‚Äôs ever set foot in a Target will tell you that you can‚Äôt fling shit anywhere near the front of the store without hitting cosmetics - most of which are brands that this company owns.

Fuck all you  üåàüêª that have never lived with a single female.  This is a play on human behavior and sales are going to the moon even if their execution team is inept.  Anyone ever work for a major established corporation?

The vast majority of pump and dumps are cheap stocks that took on loads of debt.  Fundamentally they may bounce back but they‚Äôll be digging out of a hole for years.  See also:  Cruise Lines"

2021-06-25 01:15:41,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the play but I do think it is a play. This year I expect a individuals to be much more likely to attend social events than last year and even years past as individuals will be itching to get back out eg dates, parties, concerts, family gatherings etc. Consumers of cosmetics will most likely use cosmetics when attending these events to dress up. Thus, the increased social events combined with the increased number of individuals attending these events lead to some pumped up sales numbers. COTY has already bounced back nicely from March of last year and I still see some decent room to grow. It‚Äôll be nice to see some sale numbers after this summer."

CLOV news of expansion is a good sign and CLOV's stock will be attractive to longer term investors. Expansion plans usually entail higher capital costs and this will weigh on CLOV's books. So this might not be good but it is a transitory step to secure CLOV future revenues. As soon as its expansion plans get underway, we should see CLOV price action becoming more stable and move with market norms. Because of meme stock's associated volatility, these investors are well advised to steer clear of CLOV for now. For meme stocks traders and to get this CLOV gamma squeeze and moon shot, we really need to buy and have the volume to crowd out the short sellers. To the would-be paper hands, maybe you are in a cash strapped situation and need the small profits to get by. We understand. To the diamond handed CLOV holders, I'm with you and love the CLOV ARMY. So bring it!"

Add that to the margin fees they have to pay and the fact that the stock price goes up, it stresses the leverage short sellers can afford to have.

2021-06-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DD: Why the recent discount in Corsair's growth is unwarranted I'm just going to start this DD off by saying if you're looking for the disgusting little ""sq***ze"" word, then just keep it moving because I'm not going to waste my time with that.

**How is Corsair looking at the moment?**

Over the course of the pandemic, gaming has continued to explode. With half the developed world locked away in their houses coinciding with the release of the Xbox Series X and the PS5, it‚Äôs no secret that online gaming has continued to develop into one of the most lucrative businesses in the technology sector. Every indicator of mobile, console, and PC gaming has been compounded: from Twitch streams, to console sales, to purchases of PC parts, everything‚Äôs been pretty much nuts, but you all know this. The important thing here is that the pandemic is ending, albeit slowly and a little later than expected. This means that a significant amount of analysts have lowered their forecasts for the gaming industry as people get back out of their houses to go frolic in the flowers or whatever the fuck regular people do. This prevailing narrative has led to Corsair‚Äôs stock hitting around 46 dollars per share in the beginning of February, and then sharply declining for the next 30 days to hit 31 dollars at the beginning of March. Since then, the stock has continued to bounce up and down in the range of roughly 30 to 34 dollars, save for a brief dip under 30 and the brief spike to the high 30s a week and a half ago. With 40 days until earnings, Corsair‚Äôs stock looks as stable as ever and has seemingly priced in a severe reduction in growth. So, you might ask, why should you bet against the crowd?


*Because they‚Äôre stupid.*


Gaming isn‚Äôt going anywhere, and that‚Äôs clear to anyone who knows jack shit about gamers and people who game casually. Is the field going to shift while things open up? Certainly, and anyone who thinks it won‚Äôt is kidding themselves. But let me tell you, purely anecdotally, every single person I know who purchased expensive consoles, new headsets, new gaming PCs, new games? They‚Äôre absolutely still using them, because they‚Äôre going to get their money‚Äôs worth. Everyone out there who just dropped 1500 dollars on their new setup isn‚Äôt just going to let it go to junk and stop gaming overnight. Sales might not see the type of explosive growth they saw during the pandemic, but there are a few reasons why they‚Äôll certainly keep rising.


Reason Number 1: **E-Sports**

E-Sports were actually somewhat negatively impacted by the pandemic, even with E-Sports viewers in the US rising by 70% in 2020. The industry itself, already a multi billion dollar industry, saw a string of cancellations across the world that put a halt to the fastest growing sport (yes, a sport, just go with it) in the world. E-sports is slowly going mainstream, with companies such as Red Bull, Honda, Coke, Kraft, Marvel, Mercedes, even the fucking Air Force sponsoring E-Sports over this past year. Forecasted to hit 474 million viewers In 2021, games such as Rocket League, CSGO, and League of Legends have drawn the attention of hundreds of millions of fans desperate for tournaments, competitions, records and streaming out the wazoo. The primary importance of E-Sports to Corsair in my personal opinion? Accelerating the growth of gaming and competitive gaming as a mainstream activity rather than something viewed by boomers as a waste of time. This industry‚Äôs growth over the next decade will be explosive and Corsair is poised to profit handsomely off its growth.


Reason Number 2: **Summertime Gaming**

This section is going to be short and sweet. It‚Äôs summer. School is out. Countless millions of children have suffered through another year of school, and though many were online a lot of pandemic, most kids went back to In-person school this past year. Now they‚Äôre finally getting out, and ready to spend 3 months straight pissing in soda bottles and playing Fortnite and League until the capillaries in their eyes burst.


Reason Number 3: **Unemployment Stagnation**


Unsurprisingly, gaming sales experience huge success during times of high unemployment, because people need something to do, and thankfully gaming is a great way to sit down and lose 12 hours of your life without remembering that you‚Äôve got rent due in 2 weeks with negative 14 dollars in your bank account and no job. Good thing federal unemployment benefits are still pretty damn great, right? Some states may be gradually reducing these federal unemployment benefits and reinstating job-seeking requirements for these benefits, but that‚Äôs to be expected in a reopening economy. However, if you hop on over to the United States Department of Labor statistics on Unemployment Insurance, you‚Äôll notice something funky: the decrease in unemployment claims has begun to stagnate, as available jobs is at a record high but tens of millions of people stay unemployed. This disparity is due to a variety of factors that I could write an entire other post about, but I‚Äôll leave it at this: from skills mismatch to federal unemployment benefits being higher than minimum wage in some cases means that the unemployment rate is going to stay above the pre-pandemic unemployment rate, and people will continue to game.


**Fundamentals**

Fundamentals are fantastic, I‚Äôm not going to go into extensive detail but Corsair has a P/E of 20 ATM which solid for the industry and doesn‚Äôt indicate significant speculation for the future, operating margin is great, and their market cap sits at around 3 billion on nearly 2 billion in sales and 150 million of profit. Their fundamentals have been explored to death in other posts so I won‚Äôt continue to beat a dead horse, but just wanted to establish that their fundamentals are solid.


**Predictions for the future**

As I said before, earnings are in 40 days. To be honest, I‚Äôm sick of trying to hop in right before earnings on every stock after a significant runup has already occurred and I‚Äôm sure you all re too. So, in preparation for another round of fantastic earnings, I‚Äôm getting in early this time. I believe that earnings will be fantastic once again beating analysts reduced expectations for the reasons listed above, with growth higher than many are expecting post-pandemic. The acceleration of E-Sports over this summer and fall will continue to drive the share price back into the high 30s soon enough, possibly even low 40s over the next 4-6 weeks. Given the slightly longer time frame, I‚Äôve bought a healthy mix of shares and leaps for the coming storm.

2021-06-25 00:31:09,wallstreetbets,"The silver lining here might be that Eagletree knows it isn't in its best interest to beat down the stock price too much, so they will only sell whenever it crosses $35 or so, which seems to be their MO so far. I think a smart play is selling puts at $30 for a while for pretty safe premium and--in case of assignment--reduced cost basis. The stock will grow healthily with the industry once the selling pressure subsides."
2021-06-25 03:01:20,wallstreetbets,"Without weeklies, this is a challenging stock to wheel. But I have been selling $32.5 and $35 covered calls all year and reduced my cost basis significantly. Once Eagletree sells off, I‚Äôll stop selling and let it ride up"
2021-06-25 00:33:10,wallstreetbets,I agree with selling puts near the money. Eventually this will be a steal at these levels but who knows. Do we know their final ownership percent?
2021-06-25 00:38:04,wallstreetbets,"I've read a bit more and apparently there's no obligation to sell on their part, but they've been doing it as a balancing exercise. It is uncertain how much they'll feel comfortable keeping. If I had to guess, I'd say they'll cash out enough to play with house money only and keep around 30%."
2021-06-25 05:41:32,wallstreetbets,do you have a source for that?

Tomorrow is looking very very ripe for a .618 retest on the Fibonacci retracement. As you can see on one hour the Bollinger Bands have started to squeeze closer this normally indicates a large move is coming. Moving forward on the 1 hour it looks like we will trade in a range of 14.64 - 15.11+ depending on the move to the upside. Breaking and holding above 15 will be a crucial step for WISH to maintain momentum going forward."

&nbsp;

What‚Äôs poppin‚Äô fellas, hope you‚Äôre all doing well. Today, I‚Äôm gonna teach you all about ***Collateral Trades***. Collateral trades provide us with an interesting way to dynamically adjust our risk profiles while placing trades and generate an edge while doing so! This strategy is most effective around earnings when IV is high, or if you want to safely play meme stocks. That being said, it can still find it‚Äôs application during regular trading conditions as well. Let's get into it!

&nbsp;

---

#What is a Collateral Trade?

In its simplest terms, a collateral trade is a trade where you play a different ticker in the same sector as the one you initially planned on playing, ideally around a big event such as earnings. Since stocks within a sector generally tend to put up similar numbers and move together around earnings, we can abuse this to give us a more favourable risk to reward profile on our trades. 

&nbsp;

For example, let‚Äôs say that I‚Äôm bullish on $JPM, and they report earnings this week. Instead of playing options on $JPM, I‚Äôd look to make a play on $WFC, $BAC, or any other bank who reports earnings *after* $JPM instead. This allows us to reap most, if not all of the rewards if our trade goes in the direction we were anticipating, while severely mitigating our downside risk in the event that we were wrong.

&nbsp;

---

#How does it work? What are the benefits?

Let‚Äôs walk through both situations! I'll continue to use the financial sector  in my first couple of examples.

&nbsp;

**If I were to play standard options on $JPM**, I‚Äôd be paying a pretty hefty premium because IV is high, and I would instantly get IV crushed right out the gate regardless of how $JPM performs. Furthermore, if $JPM moves in the *opposite* direction that I was anticipating, the value of my options would quickly approach 0, and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to recoup much if any of my losses. If $JPM moves in the right direction, it would need to move enough to offset the IV crush of earnings, while also bringing in enough money to make the coinflip we call ‚Äútrading earnings‚Äù worthwhile. Realistically, you‚Äôve got a 50/50 shot at winning, but very rarely do you actually double your money off of a play like this. You‚Äôre essentially playing a coin flip game where if it‚Äôs heads, you lose 200$, but if it's tails, you win 50$. It‚Äôs not a good look overall, but you still have the opportunity to make money nonetheless.

&nbsp;

**What if we were to employ some form of collateral play instead?** Instead of playing $JPM directly, let‚Äôs play a ticker within the same sector as it who reports earnings *afterwards* - I‚Äôll use $WFC as an example. Generally speaking, stocks within a sector tend to move in tandem with one another price wise, while also putting up similar numbers to each other. It‚Äôs very rare to see some stocks rally while others tank - generally they all rally or all tank depending on various market conditions. This also means that if certain stocks within a sector report earnings *before* the others, the market will price the *other* stocks differently following reported earnings from the first batch. If $JPM reports stellar earnings and rallies 4% as a result, $WFC and the other non-reporting banks will almost *always* follow suit and rally as the market prices in a good earnings beforehand from them as well. If we were holding $WFC calls, we would reap the rewards of a 4% rally ***without*** the IV crush, which means more gains in our pocket. Hypothetically, our $JPM calls may have only netted us 40% gain after the IV crush, but our $WFC calls would‚Äôve netted us an upwards of 100% if not more. 

&nbsp;

**The same is true but on the flipside**. Let‚Äôs say $JPM tanks on earnings. Our $JPM calls would swiftly approach 0. The other banks would also follow suit, but to a lesser degree. If we had $WFC calls instead, the IV on our contracts would actually go *up* by a decent amount. This would help offset our losses and we wouldn‚Äôt have gotten IV crushed in the process. This in turn means that if we do want to bail out of the trade, we can recoup most if not all of our losses, which is extremely beneficial from a capital preservation standpoint.

&nbsp;

**By utilizing a collateral play like this, we can increase the return of our winners, while simultaneously minimizing the losses of our losers.**

&nbsp;

---

#How can I incorporate them into my own Trades?

I found that there‚Äôs three ways you can consistently incorporate collateral trades into your own plays!

&nbsp;

The first method is the one I went over above. **Find a set of tickers within the same sector who report earnings during the same week but on different days**. Instead of playing the ticker you have strong conviction on, play any of the adjacent tickers to avoid IV crush and reap any rewards you would‚Äôve gotten otherwise.

&nbsp;

The second method is a little different. If you have a strong conviction on a certain sector as a whole, you can actually **look to make a play an an ETF which holds all of the reporting tickers instead**. ETFs are less susceptible to IV crush, generally have cheaper options, and always have a much lower IV than the individual tickers that they hold. I‚Äôve been using the financial sector for my examples, so I‚Äôll continue to roll with that. A few weeks ago, to kick off earnings season, 7 of the largest American banks were set to report earnings the same week as each other. Coincidentally, $XLF consists of 7 of the largest American banks. Every single bank usually sits at an IV of around 20%, but around earnings season, this gets jacked up to around 65%ish, resulting in options becoming 300% more expensive. At the same time, $XLF went from around 12% to 20%, meaning that options only got 66% more expensive. Since we know that tickers within the same sector move in tandem with each other, if we wanted to place a bet on an *individual* bank, we‚Äôd actually be better off playing $XLF, since the options are cheaper, the IV is lower, and we can almost be certain that it will move as much as all the other banks will. If I was bullish on $JPM, I could play $XLF instead to reap the rewards.

&nbsp;

**The third and final way to utilize collateral plays involves meme stocks**. This method is a little less consistent, so I use a tool like [Hungry Bot](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/) to aid me in this. Oftentimes, when one of the major meme tickers starts to run (GME, AMC, etc), other meme tickers follow suit. The issue with this is that the instant one of the major memes starts to run, MMs jack the fuck out of the option prices so us retail traders cant make any money. In order to circumvent this, we can look to make a collateral play on some of the *minor* meme stocks instead - My personal favourite for this is $BB. Last time when AMC started running, the IV on most contracts got jacked up so fast that it wasn't worth playing, however, the IV on BB stayed low for a while. Instead of playing AMC, I ended up playing BB. BB ended up following AMCs price action for a while on a percentage point basis, though you had a much greater window of opportunity to enter a position and reap the rewards. Not to mention, since BB had a lower starting IV to begin with, you actually would have ended up with *better returns playing BB than you would have if you were playing AMC*. Although BB was very profitable, you could‚Äôve made this play with any other minor meme ticker so long as the IV was low upon entry, and they moved along with the other meme stocks. [**CLOV is another great example, which actually ended up being a 40 bagger**](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794766298373423136/857753911855546399/clov.png) since we caught it well before it started running. Again, this method is a lot trickier to time and play manually, so I use my bot to alert me whenever a play like this is possible. It often catches the meme tickers before they run and usually spits out the most profitable collateral play while doing so.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

- Week one of earnings, I was extremely bullish on the financial sector as a whole. I ended up playing $XLF on April 12th and ended up catching nearly a 2% move in just two days. This may not seem like much, but on an ETF with an IV of 11%, I ended up getting a really solid return on my FDs.

&nbsp;

- Week two of earnings, I was bearish on solar as a whole due to the semiconductor shortage. Since Enphase was reporting alongside First Solar, I decided to play puts on Canadian Solar instead, since they are in the same sector but don‚Äôt report earnings until weeks after. Luckily for me my bet paid off, with Enphase tanking 15% and First solar closely behind with a 13% drop. My play, Canadian Solar, withered away 11% during that time, meaning I also secured a huge bag while walking away unscathed due to there being cheap options and no IV crush. If this play would have gone against me I would have had plenty of time to exit this play with minimal losses.

&nbsp;

- Lastly, I played BB while AMC was mooning. [**The 10C was priced at $0.3**](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794766298373423136/857753919539118120/bb.png). One week later, Blackberry touched 18$ and I I walked away with a clean 20 bagger. Not much to say here. I had a huge window of opportunity, and the writing was more or less on the wall after I watched AMC run nearly 20% on the day.

When one starts to run, I do a little media scraping on different sites like swaggy stocks, see what the middle of the pack stock is, and play that one instead. One, because I can actually afford it, and two, because they definitely run together.  I played CLOV that way and made 1300 bucks off of a 100 dollar call.  Glad to see others noticing the same thing!  Great DD man!"
2021-06-25 04:34:21,wallstreetbets,"
CLOV news of expansion is a good sign and CLOV's stock will be attractive to longer term investors. Expansion plans usually entail higher capital costs and this will weigh on CLOV's books. So this might not be good but it is a transitory step to secure CLOV future revenues. As soon as its expansion plans get underway, we should see CLOV price action becoming more stable and move with market norms. Because of meme stock's associated volatility, these investors are well advised to steer clear of CLOV for now. For meme stocks traders and to get this CLOV gamma squeeze and moon shot, we really need to buy and have the volume to crowd out the short sellers. To the would-be paper hands, maybe you are in a cash strapped situation and need the small profits to get by. We understand. To the diamond handed CLOV holders, I'm with you and love the CLOV ARMY. So bring it!"

This ninth film in the *Fast & Furious* franchise was originally slated to open over Memorial Day weekend in 2020 until COVID-19 muffled those plans. The studio took the long-view and pushed the film into 2021 and eventually settled on this final June weekend for its release as part of a staggered global rollout that began with China‚Äôs launch in May.

Box Office Pro says: ""there‚Äôs little doubt that *F9* is in the best position of any film since the pandemic began as the next ‚Äî and perhaps biggest yet ‚Äî blockbuster release.""

After **F9**'s $136 million May 2021 debut in China exceeded *Hobbs & Shaw*‚Äòs $94.9 million back in August 2019, and its $6.7 million opening weekend in Australia (good for exhibitor Reading Int'l) also bested that spin-off‚Äôs local start of $4.9 million, Box OfficePro forecasts opening weekend North America domestic revenue at **$60 ‚Äì 80 million.** Check out their total forecast and Pros & Cons influencing these numbers in the following article:

2021-06-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Predicting the market is hard enough. Technical analysis gets you so far. Some facts are well established. Ultimately it‚Äôs the research you do that matters. We are told that if we can‚Äôt do our homework for at least one hour per week per security we have no business in buying a stock. Yet there are many people who ignore this time proven lesson. We follow gut and the herds. Having said all this no one in their right mind should‚Äôve bought AMZN 10 years ago. I remember all the smart money not going after AMZN. Their valuation didn‚Äôt make sense. That‚Äôs why I waited until it was $1000 per share. Missed the boat? Nope. For a long term investor the fundamentals have to make sense. 

It‚Äôs the business model. If you want quick wins you can always go to Vegas. Of course any form of investing (specially in individual securities) is a bet. A gamble. But some bets are worth making. Know your risk level and then it all makes sense. 

Patience is also very important. Look TOYOTA came back from a terrible downturn after the unintended acceleration fiasco. So did VW. Any large company can temporarily lose its way or get unlucky (unless you‚Äôre IBM or AT&T). Sometimes you may have to cut the bait. 

What I do know is this: set a lower limit on how much you‚Äôre willing to lose and stay disciplined. Or just buy the S&P500. ü§î"

Over the course of a few years I evolved a system that led me in the other direction, I now give up some profits in favor of greater likelihood that a trend will continue, and bail quickly if it looks like I was wrong.   


I totally get waiting until $1000 for AMZN. You can't just FOMO, you have to think of profit in terms of how much risk you're taking on.   


I've only been in the stock market for about 6 months, and by sheer coincidence, I bought my very first share of AMZN today.   


Given the current circumstances, I am 100% fine with paying $3500 for it: by my read, it just got above daily resistance, and I can put a stop very close underneath. My risk on the trade is like $150. It's nothing. If I'd bought a few weeks or months ago, the price would have been lower, but the risk would have been much higher. And that's just quantitative stuff, it's not even thinking about the fundamentals. But the idea is the same.    


Of course, this being WSB, I probably shouldn't be saying any of this.

For those of you who don't know, the marble EFT is the way to pick stocks when you just want to sit back and scratch your nuts. It's a gravitational algorithm where marbles are given ticker names, and what ticker lands twice in the top ten is picked for day trading the next day. Five maps are played each evening and if there are no winners than the day is taken off.

2021-06-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$WISH Update Hello guys, as you can see in my profile I did two mainly submissions about wish.

First from a fundamental analysis point of view and a second from a technical analysis (I had some troubles with that and I dont know if mods delete the submission, just check it if you want)

About the first one, off course that nothing changed in 4 days. So, talk about the second one.

We had a false breakdown on the triangle but and a false breakdown below USD 13. But lucky for us, an extremely bullish flow money put $WISH above all that numbers

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jf5pwrmbsa771.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=eddc7b39c4863bcf7acaa5d84d58efa34f353529

And we are still above the EMA20 1hr that I think is a good trend indicator for $WISH (this chart is not 1hr, but you can see the levels in any graphicator). Im putting here only in 5m because I want to concentrate on the short term.

Taking into account that, I bought more at USD 13,55. I had 11500 shares and now 13500. I saw the last half an hour performance as extremely bullish, crossing up all the resistances that were perfored, and ***with very high volum******e***. That gave me confident about the future of Wish

So, next resistance is USD 15 and once we break, can go to16,60-16,80. Off course we will experience some volatility between 14,50-15, so, if you are a trader, I think those are good levels to watch. For a middle term trade, just focus on 15. And for a long term investment, dont read this post because is a lost of time.

Conclusion: I'm still very very bullish on $WISH and I'm even more confident that we will reach USD 20 in the short term. For the middle term, i'm still seeing USD 30 as a very potential level. I know a lot of you are talking about USD 50, 69 or 100. But remember, step by step. This is a marathon and we run every days

Overview

	AMD is a global semiconductor company offering x86 microprocessors as standalone or integrated (CPU‚Äôs, GPU‚Äôs, server systems, Etc‚Ä¶) and intellectual property/ services.

Products

	AMD‚Äôs primary products consist of CPU‚Äôs and GPU‚Äôs which are on par or out performing NVIDIA GPU‚Äôs and Intel‚Äôs CPU‚Äôs. While these other two giants have dominated the market for sometime, AMD‚Äôs recent move has evolved from a slow creep to a brisk jog. 

Competition 

	AMD‚Äôs largest competitors are Intel (CPU‚Äôs) and NVIDIA (GPU‚Äôs). With the release of AMD‚Äôs Ryzen processors in 2017, AMD has been steadily over taking Intel‚Äôs dominance over market share. AMD‚Äôs current market share (over all CPU‚Äôs) currently sits at 44%, levels it has not seen since 2005. AMD took 20% of the market share in past 2 years with a significant jump in 2019. Since the release of Ryzen, AMD is now on par or out performing Intel chips and has gained a significant amount of sentiment over the soy boys at intel. AMD is on track to overtake the majority of CPU market share within the next year based on current projections.

	Now NVIDIA is a whole other beast who currently has a significant advantage over the dGPU market. Nvidia at the end of Q4 2020, held roughly 82% of the market share which was a increase of 9% from the previous year. AMD‚Äôs high end GPU‚Äôs do not come close to Nvidia‚Äôs high end models, UNTIL AMD‚Äôs Radeon 6000 series, which are now on par with Nvidia‚Äôs cards, either outperforming or underperforming in various tests. AMD catching up to Nvidia is the same move that AMD made against Intel in 2017, 4 years later they are on the verge of overtaking market share. While Nvidia is a monster of a company, I believe that AMD will begin taking more market share from Nvidia and establish a decent foothold over the next few years. AMD has already taken the game console market, console plebs.

	AMD has already proved they are able to take back significant market share with there current and future products, Lisa Su is a genius and I believe she‚Äôll lead the company to Valhalla. What does AMD have that Nvidia does not? Aside from many differences, I think the fact that AMD has an ecosystem will play a significant role in catching up. Now that AMD can evenly compete with both of their rivals, AMD plans on leveraging the fact that they produce CPU‚Äôs and GPU‚Äôs. There are already incentives to using AMD‚Äôs CPU with their GPU rather than an AMD CPU with a Nvidia GPU. With AMD taking the CPU market, retail users will be more likely to stick with the ecosystem, and I‚Äôm a big fan of companies producing an ecosystem (laughs in apple). 

	A new player enters the battle. Intel has been working on their own dGPU and will surely be releasing in the next few years, but I believe this will be comparable to Sony vs Microsoft with Nintendo enjoying their best life staring at butterfly‚Äôs, covered in drool in the corner lol.

The Merger

	Nvidia set to acquire ARM, AMD set to acquire Xilinx. What are they and how are they expected to impact the company?

ARM - Create and dominate the mobile processor market, covering TV‚Äôs, phones, tablets, and other similar products as well as some software applications. I will not be covering much more of ARM in this DD.

Xilinx - Designs and develops programmable logic products. As far as I can tell this is some big brain shit that I‚Äôm sure some booger nosed, mothers basement living, neck beard having, nerd will easily explain in the comments cuz Wikipedia ain‚Äôt cutting it.  

	If AMD completes the purchase, which is likely and expected to happen by the end of 2021, Xilinx shares will become worth 1.723 shares of AMD. AMD is currently trading at 86.10$, meaning that shares of Xilinx will be worth 148.35$ if the deal were to go through right now. Xilinx is currently worth 133.71$, I‚Äôm betting heavily that AMD will continue to pump prior to this deal as well.

	ARM will be huge for Nvidia, but this is running into some major road blocks and is likely some ways off or will fall through.

Financials and projections (I had pictures but I‚Äôm reddit dumb)

Net Revenue
$9.8B(2020), $6.7B(2019), $6.5B(2018), $5.2B(2017)
Net Incum 
$2.5B(2020), $341M(2019), $337M(2018), $(33)M(2017)
	
	I like your growth G

	AMD decreased their debt to 338 million from 568 million.
	
	$1.6 billion in cash ($9 billion in total assets, I find cash on hand more important)

	GPU/CPU sales accounted for $6.5 billion while enterprise accounted for $3.3 billion, GPU/CPU sales saw a 37% increase over 2019 while enterprise saw a 65% increase in 2020. 2021 is set to continue this trend of growth.

	AMD has a high price target of $169.70, median $107.00, and an average of $103.92. I just read 100‚Äôs of pages of 8k‚Äôs and 10‚Äôks, plus I‚Äôm super attracted to the ole doc Su Bae so I‚Äôm betting that it will get a target price upgrade, regardless $103 will make me rich. There is a lot more we could dive into on financials but idk what the fuck I‚Äôm doing so nah.

Risks

	I like to plan for more than 1 risk occurring at a time so keep that in mind. Ive highlighted the risks that I find most impactful/ probable. Also keep in mind of global shortages for damn near every company, especially with chips.

	- Intel/ Nvidia‚Äôs market share dominance (mostly Nvidia)
	- Seasonal sales can make for shit earnings in Q1/Q2
	- Reliance on third parties for manufacturing/ distributors
	- Xilinx deal falls through
	- Jim Cramer also likes this stock

	That‚Äôs enough risks, what am I, a gay bear?

TLDR

AMD will moon, Lisa Su is my mommy and is cooking up some tendies, AMD GPU‚Äôs are now in Teslas,  obligatory rockets (insert rocket emojis here), lots of words just buy it.

Looking for entry into Xilinx cuz I dumb"
2021-06-24 21:37:55,wallstreetbets,"Booger eating and neck beard  wearing nerd reporting here: 

Intel bought Altera a few years back; AMD buying Xilinx has been a moot point in terms of anti-trust since then... Altera and Xilinx were practically a duopoly in the programmable devices market, much like Intel and AMD being a duopoly in the desktop PC market.

Bullish on merger going through. Politicians' pockets are being lined as we speak. 

 With programmable logic alongside general purpose processors (also called systems on chip or SoC), imagine having a run-time reconfigurable procesor that adapts to tasks that are hogging resources. If you have a dedicated graphics procesor unit, but you never play games, then that GPU is a physical waste of space. Ergo, doing reconfigurable computing makes sense, so that when you do play games, voila, we can instantiate a GPU for you on the programmable side of the SoC.

Edit: thank you kind stranger for my first ever reward!

It's one tough fucking cockroach that just can't die, even when it was in the red for years with Intel wiping the floor with its flagship using just i3. 

However everything changed since the release of AMD's Ryzen in 2017, that plus TSMC being too godlike. Now AMD is wiping the floor with Intel's 250W shitty 14nm i7/i9 with its Zen 3 CPUs (Ryzen 5000).  It's also eroding Intel's share in the server market where the money is. 

Sadly its GPU does not get much recognition and all the cool kids want Nvidia video cards instead of AMD cards even though AMD cards are actually quite good (AMD cards actually support multi-monitor better especially if they run at different resolution)."

2021-06-24 21:44:12,wallstreetbets,"Meh. I like AMDs products just fine. However, they just can‚Äôt fuck with Intel or Nvidia in their respective markets. They‚Äôve enjoyed some success while Intel slacks in recent years as they perfect their nm manufacturing process, and a global chip shortage certainly has not helped them. All while AMD *sort of* fakes their 7nm by using the term ‚Äú7nm manufacturing process‚Äù it‚Äôs all very confusing. And a big part of the problem IMO is how it‚Äôs being measured. So, AMD makes some quality stuff at some decent prices but the truth is Intel is light years beyond them in chip making tech and has the luxury of being so far ahead of the competition that they can take their sweet time. When that time comes, I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs curtains for AMD. 

On the GPU end, Nvidia is just an unrivaled opponent. They have created architectures and technologies based around their architectures that are very hard to compete with. Not to mention their many years of R&D in machine learning and AI that seems to be giving them a much bigger advantage in the tech space as a whole. NVIDIA is the motherfucker of tech companies. 

AMD makes good products. They seem to be a solid company and even a worthwhile investment. Just be aware that the space they compete in is also occupied by monsters. Big scary fucking monsters."
2021-06-25 04:08:29,wallstreetbets,"On the GPU market AMD is still behind by a lot in terms of software. In terms of raw processing power the AMD 6000 series GPUs are still behind (20.7 TFLOPS vs 29.7TFLOPS float performance), despite having a higher processor clock and smaller transistors. But the main selling point of a NVDA GPU over an AMD one currently is DLSS, an AI-Driven upscaling algorithm which significantly improves performance, especially when raytracing (simulating actual lighting rays which can be reflected and refractured instead of simulating shadows via ambient occlusion), and all whilst not sacrificing image quality (if implemented right). About two years later AMD now released a first glimpse at it's own counterpart, which is inferior in all terms: No AI, no temporal component, no significant performance boost and a small sacrifice in image quality. And that is no surprise since the AMD chips don't have the dedicated AI processors of the NVDA GPUs, called Tensor cores.  
And that's the reason why AMD is still way behind in terms of GPU market share."

2021-06-25 07:38:42,wallstreetbets,"I would not worry about the 'seasonal sales' bit.  Not now, anyway.  Maybe most years that's an issue, but because of the semiconductor shortages and astronomical demand that supply simply hasn't caught up to yet, sales will remain at maximum until the shortage is alleviated (maybe before too long, TSMC has been spinning up more fab capacity and I know it was due to come online this summer, not sure how close they are).  

But, replace that risk with another one - Dr. Su leaving.  Especially if her replacement is an MBA rather than a PhD engineer.  I haven't heard anything about her looking to move on, but it would not surprise me.  She is not a ""business person"", she is an engineer.  That's why she was able to so rapidly pick up and master the business side of things, but it also means that she's probably not enjoying the day to day parts of the job.  And I'm sure by now AMD has a bunch of dumb Boomer shareholders who might be harassing her and trying to get another more typical MBA parasite back into the CEO chair.

About nVidia, I was scared off by the UK regulators getting stuffy about them buying ARM, particularly after nVidia released their ARM processor with nVidia-proprietary extensions that got the UK regulators heated (wtf were they thinking? They knew they were being watched and couldn't hold off?).... BUT, just this week nVidia announced that they were going to build a big supercomputer in the UK and donate resources to the NHS and Cambridge.  I imagine that was the palm-greasing the UK regulators were looking for.  Odd that they're all concerned in the first place, they had no qualms when ARM was sold to its current Japanese owner Softbank."

2021-06-24 22:38:41,wallstreetbets,"Most of the points you touched on are years old.   For one, AMD has been fabless for a while now and don't make their own chips. TSMC makes their chips and are possibly year(s) ahead of Intel in chip making. In the data center space AMD is basically tea bagging Intel right now. They have a faster and cheaper product than Intel. Lisa Su has turned AMD into a monster slayer."
2021-06-24 21:50:41,wallstreetbets,"I think you may be a few years behind in your tech. AMDs products are quite literally on par with both Intel and Nvidia.

2021-06-25 01:37:07,wallstreetbets,AMD designs good silicon but they need to support it better. TensorFlow on AMD? Forget about it. They don't have decent support for any major ML or AI framework. AMD developer support needs to be dramatically improved. Same for OEM support. They need to give the OEMs good reference designs. They pretty much need to do the design work for OEMs. OEMs are basically material integrators. They don't have the brainpower to design their own solutions.

2021-06-24 21:47:15,wallstreetbets,Just look up reconfigurable computing on SoC... That is the future.
2021-06-25 00:55:51,wallstreetbets,"The point is that with FPGAs alongside CPUs you (or the system really via daemons that monitor performance and repetitive/defined tasks) can reconfigure the programmable gate arrays (actually not logic gates, but RAM-based Look-up Tables or LUTs) to implement logical functions as ""hardware"", accelerating by 2-3 orders of magnitude their execution. You can then have an on-demand co-processor for the specific application that is hogging resources from the CPU, such as graphics processing (GPUs), for example. 

In the absence of ideas what to use the FPGA for, you can instantiate a soft processor core (soft-core, hihi) on-demand ,such as the Xilinx Microblaze (hihi again), to off-load processing from the hard-cores (hihi once again). This means that you don't need to have 8 core CPUs any more with 6 cores idle. Rather, you can have a 2-core processor that scales as needed."
2021-06-25 00:54:05,wallstreetbets,"General processors are a lot shittier than people give them credit for. They do 1 thing per cycle, where an FPGA could be set up to do 50 things in parallel per cycle. Like instantly writing 50 memory locations instead of queueing 50 cache updates which are written out to memory much later"

2021-06-24 21:12:26,wallstreetbets,"Yes AMD isn't a meme play, it's just a legitimate growth company that grew into its multiple and is even doing growup company shit like buybacks. 

Pretty astonishing to see, from what was ever the struggling underdog apart from a few bright spots like Athlon 64. Practically a penny stock much of the time (and I vividly recall thinking to buy some and leaving it for years at like 2 dollars...sigh). After SuBae, they've been the mighty ones, and they still only barely just ate into Intel marketshare for the amount of revenue growth we've seen, could do a lot more."
2021-06-24 23:44:41,wallstreetbets,"Not saying it's a big deal, but it's literally off its highs. Yes semis are cyclical. But you can't say it's not off anything when it literally is. My point anyways was that it's not a big part of the PE shrink, it's mostly just growing into it with revenue. 

To me that's more buying opportunity for the next cycle though especially with such extreme PE contraction."
2021-06-24 21:59:21,wallstreetbets,Sorry I missed that ..
2021-06-24 21:58:40,wallstreetbets,The reality is China accounted for over 20% of AMD‚Äôs revenue in 2020. Each country has their own set of merger rules and regulations. Due to the size of Xilinx and AMD they have to get approval before merging to do business with the country. China is by far the biggest wild card in this merger. One risk is definitely that there may be some back and forth with China that could delay the merger.

What points I made were years old?"
2021-06-25 01:39:12,wallstreetbets,TSMC 7nm has very comparable transistor density per mm^2 to Intel 10 nm. The process node size is not relevant any more with FinFETs.
2021-06-24 22:49:25,wallstreetbets,"Only in consumer space.  Nvidia absolutely tears it up in machine / deep learning.

But definitely bullish on AMD. They can be extremely profitable in both 2nd place value product position, or in beating out Intel.  They have a leaner company and are fabless, so less capital investment and quicker pivots but also some additional risk with TSMC capacity / priority / supply chain issues."
2021-06-25 01:41:04,wallstreetbets,"AMD has excellent designs, but try running TensorFlow on AMD GPUs. AMD needs to support their products in order to increase their market share. AMD needs to have an equivalent of CUDA that is not just better but also easier to use."

2021-06-25 00:58:50,wallstreetbets,"Modern general processors are capable of processing multiple instructions per clock cycle already. I assume FPGA are SIMD stream processors? Then it's not really doing 50 things in parallel, it is more like doing the same thing 50 times on 50 different datasets."

2021-06-25 00:32:22,wallstreetbets,"No, I think you understand it wrongly. The merger is an all-stock merger being done by issuing new shares. It means if the merger goes through, the current available shares for AMD will increase by roughly 24% that‚Äôs why the AMD share is being ‚Äúheld down‚Äù. It‚Äôs a stock dilution and is bad for existing share holders.

Imagine a company is worth $10 and there are 10 shares, so each share is worth $1. The company suddenly announce they will issue 10 more shares, so the share that used to worth $1 is now worth $10/20=$0.5.

Xilinx shares will be converted to AMD in a 1:1.7 shares ratio. People are already pricing in the value of AMD after the merging. If the merger fails, the value of AMD will/should shoot back up."
2021-06-24 23:55:36,wallstreetbets,I really enjoy your use of the word drivel here. Not that it‚Äôs accurate I just never hear that word and it‚Äôs a good one.
2021-06-25 02:55:13,wallstreetbets,Building your own fab is extremely capital intensive (5B+) and very complex. AMD being fabless is what allowed them to catch up. It frees up a significant amount of cash to invest in the core part of their business. Intel is no longer far ahead of the competition in the CPU space. AMD retail CPUs are already comparable and their server CPUS have surpassed Intel. The impact can already be seen in the revenues. Data center growth in general has been exploding yet Intel data center revenue is stagnant/declining while at the same time AMD's has seen significant growth. Intel in general has been sleeping at the wheel the past few years.
2021-06-24 23:19:45,wallstreetbets,Yes! Forgot about deep learning. Nvidia has total dominance over it
2021-06-24 22:28:44,wallstreetbets,Whhhhaaaaat?
2021-06-25 00:02:38,wallstreetbets,"For the non computer savvy folk here:

Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) indeed wipe the floor with FPGAs, but their limits are: 

1. that they are application specific (GPUs, crypt0 mining, computer vision, AI, etc.) and therefore if not used for their purpose, they waste space on a SoC/CPU
2. Expensive ($100+ of M to $1B+)  to develop and slow deploy.

General purpose CPUs that Intel and AMD develop aim to do everything, but at the cost of **not** being application specific and slow at those tasks. This is why co-processors, such as floating point units (FPUs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) were developed first off-chip, and nowadays as we are able to pack more transistors per chip, on-chip. 

FPGAs allow for reconfigurable on-demand computing, which ASICs never will. They allow the flexibility to make the general purpose CPU morph, when needed, to a time-bound (albeit \~10x slower) ASIC of a sort. They are also very energy efficient, and can increase the CPU processing speed of certain tasks by 100x to 1000x (still slower than ASIC, but not bad overall). This is their edge that general purpose future CPUs/SoCs will exploit to increase performance and power efficiency. 

The third, and probably most important, benefit is that they are reconfigurable by software updates; deploying the hardware first while incrementally adding value to the consumer via  updates is why they makes sense business-wise. Yes, they require expert programmers, but the software development chain has become ubiquitous and very rapid in the past decade and will continue to accelerate."
2021-06-25 01:18:00,wallstreetbets,"Yes, except that Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) instructions have to be hard-coded and supported on the processor. FPGAs allow you to define the SIMD stream processor, and use it only if/when needed."
2021-06-25 08:42:55,wallstreetbets,"FPGA are essentially programmable circuits.  If you want it to be a SIMD processor, you can 'program' it to be that.  If you want it to be a matrix multiplier, you can program it to be that.  If you want it to be a gate-accurate Z-80, you can program it to be that.  And you can change what it is live.  Its a grid of logic gates you can interconnect anyhow you need, and then change that when you need to suit your purposes.  It's like a 'transformer' chip."
2021-06-25 01:00:18,wallstreetbets,"But the point is, the FPGA gives you the granularity to control this much easier than it would be (if it‚Äôs even possible) on a general processor"
2021-06-25 02:53:57,wallstreetbets,I have 0.7delta leaps at $70 strike‚Ä¶ So I will probably be 400 shares short and will cover with the money I get from the option getting exercised and will probably have to sell some of my leaps for the difference

2021-06-25 00:35:50,wallstreetbets,"I see what you're saying, I didn't realize they were issuing new stock to pay for it."
2021-06-25 05:22:00,wallstreetbets,"Holy balls this sounds good.

Does this mean that in future, someone could write a library in a low level language for a high level language that does simple, but repetitive tasks in blazing speeds?"
2021-06-24 21:22:54,wallstreetbets,Except there‚Äôs nothing gentle about it
2021-06-25 06:41:05,wallstreetbets,"FPGAs aren't programmed like normal software. You use a hardware descriptor language (HDL such as Verilog or VHDL). While these languages support sequential functions the real benefit is that it's inherently parallel at the individual signal level. Think of being a to create a custom opcode for a CPU that does a rather complex operation. Then take a few of these and design it such that opcode 1 dumps the output in a custom register that opcode 2 needs and so on. Then realize you don't even need to explicitly call each of them individually if you always want to run them in that order.

That said an FPGA won't out perform an ASIC in tasks the ASIC was designed for, so it's more for operations for which the ASIC wasn't explicitly designed.  The real nifty bit is you can reconfigure them in a few seconds and if companies really wanted to make them as application specific coprocessors then they'd need to implement something like a stack push/pop process for the configuration so that it could be switched in coordination to the scheduler swapping processes.

So the final answer is that in theory someone could write a library that reconfigured the FPGA to perform custom functions for that library when you call it from your application. There's a few missing pieces to make a smoother process, but I'm pretty sure this is the longer term plan for both Intel and AMD."
2021-06-25 11:15:23,wallstreetbets,Yes. It's already happening.
2021-06-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Capital gains/losses on covered calls So I‚Äôve been selling Tesla calls for the last few months and will now most likely be getting exercised tomorrow at market close. I sold 3 640 strike 6/25s. 

The question here is the calls are showing an obvious loss given Tesla trading at >30 bucks higher, so how do I realize this loss to offset other gains? I looked into some conflicting tax info regarding this. It made it seem like if you don‚Äôt buy back the calls, then you can‚Äôt realize that loss and you only realize where you bought and sold the actual stock and the calls sold are taxed as short term and you lose that loss factor that could have helped offset gains. 

So what‚Äôs the best tax and overall gains case, buy back the calls or let them expire and get exercised? Thanks"
2021-06-24 20:03:27,wallstreetbets,Writing covered calls above the price you paid isn‚Äôt really a loss since you get premium and make a gain on your shares if they get called away :/
2021-06-24 20:03:24,wallstreetbets,Roll the calls next time ..
2021-06-24 20:16:16,wallstreetbets,"You may want to consult a tax professional as you might encounter a wash sale if you buy back the call at a loss and you‚Äôve made other option transactions on TSLA 30 days prior or plan to again within 30 days. I‚Äôm not sure how it works with covered calls, but you may not be able to claim the loss anyway."
2021-06-24 21:11:04,wallstreetbets,"If you write a covered call and it is assigned, the your taxable gain will be ((strike price + premium received) - cost basis for stock). So imagine you bought stock for $50 and wrote a $75 strike call for $5. It gets assigned. 75+5-50=$30 per share taxable gain. Hope that helps."
2021-06-24 20:53:38,wallstreetbets,This sub is r/investing now
2021-06-24 21:26:02,wallstreetbets,"According to the code is not a loss , is only on theory a potential loss when you don‚Äôt have the benefit of the upside , is only a loss unless you bought a higher price and sell for less , for example you paid $680 per share , sold 1 call $640 and the premium you collected is $5 
Therefore minus comission you have now a profit of $35 per share 1 contract $3500 profit is not a loss at all ..unfortunately I can tell you as I hate the IRS because we take huge risk for them to get up to 40% of your gains and more depending the state you live , here is Commifornia tax will be 13% in addition to the 30 or 35 % of federal . Now this is if is short term is if long term then you pay much less .."
2021-06-24 21:35:02,wallstreetbets,"The moment you open a covered call the way I was taught,you start the clock over again. I'm not sure if this is true. But that's the way I've played it. I guess I could throw some rocket emojis in there but I won't."
2021-06-24 22:54:06,wallstreetbets,"I'm a bit new to all this, but why would you ever want to sell a covered call at a strike price below what you actually paid for it? Did you buy it at $650, then it dropped significantly before you decided to sell the call at a $640 strike because you wanted a little extra premium?"
2021-06-25 08:19:17,wallstreetbets,Ask this question at r/thetagang
2021-06-24 21:00:49,wallstreetbets,"If he's selling covered calls I'm hoping it's at least 24% above cost,without premiums. If he's selling for a gain and buying again it's not a wash sale. But less than 366 days their going to pay maximum tax bracket past $40,000 the cap ,if they've met that for the year..... Well,depending on salary for the year."
2021-06-24 21:03:10,wallstreetbets,"if i'm reading it correctly, the loss in question is the difference in what the calls would cost now for OP to buy them back (higher now since they are ITM) vs the premium collected when they sold them...i believe there are actually 2 gain/loss scenarios in play here, though; one for the contract(s) and one for the shares themselves if/when they get called away"
2021-06-24 21:22:32,wallstreetbets,"And delete the app, worked for me"
2021-06-24 21:19:02,wallstreetbets,Fuck i thought it was r/eili5
2021-06-24 21:06:50,wallstreetbets,"you collect the premium when you sell the call. a loss could come in the form of higher premium required to buy back the call prior to expiration (if sold when OTM, but ITM when buying back, for instance, there's a pretty good chance the premium would be higher)"
2021-06-24 21:21:30,wallstreetbets,"Of course. If he‚Äôs profiting there‚Äôs no wash sale as the implication for a wash revolves around losses. In this case he is not profiting if he buys back the calls to realize a loss. The question is if he has traded other covered calls in the last 30 days or if he does again in the next 30, would that be a wash sale? It seems like it would be, but I‚Äôm not sure as I‚Äôve never encountered that issue, and in a few minutes of searching, I couldn‚Äôt find a clear cut answer."
2021-06-24 21:36:45,wallstreetbets,Yeah I bought Tesla for 650 originally so rn I have a loss of -8k on the 640 calls
2021-06-25 01:40:32,wallstreetbets,"So if I am understanding this correctly, OP selling a covered call, it's expired ITM, thus it's gonna be exercised. OP lost the his 100 shares. So if he want his 100 share back, he's buying his own covered call to occur a loss of differences?

If this is right, what's the difference between buying his call than just go out there and buy another call instead? Is it cheaper to buy back his own covered call or something? But then isn't it better to buy another 100 shares instead? Since you're not paying premium for options (assuming you have enough cash that is)."
2021-06-24 21:12:15,wallstreetbets,"right, and now that i think about it, there is no realized loss on the contract if OP gets assigned on the CC anyway, right? they collected the premium when sold (gain), and will collect @ the strike price when assigned (also gain, since, presumably the strike is higher than what the shares were purchased at). the current share price vs strike price is not considered a ""realized"" loss in the eyes of the tax man, just in the fact that OP does not benefit from that higher share price"
2021-06-24 22:39:10,wallstreetbets,should have sold 650c to avoid this problem
2021-06-25 01:46:59,wallstreetbets,"Are you saying you bought 100 shares of tesla at 650, and then selling covered call at the strike price of 640? huh?

Why did you want to sell your shares at a lower price than what you pay for? Is there a hidden trick that we're not aware of?"
2021-06-24 21:44:09,wallstreetbets,Yeah. Unless he had purchased the shares when Tesla was above 640. Then his loss would be whatever that difference is.
2021-06-24 22:16:23,wallstreetbets,"true, which is the case, apparently"
2021-06-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The $GLBE on My Shoulders   

Alright fellow tards, what‚Äôs more risky than a recent IPO? Finding your wife‚Äôs boyfriend is also your dad? I would say Yoloing money into an IPO I know nothing about since reading anything more than a headline is harder than my dad‚Äôs Dick.

The company is Global-E online ($GLBE), they built a world leading platform to enable and accelerate global, direct-to-consumer cross-border e-commerce, I.e. instead of ape getting banana from home exhibit banana stand that they got from banana boat, ape can get banana directly from tree. This platform allows international shoppers to buy and sell easy peats lemon squeezy online and for merchants to sell from, and to, anywhere in the world. It‚Äôs global but like having a banana tree in the back yard. This reflects the localization of the shopper's experience all while easing international transactions. GLBE currently serves hundreds of leading merchants and supports cross-border e-commerce into over 200 destination markets. They localize the shoppers' experience based on the country from which they shop, also supporting 25 languages, purchases with over 100 currencies by over 150 payment methods. So they make ape feel like he shopping in jungle for fresh large banana bundle instead of getting banana/carrot mash soup from exhibit water, toilet, and food dish. Shoppers are fully-guaranteed landed price quote, which includes shipping costs, import duties and tax charges, as well as post-sale services, including multi-lingual customer service and a managed return service (customer service is important according to 10/10 robinhood users).

Global-e has already been off to a hot start since IPO'ing but that is not a surprise when you have a digital selling powerhouse giant like Shopify as an investor, did I mention they are also a software partner with them? You know, the Shopify that has grown 5,000% in the last five years? 

**Upon Q1 2021 Financial results:**

\- Gross merchandise value as of the first quarter of 2021 was $267 million, increasing 133% YOY. 

\- Revenue increased 134% to $46.2 million YOY of which about 37% of that was service fees and the other 63% was fulfillment services up 146% and 128% respectively. 

\- Gross margin in the first quarter was 33.3% increasing 390 basis points from 29.4% in the first quarter of 2020.

\- Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2021 improved to $5.2 million compared to ($0.4) million in the first quarter of 2020.

**Quarter one Highlights and items I am watching for in Q2:**

\- Outperformance across the business lines with service fees and fulfilment revenues more than doubling YOY.

\- Continued accelerated growth of US outbound, getting into the US market is a huge win with US outbound revenues up 257% YOY.

\- New launches of strong brands and geographical expansion of existing merchants:

o Pace of new merchant launches continues to be strong, including Uniqlo (Fast Retailing) into LATAM and Skims (Kim Kardashian).

o Further expansions of existing merchants into new markets, including Marks and Spencer into 47 new markets and Hugo Boss intro 12 new markets.

\- They are enhancing their platform to increase value creation 

o Launched an enhanced self-service merchant reporting dashboards, allowing merchants to analyze data according to their specific needs.

o Developed the capability to support enterprise merchants with hybrid operational model across tax regions.

\- **Expansion of their partnership with Shopify (SIGNED AFTER THE CLOSING OF THE QUARTER ON APRIL 12TH)!!!!**

o **This is why I am betting big prior to their Q2 earnings report 8/3 pre-market.**

o **I wish they had options to bet on this but shares will do for now and probably the safe play if this turns into a long-term play like Shopify.**

o **After all this writing I don‚Äôt know how I can not bet more on this company as soon as market opens tomorrow..** 

o **‚Ä¶ I know it is Robinhood but here is ownership so far.**

**TL;DR:**

**$GLBE:** Global-E Online is like instead of ape getting banana from home exhibit banana stand that they got from banana boat, ape can get banana directly from tree. It is a global company but like getting banana right from your back yard. They make ape feel like he shopping in jungle for fresh large banana bundle instead of getting banana/carrot mash soup from exhibit water, toilet, and food dish. $GLBE go brrr see TA below:

for most SPACs its a 1:1 ratio (1 warrant = 1 share) and the purchase price is $11.50. they usually expire in 2025 or 2026

if you pay $3 for the warrant, you‚Äôd need the share price to be $14.5 to break even if you redeem. you pay $11.5 for the share + $3 premium

so they are like call options, but 1:1 instead of 1:100 and expire much later

I got in after $15.   Sometimes you have to look at grandma, look at Dr, ponder, and then pull the plug.   It has been circling the drain for a long time (as for my expectations) and felt unhappy with my position.   You tend to remember the ones that bit you.....  And to this day are on your watchlist.....  Waiting for a strong enough reversal to cover losses (cash account, never get caught up betting money from a shark, doing puts, calls, options, if ""YOU"" can't pay for it,  ""YOU"" don't need it) but that's neither here nor there."

Second lockup ends around October I think."
2021-06-25 02:39:32,wallstreetbets,"most SPACs launching late last year or this year will have warrants expiring in 2025 / 2026

i think paysafe is 2025"
2021-06-25 10:47:13,wallstreetbets,"for SPACs most have similar pricing.$10 base for the shares, $11.5 for the warrants

you can go to the investor materials for each spac to get the details about the expiry and purchase price. 

there is a website, SPAC track, that also has a lot of info

also, sometimes the expiry will be listed in the name of the warrants"
2021-06-24 21:37:00,wallstreetbets,is the first for founder shares and second employee? or are they both founder shares but with 2 different dates?
2021-06-25 02:40:36,wallstreetbets,Dang. Then isn‚Äôt everyone just buy the warrant? It‚Äôs like a really long dated call option.
2021-06-25 12:09:26,wallstreetbets,"Thanks got the info!!    
  
  
I‚Äôll skip it this time as I‚Äôm uninformed, but will look into it and decide for the next SPAC warrant that becomes available and has good upside"
2021-06-24 21:41:59,wallstreetbets,"Actually think I technically misspoke based on how they‚Äôre classified in the filings. 

Blackstone and CVC (which took company private in 2017) have their own lock up which was freed up in the earliest possible duration. Lock up for them expires July.

Founder shares, including FNF and Third Point, along with rest of PIPE expire October.

Noteworthy that Blackstone has added shares."
2021-06-25 02:56:09,wallstreetbets,"yes it is like a long dated call option. in fact, sometimes they can be much cheaper and more sensible because warrants are less known to retail investors

they also dont exist for a lot of companies. most SPACs got them though

one downside is that the company has the right to force redeem the warrants if share price stays > pre determined price for 30 days. this is what happened w/ stuff like DKNG or PLBY which were former spacs

you had to buy the shares or sell warrant to someone who would. if u do nothing when company redeems, the warrant expires worthless"
2021-06-24 21:46:57,wallstreetbets,"Ahh I see. Doubt cvc and black stone will sell at 11-12$ a pop. 

October lockup might be of concern but that‚Äôs a a few months from now.

2021-06-25 05:56:57,wallstreetbets,"Warrants expire after 5 years, unless forced redeemed by the company.

2021-06-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Schnitzer Steel Industries Inc NASDAQ: $SCHN From their investor site description: Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc., is one of the largest manufacturers and exporters of recycled metal products in North America with operating facilities located in 23 states, Puerto Rico and Western Canada. Schnitzer has seven deep water export facilities located on both the East and West Coasts in Hawaii and Puerto Rico. The Company‚Äôs integrated operating platform also includes 50 stores that sell serviceable used auto parts from salvaged vehicles and receive approximately 5 million annual retail visits. The Company‚Äôs steel manufacturing operations produce finished steel products, including rebar, wire rod and other specialty products.

$SCHN started the year trading at around $28.00. 

For Q1 earnings, they announced an earnings beat that sent the stock soaring more than $10 a share. It traded at a high of $59.34. Since then, it‚Äôs backed off some and is currently trading at $48.89. 

$SCHN has an earnings call on June 30, 2021 for Quarter ending May 2021.

Everyone, I think understands that steel is through the roof right now. 

Auto Parts are through the roof right now, too. Advance Auto Parts Director just purchased around $80k in stock in that company. Recycled auto parts are no exception. 

Earnings are likely to be strong, and a huge beat. If this stock follows the earnings beat pattern of Q1, we should see a jump back to the high of $59+, if not more. 

SCHN Jul 16 2021 55C are going for $1.00. 

What are your thoughts? This going to pop?"
2021-06-24 20:28:44,wallstreetbets,"It's a quality stock and company that should crush earnings and continue to grow. You just don't hear much about it around these parts because it's kind of boring, boomer-ish (it's literally one of my old man's biggest holdings) and because everyone is obsessed with CLF for a steel stock in this sub."
2021-06-24 21:04:39,wallstreetbets,"You basically can't go wrong long-term with any steel company in this climate, though some (like CLF and MT) may have more upside than others.

Note: SCHN stock has sometimes behaved paradoxically during earnings, dropping even on blowout numbers. But it always recovers and then prints hard - it's like investors can't believe their eyes in a sector that has underperformed for the last decade; it seems almost too good to be true. Well, believe it folks, and don't wait for others to pile in before you decide it's a good play - it's a good play."

2021-06-24 21:08:50,wallstreetbets,"It went bonkers after last earnings, then bled off, I think due to sentiment.  I just think this thing will top $65+ after the post earnings run up this time. I think tomorrow I'm in on these options."
2021-06-24 21:26:47,wallstreetbets,"I've been burned twice by SCHN earnings, but somehow I come back like a rat after cheese on an electrified platform. I'm not worried about SCHN long-term, I just don't want people to panic sell if/when they see that earnings didn't move the stock in the direction they hoped."

If you were planning this stock to be a quick cash grab within months, I think you should change your mindset.

Alot of these things mentioned will take time to implement out and expand the business.

How many people know that BB is now in CyberSecurity and cars?  I was last month old before I knew.

So give it time.  This is years worth of holding if you're in on this.

Edit: I am an ape not a professional.  Don't sue me if you're throwing money you can't lose at this."

2021-06-24 21:18:13,wallstreetbets,Not a conspiracy. Sell walls often happen on whole numbers and 12.40 was okay supports last time on the way down. With strikes at every dollar level this could be said regardless of what the share price is.
2021-06-24 21:20:37,wallstreetbets,I think youll be disappointed. A year over year decline in revenue and still having a big operating loss is going to hurt in the short term. I still like this CEO and their products. If it goes under 10 I‚Äôll add again or at least sell puts.

2021-06-25 13:20:19,wallstreetbets,"Covered calls are really easy, the only risk you expose yourself to is missing out if it moons. Covered calls should be a part of any theta strategy (IE buy and hold shares) to raise average profits in the long run. I had 150 shares total at 8 and then 50 again at 22 (oof), then it plummeted back to 8 so I sold Covered calls every week and bought more shares at 8-10 dollars. Now I own 315 shares from that total"

exactly"
2021-06-25 00:05:03,wallstreetbets,"I sell my covered calls above my purchase price. Even though i bought around $19, i sell calls for $22. Make about $100 each time and even if it goes above i will still be green from the strike price."

The whole point with selling CC's is you're essentially monetizing your savings."
2021-06-24 23:09:58,wallstreetbets,Perry much what I've been doing too. However that $100 better than nothing premium turned into like a 300$ spy call which I put into CLOV and really made a killing.
2021-06-25 13:01:43,wallstreetbets,"take it! $400 a month for just having money, don't have to buy and sell items on craigslist, sell on ebay and ship for a profit, etc. Literally just swiping up on your phone to sell a covered call, it's such an efficient way to earn a benjamin every week. Imagine instead putting all of that money into a HYS account @ 1.5% and just watching paint dry every day lol."
2021-06-24 23:34:16,wallstreetbets,"Strike for 16, 1000 shares will give him about 350 a week."
2021-06-25 08:15:05,wallstreetbets,"generally, i try to choose a strike price above my avg cost, but you have to weigh that against the fact that the premiums are pretty low rn in that range and whether or not you were planning to hold the shares either way...if it were me, i'd go with the weeklies and take the small premium, since it is pretty unlikely to gap up that much, but if it does, at least you'll come out even or slightly ahead if you do get assigned

and as the price climbs at a more normal pace, you can either collect higher premium at the 23 strike and consider your previously collected premiums as having lowered your avg cost (which is just psychological, really, but it's nice to know that your investment is generating some cash flow)

tl;dr - i'd sell weeklies at or just above my avg cost"
2021-06-24 22:04:30,wallstreetbets,Lol perfect repsonse

You‚Äôll also need to be able to read and understand market sentiment, psychology of trading, trends, and just getting a general idea of how markets response to certain circumstances.

2021-06-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$AA and $MT are reflation/recovery/rotational plays... set to surge Ok gonna try and make this relatively straight forward because I'm gonna talk about two stocks at once...

If you haven't accepted that the inflation fears are bogus, and that the economy is gonna keep moving upwards then feel free to take your üåàüß∏ ass to another post.

If you have accepted that stonks only go up, then you must realize that for the economy to continue to grow, industry has to continue to reactivate.  This means that we need more and more materials.

Even with China trying to dump steel and other materials on the market to curb inflation, there is nowhere near enough material for all the demand currently or the near/intermediate future.

&#x200B;

$AA - 

One of the worlds largest producers of aluminum.  Based in the US, and therefore set to benefit from strained relations with China.  But no matter what China does, they are seeing booming business in the post-Covid era.  Take a look at the rising earnings...

[Ready to rocket](https://preview.redd.it/llser7qzq9771.png?width=782&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f6d41dce8ec2254d68676054e84d16760312f1d)

EPS growth is up over 100%.  Revenue growth is up over 20%.  Market cap $6.53 billion.  AA has plans for greener production, which is part of the reason Goldman Sachs just upped their valuation to $48 a share.  Morgan Stanley just upped them to $50 a share.  Of 13 firms with opinions the overall analysis is very bullish; 3 outperform, 3 buy, 8 neutral, and only 1 sell.  I like the bollinger bands; looks to be bouncing off support and keeps challenging and raising resistance.

[AA BB baby](https://preview.redd.it/g93d5f68t9771.png?width=1853&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb52b808530fdab4ddc8a085fcce8099631a2359)

Only 5% of the float has been shorted, so this is not a short squeeze play.  But there will be short, intermediate, and long term increases based on all fundamentals and upcoming earnings expected in july (\~7/13).

&#x200B;

$MT - 

Steelgang rise up!  $MT is the worlds largest steel producer.  You have seen all the steel DD I hope... basically steel is one of the most in demand materials and there is no sign that we can keep up with demand.  DEMAND > SUPPLY = TENDIES.  MT is a vertically integrated company so they don't need to worry about some of the supply chain issues other companies do.  Similar to $AA, look at the rising earnings...

[up up up baby](https://preview.redd.it/w90a0o92u9771.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=0361518991e4126d8be45c1b6cb095aed882f5f8)

EPS is not reported, but revenue growth is up almost 10%.  Market cap is 31.96 billion.  They just completed a second share buyback and are now buying back ANOTHER $750 million!  Zacks recently increased their price target to $33, and analyst opinions range up to $40+ over the next 6-12 months.  Of the 8 firms with opinions the overall analysis is **one of the** **MOST bullish I have ever seen**; 1 outperform, 6 buy, only 1 neutral, and none with a sell rating.  I like the bollinger bands, and it is very similar to $AA above; looks to be bouncing off support and keeps challenging and raising resistance.

https://preview.redd.it/gay1mfosv9771.png?width=1848&format=png&auto=webp&s=71ea421bd22ba474ba3272d5f04b66ff4e9ce64c

Even less short here, but even more evidence for short-intermediate term value based increase.  Again, there is absolutely going to be short, intermediate, and long term increases based on all fundamentals and upcoming earnings expected in july (\~7/29).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So over the next 3-12 months these two companies are poised to take huge advantage of the increasing demand for materials.  As reopening trade continues, and demand increases, earning will continue to skyrocket and both of these companies will have huge valuation increases.  IV is low so you can get in really cheap on calls and leaps and even \*GASP\* buy some shares.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I am long on both... having been long in $AA for years (cause 'murica) and getting into $MT over the past month.

&#x200B;

Positions (price, change, $today g/l, %today g/l, $total g/l, %total g/l, value, quantity):

$AA:

[$AA](https://preview.redd.it/saww23efx9771.png?width=1206&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bc72efd6befccf0b7d18514b4e7e1e28c700f4f)

$MT:

[$MT](https://preview.redd.it/2rvtw2wix9771.png?width=1205&format=png&auto=webp&s=f26e0e96cbcd53e2959150d4ae1fae7f649671ef)

&#x200B;

**tl;dr** \- Buy calls and leaps for $AA and $MT and the reopening trade will bring you tendies galore.

&#x200B;

Cheers!

I already invested a lot in AMD, but I'm wondering if I should not double it. Only good news for short AND long term... Mobile GPU for different smartphones brands, the merger with Xilinx soon, tons of PS5 and Xbox sells, shares buyback program, Google recently choosing AMD for its servers.. 

I wouldn't be surprise to see AMD @95$ in July and 110$ end of year. Could be $140 by mid-2022.

It's no financial advice (I lost 1700$ this week, I'm an ape).

Take care !"
2021-06-24 22:00:30,wallstreetbets,There should be EU approval on the merger within few weeks or so. That should increase the price

2021-06-24 20:32:19,wallstreetbets,You know stuff. Magical shit like DLSS is what makes NVIDA a tech powerhouse. Their longtime investment in machine learning and AI makes them one of the most advanced companies in the world. Nothing against AMD but they just aren‚Äôt going to be able to compete with Nvidia on the hardware or software front. And as soon as Intel wakes from its slumber AMD is going to struggle even more to capture market share and mindshare.
2021-06-25 09:49:45,wallstreetbets,"AMD's FSR slutes, that said, DLSS feels like more of a solution searching for a problem, like they had some cool IP and they wanted to use them somehow, maybe to not make turing a terrible failure form the start? DLSS is still superior to FSR, but the winner will be who gets more devs to implement it, so far NVidia has a leg up but we need to see how it develops.

Tensor cores are the shit, and will print tendies big time for NV, but i don't see them having that much future in gaming"

KMX - CarMax is having earnings tomorrow morning 8:30 AM, car prices are at record highs, overall market sentiment and the fact this was shit on from ATH makes this ripe to pop.  Bullish.

PLTR - Palanqueer is having the run of it's life, might be in for a gamma squeeze tomorrow with so many new calls ITM.  This runs a buck or two and we might be kissing 30. Big Balls Bullish.

SOFI -  Banking's a bitch, especially with out interest rates. This one is riding the bottom of a channel and has been consolidating.  Solid fundamentals, looks like it wants to make a big move, we'll see which way.  Bullish - but, like, a nervous bull. 

My last pick is the SPAC merging with Buzzfeed News.  I hate their company, I think they are click bait trash.  Buuuutttt, I bet they are good for a little pop, and the downside risk is small because this is a SPAC and it's trading below the NAV.  Look that one up on your own retards."

Closed today before market close FDX(20%) , GS(40%) & COUP(24%) profit. 

Guilt missed NKE :( :(

Still in TSLA trade will judge tomorrow to leave & comeback when it is in small dip back around 650$.

Now looking for new trades, interested in BBBY as call options activity & retail market looks really good. SHOP will be cautious but upcoming catalyst of their conference can pop the share to 1600$. In general bearish for next week or two for tech, as bank earnings are coming & FED just opened the bottle of champagne for them... So bank looks good but wait for minor dip as they might react sell on the news tomorrow & next week. Banking names i Like GS, BAC.  


Now for meme stocks, AMC is consolidating & if next week is bearish for overall market it might be positive for AMC to test new high, I will watch it to open position.

2021-06-25 04:47:35,wallstreetbets,"Political controversy in fundamentally strong tech companies is easy money. 

* Facebook stock was dinged because Democrats were mad about Cambridge Analytica and Republicans were mad about supposed censorship. Everyone still hates them, but the company keeps making bank.

* Twitter lost 20% of it's value after they banned Donald Trump in the wake of the Capitol attack. But then they rallied 70% a few weeks later.

* Alibaba plunged after Jack Ma publicly attacked the Chinese Communist Party, and the government retaliated with fines and regulation. But the company still makes bank. The stock is still at its lows, but almost certainly will rise back up.

No one can get rid of these companies. US politicians rely on Facebook and Twitter to get elected, and like the deferred tax revenue they provide. China depends on Alibaba to handle most of their online infrastructure. Microsoft, Amazon, Google, etc. all provide absolutely essential services to humanity and are a big reason why the US is still a superpower. 

Of course, everyone knows this and the companies are insanely expensive. But political dips provide one of the few easy entries. The only other good approach is to identify the next generation of mega cap companies early, but that's much harder to do."

SITM has already achieved liftoff and got me a solid 28% gain, but I might put a lil more in it... will def buy more if it dips at all.

CRUS is goin up but still on the launch pad, so I will throw a bit more money at it.

IDEX is looking good but hasn't fully taken off yet, will def buy more if it dips back around $3.

MNMD is giving me profit, but I'm putting in more cause it hasn't taken off and I think it's a good long play.

CRSR keeps getting beat down whenever it gets close to $35, but that just gives me more chances to buy in for when it breaks through.

RKT just seems like a great value at current prices, so it'll get a little more money too.

Good luck everyone!"

2021-06-25 00:34:35,wallstreetbets,Stay strong. We can fight the hf. The level of infiltration is outstanding.  This isnt just targeted ads this is the economy. These attacks will make history.
2021-06-25 12:04:18,wallstreetbets,GME and AMC are played out. They can't run indefinitely. What is the possible upside or catalyst at this point? The perpetual downvoting of any new trades with actual upside...I don't get it.
2021-06-24 23:18:58,wallstreetbets,"They are concerned about the people who don't know any better than to ignore clear shill accounts that were created to take interest away from GME during the January run-up.

But I see you're a February account too, so of course you'd support your shill friends. He's probably sitting next to you lol."

2021-06-24 20:49:16,wallstreetbets,"Its because they were spending more on advertisements and getting more customers and merchant as they are still trying to get their name out. This is normal of most company their first several years. I don't see any ""logistical problem"" from my DD, but one downside they have is that they have problem keeping ""loyal"" customers even though they advertise the amount of app downloads and accounts they have. 

&#x200B;

Fortunately they are heading into the logistic business which is turning out to be their most profitable side piece. Overall, every company has good and bad, and in my OPINION, and from my research, WISH a future. Definitely not failing by any means."
2021-06-25 08:03:42,wallstreetbets,by that logic UBER should have bankrupted and failed years ago

2021-06-25 12:07:37,wallstreetbets,Not touching WISH until it hits analyst targets of \~30. And at that point it will only be trimming. This is inning 1 here.

I can't take them seriously, people promoting this junk stock is as shill as Wish Facebook posts shoveling garbage rejected products that haven't sold since they aired on ""as seen on tv"" ads from the 90s. 

On the other hand look what Amazon did with delivering toothpaste and other similar cheap readily available junk. If I'm wrong I miss potential gains. If you are wrong... manage that risk fellow apes full disclosure I am moron betting too much on Marijuana stonks."

Wish pumpers are just as annoying as Wish ads on Facebook, there is no technical analysis to support a website that shills $3 flashlights and $16 pocket knives that are obviously from shit brands that will break or not work as intended. 

The only play on Wish is a pump and dump meanwhile amc is in an ascending chart pattern and even after ""peaking"" twice still can't be pushed below $50 anyone claiming amc is done is a sad salty fomo shilling pump and dumps as ""the next meme stonk"" gtfo it was funnier when shills pushed silver now it's just getting pathetic pushing pharma plays and oil plays now this literally ""as seen on tv"" junk from the 90s reborn into internet ads ü§£ü§£ü§£"
2021-06-24 21:25:54,wallstreetbets,I am getting down voted to shit but my portfolio is all WISH. I agree with everything you said for the most part. So it seems they are headed into the logistic business but that comes with a higher margin. So hopefully they can ramp up the market side and their marketing pays off. I wonder if they can shake off their expectation vs reality meme status lol. I'm not trying to be negative I just like to have conversations about companies. After all we are just gambling on if they succeed or fumble their current opportunities lol
2021-06-25 12:02:05,wallstreetbets,Agreed - I don't understand the variant perception with WISH vs other tech companies on this issue.
2021-06-24 20:14:51,wallstreetbets,"So 2.80 x 1000 = $2800 potential loss, gains to whatever if it goes wel?"
2021-06-25 03:20:11,wallstreetbets,"Well....you are already missing the gains. 
And WISH is 1000x better than GME and AMC. It's a company with a future. Not a death end company that ONLY got promoted because of the Short Interest. 

And don't forget...it's a new company with great room for improvement. So maybe you will be surprised."
2021-06-24 20:36:20,wallstreetbets,So fucking true lmao. Most days I work from home. I probably would have day traded my shares away and then fomod back in at a higher price. Thank god I went into the office today. Haha

2021-06-25 12:01:24,wallstreetbets,The way WISH is using local businesses as drop off / pick up centers - businesses that are typically digitally marginalized - like mom and pop shops - makes me think they have a unique solution to this apparent logistical problem that may require less capex that competitors.
2021-06-24 20:48:27,wallstreetbets,Correct 2800 dollars expiring in August.   I never buy calls less than 45 days.  I hate theta decay.

Yes.

>	You pay the $2800 fee, and $16000 for the stock?

You don‚Äôt have to fork out 16,000 to exercise the option unless you actually want to keep the stock. You can just sell the contract to someone else before expiry, or your brokerage will just exercise and sell the stock for you and then give you your profit. 

Wallstreetbets is not the place to learn about options."
2021-06-25 08:17:26,wallstreetbets,"Amc was going down? You have zero support for that claim they have more screens and higher quality venues than any of their competition and like I said in 100 years of operation they now have more cash on hand than ever before.

You are correct on one point: I never have never will buy from wish.com it's literally a joke website that offers nothing exclusive or original to the platform. Everything at wish is easier and faster found through other ways. Craigslist is a better supplier than wish ü§£

If you are wrong you are going to nuke your portfolio over literally junk products sold to idiots too lazy to go shopping locally.

2021-06-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"RIG - a play on $100/bbl oil RIG is Transocean, these f\*ckers have a fleet of the largest deep water and ultra deepwater rigs in the world.  These rigs have names like Deepwater Orion and Deepwater Asgard.  F\*cking Norse Gods is what we're talking about here, gullivers.

Oh, yeah, sorry about the Deepwater Horizon, that was a stumble, but all better now.

Anyhows, here's the trick.  $100 oil was 2014.  What was the RIG price then?  $20-$40.  Where is it now?  Well it was circling the drain last year at several dozen cents.  Now it's huffed up to $4.   But Price to Book is under 0.3.  That's a bargoon.  Price to sales is less than 1.0.  Bargoon squared.

What if oil don't hit the $100 mark?  What if Elon Musk joins a monastery?  What if pancakes are made illegal?

Ask is the lowest price a seller is willing to sell and bid is the lowest price a buyer is willing to pay"
2021-06-25 00:02:09,wallstreetbets,Those are the prices of the options. But the price is for 100 contracts so multiply that by 100 and you've got a call contract.
2021-06-24 21:34:08,wallstreetbets,"Exactly this. Just like when you look at certain stocks in after hours without a lot of liquidity you might see a spread between the bid/ ask price of the regular shares.

But for options, the price you pay is the ask x 100 because contracts are in lots of 100 shares. Also, you could place an order for a mid point price and it‚Äôs pretty common for it to fill somewhere between the bid/ask"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**If company is so good, why did it fall 23% in the last 6 months?**

As all of you may know, the SPAC's were hot and trending back in early 2021 and most of the companies were overpriced. If you look at the price history of all the SPAC's post merger, then you'll notice that most of them fell quite significantly. ***Paysafe*** was one of the top companies that went public through SPAC.

&#x200B;

**Why paysafe is a good stock to invests in?**

&#x200B;

* ***Paysafe*** has been delivering what many SPAC's have failed to deliver i.e **Revenues & Profits.** Despite the numbers being good after Q1, the stock still fell by 21%. Paysafe got hit by ""Post merger SPAC effect'.
* The drop in price due to ""Post Merger SPAC effect"" is a great opportunity for investors to buy the stock and hold it for long term.
* Paysafe has an amazing opportunity to establish it's monopoly in the iGaming space. Their biggest competitors PayPal & Square are staying out of iGaming space and focusing more on Fintech space. Paysafe currently has agreements with few big companies such as DraftKings, Roblox, Twitch, Caesar's entertainment and many more.
* When it comes to iGaming space, the risks are relatively small because the disputes are very unlikely. People depositing money into their roblox accounts or draft kings are not entitled to refunds and same applies to twitch donations.
* As per nasdaq.com, the company is expected to **exceed $103 billion in transactions** this year and the company forecasts that iGaming in the United States will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of **52% through 2025.**
* The company‚Äôs products are currently not as widely accepted as PayPal or Square, however, they plan on expanding in the coming years.
* As per nasdaq.com, The U.S. online gambling industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 15.4% between last year and fiscal year 2025 and ***Paysafe*** has relationship with almost all top online gambling operators in the U.S.
* The company has expanded partnership with **Coinbase** and the company‚Äôs payment solution is in about 27  sites and exchanges. As investing and trading activity grows in the near future, Paysafe is well positioned to benefit.
* If you look at the Q1, the fundamentals were quite strong, company reported revenue of $377.4 million, which was higher by 5% on a year-on-year basis. The company's adjusted EBITDA was $113.2 million, which implies an EBITDA margin of 30%.
* The company absolutely destroyed the expectations when it comes to e-cash solutions segment, adjusted EBITDA for that segment was 110% higher and reported $48.1 million. The company reported revenue growth of 63% \~ $112.9 million.
* As per nasdaq.com, the e-cash segment has an EBITDA margin of 42.6% as compared to the company level EBITDA margin of 30%. With strong growth in the e-cash segment, it‚Äôs likely that EBITDA margin will expand in the coming quarters. As a matter of fact, Paysafe has guided for an adjusted EBITDA margin of 32% for FY2021
* Between FY2020 and FY2023, the company is targeting annual growth revenue of about \~10%. Ecash segment is the margin driver for this company and the guidance seems realistic because of potential growth in the U.S online gambling sector.
* If there is a synergy, Paysafe could also merge with other online payment companies in order to grow. The company is currently sitting at $274 million in cash and $225 million in un-drawn credit facility.
* According to nasdaq.com, Paysafe reported operating cash flow of $48.7 million in Q1. This would imply an annualized OCF of $195 million. With likely EBITDA margin expansion in the coming years, the company is positioned for healthy cash flow growth.

&#x200B;

**What is the future of iGaming and online transactions?**

There is no brainer in this question. The iGaming space and etransactions will keep exceeding in the near future. Many countries currently use cash for transactions, but as technology advances, third world countries are expected to go cashless and follow digital payments. As per the article from Juniper Research Ltd, the digital world is projected to exceed $10 Trillion in 2025. This is an 83% increase from 2020. The research also found that contactless and e-commerce payments will increase to 50% of total wallet spend in 2025 from less than 36% in 2020. More than 34% of mobile handsets are also seen to use contactless payments in 2025, up from 11% in 2020. Even a 2 year old baby would know that Paysafe is expected to benefit from this growth.

&#x200B;

Stock price during after the merger,

As you can see from the graph below, the Paysafe stock rocketed right after the merger announcement and shot up to as high as 20$/piece. What happened next should not shock the world because most of the SPAC's fell off post merger. BUT what makes this SPAC unique is the fact that they've been able to pull off revenues and profits and were able to provide better guidance for the future.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Total revenue for the first quarter of 2021 was $377.4 million, an increase of 5%, compared to $359.7 million in the prior year. However, gross profit was a bit low compared to 2020.

Net loss for the first quarter was $49.1 million, compared to $51.1 million, in the prior year. The company mentioned in the presentation that Net loss included interest expense of $58.5 million, an increase of 53% compared to the prior year, reflecting the expense of capitalized debt fees as a result of debt repayment on March 31, 2021. Net loss also included share-based compensation of $72.4 million, compared to none in the prior year due to shares vested on completion of the Transaction.

Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $113.2 million, compared to $112.8 million in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased approximately 140 basis points to 30.0%, but they expect this basis point to go up in the near future.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Now let's have a look at the segment growth

Like I mentioned earlier, the company absolutely destroyed their growth in ecash solutions and reported an increase in revenue by 63%.

***Integrated Processing -*** Revenue for the first quarter was $176.9 million, a decrease of 5%, compared to $186.2 million in the prior year

***Digital Wallet -*** Revenue for the first quarter was $94.9 million, a decrease of 13%, compared to $108.5 million in the prior year.

***eCash Solutions -*** Revenue for the first quarter was $112.9 million, an increase of 63%, compared to $69.1 million in the prior year

# HIGHER 2021 guidance

The company reported higher 2021 guidance and are expected to achieve their goals due to increase number of online transactions and growth in iGaming space.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TLDR -**

**The company is expected to achieve their 2021 guidance.**

**No competition for Paysafe in iGaming space.**

**The stock fell down in the past few months due to ""Post Merger SPAC fatigue""**

**One of the few SPAC's who actually brings in Revenue & Profits**

**Currently close to 52 week low and a nice opportunity to grab at this current price**

&#x200B;

**Positions Screenshot**

**180 share at 11.14$ each**

**45x calls with strike price 12.5$ expiring 7/16.**

2021-06-24 20:02:27,wallstreetbets,"Warrants are essentially a call option with a strike price of $11.50 with an expiration date of around 4 years depending on the issue. They can be called in under certain conditions, like if the common stock is trading over $18 for 20 of the last 30 trading days but that varies by the company. As for price action they vary like any call options, they have some value since they are dated years in the future and they move that future value + price action above $11.50 of the common. They can be lucrative but don‚Äôt chase them too hard once they‚Äôre above $2 unless you‚Äôre really confident in the stock since a lot of SPACs are pre-revenue for 3-4 years. In this particular case its a real company with actual revenue today so its more of a safer bet but that‚Äôs shown in the warrant pricing of $3.25. The common is hovering around the strike price, so if you got in the warrants today you‚Äôre break even on the common would be around $14.75."

2021-06-24 23:38:23,wallstreetbets,"With the short interest relative to real float (not the reported one), some may be looking for a pump and dump but the underlying value for a long term hold is irrefutable.

It‚Äôs clear that Paysafe is significantly undervalued when compared to a basket of comps (PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, bill, GPN, and Paysign) with a collective growth rate of \~12.5% (in Paysafe‚Äôs 10-13% range):

Paysafe's price based on sector peer multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75

EV/Rev ratio : $44.64

EV/FCF ratio : $44.18

Average :$46.52

Valuation Notes:	

1.	Removed all high outliers in each category putting PSFE at $100+	

2.	Unlike Paysafe's reported $362 million in free cash flow (on track to increase 29%) and 30%+ EBITDA margin, half of peers report negative EBITDA growth and a third report negative EBITDA and negative free cash flow.	

3.	Paysafe has better EPS than over half of the peer group	

4.	Paysafe has better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them

Also, in Q1 Paysafe had $90 million in one-time expenses associated with merger and paying down $1.2 billion in debt. This means without those expenses they would have beat analysts estimates and, going forward, they are well positioned to beat analysts EPS estimates for the rest of the year.

Recent debt management, saving around $92 million annually, secures higher margins and higher profits which will lead to raised price targets and positive price action catalysts. 

Paysafe confirmed they are on track to meet 2021 growth projection which doesn‚Äôt include planned inorganic M&A growth pipeline and iGaming expansion (55% CAGR)."

Look at whalewisdom.com and type in any (maybe even all, honestly has been 100% strike rate for me thus far) recent tickers being mentioned on this sub and look at the holders for that ticker and the Quarter they first owned it.

This is who you'll find holding them every time: Citadel, Jane Street, & Susquehanna. 

Those are huge names, $1.2T between just those three, so you may not think it's unusual they have a holding in some random ticker which is thrown around. However, you would not expect them all to randomly decide to sink their teeth into said random ticker for the first time, all at the exact same time, every time... which they do. 

They all bought these tickers for the first time Q1 2021. And if they happened to own it before Q1 2021, just check the ""Changes in Shares"" category along with 13F filing date, and you'll see they're all, in their latest 13F filing, adding to their long position substantially.

The PnD couldn't be any more obvious and who's manufacturing it.

There's other names you'll typically find buying in at the same exact time (they just don't participate in each PnD) but since they don't get mentioned often I'd rather they not get the spotlight turned on them yet.

2021-06-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Is the TTD split a great buying opportunity? Long story short, TTD recently effected a 10-1 stock split at around 1,000 dollars a share. It's been climbing at a fairly quick pace, as of this writing in the mid-79's. TTD, or The Trade Desk, deals in ad space, pricing and placement. 

The fact that cookies are now being phased out is of course, a major obstacle to a company whose business is built on them, but apparently, TTD has a solution to this in  Unified ID 2.0, which is, to my understanding, going to essentially work the same as cookies currently do, albeit in a manner that preserves the anonymity of users. Apparently Unified ID 2.0 might be the next big thing in internet advertising data. If so, this would ultimately make TTD even more attractive in a post-cookie world.

Ultimately, I think it's a pretty good buy, especially when it is still sub-100 a share. But anyone else have thoughts, any caveats to take into account regarding this stock?"

2021-06-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DraftKings: Erecting a Turgid Empire in a Bulging Market - DKNG DD Edit: meant for my title to say Dick Kings, turgid/bulging, get it? Fuck.

# TL;DR - DKNG, thanks to aggressive partnerships, advertising, and market penetration, is the leading player in the growing online sports betting and casino market. Recent legislative progress and brand recognition should result in continued growth.

^(Disclaimer: This is not financial advice, I just like the stock. There's a couple of dick jokes buried in here and I say the word penetrate a lot. I made some of the charts in here myself so please don't shit on me too much for the quality; my crayons were not sharp. Do your own DD.)

Hello again people of WSB,

I'm sure you've seen the ticker DKNG pop across your feed at least once recently, and it's for good reason. Actually, lately it's been for bad reason. Hindenburg published a hit piece on DraftKings that the stock brushed off like it didn't matter, because it didn't. There are a ton of posts about that so we're skipping over that and getting right into the nuts and bolts of this DD - market growth and DraftKings' rigid position as number 1.

^(The statistics used is this are a combination of the US Census, the American Gaming Association, DraftKings Investor Relations, Google-fu, and my own personal confirmation bias as a user of several sports betting apps) **^((no, honey, I don't bet on sports ever I promise.)****)**

&#x200B;

# Basics - Consensus: Growth

https://preview.redd.it/7rd8lk5rg9771.png?width=873&format=png&auto=webp&s=795492d339805913efe9bb71076fdd7c301fed38

DKNG has maintained a strong buy rating for some time now as it continues to grow. Universal buy/hold ratings with 3.5x more buy than hold. Consensus price target of $68 represents a 35% upside from the current price. In the last year the stock has soared above $70 (when I personally believe it got ahead of itself and overextended a bit). However, no one gives a fuck what analysts say. Let's dig into the potential for elongated growth:

&#x200B;

# Why will DKNG grow? The market is growing. More and more states are legalizing sports betting:

https://preview.redd.it/pyh2j5ovg9771.png?width=1158&format=png&auto=webp&s=06447b052a7cb6ef6fc05380608998ac9031c508

Sports betting has been picking up steam in the United States of late...

* 21 states & Washington having it legal, regulated, and in operation
* 9 states have already legalized it and are in the process of spinning up operations
* 3 more states have active or pre-filed legislation in 2021
* The other 17 have legislation either currently slated to be proposed, dead, or none started (more later on....)

As you can see above, unless you're really retarded, a majority of the US population will soon have access to sports betting. The reason for the blue/yellow/red pie chart is to highlight how much of the remaining population lives in **Texas and California.**

* **Texas** has legislation that should be **proposed in the 2022 session** (don't get me started on the efficiency of Texas government).
* **California** will have the initiative to legalize sports betting **on the 2022 ballot**

&#x200B;

# There's a difference between sports betting, and online sports betting / iGaming...

https://preview.redd.it/tihbhxtwg9771.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=78739c54a4eaa99658fb0b88f60c285e1897d2e3

Not everywhere that has had sports betting legalized has followed up immediately with permitting online sports betting and iGaming (online casino). Currently, 88 million people in the US can access online sports betting and iGaming. DraftKings, as shown above, is very aggressive in their effort to thrust themselves in and penetrate every market available to them. **They have active gaming presence in more states than any of the other apps/companies, being available to over 90% of the eligible market.** As more states legalize sports betting, more online betting markets will open up. Thanks to DKNG's exposure, they will grow right along with the available customer base.

&#x200B;

# DraftKings has achieved more market share than any other online sports book, daily fantasy, or iGaming competitor. How? Brand recognition:

https://preview.redd.it/t0c2qovyg9771.png?width=1052&format=png&auto=webp&s=98876ab029bef832fef1a6f6cb637646d96c51ca

Sitting on a market share of 30% for sports betting and 19% for iGaming, DKNG is the leader in both categories. They were and still are the first name in the category. With that advantage, along with having the slickest application in the market, comes brand recognition:

https://preview.redd.it/qtbwaz70h9771.png?width=1064&format=png&auto=webp&s=89b4b0118f567aee638819f94bec46a6ea96af99

Aiding in this dominance is a whole mess of partnerships with major sports leagues, teams, and media outlets coupled with an aggressive advertising push nationally. **If you watch sports or consume sports media, you cannot miss DKNG:**

https://preview.redd.it/7mzkvmw1h9771.png?width=1108&format=png&auto=webp&s=47cc1c1c60daca57452036e0d2ea0736b19d3a24

https://preview.redd.it/k9cys3g2h9771.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac5de6bef5e0163028253bd7f02776475498f5ab

&#x200B;

# No DD is complete without a couple of charts that look at some self-serving trends. These are 100% confirmation bias:

Well over a year of activity shown on this first chart. I like the stock:

https://preview.redd.it/zek1k9a4h9771.png?width=2179&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0cad05bb4ed02972b7e9447409148648f88eabd

You'll notice here I put my trend line through part of the upper reaches of the stock; I think it briefly overextended on that rally and choose to ignore that high point. The vertical line on this second chart is the fall off from the Hindenburg hit piece. Onward and upward. Again, I like the stock:

https://preview.redd.it/spaob3t5h9771.png?width=2183&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea3700a250a51c5b21bb1ba3ca64f60471e3161e

&#x200B;

# A bonus nugget in this DD: Canadian parliament just voted to approve sports betting on June 22:

https://preview.redd.it/tep16pr7h9771.png?width=672&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c829daa9085875b35a867d84e40cd5e07ab77b4

According to the news, sports betting could be in full swing as soon as this fall in Canada. In the investor conference in March, DraftKings was already looking ahead at Canadian market penetration and estimate the market size at $5 - $8 billion:

https://preview.redd.it/jn81d529h9771.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&s=27d680d4032475806c653c745705d76c9f6c022b

DraftKings was first to the table here, and they'll probably be at least among the first there.

&#x200B;

# In summary: DKNG is a growing stock within a swelling market:

* Positioned well in existing markets with nearly 100% exposure
* Tracking new markets and have a history of aggressive implementation and penetration
* Have more market share than any competitor
* Have a load of partnerships with sports leagues, teams, and media for exposure
* The most recognizable name in the category
* We didn't talk about it, but a best in class application for many reasons; try it and see
* NFL season kicks off in late summer and Canadian markets potentially open in the fall
* Should be on their way to profitability; the life of a growth stock....

&#x200B;

See you on the moon.

Cheers

2021-06-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Just spent 20 minutes in line Academy Sports & Outdoors...8 reasons why $ASO is going to blow tf up 1. This place is absolutely packed. At lunch time on a Thursday, I wouldn't expect a sporting goods store to have lines at all, much less having to wait in line.
2. Since I was a little kid, I've seen stores try to compete and get shut tf down, including Oshman's Sporting goods and Bass Pro. Only the Dick's across town is still open, and it is way more expensive.
3. Try to find me a rating for this stock that isn't at least outperform, if not usually a buy or strong buy. I know it is retarded to rely on consensus ratings, but I know what I am, and so I go by them.
4. **The trend is your friend.** Look at this stock since it's IPO. It is on a straight upward trend with no signs of coming down, because the company is doing great.
5. Millennials are suddenly getting into camping and glamping. I wouldn't partake in glamping, but I love camping. And every time I go shop for a new panhandling/bridge tent for my last YOLO play that went wrong, I see a shit ton of millennials checking out the camping gear. Go onto TokTok if you don't believe me. See for youself.
6. COVID-19 has driven many people to find new hobbies, and as the news has reported, a huge number of people are getting into outdoor activities like fishing, hunting, camping, etc. etc. Now that we are slowly recovering, this has increased even more.
7. Academy is essentially the Wal-Mart of sporting goods stores. I challenge you to try and find something at Dick's or your favorite competitor that is cheaper than it is at Academy.
8. GUNS n AMMO. If you haven't been keeping up with the times, firearms are being bought in record numbers in the past year. Academy sells a shitload of this stuff
9. Innovation: this store used to be somewhat stale in terms of new ideas, but new management is bringing ideas fresher than your mom's chocolate chip cookies. Their latest of these ideas fresher than your little sister's clam is ""Freely"", a line of clothing that you can wear both at work or at home.
10. This isn't a post purporting to be DD or fundamental analysis or technical analysis, but **it's good on all those counts, chief.**

Did I mention the fact that $ASO is hitting ATHs on a daily basis? Legit everyday, a new all time high. This is a short-term and long-term play. Whether it is FDs or LEAPs, you finna make some money with me. Just don't be extra retarded and buy the 60 dollar calls that expire in less than a month. God can only help that level of retard. I know I only threw in a few thousand, it's not much but it's honest work. I am throwing every last bit of my money, my girlfriend's money, and her boyfriend's money into this bad boy.

Clearly an upside down red rocked ready to splurge. More like a green rocket. So why dip your paws in on this growing stonk? Look at the stock price this year. The fucker is down nearly 9% YTD as of today, hovering around $80 a share and plummeting from an all time high near $120 a share in February.  CHWY has been hammered like a Great Dane going to town on a chiwawa since tech stocks took a hit earlier this year. Dumbass analysts think a return to normal in retail is a bad thing for CHWY but they fail to realize how loyal of a customer base they have. CHWY even raised their guidance in Q2 but the stock is still being held down. Idiots. 

There‚Äôs never been a better time to slide into your dog‚Äôs DM‚Äôs than this one. Even with a strong economic recovery, that‚Äôs bound to only help CHWY continue to grow. The more you look, the more reasons you find to buy.

I‚Äôm not a dog and I‚Äôm also not your personal financial professional either. Do your own DD retards. I just like dogs and Tendies, which is why I‚Äôm holding 124 shares of this red rocket ship."

2021-06-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$CLF - Huge BRRRR signals forming - strike while the iron is hot! üî•üî• It's getting hot over here boys! Biden infra deal, and steal commodities are heating up again. And the $CLF Cleveland-Cliffs is getting ready to strike while the iron is hot. Given the recent news, looking at this stock from a pure price action and technical analysis in this post. 

&#x200B;

**TL;DR; huge buy signals forming. MACD hit the green cross. With upside potential and a gap up, get in early on the potential upward action.** 

&#x200B;

Looking at the 1D chart (orange lines is the upward channel the price is moving in), just hit the support line/channel, and had a great bounce up. I expect the next couple of days to be very green, if not a gap up again.

&#x200B;

[Upward channel](https://preview.redd.it/z3jm8d2319771.png?width=1077&format=png&auto=webp&s=728eaa71b4145862c17707bcb3f681d895c805a2)

Looking at the candle actions within the channel. We can see the small candle actions before a large gap-up or larger candle. We just hit the next small green candle in the series. Which means an expected larger green candle is coming. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Looking at the technical averages, we can see almost all are showing buy action on the 1M data points. Confirming upward price actions. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

MACD also just crossed on the 4H chart, signaling an early green potential reversal.

I think splitting good GoT vs bad GoT by story arc is more accurate than by season. I would argue that the Daenerys arc starting going bad as soon as season 2 with highs evermore sporadic. While the King's Landing one was still good til the end of season 6. The Bran arc was always too slow. The Castle Black was fine til season 5. The Winterfell arc was fine until Ramsay Bolton. The Stannis arc was great until season 5. Arya/Dorne/Greyjoy were shit through and through. The highlight of the show being every direct and indirect interaction between Stark aligned people and Lannister aligned people as well as the inside dynamics of the northern lords and the Lannister family."

I frequently see posts about CLNE on this subreddit. I figured I would let you guys in on a little secret. GEVO just opened up a RNG facility focusing on converting cow turds into renewable natural gas. AND this is not even a major factor in their business model..GEVO will be the #1 supplier of aviation fuel to major Markets around the world. They own patents to their NET ZERO FUEL, made from corn. They already have take or pay contacts with huge companies such as Delta airlines or Scandinavian Airlines. The Net Zero One plant in South Dakota is now under from end engineering. GEVO has 550 million in cash and 0 debt. They also have 400 million in intellectual property. The founder of GEVO is on President Bidens science team. They were just listed on the Russell 3000 index. They ceo of PLUG is on the board at GEVO. Last but not least, GEVO has a SI of 28%, shorted by Citadel. I could go on and on with catalysts. Bottoms line is that GEVO is going to outer space."
2021-06-25 06:33:55,wallstreetbets,"Not bad but nothing even close to the progress CLNE has made. There's a tipping point at which RNG will have enough infastructure to be a true part of the nation's energy mix. CLNE already has enough weight and momentum to get there. It will get there. 

GEVO looks great and will probably get there.

So TSLA broke through a big resistance the last two days and has been on a tear all the way up to almost $700, and I‚Äôm not as smooth brained as some of you retards here with more technical analysis or history on this sort of rip, but I have been watching the market since the pandemic and was curious if anyone has some tempered expectations for where we could be headed next if TSLA closes the week out around this price? 

That being said I know TSLA has been getting shorted since day one, and there has been a massive consolidation going on for the last few months. What is the catalyst for this huge surge in price though? Obviously, people have been saying it‚Äôs overvalued since almost two years ago, but what has lead to this huge increase in price and what can we expect to see that will either mean a bigger run up next week possibly?

This is leading me to believe that my hypothesis is correct: ""counterparty incentive to suppress price""

&#x200B;

[Chart Data & Annotation Courtesy of u\/TradeBkk via Ortex](https://preview.redd.it/q3bhmas2v8771.png?width=2262&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a813d111a73fcd79bdd7a08c741d1fabc27bea2)

The estimated short interest of $CPNG is ever increasing.

I believe this because shares are hard to borrow.

[June 24, 2021 - HTB](https://preview.redd.it/m8v34w6av8771.png?width=806&format=png&auto=webp&s=6044b608a019d2dd21072e425f97ec2578c01e32)

Today was about the same in short share availability.

Basically someone is soaking up all the shares and borrowing them to suppress price.

Now why would they want to do that?

Well it's simply because the public was is/was bullish about it.

Put sweep occurred on June 23rd on about 4,000 contracts @ $12.00.

Breakeven \~$38.00

Today price opened at $40.5 and fell to $39.00. Shares are HTB (hard to borrow). Someone is shorting this to the max.

Why?

Every point that $CPNG goes up from $38.00, the counterparty is essentially losing premium.

The original $40 puts are still maintaining their position. I've listed the potential positioning, possibly more.

Market makers / Exchanges PHLX and ISE is holding the \~ $5.00 premium, which I assume is above the accumulation of the 19,439 put contracts.

I guess it is a mixture of strategy 3 and 4.

# On almost every timeline:

# 1) $45 feels the pressure

# 2) $50 might pop

# 3) > $50

What are ""they"" trying to do?

* Time Value Decay

Why are ""they"" trying so hard?

* they wrote naked calls
* or they are losing on the put hedge
* they don't want to get assigned
* they are short shares from the synthetic short call

What can the bulls do?

* Buy stock
* Increase option pressure
   * (subject to your risk preferences)

The bears?

* pay up and stop *manipulating* sentiment
* short more
* sell long equity
* exercise options, if capital is available
* tank the market like 2020

I started to doubt this, but it got me thinking. If the counterparty is selling shares naked and continues to short shares while price fails to decline. What happens? Well people are going to own a lot more of the shares than are actually available.

The shorts? Well they're going to be short a lot more than the float.

TLDR: Consildation of debt by Telefonica($TEF) + low IV + 18% short interest = üöÄüöÄ üöÄ üöÄ

# Alright retards; put your fucking sombreros on, grab a margarita, and buckle up.

Telefonica is one of the largest Internet service providers in the world, operating in 13 countries with over 113,000 employees. Coming out of the pandemic, Telefonica is currently undergoing a transformation with the shift to 5G provision across its markets.

I won't bore you with a ton of numbers that shows that **TEF is profitable** as FUCK, **undervalued** AS FUCK, has a ton of **CASH, and is consilidating its debts. Shorts are keeping this stock down. It should \*not be at 2020 levels.**

TEF is clearly set to explode higher given high short interest of 18% and lack of borrow (borrow rate currently \~20%).

At the beginning of the month, **Telef√≥nica finalized its merger with Virgin Media** in the UK and **the sa**l**e of Telxius Towers**, two transactions that will allow it to **reduce 9,000 million in debt.** With this reduction, Telef√≥nica's **debt will remain at 26,000 million euros**, **at about 2.3 times its gross operating profit (Ebitda)**, and an amount that could drop further with some divestitures such as the submarine cable business of Telxius or a subsidiary in Latin America, he said**. Income 4 analyst Ivan San Felix for Europa Press.After this process, ""the investor's anxiety should ease a lot**,"" San Felix says.Conditional on the overall performance of Ibex 35, which has fallen in this period, Telef√≥nica's share has rebounded by only 2% since the closure of these operations, to ‚Ç¨3.94, yet it has accumulated more than 28% of revaluations since the beginning of the year.

TEF has a current dividend yield of 7.1%, and has had above a 4% yield for the past 4 years.

**Telefonica Analyst Ratings:**

This stock has been beaten down by shorts over the past few years. I am extremely bullish on this stock as the telecom industry isn't going anywhere. With the recent merger of their subsidiary O2 with Virgin Media, Telefonica is set to go higher.

Based on fundamentals and the possibility of a short squeeze here to expedite the inevitable, I like the stock. **TEF should \*not\* be at 2020 levels, especially given their recent consolidation of debt.**

Let me present you LZB, a forniture company which has been growing for the last 10 yrs. Being such a clean company this year had a target price of 50$, but last month got somehow shorted for just speculative reasons. We don't like that, we want clean companies to reach their targets and even break them!

Here you can see some graphs:

[Revenue\/Net Income](https://preview.redd.it/jq2gjxteu8771.jpg?width=1191&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5cff9d25968203545b27d187375352bf37f85913)

So we understand why this is a total buy, the rating agencies were predicting 50$ in the next months, we are not talking about a tech or steel company, this is about wood and feathers, recliners, sofas.. pure comfort.

That's why this is a powerful company, it's not a sector we hear about often, that's why noone was expecting that short,

luckily we are here to send this monster company with a sky-rocket to the moon. Let's reach the targeted price of 50$ as soon as possible. There are not many words to add, evaluate what you think and make your choice, but don't wait too much, it might be late :)

(The calls I bought back then are showing a nice profit already haha) People are calling it a pump&dump now that it's back to the level it hit 10 days ago.

Tough crowd. :P BBBY is a fundamentally solid company - it's not the next Tesla or Amazon, but it's more fundamentally strong than some of the tickers getting pumped on WSB. Nobody is trying to distract people from AMC, BB, GME, etc. (Hell, I have a position in GME, a big stake in WKHS, and I swing-trade BB on top of my BBBY.) All of this is just to provide an option, an alternative, if anyone is so inclined. BBBY will go up at some point, and I think that point is approaching."

They will not come down or crash due to inelasticity of demand and the catchup game we're stuck in. The backlog for Ford F150's is 5 fucking months right now, at least. CLF is going to squeeze way, way up when wall street realizes that they are staring at a company that is about to have zero debt, the moat of a fixed cost supply of Iron Ore mined locally here in the USA, and 4-10 years of \~trillions in infrastructure, highway/road/bridge building staring at us in the face.

Take the $1000 and view it as actually potentially $10,000 if you do the right things. Then, take that $10,000 and view it as actually potentially $100,000 if you do the right things with it.

This is how I turned $400 into $100,000 over the course of two years playing poker.

I got in at $13.59 and I am swinging until my next target of $17 hits.

Coal futures surged past $123 a tonne for the first time since October 2011, up from $90 in May and up from $55 in October,  as supply constraints meet higher demand, a demand which is only going to  increase as more and more economies reopen following covid

Coal is essential in Steel making which is surging at the moment, there are 252 electricity power stations in the USA which are coal powered with another 3750 around the world, over 1000 in China and 281 in India, not to mention home heating use, industry and the many other applications

China and India are leading the demand as they become industrial power houses making up for lost time following covid closures

With the world coming out of covid, the demand for coal has shot up to at a high not seen for over a decade, the resurgence in price has made coal a very profitable business for Peabody Energy, one of the leading suppliers of coal

&#x200B;

In contrast the share price had tanked up until March this year, there were solvency worries for the company during the covid shutdown last year but these have now passed with the 03/31/2022 corporate bonds having recovered in price to sell at nearly par value.

&#x200B;

With the solvency issues in the rear view mirror and $500m in cash on the balance sheet BTU stock has begun a sharp rally as it starts a new long term upward trend with a long runway ahead of it powered by demand tailwinds together with increased coal prices leading to a surge in cashflow

Electricity Generation. Power generation is the primary use for coal worldwide.

Metal Production. Metallurgical (coking) coal is a key ingredient in steelmaking.

2021-06-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Citadel Capital Replenishment  If you find where they are hiding taking profits and take action to prevent any profit taking, the GME moon landing will happen. They can't be margin called if their capital is not reduced significantly. --""But we are reducing their capital by buying and holding""-- You were, but over the past year these hedge funds have invested in piggy bank stocks they are using to replenish that capital.

Citadel has been using this particular stock as a piggy bank this year. Orchestrating wild swings with other HF's to pull profits on run ups and rundowns. I tried to post a screenshot of their latest 650,000 put but that just results in an instant post deletion. I tried posting a link to the data on fintel but that got the post deleted. Seems impossible to post DD data in this subreddit, so you'll have to do the legwork if you want to see proof of Citadels shorts on SRNE

I know of this particular stock because I am a long term investor who has watched this play out over the past year. I guarantee you there are many other stocks they are playing this same game with. When GME goes up they loose capital, then they work over stocks like this one to replenish that capital loss.

To be clear this stock needs nothing from this sub, my investment will rise on it's own accord naturally over the next 3-5 years and that is just fine with me.

Have you all consider figuring out how to stop the inflow of cash to these hedge funds. Unless you can cause a substantial capital decrease the margin call will never happen. As long as they have side stocks that are piggy banks the war will rage on indefinitely. Clearly buying and holding was an excellent phase 1 strategy, so what's the next phase of this movement? My thoughts, attack the inflow of capital."
2021-06-24 22:56:24,wallstreetbets,"I think SRNE took care of this concern by making lots of good moves and becoming valuable on it's own. As far as hedges making money by beating up and pumping and dumping a bunch of small stocks sure, shorting, selling those options etc. Seems like across the board the market makers are learning how to use WSB and retail by dividing them and appealing to their wagering tendencies. The only place retail has the hedges by the balls is GME and maybe AMC. Both likely have enough manufactured shares so there is no way for the shorts to ever acquire legit stock if everyone holds but there is no end game here...maybe they never have to come up with shares! Whether the Hedge fund makes money or not on other stocks won't change this possible reality. Buying and holding the right single stock is the easy and direct way to succeed, putting attention on others is likely playing into the hedges hands."

2021-06-25 00:36:33,wallstreetbets,Ya it‚Äôs just temporary. It will go up. Never bet against Tesla.
2021-06-25 00:39:12,wallstreetbets,"over the 2-10 year you'd be right. but the all in on tesla, the most volatile stock in tech, with borrowed money of all things, it seems op's fucking himself"

2021-06-25 01:36:33,wallstreetbets,"Long F checking in. I have been in and out of F since around 2009 (back when was around the $1-2 range).

Currently, I find value of incumbency of confidence of the bestselling vehicle, trust that the company will be around to service an electric car for that car's lifetime, an existing ecosystem around  F150 accessories, high margins on the high-end optioned trucks, an existing dealer repair network in place so not need to tow a car far to get fixed, factories that can already build at scale, and a little bit of customer loyalty.

Good luck to those in the game."
2021-06-25 10:24:35,wallstreetbets,F's in the chat I guess
2021-06-25 10:39:37,wallstreetbets,there's a lot of potential catalysts.  ev hype.  good fundamentals etc.  It's  a very good bet but im a huge ford bull so take it as you will.  I have a fuck ton of ford calls so obv im bias.  I'd rather bet on toyota or something but they aren't doing shit with ev yet and have a much bigger market cap.  Ford has a lot of room to grow imo
2021-06-25 10:41:45,wallstreetbets,I made a 100 percent gain from ford and then took my gains to make calls for this year ranging from 16 sp in the new few months to 22 sp by march next year.  I'm very bullish but am a little afraid my timing is wrong and it might be until 2022 till we see these big gains.  Regardless with the f150 l coming out next year it seems like a good time to make a bet with all the hype
2021-06-25 10:37:06,wallstreetbets,tesla is risky af now with all the competition.  gl tho man.  im on team FORD with it's measily 50 mil market cap and top selling F-150.  I wouldn't short tesla but im way too scared to touch that shit

2021-06-24 21:30:25,wallstreetbets,"TLRY cant operate in the US and has no clear path though. 

Top tier MSOs are the way to go: TCNNF, CURLF, CRLBF, GTBIF, and VRNOF are all years ahead of TLRY or any LP."
2021-06-24 21:35:13,wallstreetbets,MSOs are way bigger and actually profit instead of losing hundreds of millions of dollars every quarter.

2021-06-24 20:29:27,wallstreetbets,Seems like someone shorted ACB üòú
2021-06-24 20:30:54,wallstreetbets,No I don't short stuff because I think its a shit concept. I was an ACB holder for a long time and they continously diluted shareholders until they were forced to do a 12:1 reverse split
2021-06-24 21:34:33,wallstreetbets,"No, not high risk.Cannabis will be bigger then Amazon and Microsoft together.Only 15 % of the world has legalized it so far.Hemp is the strongest material beside steel.Every item will be made of hemp.Roads houses furniture cars.
Cannabis cures dementia Alzheimer anxiety pain etc.
As soon as these old white rich asswipes in the government die we going to da üåô"
2021-06-24 21:32:47,wallstreetbets,"Ya, they lost a lot. TLRY lost $361M and pay their CEO the most in the business. Neither are good to capture the giant US market.

MSOs are the way to go!"
2021-06-25 06:47:38,wallstreetbets,They started the movement to legalize it in the 60s. Yeah. That long. Till it‚Äôs legalized federally my comment still stands. Even when it is legalized. Canadian weed will be far behind what is established in the US and what has been around from Mexico for the last 60 years.
2021-06-24 22:51:02,wallstreetbets,"MSOs are good but they can't list on major exchanges and were not able to for the past 4 years as legalization progressed, due to this Canadian LPs have a first movers advantage globally and can become more established around the world with more growth potential as Cannabis is legalized not just in the U.S but globally."
2021-06-24 23:09:53,wallstreetbets,"But the US is the big market to be in. Its not even close. Canada was a $2.1B compared to $17.5B in the US market and Europe is only forecasted to be around $3.2B by 2025.

Also, some MSOs are international. Curaleaf exports to europe from Emmac making them the largest international cannabis company. They also grew 176% in the last year. Columbia Care also has international operations. Most dont bother because the market outside of the US is tiny and crowded for the size. Also growing very slow right now on a total world market %. So they focus where the money is... The US

You are right though, when MSOs uplist the stock price will sky rocket. Too bad LPs dont have that catalyst.

And like I said, MSOs are profitable or close. Name a large LP that didnt lose hundreds of millions last quarter.

Dont get me wrong. Im long TLRY, but its not for the fundamentals or the company's present opportunity."
2021-06-24 23:17:10,wallstreetbets,"There are several problems with your DD. Curaleaf is not the largest international player. Canadian LPs lose more money because they are GROWING. U.S operators are profitable because they dont scale as much, if you think Curaleaf will be bigger than Tilray you have been lost for the past 4 years of legalization."
2021-06-24 23:18:58,wallstreetbets,You sound more like a bot than a long or maybe you just don't have the understanding on how this all works. Its pretty clear that Tilray is and continues to grow the strongest brand and market share while driving revenue growth and becoming closer to profitability. They will just wind up acquiring some of the U.S players.
2021-06-24 23:31:34,wallstreetbets,"Quit pumping dude. Curaleaf had $260M in sales, they ARE the biggest international company. TLRY isnt even close.

They are the majority owner of Emmac. A UK company who grows in portugal and imports throughout Europe. 

Also LPs are not growing as fast as MSOs. Curaleaf grew 176% compared to about TLRYs 36%. That is the main problem. Low growth and losing tons of money."
2021-06-24 23:34:11,wallstreetbets,Curaleaf isn't the largest international company because it got into Europe a quarter ago. I'm not pumping these are just facts. Enjoy your M.S.Os lol
2021-06-24 23:47:40,wallstreetbets,Sorry I thought being the largest cannabis company by revenue and MC while being international made you the largest international company
2021-06-24 23:49:50,wallstreetbets,"In terms of infrastructure, no. In terms of revenue you are right that Cura is making the most revenue currently."
2021-06-25 00:03:53,wallstreetbets,"Cura has way more infrastructure. TLRY is shutting infrastructure down because they cant sell enough weed. Cura is agressively expanding and is guided for revenue of $300M this quarter. 

You are funny üòÜüòÜüòÜ

Good luck with the pumping activities"
2021-06-25 00:05:41,wallstreetbets,They are doing it to consolidate costs and narrow losses which is what any smart business should be doing. Most Canadian LPs over expanded because Canada and U.S were slow to legalize and regulate this industry correctly. I love their plan going forward personally and Irwin Simon has been able to reflect these results several times.
2021-06-25 00:19:49,wallstreetbets,Companies not over extending and making shareholders pay would be even better IMO
2021-06-25 00:20:25,wallstreetbets,Isn't it obvious that that is what they are doing?
2021-06-25 00:21:08,wallstreetbets,Irwin Simon is a financially responsible CEO and did a great job at Aphria and Hains. I trust him.
2021-06-25 00:50:33,wallstreetbets,"Ya, it is obvious they overextended and made shareholders pay. Hopefully that is behind them. Doesnt mean its good or they have more infrastructure."
2021-06-25 10:16:11,wallstreetbets,Because GME is so much better and not a pump and dump.

I've been loading up on TSLA since 2018. Until 2021, it's been doing great. I make a few bucks selling far-OTM short term call options against the shares I have, but conservatively selling call options doesn't bring in a lot of $.   


Hopefully TSLA wakes up again and starts moving north.   I hope to see you enjoy a good hot cup of coffee.  If you have never had it, you might not like it. But, if you do have your first cup this week, make sure it is good coffee and not fast-food or gas-station coffee."

And it isn't addictive, it isn't tolerance building, I doesn't cause withdrawal when you quit, and there no rebound insomnia.

Unfortunately the asshats from insurance won't cover it unless the far stronger far more dangerous and impossible to use long term ambien and sonata fail.  It's stupid, they're making me take stronger more dangerous medication that can't be used long term just so I can get a weaker safer medication.

One the one hand  
You are asking me to put in effort when the information was readily available and would have taken you less effort to click through than you put in to responding to my comment. If you don‚Äôt value your time, why should I?

On the other hand  
The TL;DR was easily visible in the post. If you missed it, what reason to I have to believe writing a TL;DR here would lead to a different outcome?

On the third hand  
The analogy breaks down because I only presented two options (and humans only have two hands). But I wanted to bury the tl;dr here to see if you were still reading. It‚Äôs because Joseph Smith claimed God gave the advice to not to drink ‚Äúhot drinks‚Äù but it took almost 100 years until everybody agreed that ‚Äúhot drinks‚Äù meant coffee and tea at any temperature and it was actually a commandment, not just advice."

Let‚Äôs not pretend that sealing to another after your wife dies is the exact same as practicing polygamy. Especially here on Earth. I have no interest in arguing over the crazy shit they teach about the afterlife as I obviously disagree with it and it‚Äôs up for massive debate even in the Mormon community and among Mormon scholars.

Historical authenticity is a connected, but separate conversation than what I was talking about. You can make all sorts of claims about that, but what is the explanation of the book's creation? That's the specific thing I asked you about. You're one attempt to attack a historical fact, that it was ""a bunch of cult members"" looking for status runs into an issue: several of the witnesses left the Church. They got into arguments with Joseph Smith and didn't want anything to do with the Church anymore. It would have been take easy at that point to admit the ruse, right? David Whitmer, no fan of Joseph, made his testimony of the authenticity of the Book of Mormon part of his headstone by his own wish. He was a man in good standing in Missouri who just happens to have disliked the Church and had his headstone read ""The record of the Jews and the record of the Nephites are one. Truth is eternal."" I can't just push that aside.

The shaving commission off the top compounding over time is probably the real reason rich r getting richer. And the military/national maintenance of tax isnt a concern of mine.

Basically, that's what the market price is -- it's a weighted price that the market evaluates based on expected value of everyone's estimates.  There will be people like you buying and then people that don't believe selling -- so the market price is pricing everything in.

What would be compelling would be if you think there's something else that people are missing, which would leave price to go up or down more than what market is pricing in."

Gift/loyalty isn't the boon people thought it would be, and payroll is experiencing its own race to the bottom with companies like Gusto offering it for $30/mo and $5 per employee. SMB capital (aka Cash Advance) is a predatory lending tool that the government will soon be cracking down on. During COVID every processor stopped writing these loans because they aren't secured. If the business closes, the loan doesn't get paid.


Profit margins took a hot over the last decade in processing. Margin compression took the average account from over 100 basis points to about 38 basis points while attrition rates went from 20% to almost 40%. It was looking kind of bleak, tbh. However, the newest trend is called Cash Discount, and essentially it's passing a fee on to the cardholder to use their card, which eliminates the merchant's processing fees. They're set up on a flat rate that's about 200 basis points in margin, and a surcharge/second sales price is automatically calculated at checkout.  Branded gas stations have been doing this for a few years now (dual pricing) and now processors are offering it to SMB retail and e-commerce. It's so lucrative, we had to cap our signing bonuses to $10k per deal for our agents. My company does just over $50 billion in annual processing volume, and nearly half of all new merchant applications are for this program. This program makes processing by far the most lucrative product."

2021-06-25 14:55:57,wallstreetbets,"I mean it's a lot of my opinion.. but I think people tend to be looking at projections thinking ""the stock should only go up from here"". But I feel like projections are just as the name implies, a future looking prediction. They don't go back and say, hmmm this stock got boosted by WSB and is way overvalued.."
2021-06-24 20:59:55,wallstreetbets,100% shook that 1993 was 30 years ago. I old.
2021-06-24 21:01:38,wallstreetbets,"Tl;dr but from my short trading experience, timing the market absolutely btfo time in the market. My retirement account is up some boring two digit percentage after 1.5 years while my gambling account is up over 200% and has only been open for half as long."

2021-06-24 21:40:29,wallstreetbets,"Very interesting analysis‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm one of the lucky that timed the crash in March 2020.   I went all cash in February 2020, planned to short and lost my balls, went all in on the 20th, did a lot of swing trading and made 350% over the next 12 months ‚Ä¶ without significant results from GME or AMC (no balls).  My point of bringing this up isn‚Äôt a humble brag, and although I appreciate your analysis, I think there is a flaw because anyone sitting on the sidelines waiting for a crash is it going to have a different mentality and will not be holding for 30 years. However, since I still love your work, I would really love to see you create an analysis of how a momentum trader would have performed since last March on the most actively traded and talked about stocks of the last 18 months. And maybe to keep it more interesting, have them buying late after it already took off, and then selling before or after the peak is already happened. Basically a demonstration of true momentum traitor."

2021-06-24 23:13:26,wallstreetbets,"This is all good but I made 6000% on some Gme Calls in Jan. We all will forever be chasing the dragon. Great analysis though, jokes/reality aside."
2021-06-25 00:00:03,wallstreetbets,It's hard to fail when dollar cost averaging.
2021-06-25 00:13:16,wallstreetbets,Nice. Will read this later.
2021-06-25 00:15:28,wallstreetbets,"Interestingly, inflation doubled in about 30 years. If an item cost 10k in 1991 it‚Äôll be 20k in 2021."
2021-06-25 00:31:25,wallstreetbets,"Tl;dr time in the market does actually beat timing the market, especially cuz none of us retards will ever time the market correctly"
2021-06-25 02:39:58,wallstreetbets,I went all cash in February 2020. Smart guy. Then I waited too long to get back in. Dumb guy. Ended up being about the same as if I'd stayed invested.
2021-06-25 04:43:35,wallstreetbets,This was cool thanks for all these very easy to understand charts.
2021-06-25 05:34:25,wallstreetbets,"I have a small issue with a part of this.
Specifically this part: ""a. The current returns are calculated by investing at the very bottom of the crashes. It‚Äôs very difficult to identify the bottom of the crash while a crash is happening. You can end up investing midway through the crash and given that you are investing a significant chunk of capital you saved up, it can end up wiping out your portfolio.""

It is obviously better to buy _somewhere_ on the way down than on the peak just before a crash. So while continously putting money in is a _good_ plan, putting some extra money in when you see a dip would probably be a _better_ plan, in the long term.

On the other hand, I weep for you Americans with your day trading rules and your wash sale rules. In Norway, there are tax incentives from sitting on your shares over New Year (so shares you owned from January to December are taxed normally on sale, whether it be loss or profit, while shares you owned from 31st of December to 1st of January get a little bit of reduced tax if you sell with a profit). But there's no minimum or maximum time to own the shares, so I can buy on the dips and sell on the peaks no matter how many hours, days, weeks or months there are between these dips and peaks. As long as the government get their cut in the form of taxes, they're happy for me making money."
2021-06-25 06:10:40,wallstreetbets,"I analyzed every lottery drawing in the USA to see if picking the correct numbers was a good strategy. It turns out it was. 

Winning numbers:  +123987623%
Random numbers -87%
Losing number -100%

So if you‚Äôre going to play the lottery, make sure to pick the winning numbers. Otherwise, don‚Äôt play."
2021-06-25 07:22:57,wallstreetbets,"You forgot one scenario:

Invest at the top, sell on the drop."
2021-06-25 09:13:22,wallstreetbets,I take it all strategies except investing every month assume just keeping the cash from some monthly income until the moment of buying shares. I wonder what the results would be if that money is kept in a deposit with positive interest or relatively safe bonds instead.
2021-06-24 23:53:49,wallstreetbets,Good work
2021-06-24 21:09:25,wallstreetbets,"It also says, selling at the bottom is not a viable strategy."

2021-06-24 21:11:20,wallstreetbets,"My lower back hurts from sitting at a desk all day to the point where my kids rough housing on my back while I lay down actually makes it feel better. My hip hurts from sleeping wrong. But other than physically getting old about everything else is great. There's that saying ""the best time to start investing in yourself is 20 years ago. The next best time is today."" It's true for yourself as well."

2021-06-24 21:33:18,wallstreetbets,"I'm coming up to 30 and if I learned anything from 20-current it's that time flies by. Completely agree with the investment of yourself, it's far too important."
2021-06-25 06:32:16,wallstreetbets,"On the closest data day available to the first of every month I simulated what would happen if you bought $300 worth of SP500 (back then it was sub 300, so the numbers are weird once SP500 breaks $300, but you can buy SPY or other similar ETFs to it to do this nowadays) from 1/4/1965 all the way up until 08/01/2017. I forget exactly why I did this at the time but I assume it was the start of the worst 30 year period that I could find. 

You would have put a total of $189,600, and received 826.67 shares of the original SP500. Which today, would be worth about $3,526,983 as of 06/24/2021.

So yeah, a monthly DCA of $300 into the market for 55 years shows the power of compounding. For reference, if you had $189,600 at the time, and threw it into the SP500, you would end off today with $9,604,137. This comes out to a return of a little over 7% a year. Your max loss over that period would be about -$50K"

If the account is ~140 days old, they are from this new crowd. I got nothing to say about only posting on a singular stock besides maybe they went in with all their money on that stock and can‚Äôt afford the other meme stocks too. 

We both elders of this sub so we truly know what it was like before this whole pumping shit happened. I liked the old days of calling each other retards for taking stupid positions that no one else would ever follow or think was even possible to come out ahead.

2021-06-24 21:37:27,wallstreetbets,I unfortunately have to pretty much agree with you on this. The partnership looks good on paper but I can‚Äôt get excited about Data Robot.
2021-06-25 05:45:20,wallstreetbets,"No, low code/no code is bullshit.

There's a reason programming evolved the way it did. Low code/no code is something managers get excited about, but programming is much more about solving and automating problems than it is about learning programming languages.

The language is just a tool that helps you do that.

Low code is like replacing an entire toolbox with a clawhammer and claiming it simplifies fixing cars. Yeah, i guess you can fix a few problems very easy with a hammer, but at the end of the day, as soon as you encounter a harder problem, those 'hard to use' wrenches will come in very handy.

Back to programming. Low code/no code is great to start projects. They will always show demos with 5-10 users, a basic web/mobile interface, and show how fast it can be done. 

They won't talk about scalebility, in any case. Scale up that app to 1k users? It will get dogshit slow. Add more pages, with additional logic? Well, object oriented was too hard, so prepare to copy paste. And within 2-3 years you will have an unmaintanable mess of idiocracy. Someone specialised in only that low code tool, that you can't easily replace because all coding standards got thrown out of the window."

2021-06-25 00:37:18,wallstreetbets,"That is my thesis, yes.  This stock has twice moved $10 in 4 trading days.  Without index pressure.

I could be wrong, but if any week is going to do it, it‚Äôll be next week."
2021-06-24 21:40:37,wallstreetbets,">It might be designed from scratch but still is designed in a traditional way. Did they reduce 35% parts because its an electric powetrain? Did they reuse more that 25% of parts as EV powertrain makes that possible?

The design is not at all traditional. You haven't seen any of their tech at all have, have you? The drivetrain consists of 4 moving parts - the in-wheel motors themselves.

I'm not positive but I believe they have incorporated most critical systems into the platform, because it is designed for modularity. They are building a van that goes on the same platform, and the have built a military transport prototype that also goes on the same platform. They have even talked about shipping the platforms and bodies separately to the military to allow them to swap out bodies for different mission requirements. That is the height of customization."

Don't you mean that they will start to happen by next friday? Aren't you cutting it pretty damn close by getting those calls expiring on the day of?? I'm just trying to understand your play. Not criticizing. Just seeking information. Mulling everything over and seeing if I'm interested in jumping in."
2021-06-24 22:08:27,wallstreetbets,"What you are saying sounds too good to be true about Lordstown. If they had really reduced and reused parts their starting cost should have been around 35k not 55k. Also what about their ECU's? Are they remotely flashable? Canoo is claiming 50% reduction in ECUs and 75% over the air flashable rate. My general perception is that lordstown lacks the kind of human resources Tesla,canoo and arrival has. But still if you think they are ticking all the boxes then good luck to them."
2021-06-25 01:44:17,wallstreetbets,"The forced purchases will start this Friday and I anticipate through the end of next week.  I think this is a challenging play because once the indexes are done purchasing, there will likely be a lull in buy side volume and result in a decline in the price.  So you have to pick the perfect call expiration date.  Next Friday 7/2 is where my research and analysis has pointed me.  

I paid 32 cents average for my 450 calls, and have averaged down each week,  I was buying them for 4 cents a few days ago.  I had originally purchased them for a buck a piece.  

This could be the most idiotic play of my life, but I‚Äôd rather have tickets to the show than be left out.

Some people call the Russell reconstitution ‚Äúthe greatest show on earth‚Äù in the finance world.  A lot of dollars move around without much thought.  A lot of automated / slow / methodical forced dollar shifting."

I don't know if they're going to use them to short it on the way down after it peaks or if they are just going to short it heavy once the price action starts to move. I imagine it's the latter. This play makes me real nervous. Especially with seeing them grabbing 10mil shorts, they just have them in their pockets ready to use. I wanted to. I wanted to get in. But, idk."

2021-06-25 15:42:46,wallstreetbets,I can't find anyone else out there in internet land talking about this reconstitution $115mil purchase.
2021-06-25 15:28:50,wallstreetbets,"The index inclusion happens today after hours.  Volume is still incredibly low.  I think this will happen today and over the weekend and through next Thursday.

Don‚Äôt pay attention to the shorts here.  They can borrow shares indefinitely.  They only have to cover if they get margin called.  Higher likelihood for a gamma squeeze if it carries high SP through 7/16 where all the big OI is."
2021-06-25 15:26:45,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs challenging because this is a decently new phenomenon with the Russell index this year, as SPACs are getting high valuations and rolled into the index at a higher portion of total assets compared to some others historically that grow up in the index.  

Go look at WKHS from June 20 - July 2 in 2020, granted There‚Äôs also some other stuff at play with that one, but they were rolled into the Russell index last year. 

Other indexes are also not a great proxy. Like Tesla and S&P, because it was such a big deal, it was front run before it was included in the index.  Beaten down small caps with low liquidity have a lot of potential in my mind.  Those people that would have sold have already sold already.  Nothing has changed.  Why would you sell right before production at this stage?  Seems like very little incentive for people to sell right now. 

So this is truly just a crowded trade thesis; however very crowded."
2021-06-25 15:27:14,wallstreetbets,"Look at 7/16.  7/16 options chain is huge.

And has been growing over the last 3 weeks.  Two weeks ago OI for $25 and below on 7/16 was about 20,000.  Now OI for $25 and below is about 100,000"
2021-06-25 15:31:30,wallstreetbets,"Again, I could be wrong here, but my thesis takes me all the way through next Thursday.  I will Re-evaluate after the end of each trading day next week.  I just think this is a crowded trade that could go parabolic"

2021-06-25 15:47:30,wallstreetbets,"Have they gone through the effort of calculating all the funds that track the Russell 2000 assets under management, and then calculate the estimated RIDE portion of the overall market cap weighted index?

My estimate is $75M - $115M.  $97.5M is the number out of my calculator, but have buffer of 20% on both sides in case I‚Äôm wrong.

Also this purchasing could have possibly already been happening.  And this could all come out to be the same next week and I‚Äôm fucked.  But once again.  I believe in my thesis enough to bet pretty fucking heavily on it. 

I also work in finance and have some semblance of an idea of the mechanics and logistics that would need to go down to pull all of this off, and RIDE is just one of 2000 companies that need to be rebalanced.  Passive asset fund managers do not have the bandwidth to pay super close detail to any one given stock.  RIDE is just one of the top 40% of the 2000."
2021-06-25 15:59:58,wallstreetbets,"Actually I put in the order 18 min ago and it's still not filled. If it does start to happen today, guess I'm fucked and missed out. Pretty sus that the order is not filling. Welp. Good luck then. Guess I'm not going to be part of the fun."
2021-06-25 15:56:01,wallstreetbets,"Well I bought a few calls. Nothing too crazy. Just for funzies. I really hope it pays out for everyone. But, like I said. They grabbed 10mil shorts this morning. 10 million. lol. That's not great. Lets see what happens."

2021-06-24 23:46:36,wallstreetbets,"that is because fidelity has an in-house clearing house whereas robinhood and many other brokers uses apex clearing house, the high volatility on gme and other stocks caused apex clearing house to raise the liqiudity requirements. tl;dr robinhood got margin called."

that's more income convo though.  I think there are some key points to consider outside of that:  


* just because you're making money, doesn't mean you're saving money
* I wasn't talking about, nor including, retirement savings.  I'm talking about stock market play money, like the OP has.
* I was admittedly thinking just crossing the threshold into 1% land, so $550k ish

my main point was that I don't think the median 1% is anywhere close to 4mm in a stock market play money account, and instead has more like 200k.  You're welcome to disagree, but if so, provide your sources ;)"

2021-06-24 20:10:28,wallstreetbets,"So I had a whole book typed out in response, but I had bad signal and it didn‚Äôt send sadly. Short of it was:

I should point out I stepped down a position, I was management but even that you‚Äôre talking $50k a year. The catch being if you‚Äôre good with payroll (screw your staff over, under pay, odd scheduling, stagger sales, etc.)  you make 13% of the store sales minus the payroll. I just need to be in a certain area for family and they tricked me into a different location. Stepped back down to be in my original location. 

The pretzel shop down the road keeps trying to hire me for $20 but I‚Äôd just be making pretzels all day and that‚Äôs kinda meh. I like what I do just had higher ups kinda screw me so it set me back a bit.

I do have a ‚Äòfall back‚Äô option of doing day charters back home. You can pull several thousand for a full day charter. But as nice as that sounds it basically means start your morning with explaining why you can‚Äôt wear your dirty shoes on the boat and then quickly turns into dealing with a bunch of drunk idiots running around all over the yacht you currently have fully in motion out at sea and you‚Äôre 100% responsible for everyone‚Äôs life. Not legally actually, you have that covered in the contract for the charter, but as a captain I feel anyone on your boat is your responsibility. Drunken Karen never listens to the crew and it gets as bad as having to separate them into the dinghy and towing them behind the boat because I‚Äôm the captain you‚Äôll listen or go overboard.

CLOV news of expansion is a good sign and CLOV's stock will be attractive to longer term investors. Expansion plans usually entail higher capital costs and this will weigh on CLOV's books. So this might not be good but it is a transitory step to secure CLOV future revenues. As soon as its expansion plans get underway, we should see CLOV price action becoming more stable and move with market norms. Because of meme stock's associated volatility, these investors are well advised to steer clear of CLOV for now. For meme stocks traders and to get this CLOV gamma squeeze and moon shot, we really need to buy and have the volume to crowd out the short sellers. To the would-be paper hands, maybe you are in a cash strapped situation and need the small profits to get by. We understand. To the diamond handed CLOV holders, I'm with you and love the CLOV ARMY.

In other words, there remains a wall between agents and production companies. Writers, actors, directors all rightfully feared that Agencies owning production companies would likely result in something akin to a modern ""studio system,"" where Endeavor would produce a movie written by their clients, directed by a client, with a cast of all clients, and because they are in control they would lowball all the salaries in order to maximize their production profit. The writers fired all their agents two years ago to prevent this, and during the pandemic the writers guild won the battle.

CLOV news of expansion is a good sign and CLOV's stock will be attractive to longer term investors. Expansion plans usually entail higher capital costs and this will weigh on CLOV's books. So this might not be good but it is a transitory step to secure CLOV future revenues. As soon as its expansion plans get underway, we should see CLOV price action becoming more stable and move with market norms. Because of meme stock's associated volatility, these investors are well advised to steer clear of CLOV for now. For meme stocks traders and to get this CLOV gamma squeeze and moon shot, we really need to buy and have the volume to crowd out the short sellers. To the would-be paper hands, maybe you are in a cash strapped situation and need the small profits to get by. We understand. To the diamond handed CLOV holders, I'm with you and love the CLOV ARMY. So bring it!"
2021-06-24 20:02:48,wallstreetbets,"Sure. But as rates rise they have no incentive to refi to a higher rate. 

So it‚Äôs cyclical. Rates rise and refi market contracts. Rates fall and refi expands."
2021-06-24 23:52:23,wallstreetbets,Cheap capital be borrow cost?

2021-06-24 20:54:30,wallstreetbets,Dont forget that the major issue with that credibility is Dan Jarvie.... Not a single fucking mention of him because I do not think he would put his name on the line when talking about a new exploration play.
2021-06-24 21:56:09,wallstreetbets,"You are a fucking clown. 

The names leading Recon Africa have infinitely more respect than Viceroy or Moez or any of the predatory, lying short sellers in business of stealing from the naive. The chairman of Recon Africa is one of the most respected lawyers in the world. 

A middle schooler could have written better research than Viceroy. For starters, they would have known to stick to facts. 

If Viceroy was walking around the Wild West after publishing lies like this, I know what the good guys would do to him."

2021-06-25 15:49:20,wallstreetbets,"Well normally when somebody sees a post like this they downvoted it and move on and maybe leave a rude comment if they're really upset, but you've looked at and commented on multiple replies, which makes me wonder if everything's alright since you seem to care so much about this"
