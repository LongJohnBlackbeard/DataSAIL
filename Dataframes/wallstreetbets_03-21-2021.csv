03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Im here to prepare you that it possibly might not be happening.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Um I can tell you exactly what happened. Starting around the 10th or 15th of January a lot of heavily shorted stocks started to squeeze. GME being most obvious example but it was across the board. As you noted, FIZZ. IRBT, BBBY, GSX etc. By Jan 20th Melvin was already down about -10% on the month and other HFs that were short these “crowded shorts” were hurting as well. They all started slowly deleveraging (selling longs and covering shorts). 

Other hedge funds and quants noticed (whether an actual human noticed or computers noticed doesn’t matter) and started piling into the other side of these trades. Basically all Melvin’s shorts went up and their longs went down. EXPE, LB, PINS, BKNG all were under selling pressure.

They had to keep deleveraging and it turned into a downward spiral, exacerbated by other HFS in crowded names doing the same thing and then OTHER hedge funds piling in to cause a pain trade. That’s how Melvin lost 53%. It wasn’t all GME. Other hedge funds like Maplelane and D1 also got crushed (source: WSJ). 

Basically everyone in this sub thinks Melvin lost -$6B on GME. No, they lost $6B because every trade went against them and that is not something you would expect in your risk models (which assume if your shorts are up then SOME of your longs are going to be up. Or as you said, that IRBT, FIZZ, and GME, 3 completely different companies in different industries, don’t have a high correlation to each other)

Addition:  so while filings now show that they sold these puts in the fourth quarter (correcting myself) at *the time* the street would have been using their 3Q 13F as the best proxy for their short positions hence IRBT, FIZZ, etc coming under pressure. I’d guess that they were still short shares in some if not all of those but don’t know for sure. 
And no, they absolutely didn’t “run the price up” to re short. They got crushed on this."

Suggest that. I dare you."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Cathie morning wood is a true autist. I will follow her into hell
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I began 2 months ago, right before the big correction. this PT makes my tesla buys almost at all time high (averaged down at recent low) the best predicted investment I made so far. so I just pray for my wood to be correct at least once in my life."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Kinda reminds a man how Epstein didnt kill himself.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't know what she's smoking,  but they would really have to have serious revenue to be worth almost 4 TRILLION dollars. Or almost 2x what Apple is worth today.  The Elon fanboys will go on about how they are more then cars, but they are not even the leading company when it comes to home battery systems. Every idea Elon tweets isn't a 100b idea.  They are going to face much more competition in all segments in the future,  and they really need to walk the walk with some serious earnings dollars to be valued that high. Speculation won't get you into a multiple trillion dollar valuation or the most valuable company on the planet.  Revenue has to be there."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"TSLA 4/16 $420 put. One of us is gonna end up wrong. 

Actually 2... you and Cathie the clown 🤡

Edit: keep the downvotes coming and I’ll double down on my position (which is profitable and big time green) on Monday. I know when it’s time to inverse you fools. This sub is so big that it essentially is dumb money now. 

Let that sink in"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This statement scares me but I’ll pray for your soul while you’re in hell 🙏🏻
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Where did money touch you
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"TSLA is such a volatile stock that it doesn't have to be either/or. We can both be right, and we can both be wrong."

This sub is so stupidly bullish on bubble stocks... and I’ve been a member for so long that I know when it’s time to inverse WSB.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,In his no no place.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"True, but imagine betting against Michael burry. So many Tesla shorts been burned that they all capitulated and now it’s time for a fall back to reality. 

I love Tesla as a company but 2000 is calling and they want to remind you that “this isn’t a new paradigm shift”"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,No I’m not that stupid

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro Tesla is just tapping into home energy products. And autonomous taxis. There are plenty of bubbles at the moment, but Tesla isn’t one of them. Good luck with your put. You might luck out of yeilds go up and the entire market crashes though"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think Michael Burry is a one hit wonder, so I have no issues with putting my money against his recommendation. Similarly, you think Cathie Wood is a clown and have no issues putting your money against her recommendation.

Reality is that TSLA is the kind of stock that it can make us both rich even though we are on the opposite sides. So let's just say best of luck to each other and see how it unfolds?"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Have fun being a bag holder 💼
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"😂 he is the GOAT and called the GME squeeze way in advance and said it would crush our markets. 

I’d say he’s about to go 2 for 2 with 2008 and GME ...and you belong here on WSB. 

Post your loss porn."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't have loss to show yet. Besides with only one call expiring this week, it's hardly going to be worthwhile for you to look at it even if it goes down to zero.

In any case, I will reply to your comment and let you know when I sell it."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You need our address to send us invites?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Long time lurker, first time poster.

I found WSB back in 2019, but didn't really start trading until last July. I was able to turn my initial small investment into a decent amount researching and playing around some of the DDs I came across on WSB. I YOLO'd my entire portfolio into $GME in Jan and caught the rocket to Tendie Town. I realized my gains and pulled out $30k for my wedding next year. I convinced my fiancé to put ""Brought to you by r/wallstreetbets"" on out invitations. I'll post an update when we get them printed.

I transferred my portfolio out of Robinhood, cus fuck em. I got caught bag holding $NOK, but sold it all and put that and my BidenBux into $GME once again. Thanks for the wild ride, ready for round 2.

PS: Apes together strong, I like the stock, hang in there, rocket emoji, diamond hand emoji, etc."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Makes me wonder what I could do with $10,000 

At some point"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,So your entire portfolio was $400 which you turned into $45K?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"proof of invitation

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol, we got fucked by NOK"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,DFV getting an invite?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,To even suggest something like that to your fiancé takes balls that are the size of a planet. Waiting for the picture of the invitation lmao
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I dare you to invite us
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Congrats, you sexy ape. Let's get some money for your honeymoon now! 🚀🚀🚀"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,lose it all?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"$400 deposited over a few months to about $6k playing around WSB DDs I researched further($SPCE, $ADMP, $RDHL, $GME). Then YOLO 6k into about 160 shares of $GME early Jan."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bought that $5c leap on sale some time ago, and it’s in the green!  It’s fun watching it move a penny here or there."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"*Used* RH. Transfered my portfolio to Schwab, because fuck Vlad."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Shit. I'd make him a groomsman if he'd accept an invite lol.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Wedding isn't til next year but once we get the invitations printed I'll be sure to post a follow up with pics as proof.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right. I’m not greedy, I just like to gamble. To be honest, once we hit the moon, it’s not like my life will get any better. “Look, I made a million dollars! And...it’s gone”"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,i literally lost $4k on calls this past month. a fucking shame. that’s the second time in a row

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Harder to hold you buffoon.  It's easy to not sell for a loss. It's Harder to not sell for 1000% gain.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Who says we're all not holding 4$ per share? Last I checked, 200 is the new 4"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Easiest part was holding. Hardest part was seeing the dip from 500 and mass price manipulations all the way to $40 back to 350 then massive drop to 172. 

My 150k turned into fucking 12k when it dipped to 40. Fuck me silly side ways upside down."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"No. Not when the prices goes over $400. It takes an enormous amount of balls (or autism) to not sell when up that much money. 

It’s easy to hold at $345/share at the moment."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol just fkn with ya. Congrats on those diamond hands
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I should've posted my purchase history starting at $14 averaging all the way down to roughly $7/share.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Settle down there Dexter. It could drop to $8 and no problem I still doubled my money.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This it’s easy all around right mate?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Respect to you bro...balls of steel...
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah, if I bought for $350, and it went down to $40, and then back to $400, THAT would take enormous balls yo"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,These videos never get old unless you're retarded.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol I have seen this too many times but just noticed when napoleon went they had removed the middle brick. Dirty cheaters.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Who's mugshot?  I googled Gamestop mugshot.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,The dude who opened the door got caught cause he wrote on social media that he opened it. What a dumbass
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you link me the other video so I can close this out.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,In that case they ask for your social.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure am, a nice juicy one. Probably not as juicy as you but I try."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, which is why I specifically said soldiers. Not all soldiers are drones. Many have woken up to what the military is actually all about. So you picked one think to criticize... Seems a lot of bootlickers don't like my comment."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Yes officer that's 555-55-55FU... I dunno, man, I always asked my parents and that's what they told me. You can talk to them if you have Qs.. number is 555-55FU"""
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone grab a shirt from them? I can’t wait for mine 🦍💎🙌
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, thanks guys. Because of you they were able to give us gorillas internet access so that we could join you and dump all our monke coins into GME."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"FYI, we've basically boosted their funding with 5% so far, which is a lot more than it sounds like.

In addition to that, the publicity they've gotten throughout these last weeks is nearly priceless.

Edit: Indeed, compared to [similar](https://www.charitywatch.org/charities/wildlife-conservation-society#top-salaries) or [other](https://www.charitywatch.org/top-charity-salaries) charities, those are low salaries. Sorry for my retardness. And btw, the CEO gets paid $209k and the CAO $122k, not 165k/165k. Also should have mentioned that I'm an europoor, even worse from Italy.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This came up in a thread the other day. Is pretty standard. You’ve got an organisation that is turning over and allocating several million dollars  of donations each year. To ensure that money is well managed and has maximum impact you need the best people running it, so you have to pay, or they’ll go to the private sector

See also https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pallotta_the_way_we_think_about_charity_is_dead_wrong/transcript?language=en"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,160 grand a year is nothing for a CEO
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"In the c level world that is very low.

Some senior devs make 160k+/year. These are top level execs"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It should be competitive with a private company that has a similar budget and number of employees.  A more useful metric is to look at the percentage of the total budget that goes to admin costs - and compare that with similar NGOs.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Managing a non-profit takes more than you realize.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty standard.

But take into account, the CEO probably is working 24 hours around the clock, in a jungle setting, surrounded by wildlife, and a pretty dangerous place.  

Dian Fossey is the lady the movie ""Gorillas in the Mist"" was about, starring Sigourney Weaver, if you haven't seen it, check it out.   Everyone here should watch it, and feel good that their donos went to a great cause. 

Consider that to some other Charity CEOs sitting on their butts in an office or playing golf.  

[Gorillas in the Mist Official Trailer 1988](https://youtu.be/-PPSIwe7sb8)"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I donated directly to the Virunga National park/world heritage site in the Congo. At least with them I know where my money is going. They use the money to support park rangers and their families. From top down the organization is legit, they’ve lost hundreds of rangers in the last few years to poachers. If anyone on earth deserves the hero status it’s the park rangers of Virunga. If you really want to help Gorillas  than do a lil research on Virunga."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It does *seem* high. But this is important work, and these are professional and demanding jobs."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Considering some charities pay themselves Millions $330k is really a drop in the bucket for two people.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"it's just 165k dude, some grads get paid that much in a real company. makes sense a CEO would make that at a charity."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fairly normal. 180+150 gets you there. Need to evaluate other benefits to know full picture,"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I mean if you’re halfway intelligent you’re gonna make money like that. I’m a total retard and make six figures at my day job in a low cost of living area with my GED.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well if a CEO that gets paid more raises alot more money than CEO’s that are willing to get paid lower than its worth it, also even when charities get funded big money those CEO’s still get paid around the same comparatively to non charity CEO roles could easily get paid millions."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Then why is called a charity if they are making 6 figures?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,We got bamboo-zled.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s normal but doesn’t mean anyone who donated didn’t get scammed thinking it would help animals

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wish we could have put stipulations that none of our donated money be used to increase salaries/bonuses of any administrative/executive members, including the CEO.

Edit: I'm not knocking execs getting paid for their job. I'm saying I don't believe our surge of donations should go towards any performance metrics that would lead to bigger bonus/salary payouts. In other words, our random viral act of charity shouldn't be seen as something they did to earn bigger checks at the end of this year."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just for the record, the CEO gets paid $209k and the CAO $122k."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m CEO of my own enterprise and don’t have near that salary. But we are just helping PEOPLE.  haven’t got he resources to help animals yet.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"PUSA barely gets paid that per year.

CEO of the USA sucks for wages.

Edit:  Chill out.  Mid 00s the pay for being President was only like 200K per year.  One of the worst paid Presidencies in the world."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I just randomly went through some comparable NGOs on the charitywatch.org list, seems to be normal or even on lower end. All good, SOLDIER ON, FELLOW APES."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because those same employees could be making $300k to over a million in the private sector. Theyre taking a massive pay cut to work for a nonprofit.

They have immense responsibility, managing millions of dollars and hundreds of employees. You cant put just any dingus in there, it takes education, experience, and intelligence to do the job well.

If you offer $80k/year, you'll get someone with zero experience who just finished their masters. That person will mismanage and have poor outcomes that cost way more than the extra $100k it would take to just pay someone who can do the job well.

(Side note: why do we expect that just bc its a charity, all their employees should be sacrificing everything they have? We hold people who are already making more sacrifices than the vast majority of us to a higher standard than people who literally care only about themselves, like CEOs who earn millions. It's absurd.)"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You want him to get paid the same salary of his employees?

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Psilocybin can be great at treating depression, but Idk how you could make a good business out of it. The whole point of psychedelics is that you can't use them every day, and recurring revenue seems like the best way to make money."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Ya psycadelics make up like 40 percent of my portfolio but it's worth mentioning... The chances of this market actually turning a profit is real low. Mushrooms and LSD are cheap to produce and clinics are expensive to run. For me this is a buy the rumor and sell the news play and the rumor is bullish AF.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,CMPS also has a third granted patent that is not public yet.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,FUCK I WAS GOING TO WAIT FOR GME BEFORE I DUMPED INTO PSYCHS
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol pls it's going to take years before you see any valuable profit
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea it is. Most my portfolio is in psychedelics. I bought GME at 4.85 and just piled that back into psychedelics...
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is a large market that has given up due to the current crappy treatments. This market (Even if one time) is still huge. 

To address the “one time” question further... if you talk to people that did “5 grams in darkness” or read the John Hopkins studies they have benefits that in almost all cases last MONTHs but not for the rest of your life in most of the time. 

Ketamine clinics (different but it is what we have to compare to at this point) data points, while few and far between, suggest perhaps quarterly “trips”. 

Lastly, there are, and I am invested in, companies looking at both microdose and mid-dose psilocybin that would be daily to every few days."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Legal ketamine clinics are profitable today. I know of one with 60% profit margins. 

A key player in this space is telemedicine. Great for scaling and driving down costs. 

CMPS has filed patents for their implementation of telemedicine as well (remote therapist - no clinic)."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Are they also FDA approved to proceed with clinical treatment or is it just a patent?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I was pretty sure most WSB plays have zero profit - and no revenue. ;-)
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean it should be in like 5-10 years but without all the regulations it’s a business that seems like it’ll have the same problems as the weed stocks.  All this clinical stage stuff isn’t profitable really is it?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"They are in phase 2b trials for TRD. I am not sure how that relates to treatment of MDD. 

Are they the “same”? Can a doc prescribe it for MDD “off label”.? Will the TRD depression trials mean you can skip a step for MDD? 

All the above are questions I have."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"2-3 years. Timeline for legalized shrooms and mdma is 2-3 years. We are already seeing laws change in many states and countries.  “Compassionate use” cases in Canada have already been approved. 

Weed is a recreational play. Psychedelics are medicinal. Covid pushed mental health issues to the forefront - this is the solution."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, it looks like I have a little digging to do. If I find anything that helps, I'll send you a link or two with my take."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Closer to 10 I hope.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Company founders are looking at 2-3 for mdma and psilocybin to closely follow.  Could they be optimistic? Sure. Hard to tell. 

CMPS wraps up phase 2b trials later this year and phase 3 by next year. Covid has not impacted these deadlines per their last investors call.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,My wife goes to Target every time she gets the chance and ends up spending AT LEAST $200-300. I can see some truth behind this.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought 4/16 $200c after earnings expecting a rebound....  avg down twice on the big dips.  Now up 30% again with 12 contracts.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha the Karen’s are on the prowl with stimmies
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Target + Shipt.. I’ve spent a lot.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been picking away at TGT. Positions: 20 shares @ $167, 2 $180 7/16 calls, 2 $180 4/16 calls, sold 2 $175 4/9 calls up 150% on Friday .. made a big move and theta will start kicking in so I took profits. Will add shares on any pullback wouldn’t mind getting to 100 shares and selling CCs while getting dividend

I should add: the bull case on this is TGT is positioned well whether there  is massive “reopening” trade or not. They invested a ton in technology and supply chain management and are really competitive with AMZN on shipping and prices are cheaper. People are bullish on “Omni channel retailers” that are successfully selling in store, online/shipping, and “buy online, pick up in store” (BOPUS. Yes, really.) The bull case is that BOPUS is a permanent shift in consume behavior and people like being able to shop online and easily pick up what they’ve ordered by driving to the store, sitting in the parking lot, and have it brought out to them, therefore TGT will be able to steal  more share from AMZN. 
P/E ratio of 21x is also really attractive given their growth. 

Bear case is they didn’t provide 2021 guidance on their last earnings call, and they could be hit with inflation on the cost side. Additionally, reopening could drive consumer spending to other areas like dining out and traveling, as well as up in “luxury” on the apparel side (tons of people haven’t bought work clothes for a year, when they do it probably won’t be from TGT.)"

I have a doctorate in social work, so let's do a little ""DD"" of this situation.

Now, this has to be the hallmark of a true mission based non-profit that has zero scam to it.  They are staying on point, not falling into silly memeing and pandering about getting all of this cash as a money grab, but still acknowledging it and thanking the specialized community that is giving them money.  They researched enough and know what's up.  They respected it and did just enough to stay on point to achieve a honest unison of fun and progress.  
The fund quickly made an ""APES TOGETHER STRONG"" shirt, specialized, with literal diamond hands on the back, but isn't pushing it too hard or making a big deal of it.  Complete and total CLASS.

If we can get a gorilla preservation fund to acknowledge the WSB power, and integrate it into it's mission, who doubts that the squeeze will happen?  Wall Street is f-ed."

This barely mentioned issue is the key to the entire thing. It is inevitable that TSLA's dominance will be eaten away as more EVs enter the market. Applying current market share to future market growth to justify their current valuation is just crazy."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a firm believer in Tesla, the company, my doubts about the stock’s long term performance arise from the fact that Tesla didn’t meet any of the assumptions or conditions that were in Ark Invest’s $800 ($4000 pre-split) PT. Its stock price was mostly inflated by hype and memes, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but hype and memes are historically shown to be fleeting."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is a reason why comparisons are made with peers and not to a random basket of richly valued growth stocks.

Look at the margins of Pinterest, Fiverr, Palantir or Shopify where an extra user generating revenue has very little variable cost to the company, in addition this also requires minimal assets. 

Tesla on the other hand has a significant cost to produce each car, and is much more asset intensive."

More credible players enter the EV market each year and their headstart diminishes."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are you actually comparing Facebook to Tesla?.. Are you really doing this?

Yeah, facebook had to build 20 gigafactories to fuel their growth.. They had to dig up rare metals and produce physical goods to grow that 45% per year.. Or maybe they just had to fake some usage data and clicks on ads.. hmmmm"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Facebook IPO’d in 2012 at a P/E of 91.2 and price to sales of 24

FB also dropped by 50% in the few months immediately after IPO and didn't regain the IPO price until around August 2013, after revenues increased by ~60%. That increase in revenue means both the P/E and P/S ratios were substantially lower 8/2013 than at IPO in 2012. ([Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/268604/annual-revenue-of-facebook/)


> you believe Tesla retains its market share

But it already isn't. Tesla's US market shared dropped from 81% to 69% over the last ~1 year ([per CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/04/business/ford-mustang-mach-e-tesla-market-share/index.html)), nearly all of which is being attributed to the Mustang Mach-E, and that is Ford's first real EV. What happens when everyone else gets their cars out? The same article also says the VW already sells more EVs in Europe than Tesla even though (claim somewhere in comments) VW is an ICE company, not EV.


> argue TSLA is currently undervalued by this metric, even compared to other EV companies

Doesn't this assume that other EV companies (or growth companies in general) are fairly valued? Undervalued compared to something overvalued could still be grossly overvalued. Even at a P/S of 64k, NKLA seems overvalued to me.


As purely a car company, EV or not, Tesla appears overvalued to me. Where I am not sure is whether it is overvalued when considering all of the other possible expansions - robotaxis, insurance, batteries, and so on.
Personally, no positions on Tesla but I'm curious to see where it goes from here."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,the central flaw here is that you are trying to justify cathys price target and not starting with the actual fundamentals and without premature judgement...
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Try arguing why TSLA is worth so much more than say VW or GM. Make a peer comparison and see if your thesis holds up. Or maybe you think VW should be trading at $300
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jesus. 1000 times p/e and still not overvalued. So when the growth stops, will the p/e drop to 50x and maintain the stock price? Investors already priced in things that tesla hasnt developed yet. Its a bubble mate and cathy, with all regret, is a wackjob for thinking it will reach $3000. The thing is,her ark is about to sink mate, she needs all the money she can get to plug the holes. Posting out crap analysis like this tries to convince retail to jump on her ETF or on TSLA,either option is fine with her as long as you buy and maintain the bubble.

Also mate,you cannot expect people still buy a tesla with autopilot, and then still take a ride with uber or others. It contradicts itself.

Also why is everyone assuming that tesla is unique? Why do you think vw or bmw or mercedes cant offer a power wall? Or a solar roof? Or get fucking energy credits?  Tesla's model can be easily replicated by any established automaker. They have the cash,the people and the means to do it. Will they do it? Probably if it is economically viable, but i guess its not really. The problem with early adopting a tech is that better tech appears in the next few years.

Take for example USA vs Eastern european countries. USA invested a lot of money to have the country connected to the internet, they succesfully managed to connect a lot of the country while Eastern european states were still using a rotory phone. Fast forward a few years, and eastern european states start building the network but with the most recent tech at the time,fiber optics. So they got the fastest internet speeds reaching even 1gigabit/s while developed countries like USA havent managed to upgrade users to those high speeds till this day."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,or cathie cannot sell because of her loaded position and wants apes to support her bull thesis
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dont understand the Tesla hype. Tesla made in 2020 the first 721 million in profit, ever. VW made 2020 10 billion and that was half of what they made 2019 (19 billion).

And now all the big auto mobile company's begin to produce EV, hell even Ford wants to go electric. I remember clearly a visit in a BMW factory I had made when I worked for a German university. We made research in light wight fibre construction and had talks with BMW.

So we got a tour of a factory of BMW where they produced the i3. That was, I think 6 years ago, dont quote me on that. I asked one of the engineers if they worried about Tesla. And he said no, because Tesla had not the capacity nor experience to produce enough cars fast enough. And that was what I could observe in the following years. They now produce more cars. But all mayor motor companies now have EV.

I dont say they build bad cars. But I dont think the company is worth the hype. As soon as some of the big car companies get in big in EV they will crush Tesla with volume alone. They dont really have any Technology that others have not. And really I mean that. They are like apple. Good marketing. Hell do you remember the embarrassing reveal of the cyber truck with the unbreakable windows? That seems like the company of an eccentric, not an entrepreneur.

edit: are downvotes based on bad arguments or on the hurt feelings of the majority? :D I take it as a compliment."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Talking about Tesla and nobody even mentions that they aren’t a car company—they are a technology company that happens to sell cars. They also happen to be a vertically integrated, proprietary charged, industry breaking technology company.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,People who dont do their research and listen to the TeslaQ shills that have invaded this sub is going to cause people to stay poor. The Tesla shorts are just trying to keep people away from the stock long enough for them to profit. Meanwhile i am loading up here.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"TSLA's real value is in the development of self-driving AI. The EV branch is a short-term hype that will reach its height ~5 years from now as we hit and begin to realize the physical limits of how much electricity can be produced, stored and delivered with current storage and grid technologies. Unless there is a significant breakthrough in these fields the EV branch is going to come rumbling down and any company that doesn't have anything else going on but producing electric vehicles is going to be gutted and likely go out of business.

10-15 years from now everyone will be driving around in cars powered by emission free clean synthetic fuels, for which the infrastructure to produce, store and deliver these from producer to consumer already exists. In fact, modern ICE's can already accept or be easily modified to accept syn fuels."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, this is a good point and I did make note of the flawed comparison & margin difference in my argument. I included these comparisons because I think it does help to counter the argument that EVs as a whole are in a unique bubble, and because there’s not another profitable EV company that I know of to compare to."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The cars selling price revenue is just a means to an end, razor/razor blade."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s not quite a fair statistic. Yes their market share decreased but the overall market is still in its infancy. Tesla sold 367K cars in 2019 500K cars in 2020. It matters not only their market share is decreasing but also that the overall market is rapidly expanding. And markets for self driving and robo taxis are just getting started
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Plus Elon is fucking dumb
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s a fair point but what do you recommend doing instead? If you compare with other stocks in this market people say the current market is overvalued. If you compare with high growth stocks from historical markets people say it’s not a fair comparison, but EV stocks didn’t exist in other markets. You could argue to compare with existing auto makers but no existing auto maker has 45% annual growth rate or sells insurance, so they aren’t and shouldn’t be priced as growth companies"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just make sure you give yourself enough time, I waited for over 4 years to see any significant return on TSLA, not complaining and not selling any of my shares, just a word of caution."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Very good points, appreciate this response. I definitely agree that it’s possible that Tesla drops in the short term, since as you say the market/EV market as a whole could be temporarily overvalued.

Regarding market share, I guess I should have phrased it as Tesla maintaining its growth in an expanding market, rather than Tesla maintaining its market share as a percentage. Tesla’s market share fell in 2020 but it still sold 100K more cars in 2020 than in 2019. The EV market as a whole is still in its infancy so I think there is room for Tesla to grow even with more players entering the spacs"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"While I mentioned cathy’s price target I didn’t intend to justify it because I didn’t want to focus on Tesla’s business, only on the stock’s fundamentals. I only intended to justify its current price based on forecast growth."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s not a fair comparison because existing auto makers are no longer valued as growth companies. If you think one of those companies can catch up to Tesla as far as production, market share, and battery tech, not to mention autopilot, robotaxis, insurance, etc. Then yeah I’d definitely lean more towards increasing the value of that company as opposed to decreasing the value of Tesla. I don’t think complete market dominance is priced into Tesla right now."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,lightning doesnt strike twice
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not sure why you’re getting downvoted. This was one of the better counter arguments, I thought.

If looking at Tesla as a car company then you’re right that their market share will probably continue to decrease, although this will be partially if not fully offset by growth in the EV market as a whole.

I also think that their moat is bigger in newer parts of their business like insurance and self driving because of their massive data collection. If you look back to Google in the early days, literally any random software engineer in their mom’s basement could have made a competing search engine. But Google did it better, partly because of their data and machine learning techniques. I know it’s not fair to compare Ford with some guy in his basement, but I like where Tesla is in these spaces. The top engineering talent wants to work at Tesla, not Ford. Just like the top engineering talent has continued to go to Google and that’s helped them maintain their advantage"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well said. I like Tesla and all but all the big manufacturers are scaling up in a major way on EV, this has been coming for years now. To value Tesla higher than VW, BMW or Ford who already manufacturer combustion and hybrid engined vehicles worldwide is absurd. It will be as easy for them as clicking their fingers to dominate this market. 

Most of Europe and probably China will be selling only EV’s 2030 onwards, do you think they will all be driving Tesla’s? No way. It will be one of the manufacturers mentioned above or something from one of the other big cats like Toyota, Mercedes, Audi, GM etc. They will saturate the market and the small players will be crushed. 

Tesla will be sadly be little more than a niche EV manufacturer 5-10 years from now."

VWs market is combustion engines which they certainly are a big player in. Them going deep into EV is a good sign but all they weill
be doing is replacing their revenue of conventional engines with the EV market meaning they are growing and shrinking at the same time.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tesla sells insurance as much as any broker sells insurance. They don't underwrite it.

Also, if Tesla sells insurance below market rate, guess what, the market rate will drop for Teslas. It's very easy for other insurance companies to just price match Tesla offers.

Also, maybe it's a hint that literally no auto maker has 45% annual growth rate for long periods of time that MAYBE Tesla won't either. And even if they did, they would cap out at a market value of the other large automakers."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Wrong.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"not necessarily. I am not that deep in this field. But I know that BMW has fully operable self driving trucks in the test phase on the autobahn. I dont think any of the mayor companies would be liable to make themself so dependent on Tesla.

But in Europe it is more a question of law. (And Germans all think they are racers and most look at you as if you where the coming of madness if you suggest not to drive yourself)

Please understand and dont want to shit on a company you like. But maybe all the nice glitter and shine is really not that much of a unicorn you thought it is."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Range is a bad measure for that, since it is easy to improve by making the battery bigger (keep that in mind it gets important). Most EV I know of are made for city usage, where a big range is not necessary and are only good for increasing the price.

But since you mentioned battery technology.

[https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/gallery/tesla-introduces-new-4680-battery-with-claimed-54-percent-overall-range-boost\_2.jpg](https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/gallery/tesla-introduces-new-4680-battery-with-claimed-54-percent-overall-range-boost_2.jpg)

That was the big revolution in Tesla battery technology after 9 years of research. 50% you say! Great!

But wait, what Elon did not say, was the names implied the measurements of the cells. Namely diameter and height. 1865 to 2170 (diameter)(height).

Lets do math. For the 2008 we get a volume of16540 cm\^3 and for the 2017 24245 cm\^3. That is an increase in Volume of 46%. The +50% energy suddenly does not look so good any more does it? In fact I am willing to assume there was no really new development and the slight increase is only the result of the higher volume per area of the bigger battery.

I am no expert in battery technology. But I know that baring any groundbreaking new development the current LiIon batteries are basically as good as it gets. All improvements on the basic technology at this point are incremental.

edit: words are hard"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know what you mean. Do you know how many cars Tesla produced in 2020? 499,550 EV did Tesla produce. VW produced 9,3 million cars.

In fact if you look at the raw production capacity Tesla is not even in the top 20. 

Do you really think that the production from Tesla will suddenly jump up by a factor of roughly 10? It takes about 3 to 5 years to build a new factory and another 1 to 2 years to get it running.

And do you think that all the big motor company's will lay down and say well that was it? BMW is building up capacity for the last 10 years."

And before you know it people get FOMO and also throw their money into the moneyfire.

To be clear, Tesla is not a moneyfire, they're overvalued in my opinion but at least they have a real product, and a business model other than ""Let's give our customers a thing for less money than it costs us to make""."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Even ignoring insurance, I think that restricting its market cap to existing auto makers unfairly discounts other parts of Tesla’s business like self driving, batteries, charging stations, and taxis. Existing auto makers are still significantly behind in these areas.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"On a parallel universe where Tesla belongs to a socialist state all of the money is pooled into the company by force.   Or

Tesla could be worth that money if you break down the company to separate divisions. For instance, today their software is still way above the industry average. They could spin that off as a sub like they could for other core parts of the business and maybe reach $1000 P/e with justification

And why rock the boat when they can continue selling combustion engines for a few more years which they no doubt make much bigger profits from? The next few years will see the proper infrastructure arrive and quicker charging, then the big cats will all pounce on the market.

How are they ahead of other automakers? 

There's no other profitable EV company to compare to because they waited for Tesla to do all the legwork of getting people to buy EVs. Now that Tesla did all the work all they have to do is make an EV. They don't have to spend any money in trying to convince people to buy an EV anymore.

here is a recent article form the Tesla giga factory. In fact it is just a few minutes afar from me at the moment. It does not look as if it will produce in the summer.

In fact I recently read a local newspaper and they to had a question regarding the, still high, construction speed of the Tesla factory.

And the synopsis was the following. Tesla simply did not wait for all the permits. Musk basically said start before all the paperwork was finalised. And so risked all being stopped. As it was when some green made a protest. That one got sorted out though.

But still, if the worst had happened, he would have burned millions of dollars.

My 3 to 5 years remark came from the BMW engineer who worked on the planning of the i3 factory.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, it’s still early days and there’s a lot of risk as a result. I’m not denying that. Tesla is ahead in self driving because they have more data on this than any other company, and it’s not even close. Self driving runs on AI and ML, and AI and ML run on data.

Ford and other companies might sell EVs but I doubt they’re going to beat Tesla at self driving. If you ask the top ML/AI engineering talent where they want to work, nobody is saying Ford. They want to go to Tesla. And if you have the talent then you’ll have the better product. Some might want to go to Google or other big tech instead, and so you have Waymo and now you have Apple talking about making a car. But Waymo and Apple don’t have cars on the road like Tesla does, so they might have the talent but they don’t have the data.

If the next multi trillion big tech company is going to be self driving, robo taxis, or some combination of that - and I’m not denying that it may take years for this to happen - then I think it’s extremely likely that Tesla is that company because they’re the only ones with the talent and the data to do it well."

Tesla is worth more than Ford, Honda, BMW, GM, Daimler, VW and Toyota combined.

In 2017 these companies together produced 44,382,808 cars. Tesla produced 101,312 cars.

Now these are not the newest numbers. But surely you see what I mean? The share price of Tesla clearly does not represent their production of cars.

To get a comparable profit out of their production, Tesla would need to sell their cars for 438 times as much than all the other companies :D

And keep in mind, in the list above we have some of the premium car makers in the world."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m not enough into battery tech to know jack about that but I’ll take your word for it. As I perceive it, Tesla took EVs and made it comparable to an actual regular combustion engine car and that trigged something. I honestly don’t get why mileage wouldn’t matter in Germany, autobahn??  
I’m from Denmark and wouldn’t consider going below 500km. The thing to remember is that anything you do discharge the battery. Need AC? Radio? It all drains. And when I drive my 60ish km for work on a cold December day I really don’t want to drain the entire battery on the way.

I very much doubt it. It's a nice story but it doesn't mean anything. Data is important, but 'more data therefore beter' only works up to a certain level. It won't make up for better models or better sensors (LIDAR ? ).

The rest is all speculation. It's more something you want to be true rather than something there is evidence for being true. Tesla is hardly known for being the best place to work at. Also, at these valuations if you consider stock options it might be better to work at smaller company rather than a company that is arguably already mega overvalued. Your options might turn out worthless."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t think it’s a code issue it’s a hardware issue. Go look at other companies that are using Lidar if you want to see fully autonomous. Tesla is not leading in this area at all. Both methods combined is the way to go.

Its not going to happen and has already been proofed to be a faulty premise. They are great cars and will be competitive but in the context of the valuation of the company I think its important to see the facts as they are, not as Elon or anyone else wants to spin them."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"for the new EV cars like Tesla.

[https://www.auto-motor-und-sport.de/elektroauto/software-update-vw-id-3-id-4-over-the-air/](https://www.auto-motor-und-sport.de/elektroauto/software-update-vw-id-3-id-4-over-the-air/)

sorry the article in German. But it basically says the new update in the summer will come per UMTS-sim or Wlan at home.

And to be fair the article also says how many problems they had with the first version of the software :D"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think that’s where our different perspective collides. I have 2 doggos, 2 Monke kids and a yelling wife to transport to my in-laws while also being able to transport the baby stroller, a trailer (fak I sound old af dude. When did this shit happen?) and none of the EVs that are in our DK price range has the size - apart from the Tesla. What we saw in 2020 and maybe into 2021 was probably transitions of “2nd car” into EV. I’d bet you still have the station wagon needed if you have any sizeable family and a Zoe 😂"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think the EV market in time will look like the combustion market with several large players and Tesla being one of them. EV has just started.  
Tesla do afaik supply the most advanced autonomous driving yet and their update over the air is also something the competitors don’t have. That’s the Tesla is a tech company part. They’ve invested (again, my understanding) into battery technology and has the longest ranged batteries compared to the others. When I look at my family I don’t see much other than Tesla’s model 3 long range that’s in our price range, has the mileage we need and the size to fit my family. I’d love to say the Merc EQC (that thing is fking hot) but I’m not really that wealthy."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s the thing. Flashing updates on live systems (that could kill you on failure) is not something “you just do” but Tesla has had this from the start. That’s one tech aspect where they seem to be (have been) years ahead.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"maybe. BMW has a nice concept here in Germany. They have a cooperation with, I dont know which any more, but a car rental service.

If you buy a BMW EV you get 2 weeks per year a BMW from the rental for free. If you need it for a long haul.

And you only really need it one day for each trip, so it is quite a good prospect I think.

edit: and no it does not sound old ;D"

I bought my first GME shares just before last earnings for like 19 bucks a share. The stock dropped big time and I sold, as the paper handed bitch I am, for a huge loss at 13 bucks a share.

I then bought back in at 21 and actually managed, my paper hands were trained just good enough, to sell at 350. 

I bought back in at 50, sold at 100, bought back at 120 and sold again for 100. That last move cost me 10k and that hurt so I decided to try again and bought for 125 and now my paper hands are tingling..

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets," I already consider my GME investment as lost money, makes holding easy."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Outstanding DD. 🙌🏻

That low cost to borrow is bothersome. I agree - the 🚀 will ignite with a catalyst. Holding has made the fuse real short, but positive news is what will ignite the engine to send us out of orbit. In Jan, our test flight was helped by high borrow fees (over 30%). 

What do you make of why borrow rates are so low currently? It seems to me they reflect a low “on the books” number of shares shorted, and with a rate so low, provide little incentive for shorts to cover.  The smoothness of my brain makes it hard for me to see how shorts would be compelled to cover, unless the borrow rate increases, e,g., in response to increased buying and share price acceleration. However, that didn’t seem to happen in this run-up. Any sense of what’s going on? 

Edit: 
To add for those who may be unaware, iBorrowDesk uses publicly available data provided by IBKR (e.g., see, https://iborrowdesk.com/about). 

I hope I don’t have to remind my fellow apes where IBKR stands when it comes to GME shorts versus longs. If you want to know if IBKR is still cynical on GME, I recommend a review of their explanation as to why they blocked the opening of new positions of GME back in January (e.g., see, https://ibkr.info/article/3764).

I surmise that what is advertised as lendable on iBorrowDesk is what IBKR offers to its retail clients. I imagine availability (and borrow terms, such as rate) is vastly different for commercial clients. I recommend finding other, reliable sources for estimated short position availability."

Just a reminder that there hasn't been a Gamestop news catalyst in a while and this week is the next confirmed date for more. Catalysts drive volume which drives price.

Last 2 big news catalysts?

**3/8** - [Gamestop governance update](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-provides-corporate-governance-update) announcing a new board for the e-commerce transition led by Ryan Cohen. This was announced pre-market.

**2/23** - [Gamestop announces resignation of CFO](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-resignation-cfo-and-succession-plan-support) and succession plan. This was announced post-market.

**3/23** [Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2020-earnings)

Following that announcement we can expect to hear about a replacement for their CFO, the *possibility* that Ryan Cohen may be taking a new role within Gamestop, and with the end of the pre-earnings blackout period Gamestop will be free to announce any transition initiatives moving forward.

*A note on earnings:* **Gamestop's fiscal year runs through January**. So the Q4 report will include holiday sales, the console release, increased offerings of PC parts, and any additional sales driven through Jan from suddenly getting a ton of free press and consumer goodwill."

Why would it effect the stock at all right now? I get why something like appointing Cohen to CEO would do it, but I don’t get why new announcements would. Maybe ape brain too smooth"

Dude. Look at your own charts. And then tell me what the fuck you’re talking about. 
Going from $40 to $500 and a stock with a 50M float trading 100M shares a day isn’t a “rapid increase in price and volume”? 

You can think there’s still a squeeze to be squoze but it’s fucking idiotic to say January wasn’t a short squeeze. “Violent uptick” - check.
No clue how you randomly and unilaterally decided $40 to $500 in 4 days doesn’t qualify as a violent uptick in price and volume.

Oh and saying the “apes” that came up with 900% short interest did some damn “good DD”makes everything else you say questionable. That “DD” was stupid AF."

I almost couldn't believe how the price recovered Friday. I was like how long can this shit keep going on? The price fell again somewhat by the end of the day but not to the point of losing money (for me anyway) when during the dip I was down like $30. Obviously I have very little money actually invested, not much to play with. But some weird shit has to be going on, the daily fluctuations are insane."

And if William Blair is a market maker, then it's not buying or selling the security for themselves either. They only hold the stock to facilitate the transaction for others.

There are conflicts of interest in sell-side research, but usually it's when the same bank supports an IPO or direct listing. But in this case, two of the banks you mentioned have opposing recommendations despite this.

> [Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse Group AG and Goldman Sachs & Co were the lead banks advising Palantir on its listing.](https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2020-09-30/palantir-opens-up-38-in-new-york-debut-valuation-at-nearly-22-billion)

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You know also what is an inverse? Insanity! Inverse(Sanity) = Insanity. Literally all these lunatics that manipulate people by inverting their logic has fucked up the world.  I have a feeling that a lot of shit the people see is actually inverting and symbolism.

&#x200B;

E.g., the Green new deal is really about $$$. They can't come out and talk about making trillions so they call it Green. People in the know understand it but outsiders think it means something entirely different. Global climate change is really talking about money and has nothing to do with weather climate but it then takes a life of it's own. Carbon tax has to do with $$$ tax. Essentially everything these politicians talk about is actually about money but they disguise their language and invert shit to communicate to their cohorts. The people on the outside take it literally but it really, inversely, is just a figment of their imagination... that sometimes becomes self-fulfilling.

&#x200B;

Basically since wiretapping has gotten so easy people can't ever say what they really are saying so they come up with these different terms and insiders know exactly what is going on and outsiders don't. It works EXACTLY like inversing. E.g., with global climate change, they are talking about the global climate of money. A green new deal is a deal to get more green in to the pockets of the democrat's. (notice it's a \*deal\* just as in a business deal) It's anti-republican since most rich people are republicans and don't want to lose their green. I'm not saying that there isn't more to it, just saying that there is a lot of sub-surface shit that goes on that almost everyone is oblivious to.  Very similar to how analysts straight up inverse logic(lie) and many people don't realize it. Politicians clearly do the same. It has gotten so out of hand and is taking a life of it's own. (e.g., on one hand you have people that take green new deal as saving the environment and on the other you have people who are talking about getting more money. This creates more hype than it would individually and both can end up becoming self-fulfilling)."

>a global investment banking & **wealth management** firm that is committed to building enduring relationships with our clients. 

Also CS USA & those purchases were made long after their IPO (reported March 1st):

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,my guess is we should start seeing volume pick up and a potential pop sometime before or during the next demo day. (april 14th)
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought 30c for 6/18....might just take the loss and roll em into my October 26c
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,How is it expensive? It's at a big dip... 🤔
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I made sure to include enough pictures for you illiterate apes
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's not always how it works because most of the time research has its own view which it then informs the brokers/dealers/etc. Both research and the brokers will talk to clients on their views and it's up to the clients to decide if they want to buy and sell. Of course if a stock is rated Underweight, CS or anyone can't pitch to the clients as a long idea. They also wouldn't publish $20 and tell their clients that it's actually $30 we're only putting $20 to help you out. The only time when things may conflict with each other is IPO research because obviously you can't have research Underweight while the IBD is trying to put a Buy on it - but people do their best to maintain some form of objectivity and independence."

Doing business with a trillion dollar company doesn't make you more profit than doing business with a billion dollar company.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It has been Brad covering the stock for the most part. Maybe they transferred coverage to Chew on the same day I'm not sure but it's possible. Chew might not have had much input to it. Give the guy until Q1 to see if anything changes.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s a massive number. I have literally 1 percent of your shares.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,... that isn’t what a covered call is? Wtf have I been doing then?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for sharing
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve been selling monthlies and bi weeklies mostly on my shares. How do you manage selling LEAPS? Obviously they don’t expire for a very long time but I’m curious what your close out or roll plan is on those.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't really know options but.... wouldn't you technically loose money if they all went itm? let's say not by a little but buy a lot. I understand that those are COVERED calls, but if pltr went to \~75 jan 2022, wouldn't you technically loose 10$ on each shares?

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Being able to give 30% rev growth of 5 years shows how much confidence leadership has in their product.

I see this type of bear argument a lot, but i dont find it a strong one cuz its very linear and present based. Their TAM is only going to get bigger at faster pace and they have no competitors and wont for at least (my best guess) 5 years from a product quality stand point. 

If you made an argument about their outstanding share count and their stock based compensation, i would understand why you wouldnt want to invest in them, but talking about rev multiples for big data companies is silly. You might as well not buy any tech stocks at all."

They are broadening out and the idea that they wont is factually incorrect."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,🌈🐻
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought PLTR on the IPO date without reddit by doing my own DD. I think the problem is you simply don't understand their product and TAM
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Well you should probably look a little deeper into the company because you clearly don't understand it very well.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait for a little run up in price and sell. IV is so high that if you ever get in the money you can always roll back a few weeks and a few bucks up. I rode my calls from $15 to $45 and never got called
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Aw that’s not what it means. It’s a day the company showcases and pitches what they’re working on and what’s in the pipeline.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm sure you've used the software and are an expert on it.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't need to,  reddit says it's good.  It's tech so it's got to be 100b+"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao that made me laugh. After GME imma split my portfolio 50% AUPH 30% PLTR. Rest cash if the market explodes

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"They still do, whilst letting AMC get a complete free pass for whatever reason.

They constantly shit all over the GMEtards but have nothing to say at AMC who's gonna get diluted for a FIFTH TIME.

I hate being conspiracy... but the fact that AMC gets a complete blind eye to ALL CRITICISM from people bashing GME, when it **absolutely deserves it**, makes me believe they're not actually anti GME but just *trying to* make it look bad. For *whatever reason.*"

On top of the other insiders, Thiel personally dumps like 20 million shares every month onto the fools buying his stock."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,lot of folks here got caught holding the bag on that one. Every day one of them is trying to convince the world that palantir is the future of big data when in reality they are just one fish in the ocean.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"People are just tired of the gme people, they've become obnoxious enough for a lot of people to start rooting against it out of spite. Have you made a trip to their megathread lately? Posting something realistic, yet against the narrative, is like insulting their god.

Not to say amc doesn't have their fair share of zealots, its just not near the scale of gme. Plus theres not a group of jerkoffs running around downvoting everything that isn't amc."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah.. but when you say something about amc they will just say ur a hedgie bot or shill lol pigs will get slaughtered and apes too

Edit: Because nobody knows when the fuck this is going to happen exactly, but by Jan 2022 is somewhat safe
If you can't afford 10k for a Jan 2022 or 2023 Call, then just buy shares. If you're buying weekly calls you're literally gambling, you don't know when the fuck this is going to happen"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean I think it really depends on if you’re trying to scam or if you’re trying to get the squeeze like someone’s not interested in actually waiting on the squeeze like why not buy weekly calls and puts  with this kind of bullshit volatility

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,What about covered 800 calls and sell before they expire?

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The opposition can't stop the squeeze, but they have a lot of power over when it starts.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seriously. The premiums are so juicy right now. Sold 800s early last week for $12. Tho I rolled out, they obviously expired worthless.

I wouldn’t buy GME to sell premium but I’m not passing up the opportunity while I hold the shares with a much lower cost basis."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This man knows what he's doing.  I started selling covered calls.  Premiums are nice at $300-800 strikes. I am too afraid to go lower and missing the moon.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,it has audio
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,no you dont... (not being a jerk)... Dont buy 800 calls if thats how you understand options...
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The contract will continue to increase in value as it goes towards 800, They’re kind of under selling the fact that you don’t have to actually hit 800 to make money on an $800 strike price"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't buy options.  Period.  Unless you've got a six figure position and want a hedge against loss, don't.

Don't be Melvin"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"At expiry, if the stock price is $801, a call with a strike price of $800 does give you the right to buy 100 shares at that price, which you can then sell for market value. Ignoring the premium you paid for the option, you would make $100 if you exercised the option. This would actually be a net loss because the premium paid to buy the contract would have been greater.

Before expiry, options also have extrinsic value, which takes into account the price of the underlying stock, time to expiry, among other things, such that if the price rises and you sell the contract before expiry, you can make more from the premium than you initially paid.

So when you buy out of the money options, the best scenario is that the price approaches or exceeds the strike price long before the option expires and you can sell for a lot of profit."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,thanks earl
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"nope.. Im real...  800 calls dont help the stock moon till they are close enough to force the MM's to hedge... In my humble opinion, these lottery tickets are working heavily against us..."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm dusting a polishing my one stock every weekend. It's my new baby.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,300c means a Call option with a strike price of 300.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Boomer
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"that’s the price (300) they are calling (c) it gets to. Options include buying and selling calls, and also buying and selling puts. You may also see 4/16 or any other date based on the timeframe they chose when they purchased the contract, which is when the option needs to be used by."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,not with that attitude
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea you can gamble on a 3000 percent spread but your likely hood of actually hitting is probably under .5 percent. So lol
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,No they can nab that within a couple months. Likelihood of either is slim. Definitely the dumbest data point for making investment decisions lol
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It's in the name. You're buying the OPTION to buy a stock at its OG price after it's gone to the moon. You're reserving the right to buy it and paying a premium while you wait for it to go up. If it doesn't go up you're out the money of your premium and don't have to buy the stagnant or devalued stock.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Imagine you're buying a contract to buy shares for the price stated in the contract, backed against the price of the stock. So if the price say, goes above $400, and you've got a $400 OTM (out of the money, more confusion I'm not covering) call, as long as the price is above $400 you can buy 100 shares for $400 a piece. Then for example, you don't have to excersize that option, you can turn around and sell it to someone else, so they can excersize it.


Imagine it's just people buying the option to buy 100 shares. If it goes above/below a price, you buy it for the price stated. That's the simplest explanation that made it click for me."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"When you buy shares you're betting a stock is going to go up eventually.  When you buy calls, you're betting a stock goes up to a specific price in a specific time frame.   If you're wrong on calls, you lose your money (or most of it), but if you're right, you make a lot more on an option that you would have on shares in the same time frame."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,They’re pretty simple.  An option is a right to buy 100 shares at whatever the expiration date is.  You pay a premium to buy a call option.  What else do you need explained?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Calls are a contract conferring the right to buy 100 shares at a strike price (K). When you buy a call, you're paying a premium per share for the right to buy 100 shares at the strike price. 

That's just the gist cuz I didn't get into selling calls, but I hope my explanation was ok :D"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,LOL... WTF?

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah i know but he says in a lot of his streams that he is mainly a stock guy who is now dabbling in options . Regardless your point stands about the 800 calls.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly though for someone who can only afford three shares and 800 call that’s rather cheap is probably going to make them more money if it hits and ultimately they’re not putting up enough money for that to actually matter to them losing it Dial remember this is not a group effort here is either individual investors all doing what is best for their individual situation and their loss tolerance y’all just mad that it doesn’t help the squeeze and I’m also mad about that
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Covered calls would be something you'd *sell* and then buy back before they expire. Except if you were selling $800 covered calls, you wouldn't need to buy them back because they would expire worthless."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I get it - it makes sense for you personally but you also have to consider it gives MMs a lot of power to keep the price down. So you're kinda paying your opponent.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't worry, I'm not buying any calls. I'm happy just buying stocks normally. 

I just don't get how they work. From what I understand (Which isn't much), it's like paying for the promise that you'll be able to buy 100 stocks at the strike price, at any point before the end date. The point being not to actually buy the stonks, that'd cost too much, but to sell that right to someone else who could actualize it. 

I just don't see why anyone would pay for a contract to buy 100 shares at a price higher than current trade price, thus I don't see how a call for a strike price higher than the current trading price can be worth anything."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Ban
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I kind of agree with you. I honestly hope for the best but I think GME is only going to drop. Sold off my stock at 280 and I don't regret it. Unfortunately paper handed :(

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"So if you’re holding call options that are now profitable - how do you sell them to someone else to exercise? 

Do trading platforms allow you to sell them easily just as you would selling an actual stock?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Also is it my stupid ape brain speaking but dont the hedge fund hitlers have access to all the call options so they can then manipulate the fuck out of the stock so it does or doesn't hit that mark?

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,So why don’t you go ahead and jot that down on your little notepad ok
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh lawd that's not comparable. 1400 scratchers each have independent chances of success. If you buy 1400 scratchers each with a 1/200 chance to win, my odds of not winning a single one is (199/200)^1400 = .09%, or 99.90% to win $3000 minimum from $1400. Damn right I'm taking that. With stocks you don't get those odds unless that 1/200 is a unique chance across each bet."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,y'all got stimulus money??
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,The difference with that is that you're increasing your odds for each ticket that you buy. But here no matter how much money you put in the odds are the same
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would you spend ALL of your stimulus money on it? Your chances don’t improve past 200.

Is it factually correct? Yes. Is it relevant to the situation? No."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop asking to not get downvoted it’s so bitch-made. Auto downvote anytime someone is that weak.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's the two parts of the price coming into play, the intrinsic and extrinsic value.

The market price has to be above/below the strike price for calls/puts respectivly to make money off of the intrinsic value; ie when the contract has expired and it's either worth the difference in the strike price x100 shares (300c has a strike of 300) if in the money or worth nothing if out of the money.

The extrinsic value is based on time to expiry and volatility of the stock, basically how possible the market deems for it to expire itm. This is why an option for 3 months out is more expensive than an FD expiring tomorrow, and why an option in gamestop is way more expensive now (for a call or even a put, if we're talking the extrinsic value) than it was Jan 1st, because the volatility has skyrocketed.

So if your option's value goes up and you want to exit it, you're better off selling it and not exercising if there's still time to expiry, cause you can charge somebody a premium for the chance that it goes up more"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"With options you're buying a contract, but you're also paying a premium for the time attached to the contract. 

If there's enough time before the expiration then other people may feel that the stock will still go up in value (if it is still trending up) enough for them to make a profit even at its now higher price.

So you buy the option, wait for the stock to spike a couple percent, and the call option contract may go up in value several times as much."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"From what I know, yes. I'm an ape who lives in Canada that has 0 clue how to actually trade them; I've got no options up here with most platforms for small apes. I just know vaguely how they work."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes and no, theoretically everyone has the power to see the volume of the options that day. The small guys just don't have the power to do what hedges can, and keep the prices lower/higher. 

It's not market manipulation per se, but definite Shenanigans."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Calls only help the squeeze if they need to be hedged (covered). They only need to buy shares to cover calls that are about to be ITM. $800 is so far OTM that hedge funds are selling them, taking the money from you, and laughing with their shitty friends about how WSB autists are keeping them liquid through buying $800 calls that are going to expire worthless. If you want to buy calls, they need to be near the current price of the stock."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Calls that expire ITM help the squeeze, calls that expire OTM is just free money for the hedge funds that sold them to put towards the interest that they're paying on their shorts"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry I don't mean to attack personally. I think I'm actually still slightly emotional about that 400 call, I let it expire worthless because I'm retarded.

Real estate and REITs have been on a burner recently.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,i have been in on NLY for years. great stock. Great divs.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,If you go shares the quarterly dividend is .22/share.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I own NLY and I'm definitely long because it's a solid company and pays a nice dividend so I'm getting double growth and dividend while it's cheap.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Definitely putting a bit in those options are too good to pass up!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Those 9$ calls lookin pretty nice
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"A few points to add. I’ve been following this thing since 2012, so I am a bit biased.

This is a great dividend stock

Low volatility is why the calls are so cheap. 

As soon as the price appreciates to a certain value, management will issue more shares if they believe the justification is there, you could get diluted (outright offering, convertible debt etc). Each time they issued, the stock has done well except the last time ( went down and hasn’t recovered to past highs).

If you’re afraid due to real estate and housing, this place made money in 2008 and beyond, a lot! Of money. Not investment advice, unless this thing is a ponzi scheme it’s a well run place ( haven’t updated dd in a few months)

Edit : spelling"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Be careful of cheap options like this because I bought ON semi which was cheap was hell options but lost money because of low IV.  Even as the price moved up the option price barely budged.  Meanwhile the time decay was killing it.  The options chain for this does look cheap AF even for ITM options.  Few cents over current price after premium.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,under $10 and sounds solid. I’m in and I like the stock 👍
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dont like the stock

I used to hold it in the past - but sold

Way it works is essentially earn the spread between long dated and short dated debt

So huge yield curve risk - and historically this has been the case - constant burn down in share price

If you look at total returns, they're not incredible

I do agree that mortgage reits have been hammered - but there are much better picks out there - best imo is BXMT - the Blackstone Mortgage Trust - which could fit your thesis of a recovery play on mreits perfectly"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was looking at the same thing, what caused the price to go from 13 to 9$ 5 years ago was that they announced a hold on the dividends, and around the 6$ mark in 2020 while it was climbing back up they announced that it would be brought back, unless cancelled a couple months down the line I don't see anything stopping this stock from continuing its up trend out of the hole (especially since it was just recently announced)"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"see i literally had the e x a c t same sentiments as you when I read OP's post but the downtrend seemed to have happened because of those delayed dividends. From August 23rd upwards in 2019 it looked to be climbing back up to a positive uptrend before covid knocked it down with everything else. Then continued that uptrend almost immediately, I see a minimum of 12$ in the future. Gonna FOMO a couple hundred that way and let it sit"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,When in the last 5 years did NLY hit $13?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I meant earlier dips from 10.80. If you take a macro look at the price action then the price reached 10 mark multiple times and each time bounced down. It seems that 10 is quite a stable resistance level. The last time it traded stably above 10 is way back in 2009. If wanted to get into this stock I would wait until it bounces down again from 10 and buy at the dip. But that might take a while because I see that the stock likes to trade sideways. ||| Everything here is not financial advice.

My new strat is to daytrade spy mwf bsaed on technicals and then to hold meme stocks overnight to try to rack up some extra percent. Currently im 6 trades in and up to this from 800 three weeks ago. Well see how long my luck contiues. If i get three similar trades to last week this week ill definitely adopt a bunch of gorilla.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because, when you buy calls you are buying basically 100x leverage (100 shares) per contracts. 

So, if he can control 1700 and 3400 shares with such little capital, he makes big returns if his bet works out. However it is literally like putting money on red or black..and I wouldn’t even give him those odds tbh."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for the elementary explanation. I thought that might be the case but I really had no fucking idea.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"> buying basically 100x leverage

Way oversimplified. Delta is close to 1 (i.e. ""100x leverage"") for **deep ITM** contracts, and for **ITM contracts close to expiration**, but not for calls in general.

Also, ""buying basically 100x leverage (100 shares)"" can be (mis?)interpreted as ""buying basically 100 shares,"" which is wrong because (1) it's not 100 and (2) it won't move exactly like ""n shares"" because of theta, vega, and rho.

The closest you'll get to 100x leverage is a synthetic long position (buy ATM call, sell ATM put) with a good amount of time to expiration, as both will have close to 50 delta. You can even establish it for a net credit if the IV is high. Unlike truly buying 100 shares, though, you can lose more than 100x(drop in share price)."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,what a beautiful steady chart wish mine looked like this
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,What is this gradual incline? All I'm used to is sharp rises and dumps.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,My portfolio was looking like this then I got gme and it looks like a heartbeat monitor now

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Often times weekly-monthly. Keeping track of earnings report date makes a difference since I usually want increased premium for increased expected volatility through those weeks. Now and then somebody will throw out an attractive ask in to the market at a random date/strike and I will go out further if it looks tasty.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Should... but shornt

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did get affected, but I also moved in and out of sectors/tickers as best as I could along with the momentum. I used margin for collateral on several occasions. It is possible that the premiums from using margin when down smoothed it out a bit?"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,No contracts at all just a few positions in various stocks throughout my time lurking WSB as well as .75 GME haha. Finally have enough to go in on one contract so I might make a move on one this week possibly. Started with only a little to see what I can turn it into

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah I normally deal with 21dte calls, 10-20% OTM and sell half if/when the underlying jumps 5-7% in the first week (usually makes those calls double in value). Then if that first week goes sour, I have capital set aside to average down and play the bounce on week two. If I’m down after two weeks, I’m usually fucked but at least try to break even (and often fail, expire worthless)"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm bout to drop the F-BOMB aka balls deep
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let me add a little context for Square as a small business owner.

Square caters to smaller retailers. Their included software is extremely easy to customize for the  small businesses who want to run everything through a single terminal.

As an owner of a small regional Cafe chain, I need to run payroll, Merchant services,run inventory reports, quarterly reports, keep track of sales and trends, manage recipes and HACCP, play music for ambiance etc... Square has optional premium tools for more specialized needs but most of my needs were met by the included free options. The whole deal being paid for by a slightly larger payment processing fee ( slightly but also more clear and a better value for low average sales like in cafes and QSR) 

Currently, in order to stay in compliance with music licensing, I need a paid  music service that is commercial free and passes licensing fees on to the rights holders for playing music in a public venue. I could play from my own collection and deal with paying BMI or SCAP the $400 to $2000 per year fee and provide a written record of what had rotation. I could also pay for Pandora Pro, licensed through DMX digital ( my current system ) but this is another piece of hardware and a really crappy UI for $40 a month.

Tidal will offer a number of opportunities for integration right through the Square system. I am currently able to run 70% of my core services through my Square terminal. Our uptime is roughly 99%, so pretty good considering how many tasks were once managed through a dozen separate sign ins with wildly different UI configurations. The amount of time I spend dealing with all of these management tasks has dropped by roughly 25% since integrating into the Square ecosystem. Training staff to use Square is literally 30 minutes and the occasional yell across the cafe for questions and answers 

Now, there are absolutely still a fair number of irritating issues with Square. That said, it was bordering on inducing murderous rage before integrating into Square. Last year, my business partner decided to try a competing product. His management workload increased by about 15% after set up and getting up to speed ( 3 days ) and his cost of services increased by about 10%. he switched back after a few months and bought stock in Square.

Through the 9 years we have used Square in our businesses, we have had 3 customer support tickets opened. Only one was a huge pain in the ass and it was due to a faulty cable on a 5 year old iPad stand.

We have used Square capital as a tool for growth. It is a pretty expensive borrow cost but the ease of use and the instant access to funds made it useful. 

I am very bullish on $SQ and buying the dips. I expect $300 per share by EOY"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Lots of words. Sure some gems in there. A payment company buying Tidal is just like.. DaFaq? To me. Would have made more sense if Twitter bought them. (Twitter should buy CNN) Maybe I’m to old to see how this acquisition works beyond just Jack Dorsey being a star fucker.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m long Sq but that merger makes no sense to me ....
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"N-F-T. Say it with me. Jack Dorsey is going to lead the movement into music streaming and artist compensation with Tidal and Square. Oh yeah and his favorite ecoin. Other functions of the new partnership are novel value propositions compared to current competitors, Re: small business payment portal and built in cafe ambiance. My best guess."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,News industry is hurting hard with the internet stealing viewership like crazy every year. Twitter has something with spaces and should focus on stuff like that but considering since the elections every news cable media is down 40%+ in viewership. CNN isn’t growing and that’s why AT&T is trying to sell it
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"That “block trade” was the NYSE closing auction print. **Happens every day at 16:00:02.**

Typically larger on Fridays, mopex, and triple/quad witching. 45M shares is a lot so it’s possible that there was a very large MOC order in there but it’s not one block, it’s all the closing orders lined up and crossed where supply and demand meet."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Those end of day stock dumps are the accumulation of micro shares, large firms settling their books at the end of the day, etc...

It's activity that already took place throughout the day and the paperwork is catching up.

This happens like multiple times a year to multiple different securities (happened to AMC like two weeks ago), but please do go on about the conspiracy."

I've seen it posted here so much that I've never fully looked into it because I'm pretty sure this kinda bullshit gets posted several times a week and it's always the same answer.

E: And if this is the case and Wanda can still sell 45 million shares and they're voting on adding 500m shares are you still just as bullish? I like the idea of the movies, I bought in at $2 but to think it's worth more then pre covid prices they would have to start giving foot rubs to get the amount of people back in theaters."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Goldman would never pay market rate for a block of shares worth 660M.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This post literally has nothing of value going for it.

Also, you should really care more about what the company's executives are proposing rather than RANDOMLY GUESSING who bought those shares.

Lmao"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Won’t lie I’m surprised that this was done as one order. Usually a block trade of this size would be done through a blockhouse who would use a network of brokers to execute “iceberg orders” to avoid share price volatility. This to me seems like they weren’t sold in the open market but rather through a pre-established agreement with one, single institution, or it would’ve been broken up into separate sales.

Interesting. Who is buying 45 million shares of AMC at this price? Perhaps someone with significant short exposure? Or, more interestingly, someone who’s about to acquire it. Or could just be a broker who is confident the can offload it given the volume and volatility and got paid a solid fee for execution.

My issue with AMC right now is that it’s legit trading above pre-pandemic levels with more shares outstanding now than there were then. So market cap is well above what people thought it was worth before covid and now the business 1) barely has revenue and 2) will likely see a paradigm shift of movie viewing habits even after the pandemic.

This is a super interesting find and well done. How to trade it I’m unsure. It’s a high risk high reward situation."

And if a short hedgie was in contention to buy Wanda shares, they'd have forced and kept AMC shares at the 6 dollars and force Wanda to hand over shares at that price.

It's likely a big banker who sees AMC recovering by reopening all it's theatres. They think of all business to recover, restaurants and theaters will be the first. Airlines and hotels later. Cruises even later. 

Pre Covid AMC operations was  20 dollars in 2018 and 30 dollars in 2016."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,For all we know it could be Warren Buffett. He offloaded a whole bunch off Apple so he could buy Chevron last quarter. Maybe he sees value in AMC. (I’m not a fincnacial advisor)

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Wanda has it's own set of problems and they need to cash out and send money back to China. We should be happy they simply didn't dump their shares in the market.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Id go to the movies twice a week if they offered that
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think it is worth more per share than precovid mainly because both Hollywood studios and AMC both know directly releasing big blockbuster movies on demand has failed and lost a ton of money. Not only are people not as interested to experience the movie in their home but they wait for the price to drop to $4 or $5. Mulan, Dumbo and many other movies all lost over 100 million dollars in a time people were most exposed to the option of purchasing them. The studios need theatres and this is proof more than ever and AMC likely has renegotiated contracts so that they get enough from the door to be profitable. They have been getting screwed for years losing millions of dollars as Hollywood studios were making billions off them. The tables have turned and you already seen it with whatever deal they signed with Warner. This stock is going to be in the high $20 to $30 range by early next year when the progression of earnings profits multiply through out the year"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,True. I trawl these DDs all the time for info and most of the time it’s confirmation bias combined with misunderstanding of how things work. I suppose mods are overwhelmed
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sad state of affairs of what this sub has become tbh.

We used to have legitimate DD presenting bull and bear thesis and catalysts, not this QAnon conspiracy bullshit. We used to have legitimate YOLOs, not these sappy bullshit ""just bought another 2 GME shares! Let's go apes!"". We used to have legitimate strategy talks and play breakdowns with entry/exit strategy, not this ""lmao GAMMA SQUEEZE buy $800Cs!""

GME and AMC seriously need banned for the sake of the sub."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The best DD is DD you do yourself and isn't attached to emotion. 

Read all the DD that gets posted positive and negative and take it into account. You'll get a couple posts like ops that aren't exactly dd but are just there to give you conformation bias. 

Also be willing to listen to both sides and draw your own conclusion."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just wait a few days because if Wanda sold 45 million shares, they must report and file with the SEC.  You'll see it in those Form 4, 13D, 8K etc filings."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"WHAT????

EVEN AFTER THE VOTE YOU STILL BELIEVE THIS IS POSSIBLE?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL it's so egregious what is going on, but if you talk about it you get called a conspiracy lunatic."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have it sub $10 in 2019 but just looking at RH’s jank chart and haven’t done any math on it. 

And agreed likely not a short cover. Most likely a broker getting a good fee for execution. But the acquisition theory is also intriguing. Lots of companies will build a toehold in an equity before announcing a tender. Gives them more leverage and allows them to avoid paying a premium on a chunk of the acquisition."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,i will thx
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I really want whatever you’re smoking. AMC is valued at almost double their ATH market cap currently. They took a 4.59B loss in 2020 and they weren’t profitable before that. You really think this one year is enough to cancel out a loss 5x larger than the market cap of the company in the year prior?

What you’re doing is pure speculation on very very weak evidence. If you can even call it that.

Sounds like you don’t actually have a clue what the financials for this company look like. Have fun in your land of make believe"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I'm a new investor, only started in November, so when I first saw some of these posts I was like wow cool details. 

But now even I can tell that most of these DD posts are 20 something white dudes pulling shit out of their ass to feel like they're succeeding/good at something because they don't actually have any skills. It's getting quite frustrating and I'm very glad I didn't invest in any of the DD I read when I actually believed them."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"No confirmation bias here. In fact, I've been skeptical about AMC's short squeeze because of too many shares out there, dumped by SilverLake, and with Wanda hovering to sell their shares, plus the still sizable debt.

But if a big banker took Wanda's shares off the table at 13.93, then that's a big cloud lifted from AMC's stormy future."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah so you can’t just look at share price dude.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"In 2018 AMC had 1/4 of their current issued shares : https://ycharts.com/companies/AMC/shares_outstanding

The company is currently valued 50% higher than their previous peak market cap in 2017: https://ycharts.com/companies/AMC/market_cap"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow. Ever heard of market cap? 

This post alone tells me all I need to know about your financial literacy to make a judgement call on your ""DD"""
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Your utter lack of understanding how stock prices work *when the company issues additional shares* is disturbing.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,did i touch a nerve
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure why, but according to some other sources*, it's even worse-- this site says they had ~50m shares outstanding, pre-covid, and now ~450m.

https://www.sharesoutstandinghistory.com/amc/"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Wanda converted their ~50M class B shares to Class A which is technically not dilutive. So pre COVID AMC had 52M class A and 50M class B. Now they have 450M class A. So it’s about 4.5:1 dilution.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,My favorite part of this is all the commission and fees lol
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Those commissions! Worth 23 GMEs!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Atleast you bought back GME shares.

I only sold a couple before it tanked. Walked away with 3500$ish

Since then I've lost almost 1000 on calls. 

No more. Just cemex leaps."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Man - know what’s funny - I hadn’t noticed that until posting.  My lord it added a new level of pain lol.  I have made massive amount of trades last two months though.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn, losing money is expensive."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,GUH
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh - meant to add - I was in a ton of good names in the summer but I was really bad in my expirations.  With the names I traded - would have been far better off just buying and holding.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,If I had December and January to the range - yes - would be green.  If I go back to the summer - story may change.  Full transparency - I bought back my calls - sold another set of CC for decent premium and then sold the shares (I know - that makes me the devil) around 100 - before they dropped to 40 and obviously before they came back to 200.  All in all a bad decision as the CC buy back was about 90k and the sells netted somewhat less.

I am staying out of riskier bets like options and shorts, as I have seen massive losses of members, and it’s scary."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe you should go back to not being active. Sounds cheaper.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You stickied bruh?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,He wanted to pay $5k for the ability to lose $120k. Truly belongs here.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,looks like eTrade. $0 commission shares (except OTC) but $.50 per options contract. Dude probably opened and closed 4600 contracts.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Unlike stocks, buying and selling options contact are not free. It costs 65 cents per contact on etrade. He may also use leverage, which also cost money."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"paying commission is 100% worth it if you have more than 1000$. you know where the broker is making their money, and they'll more than likely keep your interest in mind. if you aren't paying commissions or fees, they're getting the money from SOMEWHERE, you just dont always know."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe because then your orders won't be sold with the flow to shitty internalizers who take the other side of your trade. Maybe.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did you see the timeframe ?  Also - I am almost solely technology investor as that is my backgroud.  I don’t think anyone saying tech is in a bull market right now.  Rising rates/yields have been crushing.

That said - I lost money on a ton of trades this summer when tech was running and gunning.  It’s just options though so even when the underlying moves up - doesn’t mean you automatically make money"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Correct - although I don’t use margin.  Thin price is .40 or .50.  So it adds up when trade total can range from day 1500 to 40k
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depends on the broker. All the retail brokers din’t charge anything for contracts, and not all of them do payment for order flow."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly - which I used to do more often but I actually do more ITM and ATM now.  The “cost” is different between brokerages like E*TRADE and RH - you’re paying for the trade one way or another

At this point it’s looking like that 5k profit will come easy. In fact, I’m looking for at least 420,690 per share on gme and at least 1000 per share on Amc.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah don't see how anyone thought this was real, that area for a tattoo would be RED, ever more red than HF January's losses"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good on you for following through.

On the foot though, that will be gone in a few years. :("
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Gotta love it
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice! I’m getting my tattoo after the MOASS.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Heel?  Weak
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,LOL 🤣
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Ur beautiful
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Glad it’s small, the tattoo artist might be a little re re himself 🤣"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,My friend Bob once started to get a tat too of a horse
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Worst ""capital G"" I have ever seen"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,proud of you ape!!! Pure blood ape is he who keeps his word
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its on their ankle, and no larger than a US quarter."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s dope
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’ll just cover that up, you can’t"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,No
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m gone 💀
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe because it's a fucking tattoo, lmao"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can cover it up, but congrats on holding your end of a bet."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol did u even take profit yet? Or is this just gonna be the 2021 version of a tiger king tattoo
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"When we reach Alpha Centuri I want that bitch colored in. 

All classy like."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, so far as tattoos go, which generally suck and look retarded, this one is pretty good! :D"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Classic Bryce!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,That thing looks like it cost you one AMC$
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha you blame other people for your own actions that’s classic
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy shit that tattoo is awful rofl
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Guess im shorting WSBs ability to discern fake tattoos from real ones.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,When you google going full retard this image comes up.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,That edit was a strange way to plug only fans
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Next time use something better than shitty crayon
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,At least you didnt waste money on quality
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean this in the nicest way possible - That tattoo artist needs a new profession.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Is that your G-string in the background?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice, the GME short squeeze will definitely be in the History books."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,🚀🚀🚀
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The whole bet and calling out was hilarious but the fact how amazingly bad this tattoo turned out to be is just a fucking cherry on top. I love you apes, I love this sub."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,i love how salty he is in the vid
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Hope you waited for the ink to heal before scrubbing the shit out of it. Good way to ruin it even more
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is that the side of your heel?  Should have gone with the soft spot on the ankle, retard."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,That is one of the worst tattoos I’ve ever seen. If I were to get a rocket emoji I’d want it to look good
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,that has to be the cheapest tattoo I have ever seen.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Good job Bryce
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro! I never doubted you, but you can't blame these guys...they are self proclaimed retards and autists."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,How easy is it to get a job as a tattoo artist? holy shit
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Pick poke?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,That location is the most feminist spot possible
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Even your tattoo is retarded.  I’ll admit I thought it was pen too. 

Respek"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Couldn’t you get a shittier tattoo man? It looks like crap
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Drop the soap
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You shorted yourself, son."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idk why people are saying it's fake. It definitely looks like a tattoo to me. In the pic OP linked it literally looks like a newish tattoo. The skin underneath / around the tattoo are red / flushed, the line work is a bit uneven which (to me) indicates a newer / less skilled artist unless they did it purposely. Not to mention in the video even if he wasn't ""scrubbing properly"" ANY ink would smudge a bit if water / rubbing happened."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I remember my first prison tattoo.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Tramp stamp would’ve been nice

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,To the moooon
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmfaooo that thread were everyone was thanking the op for giving them 1 year leaps for $1 puts is so cringe. The fact that they were so wrong is absolutely hilarious.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao 'has a prison tat'
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"On your ankle? That's some weak sauce right there.

We gotta make some rules about tattoos right now.

On your neck or it doesn't count."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This sub is the epitome of the internet.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Was it drawn  by a toddler?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Jesus fucking christ. Could have gotten something that looked half decent. Looks like a meth head gave that to you while blowing some 🌈 🐻.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"There was this Scottish guy once who was on shore leave in Japan, where he wanted a tatoo of our national flower the [thistle](https://www.google.com/search?q=scottish+thistle&rlz=1C1CHBD_enUS939US939&tbm=isch&source=iu&ictx=1&fir=5--_aXykCd4s_M%252CdqoTJBSTAk5yUM%252C_&vet=1&usg=AI4_-kRxpzjzecD_AYDRAgDt-UXO78IlUw&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiFzvWbscLvAhWQQs0KHTdwDjwQ9QF6BAgeEAE&biw=1718&bih=1283#imgrc=5--_aXykCd4s_M).  However, the guy at the tattoo shop didn't speak a word of english, so the Scottish guy drew his best attempt of what it looked like.

The guy ended up with a tattoo of a big pineapple on his arm.  Go figure."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Your honor is maintained sir 🏅
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Aha I've got a tattoo waiting on 6 figure minimum return so here's hoping I get it!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel like you should have gotten the 🌈🐻 instead...
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"People getting tats just for upvotes, super sad"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Jason “The Jet” Terry for a tattoo of the Larry O’Brien trophy before the 2010-11 NBA season. Guess who won the ship that year?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Rocket booster heel. Gotta get one in the other foot to even out propulsion to the moon.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I promised a diamond on my ass if it hits $5000.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn't feel like getting it somewhere visible?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This debt is NOT paid. His exact quote was ""I'll get a GameStop tattoo."" - I petition to reban until debt is paid and a tattoo that says ""GameStop"" is written anywhere on his body. Doesn't specify font, size, location, etc. so use your imagination, but debt is not paid. Some may argue this suffices."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You will forever be known as 

CHIMP- AMONG APES"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow everyone’s gonna see that tattoo on your foot there. How embarrassing.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Would have gotten a much better line if you were getting it done in any jail
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,When GME hits moon i tattoo my shmeckle
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Lucky for this guy it can easily be turned into a penis later.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,If gme hits 500 by may 15th I'll get a tattoo of a ape riding a rocket on my ass cheek. Ban accepted if bail.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hmmm, it's not coming off... Maybe it's a fucking tattoo 😂"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,If GME rockets into the 5 digits I'll get diamonds tattooed on my hands. Also they would be my first tattoos.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro🤦🏻‍♂️I could have tapped a tatoo gun to my dick and did a better job than that if ur gonna represent us at least spend 20$ on the tat
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Amazing
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,How much did they pay you to let them do this to you?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice. On the foot so you're always walking on the moon
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,The normalization of the R word in this sub is so fucking sad.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,That looks like a ball pen ink dripping I don’t think that is a tattoo at all.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"That can’t be a tattoo...It looks like a pen drawling, lol."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Only counts if it's on the forehead... nice work paying up
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol this is not a tattoo. OP is cucked
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,LMFAOAOAOAOAOOO it’s on your foot ain’t no one but you gonna know
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Congratulations, you cucked yourself"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it's real, then please explain why it's so terrible and maybe people will believe you."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Why does it look like complete shit? No points.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Hah. Well played.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I saw some pens for sale that said they were permanent ink.  How do you explain yourself?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re even more of a dumbass to responding to random strangers’ peer pressure my guy. The only thing more lame than not keeping your word about a stupid tattoo is ACTUALLY KEEPING YOUR WORD HOLY SHIT. You were never going to meet these people, they had no way of actually enforcing any punishment on you. So dumb! I hope this tattoo is a daily reminder of how pathetic you are lmao."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,All these tattoos are gonna look really silly once GME crashes back down to reality.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m so weak after seeing the video😂😂😂
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can I get  ""I'm retarded. How dare you"" flair?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Puts on this guy's brother
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,The best part is how clean the spot looks after he washed it lmao
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I was about to ask if part of the bet was that the tattoo had to be especially shitty.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,lol fair enough.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,">looks like it was drawn in pen.

Like an ape would do? Fascinating."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just saw this getting home from wage slavin' and I didn't even doubt it was a tattoo. My first thought was ""Were this man's trades so bad that he was sent to prison for them and got the tattoo there?"""
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,to be fair. how much money was he supposed to spend on a tattoo he def didn't want lol
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,😂 all his loss porn he couldn’t afford a decent tat artist
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I need to know how you verified that this was real - that's the real humour.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's literally red around the lines because it's been tattooed, unlike the result of drawing on yourself with a biro.

he's not wrong ""y'all real retarded"""
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This is actually so fucking funny
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha. This is the funniest fucking thing ever.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,That line work is terrible
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cheaper tattoo, more money for GME I guess."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,LMFAO
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"At first I was thinking it's not such a bad tat, then I zoomed a little."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,How do I mod this guy?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,We call this a scratcher cause it was prolly made by someone who doesn’t know how to draw a circle in a basement of an abandoned house
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"We can give him a break, he probably couldn’t afford a good one because he tried shorting GameStop like a 🌈🐻"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Well yeah. He bought gamestop stock. He can't afford a better one.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It does look like a pen drawing
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s definitely drawn in with a pen. You can see the sharpie ink bleeding and smearing 😂
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s definitely pen. Watch the YouTube vids on how to make ink last for weeks on your body even through multiple showers!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Good bot
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure it’s called a stick and poke you should read up modddddd
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It could be gel pen. We need more proof next month.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Soap wouldn’t easily wash the pen off, make the dude rub it with alcohol of some sort and then we know."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This poor retard couldn’t afford a decent artist to make it, I say ban him again"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,How do we know that this is bryce_hazen's leg?  It looks like someone else's leg to me.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks super fake
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Scruffy seconds this.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao. That tat is horrendous
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You can tell it's a quality shop because it's run out of the best trailer in the whole park.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If anything, this is probably a great example of why you actually go to shops and not that friend who's really good and can do it for way cheaper."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm sure his cell ate is worried about business.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ll second that
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Buddy's tattoo shop probably yolo into GME and no money for quality equipment
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Fr artist is trash
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,If that guys tattoo shop isn't bankrupt in a year OP needs to get another tattoo
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey, that's not nice. Maybe GME puts left him broke."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably should’ve waited till we moon and he can get a tattoo from someone other than his prison roomie.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,the skin on your feet and ankles doesn't really hold well. you need to do thicker bolder lines to avoid this but some people don't give a shit.  It looks exactly like it's supposed to.  You going to pretend a meme tattoo is supposed to be anything but shitty?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh there's way worse lol
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"~~It's fake, though similar looking results can be achieved with a pin, real ink, and time. Like a prision tat.~~

Edit : apparently it is just that bad.  Pardon my assyoume."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s bad because he got it in an area where the skin is too tough and exfoliates too often to actually be tattooed correctly or hold the ink long term, they always look like shit and will likely last 6 weeks tops with excellent care, much less without. Looks like it’s just above his heel on the side of his foot, he found the loophole in this bet."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I mean, that masterpiece is totally going to look like trash if it doesn’t heal properly."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I definitely shook my head at that decision.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah what I don't get is a tattoo needs to stay moisturized and the skin is raw. I'm not saying it's not a tat since he was washing it buuuut... doesn't look like he got it in the last few days.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I highly doubt that he and his kids will have such a sophisticated conversation based on the choices OP made.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"""No son, we changed our destination and landed on Uranus. The moon wasn't high enough."""

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao 😂
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"He won’t have to explain it to his kids, it will be gone in 6 weeks tops, which is also why it looks like shit, he intentionally chose an area of the body that was not meant to be tattooed and does not hold them. Loophole."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I've seen better stick and poke work done with a sharpened staple and pencil lead.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lets show OP some support,  he must have let someone disabled to do this out of pure empathy"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Show feet
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Actually.. That looks like a real tattoo.. Badly done tho.. But to my eyes it looks pretty legit..
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Might want to check again 😂
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Not the best drawing then lol
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m shocked that anyone thought this was an actual tattoo.

Edit: If this is actually real then I will admit I’m an idiot. Honestly it would make this even better, because that drawing is below prison level and knowing OP is going to live with that would be hilarious."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,god bless the mods
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol legit looks like ink pen and just scratched or pressure for the red...
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Why?

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This didn’t age well and it’s only been one fucking hour
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Its real look at his video he just uploaded lol its just a really shitty tattoo.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I get the feeling that crayons are definitely an integral part of this individual's diet
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Eh, like this sub - everyone has their own risk tolerance. If that was a prerequisite there would either be less (fairly harmless) bets and an influx of people just deleting their account if they end up wrong like the chest shitter"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It's fake. Op 100% used a pen
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,ok
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Check the video
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Real tattoo expert here. 😂
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It's not going to be gone. It'll just be more blurry than normal.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yo those are some neat lines for something that small.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The literal CEO of reddit found a way to appreciate the harmless self-depreciating humour of this sub in front of Congress and they seemed fine with it, yet you're still too up your own ass to accept it.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"When we use the 'R word' we're making fun of ourselves and other posters here.  I guarantee you the vast majority of OG posters here would never make fun of someone with real development issues (except for the ones running Citadel and Jim Cramer).

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The ""R word"" has been normal for decades, it's people like you who are trying to change it. This is one of the few subs that isn't a woke-culture-bubble and gives you a peek into how normal people actually talk instead of just the like-minded bubble you've chosen to surround yourself with."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,LOL imagine. Lowkey he's hoarding all his money into GME
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Please show me so next time I don't have to get a tattoo.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Bruh there was blood on the first wipe with the tissue.... looked like a freshie to me

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Zoom in it’s fake.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy gets it.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Zoom in and look at the smudging, especially the part that says GME, as well as the edges which would look sharper in a real tattoo

Edit: ok, it’s real, unbanned them"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"In my defense, back in my punk rock days, I saw *so many* shitty stick & pokes, and often enough they looked not too dissimilar to this when they were first done so I didn't give it a second thought.

Edit: Now I sort of feel like all that time spent in disgusting basements listening to screaming people has been validated."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"My first thought was ""God, that's an awful tattoo, I could probably manage the same with a pen.... wait a minute...""

Edit: I was wrong and I stand corrected!!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm shocked people were so convinced that they actually awarded this guy

Edit: Well hot damn, it's apparently just a shitty tattoo. My apologies for my previous comment"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"He just posted proof, it literally is real"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't think your an idiot my friend.. That stick and poke tat looks like it was done with a toothbrush dipped in a melted chess piece at St. Quentin
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You can see where the gel pen bled 🤣
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's remarkable how you memestock retards all have such backwards ass ""street smarts.""  You're impossibly suspicious and cynical about really basic, mundane stuff (like this tattoo, which anyone with any experience can tell at a glance is real), but you eagerly believe the most insane, idiotic scams and conspiracy theories ever devised.  You're the most naive, clueless people I've ever encountered on the internet, but you think you're outsmarting **everybody**.  It's just incredible...

What a stupid time to be alive!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea I was like wow. Shitty looking tat. Moving on...
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,when the imposter is sus!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Can't you see that this is just pen ink? He lied about getting the tattoo.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, it wasn’t stupid to say that GameStop could’ve flopped during the pandemic. I think the real idiots were the short sellers who didn’t close out their positions when $GME bottomed out around $3 during the crash. That would’ve prevented the squeeze.

I feel like not many people bring up the fact that the short sellers could’ve easily closed out for much cheaper in March, but they wanted to hold till $0. 🤷‍♂️"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"What did you do, Prison Mike?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Well shit.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I gave my opinion and I still think it’s fake. I certainly hope it is.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Nothing ages well in these parts
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Fair enough

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I have no complaints. Mods know best.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"He made it shitty enough you got banned for it, so I think your request was fulfilled."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well I said I was in for the bitch-out, but you did it you crazy sonovabitch. You did it."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,any recommendations on toilet or boiler companies?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly! Gently wash the tattoo with antimicrobial soap and water and be sure to pat dry
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Wooosh
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Im your father but not your dad boy!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah it's pen ink
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"my thoughts exactly, strange that there seems to be very minor inflammation tho (not what you'd expect for a real tattoo) also, why put a fake tattoo on your ankle?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Tat wizard
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well i got a tattoo in ancle at same spot.. Made drunk with poor quality machine n colors.. and it looks exact same quality. . 

I still believe that the tattoo is real.. Even tho there is seeable blood, tho skin is irritated too.. 

Thats legit. Gotta be.. 

No man would be so dumm to try out pencil to make it look real."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I grew up homeless in the gutter punk scene. 

I thought it looked pretty good, at least by the Bic pen and guitar wire standards that I'm accustomed to.  Definitely real."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Well I’m an idiot
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a shill. Ape no fight Ape.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Well. Looks like you're wrong.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry I did not notice that . Good call!

 Definitely ban him!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the part I can't believe. Some of them started shorting it in the $30s, some in the $20s. They had already made at least $15/share. But wanted to hold onto that unlimited risk for the chance at $3 more... And these are the financial elite that run hedge funds 🤣"

LOL!  *Or*, and hang with me here, could it be possible that the hedges **did** do exactly that, because it's the only rational thing that could have happened, and now all your retards are trafficking in complete fantasy?  

All of your conspiracy theories hinge on the idea that hedge funds acted like absolute lunatics, to their own obvious detriment, for absolutely no reason.  Do you *really* think that happened, or is it more likely that all your retarded new internet friends are just blowing smoke up your ass?

This is all so fucking delusionally stupid."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Kinda clever of op to switch ink color for his index card 😂
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"He said you stated it as a fact, and you did."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have tons of tattoos that look like that, and those are my ""*good*"" tattoos.

The rest of them are just blobs in indian ink that used to spell words and form band logos.  

I had a penis tattooed on my bicep between the ages of about 13 and 36, but it wasn't really a problem, because it was so poorly done that nobody would guess that it was supposed to be a dick.  People always thought it was a weird dog thing...and I just let them believe that, rather than explain that it was actually supposed to be a penis.  Finally got it lasered off when I got some real money."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wish I had taken pictures of all of them. Most of my friends got them covered up later in life with professional ink, so they're only in our memories now. Some of them were amazing, one of my favorites was one a friend had on his chest, two narwhals crossing tusks. I might still have a bottle of india ink somewhere that my roommate bought back then because he wanted to use ink ""a step up"" from the Bic standard."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,same
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,At least ur not an idiot with that shitty of a tattoo!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Ape hump ape?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,People that say the ape shit are clearly new here. And should honestly take a retard/autism test.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm glad I'm wrong. This is honestly hilarious.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The reason they did this is because they thought the company would go bankrupt, and shares borrowed don't have to be returned after bankruptcy, so the short sellers get to keep the premiums without buying to return. IIRC there are also tax benefits to having it happen this way. 

This is also the reason many suspect (justifiably so) that there are fraudulent/counterfeit shares floating around, what with the failure to delivers being so consistently high."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds like something 80% of the people in this sub would do (including me).
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow that was quite an unexpected comment. I’m actually opposed to all the conspiracy theories surrounding GameStop because they are ruining the sub. I bought in at $20 and sold at $100 and never looked back. I don’t even look at GameStop anymore.

Obviously they didn’t close the positions in March because we have data showing when the short interest was over 100%. We also witnessed a short squeeze in January. So you just commented based on opinion and not fact. I don’t think anything I said came off as acting like a lunatic either. 

I’m thinking maybe you’re in a bad mood today? 😂"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I still think it fake. They make permanent ink pens. You are only suppose to gently wash the tattoo with antimicrobial soap and water and be sure to pat dry. He would have known that if he had really got a tattoo.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Go online and search for pictures of tattoos. Zoom in and compare his to the real tattoos and you will see it’s fake.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you even finish high school or did you go straight to jail? Go drink your maple syrup.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Nothing can make memestonk retards feel dumb.  The video is just another hedgie trick designed to upset and confuse apes so they sell their precious joke stocks.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got a bunch of coverups on ink that shows when I wear a t-shirt, but I still have a shitload of really insane, terrible tats on my chest and back that I keep for the (blurry) memories.  

I don't even know what most of them were supposed to be and they're all fucked up now that they're really just ungly, nondescript blobs of ink.  

Ah, the good old days - snorting bathtub crank and eating out of bakery dumpsters!  I'm actually pretty happy to be a boring old man these days.  I eat three meals a day now!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Keep up, old chap."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I've gotten tattoos for worse reasons lol. At the very least its a cool memory of history in the making. The 20's have been nutty so far.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know why they do it. That doesn't make it make any more sense though. Like say I short sold $40mil worth at $40. It's now at $3. I've made $37mil. It makes no sense to risk that $37mil plus an unlimited amount further, to maybe make $3mil more.

On top of that, it's like none of them even looked at the balance sheet. At $3, just the company's net cash alone was worth four times that. They were never even close to being at risk of bankruptcy."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,">Obviously they didn’t close the positions in March because we have data showing when the short interest was over 100%. 

LOL!  That's an incredible leap that you're casually making, and that's why this is all a conspiracy theory house of cards.  

You have no idea who's shorting, or at what point, but all of this stupid shit hinges on the idea that giant hedge funds are positioned exactly like they were before this whole scam blew up months ago.  That's in spite of sworn testimony from possibly the biggest player that they're completely closed out (which, of course, you retards believe is just straight perjury, even though it would be trivially easy for Congress to confirm that claim).

You retards are completely irrational, but you're so impressed with yourselves that you can't see what QAnon lunatics you actually are.

It's insanely entertaining, but also infuriating, so my mood is neutral when I read this stupid memestonk shit - the anger and the hilarity cancel each other out."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just mean, for something that is now a permanent part of your body, this looks like absolute shit. I've seen better tattoos at the county jail. I didn't expect OP to be even more retarded than we had all hoped for."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have seen some ideas that maybe the (soon to be former) CFO was involved in the idea to take them to bankruptcy as he had a history of leaving companies with large exit packages as they went bankrupt.

Regardless though, they can't close their positions without making the price explode. If they really did overextend themselves, and it certainly seems like they have, they might have to buy every share back a few times over. Yes, they were greedy at $3 and you make a good point, but their price target was bankruptcy. It doesn't make sense to us but hey"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,it wasn't 3 mil more. if GME goes bankrupt they never have to realize the gains on their position and thus avoid taxes on the other 37 mil as well.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Short selling in general doesn't make sense, unless the fucking market is crashing. Way more upside, way less downside in any long position, and you don't have to pay borrow fees and you aren't responsible for a business going under."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,">they can't close their positions without making the price explode. 

Why do you think they're still involved in memestonks of any variety?  

Wouldn't that be insanely stupid, when there are so many other stocks that aren't subject to this kind of irrational internet retardation?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow, our tax law is even more retarded than this sub. If the stock goes to zero and your cost basis is -$30, how is that not a gain of $30?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You retards just combine words at random, don't you?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Short selling makes sense in a lot of scenarios. If you uncover fraud or something very wrong with a company before the market does, it makes sense to short it.

The inherent problem with short selling is that it's essentially only a tool for the wealthy - which is probably okay if they didn't misuse it. But regular investors don't have the resources to investigate and uncover fraud within companies, don't have the capital to open short positions and/or pay the fees and interest, and don't have a platform to share their findings on. 

Shorting definitely has a necessary role in the markets. Without it, the public markets would be full of fraudulent companies (moreso than it is)."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Not impressive
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"... short sellers have been in gamestop for years

There is an abundance of DD on the subject, I suggest you seek it out"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"How on Earth do you think that a memestonk retard posting in a GME thread has any actual idea of how tax law works in that scenario?

You understand that these are all Reddit ""experts"" who pretend to know what they're talking about just to get attention, right?  

Not the best source for legal *or* financial advice."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Welcome!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea exactly, short selling is basically saying you have inside information. Which of course they abuse by ""bluffing"" they have inside info by shorting in large quantities."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Don’t care. I’m 50 and retired.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL!  I love the idea that kids stopped buying video games at the mall because a hedge fund manager wrote a column explaining the reasoning for the short.

As we all know, teenagers' buying habits are dictated almost entirely by hedge fund newsletters.  LOL!  You people are **soooooo** fucked up."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Doing investigative work and uncovering fraud isn't insider information. It's just being first to find something.

Insider information would be if you were ripped off my a company exec, or someone within the company telling you about an upcoming event.

There has to be a financial incentive in the market to uncover fraud, and shorting is an efficient way to do this.

The problem is people with a lot of money can abuse it. It's not an insider info issue. It's a market manipulation issue."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL!  Nobody needed ""inside information"" to see that Gamestop has been falling on it's face for almost a decade and is poised to die very soon."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have no idea what you're talking about lol... you are making no sense

1) I have 100% of my money in gamestop shares and calls rn. What do you think I'm saying to you?

2) HF newsletters?? I only said ""DD"" lmao. I suggested this because you asked me arbitrary questions that if you're interested in understanding in depth then you should research it on your own, or seek out others' research.

3) Kids aren't the ones buying video games, adults are. And regardless, *who* is buying video games has nothing to do with the short selling situation and possible short squeeze. This situation has been growing for years, that's what I'm trying to tell you"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or maybe the government and IRS can uncover fraud with the huge amount of tax dollars we give them? Shorting is a really inefficient way to do this, because it pays a lot more to just ride the wave up."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow only 10 years to see some gains! Maybe in another 10 the new business model will fail and short sellers will be in the green!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,">I have 100% of my money in gamestop shares and calls rn. What do you think I'm saying to you?

That you are literally retarded and you hate money."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just saw an article earlier that the IRS had attempted to go after a super rich dude but decided it wasn't worth it because he had enough money to put up a solid fight for years to come. They don't want to do any real, hard work so they go after the low hanging fruit."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,">in the green!

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not really, because even when the stock went down to $40 after the January run I was still up by multiples on my investment. I'm now hundreds of thousands of dollars richer.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you pretending now that you didn't edit your post after I replied?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I added words because I didn't know how to respond to whatever the fuck you tried to say. I didn't change my original response at all, I only added to it.

Fuck off and stop trying to cause issues

And here's another edit: Why do you care about gamestop so much? That is literally all you talk about. You're a negative piece of shit and you clearly have some agenda, trying to diminish gamestop to ""memestonk"" constantly. I tried to be helpful until you said dumb shit and asked me to explain the world to you, and now I understand that you weren't asking anything in good faith. Loser"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't be surprised if he's a hedgie here trying to sway us away from our millions.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You didn't understand what I wrote because you don't understand your own argument.  

You're supposed to be mad at Citron for writing a short report that, according to retard legend, somehow hurt Gamestop by encouraging more shorting.  That was a big basis for the idiot populist anger that drove so much of the original scam and continues to string along the extra-slow retards who don't know it's over.

That's retarded, of course, because the only reason the stock was shorted to begin with was because Gamestop was a dying business in a dying industry, but that's the basis for your objection to shorting GME *for years*, whether you understand your position or not.  Gamestop isn't dying because it's shorted, it's shorted because it's dying.

It's fucking hilarious that I have to flesh out your own argument for you, because I know more about it than you do, yet I'm telling you it's completely retarded, and you don't believe me.  Instead, you insist on barely understanding the ""*DD*"" that you read (**totally** misunderstanding what that phrase means in the process), so you have zero context for what it says.

You are retarded as fuck.  Well played.

eta:  And to respond to your edit, I hate you memestock retards because you have almost certainly killed my ability to trade as an amateur with your arrogance, stupidity and naivety, and you're putting the entire market at risk of becoming the next joke stock that internet scammers manipulate retards into...well, I can't use the word without automod removing my post, so let's just say *humping* the stock.

You people are a cancer and I want you gone, so I'll keep talking shit to you until that happens."

once summer rolls around and the focus shifts towards the infrastructure bill and the ""snow in the winter doesn't disprove global warming but a 90 degree day in july absolutely proves it"" crowd starts circle jerking over green everything, nio will probably get at least a spike to bring it closer to your strike if not blowing past it."

Maybe sell on a very good nio day to salvage some money.  Gl to us all.  I hold nio too, shares so I can wait this down turn out."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I still have faith in nio. Already lost 8k so even if it doesnt work out, losing another 2k aint gonna hurt."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly this short term puts on any Chinese investment could always be fraud or gov canceled even baba
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Theres a ton of catalysts coming up too. Delivery numbers every month, q1 and q2 earnings report, confirmation of nio and sinopec deal, and who knows maybe theyll even talk about a releasing a new model in their q2 earnings."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"EV bubble pop was artificially induced by the CCP turdburglars that restricted lithium hydroxide deliveries and sales, so there is no saying how this will go down since Japan has major rare earth metal reserves."

Op basically has to pray to the volatility fairy to rapidly raise the price enough that he can get net positive and sell the contracts, he still has time, but it doesn't look good."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,But these hands are made of diamonds 💎

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"All these EV valuations are further removed from reality than even the mortgage/credit stocks.

How can the entire market recover in 8-10 months when nothing has improved but it took over 2 years when the housing/bank markets burst that bubble?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,How did you know?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I seriously do not get why so many people buy solo calls OTM like this. Yeah it's cheaper? Looks easier to afford? But the theta will absolutely rape you if it doesn't see strong gains. This is why I almost exclusively go into bull spreads (buy 1 low call, sell 1 high call. Same exp.). Yeah sure the profit potential is lower, but it doesn't give a shit about theta for the most part and it's easier to get into ideal strike price zones at reasonable cost. That and with a good setup you can easily setup 100 or more spreads for the price of 10 calls. same risk - your debit."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Tbh he fucked up buying a 90 dollar call on NIO but at least it wasn’t for like end of the month 😂🤷‍♂️ best case scenario at this point is breaking even by summer
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol that is not a healthy way of looking at it. Dont be married to a bad position
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"With stocks like this, he could be up by July.  I give him a 30 % chance of making a profit.  He's pot committed now."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,🤔. What does that even mean?  Brrrr weeklies.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m still pretty bullish on EVs, I hope NIO makes a comeback."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Do they have Rhodium? I know someone looking for some.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh I’m well aware they’re calls and not shares, hence the yolo and exit strategy comments. Still not a loss unless he sells the contract in the red or they expire worthless. I’m curious to see what type of retard he’ll choose to embody."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think i bought it around mid february when nio took a little dip (didnt know it would be a dozen layer dip lmao) And honestly, there was no DD or exit strategy. Hell, idek what DD means. Dunkin donuts maybe ? Their boston cream donuts are amazing. 
And i already lost too much to care about this position so imo its not even worth trying to pick up the pieces. if those contracts are worth 5-6k at some point then maybe i'll sell. But thats a big maybe.
So i either walk out of this carnage with 6k or nothing at all."

If NIO opens at $60 he can sell for a total loss of $2,930 lmao."
2021-03-21 19:48:56,wallstreetbets,"EV Industry: a SPAC fueled & fraud filled bubble So right now the **EV space** is starting to look **very similar** to what **weedstocks** were **in late 2018**. Incredible hype, unprofitable companies, zero sales, fraud and mismanagement of investor funds.

Related to this, a week ago another EV stonk ($RIDE) was being **alleged of fraud** so I think it's time we briefly go through the EV turds you guys have been throwing money at for the past year.

**Disclaimer: This is fanfiction I write at night after I drop off my wife at her boyfriends place. Not financial advice.**

Some  background for the kids who weren't gambling FDs in 2018. Roughly three  years ago, back when your biggest goal in life was to see your middle  school teacher Ms. Wilson's **bare tits**,  the retards here were already YOLOing their Wendy's paychecks and  sending them over the border into Canada. Why Canada? Turns out the **maple syrup sipping beavers**  up there were about to legalize marijuana. Some of the more business  oriented folks tired of freezing their balls off decided to quit their  jobs at Tim Hortons and buy **barns in the middle of nowhere**, setup weed companies and call them cool names like ""Blaze It  Erryday Co"", ""Kush Money Inc"" and ""Aphria Inc"". The empty barns were  publicly listed on the TSX and we were off to the races! Retards like us  bought everything we could get our hands on, **weed was about to make us millionaires**.

Turns out most companies shit themselves after reality set in.

Sales were **disappointing**, low profit margins meant that almost none of the companies were profitable, the **bubble popped** and your boys were left **holding bags** of weed(stonks). Some of these companies are still around, while others are now **lol tier pennystocks**.

I  was originally going to compare the current state of EVs to the dotcom  era internet companies but only the boomers here will remember that ancient stuff  so weedstocks it is. Okay, enough with the history lessons. Here's why I  think 2018 weedstocks are a good comparison to EVs.

* ""New"" industry with incredible growth expectations from investors.
* A ton of public listings by companies in a short period of time.
* Stonks going to the moon
* Strong belief that these companies can actually turn a profit.

Let's move on to **what's hot with the SEC** right now. I'll list some of the EV companies here and tell you why they're terrible. Note: I'm **not touching Chinese EVs**, the CCP will eventually decide which manufacturer they want to install their **spyware** into and declare the winner. Also I'm sorry if I left out the EV fraud you're holding, too bad, I'm about to **blast some ass**. I think you'll quickly see a pattern emerging with these companies.

**Canoo Inc ($GOEV)**

* Listed via SPAC. Not making profit.
* Not  mass producing cars, but has plans to start producing a terrible  looking minivan in 2022. These minivans will be subscription based  revolutionary ""lifestyle experiences"". I need to know what these guys  are smoking.
* The company estimates it will produce 95k cars per year by 2025, lmao.
* **Rating: Lol tier**

**Fisker Inc ($FSR)**

* Listed via SPAC. Not making profit.
* Not mass producing cars, but has plans to start outsourcing production of a decent looking SUV in late 2022.
* They're  strictly using 3rd party manufacturing for their cars and using a  'leasing' type of business model, so customers will pay a monthly fee  instead of a big upfront payment. Foxconn has stated they will be able  to produce up to 250k Fisker cars around 2023. Essentially Fisker is  drawing pictures with crayons and hoping their 3rd parties can deliver.  3rd party manufacturing and business model doesn't sound that terrible, they may have some brain cells.
* **Rating: Crayon tier**

**Nikola Corp ($NKLA)**

* Listed via SPAC. Not making profit.
* Not mass producing cars, but has plans to start producing trucks in late 2023.
* CEO resigned after fraud allegations last year. Investigated by the SEC. Also that fake truck video was hilarious.
* Didn't  find any reliable production estimates. The company is allegedly filled  with fraud, which is why I think this company will never mass produce a  car/truck.
* **Rating: Fraud tier**

**Lordstown Motors Corp ($RIDE)**

* Listed via SPAC. Not making profit.
* Not mass producing cars, but has plans to start producing a nice looking pickup truck in late 2021.
* Allegations of producing fake pre-orders and being years behind of schedule. Investigated by the SEC.
* Aiming for 100k cars per year in 2024, CEO has stated their factory  has potential capacity to produce 600k cars per year.
* **Rating: Fraud tier**

**Lucid Motors ($CCIV)**

* Listing Q2 2021 via SPAC. Not making profit.
* Not mass producing cars, but has plans to start producing a very nice looking sedan in Q2 2021.
* Factory capacity to produce 30k cars per year with plans to increase it to 400k.
* Actually not a complete disaster but production capacity is very low at this point.
* **Rating: ex-TSLA tier**

**Tesla Inc ($TSLA)**

* Did an IPO back when you kids were sucking on your **mommys nipples**. Profitable because they sell billions of regulatory credits.
* Mass produces multiple models and has plans to start producing more models.
* Current capacity over 800k cars per year with upcoming expansions.
* OG memestock. Only EV company that has a **Technoking**.  Incredibly overvalued. Multiple reasons pumping valuation,  Full-Self-Driving & robotaxis being one. Go check the 8.2 beta  videos, that thing is nowhere near autonomous. ""tEsLa iS nOt a CaR  ComPanY"", okay, right.

**In conclusion.**

Almost every single company in the ""purely"" EV space is **losing money**. Most of them **aren't producing anything**. At least a few of them are producing **fraudulent data**. Some of the founders have **terrible track records**,  look at the founders of GOEV, FSR and RIDE. This is 2018 weedstocks all  over again. Most of these companies will go away in the next 5 years as  car companies that actually sell cars begin to shift over to EV. Even  though TSLA is incredibly overvalued it looks like a 10 compared to the  other turds in the industry. Even TSLA will have to compete with Ford  and Volkswagen in the upcoming years but I'm expecting them to survive  and possibly become legit profitable at some point. If you think the EV  stonk your holding is going to moon this year, go look at what happened  with weedstocks after 2018.

Thank you, have a great weekend and good luck next week!

I know a lot of you retards are holding these stonks so I'm prepared to receive my downvotes.

**Related positions:**

Currently  I have no positions on the companies listed above except long dated  TSLA puts. I am however looking into buying puts on the other EV  companies listed above."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The problem with the weed stocks, and any ipo really, is that the valuation of the company is subjective to the times.  The weed stocks were crazy cause you could take 100k and start a company, hire some famous boomers as your ceo (and they know exactly whats coming to them) you hype with some branding and boom your company is valued at 100mm .  You just took 100k and made it 100mil. Now you just have to dump the shares, you pay the ceo and  executive team in shares, everyone dumps 50% and then you merge it with you the company your buddy started who  also dumped 50% .... now you have a 200mm dollar company and all the hype is back up cause mergers mean youre winning."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just a couple things. 
  
GOEV is partnered with Hyundai and develops the platform on which Hyundai’s electric vehicles will be based. They don’t have a profit but they have solid revenue streams+aren’t claiming to be on the brink of a profit, so saying “they are not making profits” doesn’t make sense. 
  
RIDEs factory having a 600k capacity is based on GMs estimates from when they had a factory there. They’re entering a race in 3 weeks, the San Felipe race. I think they’ll miss the start of production and all their targets but I don’t think they’re as bad as you make it out. Especially considering they split off from Workhorse with already patented tech that’s been developed for years. 
  
TSLA is making money on the car but losing money on the building and bringing up of several factories at once. If they were losing money on their cars, there wouldn’t be a push to keep making more cars to meet quotas - they would make more money selling a specific number of cars and just selling credits. 
  
NKLA and FSKR are scams for a while now"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think Lucid has the most upside. Their car and tech is pretty amazing. 

I think they will explode if the first cars don’t catch on fire or have major quality issues. 

I like the fact that they are partnering with an energy company for the charging stations. Tesla had to build their own."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm going to sound like a boomer but...... **GM** is the EV play and **MO** is the weed play going forward.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree 100%. The only seemingly contradictory thing I can add is that Tesla is 1000x smarter bet than any of these car company's because of their nut on the battery supply, eventually they will be the only company that will have a truly autonomous car at a viable price point, and most importantly: the bet on Tesla's solar roof tiles is worth more than the cars. Everybody doesn't need a self driving car. Nearly every house in the world will have solar panels installed if Tesla can finance something that is made out of tempered glass and produce a roof that never has to be replaced. They'll own the roof/house battery market because they already have the tech, hype and trust to finance it. Questions is how long does it take them to get the infrastructure figured out."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"OP has done a good job here. Some basic consumer thinking is needed here wether your talking sales in Chinese, US or European domestic markets. Tesla is the only one of these with some kind of potential. At this moment in time they have established themselves as a brand which you would actually buy into and go and spend your hard earned Tendies on. 

But why the fuck would anyone go and buy a shiny new lordstwonk motors corp EV when you could go down the road to your local Ford, BMW or Honda dealership now or in 2024 and purchase one of their established fully electric vehicles? The numbers all of these manufacturers are quoting for production is a pipe dream which will never happen in a million years, not when the big boys have already crashed the party."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"$GOEV will be $200 in 3 years

The ""Dumb looking minivan"" is going to take over the Rideshare market when every single driver switches from their shitty Prius with tons of overhead to a Canoo with no overhead, unlimited miles and more passenger room. The drivers will be able to make 50% more per hour. How many Rideshare drivers are there in the US you ask?

Uber has 3 million registered drivers and Lyft has 1.4 million in the US alone. Canoo subscription lifestyle vehicle is positioned to service these drivers, as well as gen Z kids who don't want to own a car. 

OP doesn't get the Thesis. Probably a Boomer.


Every other EV is trying to make a futuristic Ev version of a internal combustion car. 

Canoo is going after emerging markets and Transportation as a Service with a vehicle targeted to EAT UBER'S MARKET"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great post. Even more are interesting and bad at the same time. Glad I rode the wave though.

Also spacs had a wild year this year with SLR off the table, but with that reinstated I’m taking a guess that spacs are going back to being seen as sketchy profit opportunities. Probably way less high flying once all this excess capital is reigned in."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,A lot of these EV companies remind me of all those internet start ups from the early 2010s that never delivered products and went bankrupt before products were mass produced or delivered trash. Remember Star Citizen?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"While I'm glad **$FUV**, my favorite EV stock, was not included in your analysis, I'd be remiss if I didn't put it out there as a contrast point. I am not a financial analyst, so I'm no position to say what is or is not a bubble, but as a futurist it is clear to me that Amazon-sized rivers of capital need to change direction now and in the very near future if we are to stave off the worst effects of climate change and environmental disruption -- and the barriers to entry and upside for globe-changing clean energy plays are arguably substantially higher than those typical of weed stocks (no shade - I'm from Eugene). With that said...

**Full disclosure:** As the Company's founder/first investor/chairman/CEO who has been YOLO'ing this one since 2007, I clearly like the stock. **This is not financial advice.**

**Arcimoto, Inc. ($FUV)**

* Listed directly on NASDAQ in September, 2017 immediately after a $20M Tier 2 Reg. A offering (the second pure EV play after Tesla to list on the exchange)
* Launched low-volume production of flagship Fun Utility Vehicle (three wheeled electric motorcycle class) in September, 2019 and currently delivering vehicles to customers. Planning significant increase in production capacity (targeting \~50k units/year capacity) with team of acclaimed industry pros (Munro & Associates and others), in new, larger facility targeting SOP next year.
* Focused on truly affordable ($11,900 target base price in 2024) rightsized vehicle platform (1/4 embodied energy, order of magnitude efficiency improvement over average car) for everyday trips (1-2 people, modest amount of stuff).
* Multiple models based on single scalable platform targeting last-mile delivery, emergency response/security, luxury fun machine, niche verticals, etc.
* Record of capital efficiency: Approximately $42M spent from inception to launch of first production vehicle.
* Rental-first model and plans for least-cost, rightsized autonomy.
* Fun fact: despite the comparators (actually producing and delivering vehicles, track record of public reporting and efficiency, market cap a small fraction of recent SPACs), Arcimoto is one of the most aggressively shorted EV companies in the market as of the most recent public data - nearly 25% of FUV's float is sold short.

P.S. If ya'll ever want a deep dive on how the mechanics of the toxic end of the public markets work (hedge warrant deals/ROFRs, research hit pieces, etc.), I'd be happy to oblige from the CEO perspective."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice! I own long dated tesla puts as well. The whole clean energy/EV thing reminds me of dotcom. People back then were totally right, that the internet had enormous potential. But they just overhyped it by a lot back then. I think tesla will be the Cisco of our time."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Facts!

Vaporware companies making money on hopes and dreams instead of actual productive capacity and absurd valuations

When actual automakers switch to producing electric cars what will they have then?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Although you mention that large automakers will still lead, I don't think you realise how in-proportionate their EV budget is compared to current ICE production and r&d budgets. Alot of the future ev stuff from current car makers are just legacy chassis with a battery added. I think the assistance Hyundai had from canoo and arrival, and mitsubishi who are partnering with an ev start up, shows how far behind some major auto manufacturers are and want to get a head start.

Everything for the major manufacturers is geared for ICE production - assembly lines, component lines, engineers etc and it's going to take a long time to transition. 

It's why I think companies like canoo have a great advantage as they can cut down on years of r and d and crash testing for larger companies. Yes many ev company start ups are trash, but you have to look at the bigger picture with some. I think just basing your judgement on canoo based on how may vehicles they can produce as a yard stick for competency is a tad ignorant. As explained above, they have way more areas to make money than just cars alone

You also did not mention hyliion - in the ultra long distance trucking business, their tech will beat Tesla's semi and any other ev semi hands down."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ikd why the market thinks current automotive manufacturers are just going to sit there and do nothing while all these newcomers try to take over the market

The real winner of the EV revolution will be an established company (or Tesla)."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your opinion on tesla is off the mark imo. They are the obvious market leader in EVs and will be for years, at least in the west, and they have a lot of promise in the chinese market. Plus their self driving is the best, their battery supply is fantastic, and they have a bunch of idiot consumers who will overpay for everything.

I think I'm a little more bullish on lucid than you are. Lucid is playing the long game and actually has a viable production car.

Rivian also seems good so I'd keep an eye on it if they go public.  But they got that amazon money. 

Other than that I think your post is pretty on point. Lots of fraud in the EV space.  Everyone who is in the know about EVs knew Nikola was shit before they were exposed. Hydrogen doesn't make sense for passenger cars and they had 99 projects and nothing to show for it.  They literally made a picture of a truck to troll elon and decided to presell it and idiots bought it.  Fisker is a designer who built a completely useless car and won't even build their new ones, which is fine if you're using slave labor for disposable phones, not so fine when you are building a product that should last for decades with minimal quality issues. Canoo relies in shifting the entire model of car ownership and is years out from sales and will need self driving tech."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I kinda figured anyone buying into the new EV companies were just riding momentum up and selling. I don’t think any of the EV companies besides Tesla and maybe Nio are long term holds. Legacy companies like VW, GM, Toyota, etc. will kill all the new EV companies (except incredibly niche ones) through either taking their market share or buying them."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Great another TeslaQ poster tryna convince people not to invest in Tesla cuz OvErVaLuEd. Look into the actual fundamentals of Tesla. Look into the 160 billion in debt Ford is in. More debt than 3x their market cap....junk credit rating....have to take on even more debt to transition to EV....bad management...Compare this to Tesla growing 50% year over year....zero effective debt...billions in cash to fund 20 more factories multiplying production capacity 20x...that is 20 times the amount of cars it can make now. Listening to this bullshit would have kept me poor.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"First off I am a tesla owner but can fully admit they are built like shit and need a lot of work on small issues . 
As of today Nobody is close to tesla and I look at it as Amazon the first 15 years while everyone was half ass pushing e-commerce but not going full speed and just kept watching Amazon grow and grow .  Eventually a legacy car company ( like Walmart ) will be like shit let’s start buying up everything and put all our resources into EV . Just like Walmart started buying multi e-commerce retailers in the 50-100 million range and consolidating.  One day one of these EV startups will make some progress ( jet.com ) and be sold for an over valued amount while losing money .
Walmart is seeing exponential e-commerce growth but still very very far behind Amazon .

One or two of these EV’s will succeed enough to be bought out and then run to the ground and they will be ages behind tesla"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This reads like a low effort FUD post. I don't doubt there are a lot of bad companies just trying to jump in on the EV hype and it's going to play out vaguely similar to the .com bubble. 

I sincerely believe in Tesla though.  ""tEsLa iS nOt a CaR ComPanY"" is the standard reductionist thinking that no one ever bothers to back up. Let's say the cars can't keep up. They have still been working on software and batteries that other car companies are going to want. Let's say the electric company idea doesn't work out. They still make solar panels, which are going to increase in demand as people want to install them on their homes and conscious consumerism drives demand for green energy. That would be pretty bad compared to the optimism going around, but they won't exactly burn to the ground."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Everything is right here except TSLA. The company literally bought land in Nevada to mine lithium and nickel to advance their batteries. And just as importantly: to reduce cost. That's just 1 of 10 catalysts. Lazy to write the other 9

I realize some are fulfilling niches, but still - there's a serious hope among all of them that none of the existing car companies suddenly comes into view. Or for that matter, they also now need to hope Apple isn't going to suddenly own the market."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude literally everyone investing in this understands that it's speculative. That literally the nature of startups, there was a great DD today about how RIDE was undervalued. If you ignore their incompetent CEO the business is promissing they have a state of the art production facility and their 2021 truck Model looks good. Ya I'm only thinking the company is only hitting $23 dollars a share by year end but from 13 that's a fantastic investment. 

It's easy to hate companies with absurd PE ratio's in an overcompetitive market realitive to current demand. That's not different then anything that could turn long term profit, just look at the psycaledilic industry currently a 60× PE ratio is low in that market rn lol. 

If you want boring company go invest in build a Bear.

Oh and positions or Ban let's see you short Ride at $13 a share when the lowest anaylsis price target is $12 s share for the year. Tesla is the only company worth shorting right now in the EV sector and even then you are a little late on that boat."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't forget to look at Proterra on the hyped up EV front. They compete with BYD (Chinese buses, very poor quality), and New Flyer (American/Canadian buses, long history in transit)."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"All I can see is, Tesla's potential long term outpaces anything that exists in the market. Ford is nearly still trying to walk on crutches, Nikola is a sham, and VW, are you fucking kidding me with that sham-gate bullshit? Competitors? What world are you living in?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I walked past a Lucid showroom this month, car looks amazing"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I've seen a bunch of lucid demos around the neighborhood. Seems to be capturing images for self driving. I think LUCID is going after the high end market.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Lucid gunna survive all this. Might not be tesla level but itll be something. I made this conclusion based off the fact you didnt call it complete dog shit. To earth's stratosphere!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agree with everything except Tesla. I recommend you go watch some Tesla daily videos if you are interested in actual research and not Reddit DD, specifically the last few episodes about Tesla’s valuation to get a better understanding of why they are valued at what they are. When a stock goes up 10x it doesn’t automatically make it “overvalued.” They’re already profitable and have been for several quarters. The regulatory credits are just one part contributing. You and everyone else on the planet buying either long term puts and/or shorting the stock are going to lose money unless Elon dies in a fatal car wreck (which he won’t because Tesla vehicles are the safest cars on the planet).

Edit (if you bother to do some deep research on Tesla as a company) you will understand they have a very very wide technology mote against their competitors and the gap is increasing every year, not shortening. 

even talking about straight up auto sales, unless you have a robust level 3 charging infrastructure why would anyone buy another EV other than Tesla? There is no way to reliably and quickly charge the car on road trips. I’ve used third party EV chargers and they are all terrible and incredibly slow.

The only EV companies I see maybe surviving alongside Tesla are perhaps electric delivery vans like workhorse and Rivian. Even then those are very niche markets and they would have either have a large single client business backing them (like us postal service or Amazon) to ensure they don’t go belly up"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree with everything you just said except Tesla.

You think its overvalued now?  Watch in 5 years when its another 10x.   It REALLY is not a car company.

Only Tesla will survive this and the competitors will be VW and other existing car companies who have the cash to switch over like this.

Elon is like that Marvel character domino whos ablity is ""luck"".  I have been watching this guy from when he built his first 6 roadsters and begged his first 6 customers to give him extra money and more time to finish it.

I work in Big Data/ML and I understand their approach, Tesla IS going to crack self driving.  When he does where you think the stock is going to go?  In 10 years this stock will be 10x to 20x."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thing is, you can't just say Tesla our an EV company, when they actually do a lot more and are investing for the future, EVs will be massive in the next 5yrs for sure, a lot of people I know would love an EV, yes they have a lot of competition here from other companies but they will compete. The biggest things for Tesla will be their AI and Autonomous driving, battery technology and not just for cars, the charging network they have established and their solar products. Also they have a huge cult following and so does Elon. Never invested in Tesla but I wouldn't write them off or label them as just an EV company."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol tesla will easily own 20% of the market n fsd will be finished by 2025.  Its the only one worth owning on ur list.the only ither “ev” plays worth a mention are porsche n tata

Yes there are many EV companies that will be destroyed in the process but that’s the same with all new industry. Nothing different going on here.

That’s all."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Back in 2017 TSLA barely had any competition. They were and obviously still are pioneers in the industry. Today all of these companies suddenly have a ton of competition entering the market. It’s a slightly different situation.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I kind of agree with this. I think Lucid is probably the least risky of the TSLA competitors. They have a great team.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This is why I used the term ”new” market. I think people buying into the EV hype forget that in the end they’re just cars with a different energy source. Sure they have fancy ass touch screens etc. but they’re still cars.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not just auto. It's energy, tech and auto combined. I agree that it's not gonna take over, but rather expand it or create it's own subsection. I mean.. think about it. It's not just the vehicle. It's the entire infrastructure making up the industry that has to be rebuilt, modified and integrated. 

Yes,  battery, energy and whatnot are it's own individual industry, but if you look at what's happening right now with shortages in every sector, I mean Tesla is an example of this. But, I  doubt others will expand into vertically integrating industries like Tesla is doing right now. The real winner winner is gonna be who ever sets the standard and streamlines the supply chain

In addition, with governments setting goals for all EV vehicles for the future, in reality there's gonna be billions if not trillions pouring into the tech. Let's be honest. Who would buy an ICE vehicle when it's going to be obsolete within 10 years? Also, I would also assume in the future, there will be much heavier investment into EV airplane, boats and whatnot after green infrastructure is all set. 

I mean who knows what's going to happen, but in general, I think auto companies with focus on batteries and battery technology will come out winner in the end. Successful startups will most likely get bought up (probably not TSLA and I have high prospects for Lucid - CCIV).


You're witnessing multiple traditional trillion dollar industry morphing and melting into the EV sector. This is the future. This is the way. 





Fyi im down 88% over the past year so everything i just said is probably bullsit"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"
> The only seemingly contradictory thing I can add is that Tesla is 1000x smarter bet than any of these car company's because of their nut on the battery supply,

Their battery tech is great but they aren't competing with car companies here honestly they are competing with Panasonic and Samsung who will keep honing their batteries and gladly sell them to anyone that wants them.

> eventually they will be the only company that will have a truly autonomous car at a viable price point, and most importantly:

This is not true, once Google starts licensing their self driving tech car companies will use that and be very close if not better than tesla. Tesla has great self driving tech but so does Google.

> They'll own the roof/house battery market because they already have the tech, hype and trust to finance it. Questions is how long does it take them to get the infrastructure figured out.

They better get the cost down, I own a tesla and have solar on my roof. I evaluated their solar roof when buying solar. It was sooooo much cheaper to buy just cheap Chinese or Korean panels, I'm talking 40% of the cost of tesla roof after installation. 

Installing my solar + new roof was still 70% the cost of tesla solar, and panels degrade, roof tiles will degrade as well, you actually want to easily be able to replace panels over time. I think their model is only applicable to people that want the look of not having panels.

edit: Also not saying tesla is a bad company at all, they are a great company and I own one, I'm saying they aren't worth 4x the value of Toyota right now. People compare them to all these car companies but they need to be compared to these car companies + suppliers like Google and Panasonic and Samsung."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Magna is making an autonomous car for uber.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"My dude, Tesla is years behind some of the other autonomous players.  They have like a 50% success rate at making an unprotected left, companies that use Lidar were able to do that years ago.  This is the point where some Tesla fanboy comes along and replies ""hurr durr geofences"", but the fact of the matter is, if geofencing makes the problem so much easier then Tesla should have done it yesterday.  If Lidar is a crutch as Elon said, Tesla should have used it yesterday, because I'd take a cripple on crutches over a cripple falling over in the middle of the crosswalk and getting run over."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets, Remind me! In one year
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I lived through the dotcom era. Most people were right about the potential of the internet but incredibly wrong about the timing and application. This is why I agree with OP on the EV industry and the similarity with dotcom.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Aren't their fraud allegations for Tesla that pop up every other year? I think they'll lean more towards the Enron of our time.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao im sure those puts have worked out for you huh. How much money have you lost total, or were you only shorting from the top"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Believe it or not I don’t hate SPACs and don’t necessarily see them as a probiem. EV space just happens to be filled with listings via SPACs.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The problem is they make no money, in an industry with high capital requirements, and they are up against established players who have been cranking out millions of vehicles per year."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks. It’s their official estimate so I corrected that into the post. Based on the recent Hindenburg report I’m however very skeptical on the timeline.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,mama Cathie likes the stock.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,he said he ain't touching Chinese EVs because of the possibility that the Chinese govt will have spyware in them.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Which
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Disagree with this wild notion that Tesla is streets ahead. They've already been caught in Europe by two boomer car manufacturers. 

Tesla fiends have serious blinkers and also have a massively US centric view that disregards reality.

The reality is that traditional car makers have already pivoted to EV production and have overcome many entry barriers because they already have brand awareness and production infrastructure. 

European figures from 2020 -

Renault Zoe number one seller. 

Tesla 13% market share. Down from 30% in 2019. Growing market but drastically reducing share.

VW is Europe's biggest EV manufacturer, not Tesla.

Yes, history repeats, but both ways."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Some good points but the whole not turning a profit on startups don't make sense.  A lot  startups don't make any revenue much less profit.  They burn cash in hopes of future profit potential.  If you base it solely on profit you would never buy Amazon, Google, TSLA, Netflix.  These are industry disruptors that lost money year over year.    Netflix, Amazon, TSLA only became profitable after many many years of losses."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"""They're all frauds."" Also: ""There's so much competitions!!""

😂"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"They have competition now? They still sell four $100k vehicles for every Nissan Leaf. 

And when a good one comes out you have to wait months to a year for a kona ev. 

But at this point it is valued as robo taxi company. If they can get that dialed in they will have insane revenue per car. You laugh at it, but how many more months do they need to before they can go big?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You said yourself 4 of 5 of these companies won't exist in 5 years. How the fuck is that competition?

I remember the dumb ass phrase ""iPhONe kILler"" years ago and that smart fuck of a phone isn't dead yet."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The amount of downvotes here are obviously unaware of the almost half a billion in sales from insiders at Tesla made since January 2021.

I've been long on TSLA since its inception, but it's alright to be bearish in the front of a fraudulent system that's finna get its cheeks clapped sooner rather than later.

I also invested in NIO last year ~15 dollars, and I took out every cent I had when it was in the 50s. I'm fine with my 4x profit in about 7 months.

Everything outside of companies that run inverse to the market are fuk."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the great post. You reminded me why I don't touch any of these companies, except for Tesla, and just with the tip.

There will be strong proponents of Tesla because their story is still in progress. There will be massive gains and losses for sure."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You just talked up that competition
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"$TSLA are pioneers for sure. To say they didn’t have competition is just false. Fisker had the Karma (I know it had issues but it was sexy AF). Arguably the Toyota Prius and Nisan had the Leaf.

I do agree that a lot of these companies have a long road ahead. Some of it is laughable or even criminal. However, these companies have the same potential as anything else."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol you say they have competition, but also just said all their competition was fraudulent or a joke."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is a difference between competitors and competition. TSLA has pretty much no competition, but several competitors. Every other EV is a joke in every respect when compared to TSLA at this point in time. That’ll change over time, but they still got another 5 years at least."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You say tesla have a lot of competition but you have just shat on all of them, in reality they still don't have any. And all the news about Ford, vw etc entering ev field is to protect the more and more investors flocking in Tesla, which makes it grossly overvalued, and risky for everyone. 

Legacy car makers have stopped taking risks years ago, they rebrand, reshape a little and keep on selling the same shit all the time. There are nobody experienced enough to take a jump on EV field in those companies anyone they could have head hunted from Tesla wont be able to make necessary changes due to lack of clout in given company cultures they enter towards, and those companies are gonna make a huge mess before aligning themselves towards that market."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"TSLA may be first but the race hasn’t been called yet. 

TSLA will be competing with VWs massive portfolio of EVs, along with Ford, Toyota, Honda, GM and, hell, maybe even Dodge/FIAT have some hellcat EV crate motor up their sleeves.

I think the EV market is going to be incredibly diverse, much like the auto industry way back about 100 years ago when you had many more automakers than now (you know, those weird American, french, and German brand cars that pop up at Barrett Jackson, Top Gear, etc...). BUT the industry is going to whittle down like is did back then and you’re going to be left with a few big players once again. Tesla may join the ranks assuming Vw doesn’t make a $40,000 Golf R EV with 600km+ range and like 500hp."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. As soon as ford and vag get their charger situation as good as tesla (like you can actually road trip with one and the built in nav will actually plan your route based on chargers), tesla is done as a car company. The actual carness of teslas is pretty crap, touch screens as user interfaces in cars are bad at best and dangerous at worst, their warranty % is super high even though they don't have engines, and their tooling it's at the level that tbr big boys use for prototypes."

honestly, i think nkla has received a lot of hate only because it’s a new disruptive entrant as it poses a threat to the EV industry."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do some research on Rivian. They are said to be going public later this year with an IPO. Their CEO/founder RJ Scaringe gives me major Elon Musk vibes. 

They earned a ton of respect from me the way they have seemed to be 100% honest throughout the whole production/R&D process. No fancy unrealistic CGI models that never pan out....The models they have brought to car shows are more or less exactly what they’ll be delivering. They didn’t try to hype up stuff they may not be able to deliver on. They actually purposefully tried to do everything completely behind the scenes as much as possible until they actually had a physical product to show off. Their skate board chassis will be used by many other brands besides Ford IMO.  Their partnerships are quite impressive this early in. Amazon already ordered 100,000 delivery vans. And their truck/SUVs actually look fantastic. 

All that being said, they are going to be insanely overpriced come IPO day. Their valuation already is crazy."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Since I don’t see anybody else advocating for FSR, I’ll be that retard. First and foremost, I like FSR. I like it a lot. 

Pros: outsourcing. As you said, yes. They are going to be outsourcing their Ocean SUV and upcoming models (probably PEAR too). But it’s not just to anybody, it’s fucking Magna. Magna builds cars for Daimler, BMW, and the “Zupra”. Basically, high quality stuff. Better quality than Tesla. And, to give them a bit of a carrot, they gave Magna a 6% stake in the company. 

Leasing model. Yes, while FSR will be offering a subscription based leasing model, they will also offer other ways to purchase the Ocean. The leasing model is focused at people that otherwise don’t have the money to get into an EV. 

The man himself: Henrick Fisker. He has designed absolutely beautiful cars in the past: the original Fisker Karma, several Aston Martins and BMWs. The man knows how to make a sexy car. I can’t say the same for most EVs currently sold.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"One thing I think people don't realize as well, is they think Tesla is way farther ahead on self driving tech. This is true in comparison to car companies like Ford etc. But you shouldn't be comparing self driving tech to Ford, you should be comparing it to Google. Google wants to step in and license all their self driving tech to big manufacturers just like Android, and Google has been developing it for years through Waymo. All car companies have to do is flip a switch paying for licensing their tech from Google and, bam, now their software is competive with Tesla(or better, I think Google has better software especially around integrating with your smart phone, than tesla.)



Tesla is unique that they do everything in house and that gives them an advantage but not that amazing of an advantage.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"They made the Jaguar I-PACE, and for all intents and purposes it's a pretty shit option compared to other EVs.

Even from a purely business point of view it's not a great option for the likes of uber, it needs a LOT more batteries to get the same range (80mpge vs 111mpge for the Model Y) which means it's expensive for them to manufacture while still being more expensive than the competition."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't really disagree with your argument, but good luck competing with your production lidar. When Tesla gets it figured out, it's checkmate. 2nd place isn't going to be worth much."

I listened to the investor call, and heard the Goldman guy ask some questions. Then later, Goldman reduced the price from $31 to $29 but kept it at buy. Tbh that smacks to me of being the slap on the wrist about the preorder numbers; but confirmation of them being on track elsewhere. They all but confirmed the majority of the hurdles for Lordstown to get the ATVM loan were cleared, and they will be getting a minimum of 250MM at treasury rates. They own that GM plant which has lots of bells and whistles, and are trying to own the IP of their batteries and build their own tools.

Only feasible way to do it would be to have Tesla owners rent out their cars for the service but they aren’t going to rent out their $80,000 cars for pennies so Tesla’s cut would be similar to lyft and uber if not less so even if they stole the entire market somehow it would only add like $150 billion in market cap."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,didn't they already have a lady crossing the highway get merc'ed and a tesla autopilot driver slam into a fire truck? Oh and the few that slammed a median because the early versions of the autopilot function were exclusively using painted lines to navigate? I don't know how they do it but people dying while using their autopilot/self driving programs seem to have little to no affect on their price as long as they claim the person in the driver seat wasn't paying attention. If any of these smaller EV's had that happen they'd tank. It's kinda impressive.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,How can you have a product if your a startup lol.   GOEV main product is the skateboard EV platform.  They are trying to sell that to traditional manufacturers to put their cars on.  The mini van thing was a new announcement and yeah it's hideous and will likely fail.  But that's not their main product.   Nkla and ride looks bad so got nothing to back them up.  Lucid looked promising they have factories ready and a ton of Saudi money to back them up. 4B in cash.   Fisker idk I'm wary cause the guy failed once already and folded but the ocean looks nice and if he can deliver it's a hell of a value.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Right not EV for consumer cars is 5%.  In about 20 years it will be near 100%.  Most industrial countries are banning ICE vehicles by 2030.  There's alot of room to run there.  That's also alot of competition but TSLA is a clear leader in EV and will sell more cars no matter if they lose market share or not.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are you referring to F and GM? The ones legally tied to the doomed dealership model? The ones massively fearful of cannibalizing their existing ICE sales? The ones who mass produce smelly poops like the Mach-E?

What's the point of listing a bunch of speculative stocks as ""not producing yet""? That's not news. Everyone *who actually follows EV stocks* knows they're pre-revenue. The bet is on which ones will eventually come through."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The fact that they are running a beta program on hundreds of thousands of vehicles automatically means they are by far the most likely to achieve the government safety rating for autonomous vehicles first. That combined with their prestigious brand means they will absolutely be THE major player when autonomous cars start to take over the road. This puts them light years ahead of almost all their competition and is the original reason why they blew up last year. But in my opinion, the single most valuable thing that Tesla has, is their current Beta program which will amass an unbelievable amount of data which is needed to perfect the AI. I believe we are in a Tech bubble and I do think EV companies are for the most part vastly overvalued, but Tesla is not primarily an EV company in the way that the other companies listed in your post are. They are also a software company that will mostly likely get fully autonomous AI certified on the road first, and robo-taxis and self driving delivery trucks are only a small part of the buying frenzy that will be unleashed when they have certified self-driving consumer priced cars on the road.

That being said, I have no idea if that justifies their current stock price or if they could get some serious competition from other AI research (don't sleep on Google, the original company that had a head start in R&D). Telsa is undoubted overpriced and will fall if the tech bubble finally pops, but that will not stop them from dominating the huge market that will open up in the next few years and their stock will sky-rocket from there. The other sketchy EV companies you have listed will fall harder when interest rates are increased and are NOT competitors to Tesla in any meaningful way. Tesla's real competitors are Apple and Google who know the real money is in the software that will be running on all these EV cars in a decade."

That still takes out the driver as a cost which is the big thing. Have you forgotten need all of those for taxis anyway? (Replacing more expensive fossil fuels for cheaper electricity of course)"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Based on your username you're clearly in denial about the reality of robotaxis. 

An automated car has the same or less maintenance requirements than a car driven by a human due to an automated driver being more efficient and less likely to be in an accident.  As far as people reviewing footage, that's already necessary if there are issues, automated driver or not.  

Hate to be the one to break it to ya but you're grasping at straws bud.  The idea that having people to clean cars or review footage is some sort of insurmountable hurdle when we're talking about *self driving cars* existing is absolutely absurd."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,TSLA wouldn't have to pay to use people's cars. They can sell them to consumers at discounted prices with the stipulation that the car gets used for robo taxi 10 hours a week. So many people would jump at that opportunity to own a new TSLA for cheap.

nasa did the reusable rocket thing back in the 80s and with the space shuttle.   


AI, while being a very powerful tool, has yet to show how it copes with really difficult road situations. Don't get me wrong, TSLA is way ahead of competition in terms of autonomous driving but if you examine videos of the cars driving in Europe it becomes clear they are years away from real autonomous driving. The TSLA autopilot only works well / near flawlessly on big roads as in America. On curvy, tight roads with sometimes bad designed crossing etc. like in all Europe it becomes a system which needs to be supervised by a human."

That said, I do think it will happen eventually, just not as quickly as originally predicted or in the same way predicted back then. It's only been in the last couple of years that I've started to think, holy shit, I barely have to think to do my job anymore.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're right, Volkswagen are looking the most prepared and they're still in a bad spot.

Volkswagen's plan for 2030 is to have a battery factory for 250GWh worth of batteries. That's about twice what Tesla has now and Tesla doesn't have enough batteries for their current sales and (smaller) storage business. Tesla made 600,000 cars last year. Volkswagen made 6 million cars last year.

How the fuck does the OP think VW are going to make 6 million worth of car batteries with a factory twice the size of what Tesla used to make 600,000 cars 9 years from now?

The guy's talking out of his ass. Shitty DD.

Lmao. They say ""full ev  by 2030"" because they forecast that it won't be until 2030 that the market has fully shifted to EVs. Not that they literally cannot move to making full EVs before then. 

The EV market isn't that big at the moment... if any single one of them suddenly said ""we're not making any petrol cars anymore"" they'd immediately go bankrupt because the EV market isn't big enough to support multiple huge players going all-in. And they all know that."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Very well could take a lot longer for autonomous vehicles to reach the demand needed to justify current price levels, but there is built-in demand in the next decades that will fully eclipse hobbyists who will never adopt self-driving cars themselves. I think you're right in that the biggest questions are how quickly can they evolve the AI needed to be certified, and is there immediate consumer demand to buy when they are available. It will obviously start with luxury brands (like Tesla) and trickle down from there, but I have no doubt at some point between now and next decade that the demand will absolutely explode. People are (rightfully) sketched out by the current state of self-driving AI,  but it's not who has the better software engineers that will determine who perfects the software first, it's who has the *data*. Billions of hours of real world driving data is needed to build the AI models to perfect the system, and they are basically the only ones with the capacity to be even gathering the real data yet -- that we know of, wouldn't be surprised if Google has secretly been using data from their Google Maps cars to build their AI models. Once consumers see certified self-driving cars with an accident record akin to the airlines, they will rush to buy. But honestly, who knows how long that will take.

Batteries are a core part of an EV. They're about 1/3 of the cost of the car. They're more important than even the motors used.

Right now everyone is buying batteries except Tesla (and maybe Nissan).

GM and VW are two companies building battery plants. That alone is what makes them the more likely companies to survive, but it's not anywhere near enough supply for their current production levels. They aren't going to have to bid for supply from LG or CATL or whoever like everyone else.

If you think buying from a third party is the way to go I hope for your sake you have no money in this game.

> VW will scale their supply chains with demand. 

That's a head in the sand response. They'll have maybe enough batteries for 1/6 of their cars in 9 years! On top of that it's costing them $30 billion. They don't have $150 billion just lying around to build for the rest. They're in a bad place. There's no denying the numbers.

> They don't want to burn as much money as TSLA does

*As an addendum to my previous post on delta hedging*

Delta hedging, pin risk, gamma, max pain: 

**Dynamic delta hedging** -

Ex: AMC a dealer sold a $14 3/19 call on 3/9 when the stock was at $10. The delta was 30% so they bought 30% of their AMC exposure and were delta neutral. As the stock moves up and down the delta changes (the rate of change is gamma). Stock moves to $11, delta goes to 40%, they buy more. Stock goes down to $9, delta goes to 20%, they sell more. 

This week stock was drifting higher and $14 call sellers are buying more stock while $14 put sellers are ALSO buying. When the stock is at $10 the chance of a $14 call being ITM in a week is... 30% let’s say (much lower for a normal stock but AMC vol is obviously sky high). The chance of an $14 put being ITM is let’s say... 70%. As the stock moves higher both call and put sellers are buying stock.
With the stock at $13.50 the call delta goes to 48% and the put delta goes to 52% as an example. 

This week a bunch of call option buyers came in bidding up higher strikes. This forced dealers to buy more stock to hedge. This causes the price to rise. Now as the price of the stock rises, so does the delta (the rate of this change is the gamma). So now the dealers have to buy MORE stock. The closer to expiry the more gamma there is in at the money (ATM) options. So dealers are buying more and more stock which is making the price go up (obviously) which means the call delta goes up which makes them buy more stock. At the same time this is happening to the whole options chain. Tada! A **gamma squeeze**. 

The WHOLE time they are hedging. Obviously some of them probably couldn’t hedge fast enough and lost money but generally speaking, they are long the same amount of equity exposure as they are short through options.

“Gamma squeezes” work both ways. As the stock starts to drop, those dealers are selling their stock because the probability of a $14 call being exercised is dropping. 

**Explaining price action Friday afternoons**:

Ok, so we’ve discussed dynamic delta hedging and how dealers are hedging their exposure constantly. They’re not waiting until Friday at 4:00 to find out if they’re on the hook for millions of dollars.

Let’s keep using AMC as an example. Here comes Friday/ expiry and the stock is right around $14.  Lots and lots of contracts are being closed out for profits/ losses and dealers are unwinding hedges.

Dealers short calls all the way up to $13.50 are almost 100% hedged (they’ve bought almost 100% of their stock). The probability the calls they are short will be ITM is almost 100%. Dealers short calls from let’s say.... $14.50 and up are almost 0% hedged (in a normal situation this would be actually 0. For AMC it was non zero) 

Reminder: A LOT of this is being unwound on Friday. Lots of positions are getting closed out and dealers are buying/ selling/ shorting stock to stay neutral. As the day goes on the dealers short $13.50 calls are buying more stock to get to 100% hedged and the dealers short $14.50 calls are selling more stock to get to 0% hedged.

*(By Friday afternoon having a lot of open interest in higher $ strikes starts to work against longs. “Charm” is causing the delta on those OTM calls to drop by the minute.)*

The problem for the dealer short the $14 call is that as the stock pinballs back and forth from $13.95 and $14.05  the probability of the call being ITM is going from 100% to 0% to 100% to 0%. (Gamma is huge here. It’s the rate of change of the delta. It’s changing a lot!)

**Right around $14 it’s a huge question mark** whether remaining open call and put options will be exercised or not (reflected in the delta being right around 50% - it’s a 50/50 chance). The dealer doesn’t know if it should be 100% hedged or 0% hedged! Probabilistically they should be 50% hedged. But if the stock gaps down at 3:59:58 the call seller is over hedged and if it spikes at 3:59:58 they are under hedged. If the stock closes at $13.95, calls won’t be exercised, they don’t need to have shares. If the stock closes at $14.05 calls will be exercised, they need to have shares. So heading into the close they are selling every time the stock goes below $14 and buying every time it goes above $14. Yes, they are buying high and selling low. They sold options thus are short vol/ short gamma.

On the other hand if dealers are LONG calls or puts they are doing the opposite. A dealer long a $14 put wants to be long 100% of their exposure at $13.98 and 0% at $14.02. So they are long vol, and buying low and selling high.

So. The reason you’ll see a spike in volume if there is large OI in ATM options is due to a) people closing out their contracts at gains/ losses (remember very few options are actually exercised) 
b) lots and lots of dealer hedging in both directions. 

There is an all out battle between call and put buyers and sellers heading into expiry. Generally if dealers are net short vol you’ll see the stock drift away from the strike on high volume. If they’re net long vol you’ll see the stock stay pinned near the strike price. (but delta hedging isn’t the only thing happening in the market! This is all happening in the middle of regular buying and selling!) A lot of times a big-ish movement right before the close is dealers capitulating and getting squared to be 100% hedged or 0% hedged. Nobody is leaving their desk Friday afternoon potentially long or short millions of extra shares.

**Max pain theory**- the theory that the stock will settle at a price that causes the “maximum pain” to option holders, ie where the most dollars at risk end up out of the money. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maxpain.asp This was actually $10 yesterday so it didn’t totally apply https://swaggystocks.com/dashboard/options-max-pain/SPY (Don’t get cute and try to trade off this, you’ll end up losing money.) BUT there was a lot of OI in $14 so while not quite “Max pain,” the stock ending the day below $14 did cause “pain” to some remaining call holders. GME Max pain was $150, but there was “pain” for remaining $200 put holders.

*It’s also quite possible that there really was a large natural seller at $14. Again, this is not manipulation.*

**The pin risk “problem”** revolves around expiry. If the stock closes at $13.95 someone will likely want to exercise their put and sell their stock at $14 (5c above market). If the stock closes at $14.05 someone will likely not want to exercise their put and sell their stock at $14 (.05 below market). Sellers of options that are ATM on expiry face some uncertainty that is almost impossible to hedge. If the stock is bouncing around $13.95 or $$14.05 or $13.99 it becomes extremely difficult to predict if the option will be exercised. Most brokers “auto-exercise” any option that is ITM by .01. BUT option holders have until 5:30 PM on Friday to instruct their brokers. They can call their brokers and instruct “DNE”- do not exercise. This often happens if the stock moves after hours. 

*IE, you own a $14 AMC put. Stock closes at $13.93 on Friday and you’re in the money. At 4:05 it’s announced that AMZN is buying AMC at $20 a share. You call your broker and scream “do not exercise!!” 

*You own a $200 GME call. Stock closes at $200.27 and you’re in the money. At 4:05 it’s announced that GME is going bankrupt. You call your broker and scream “do not exercise!!”
More likely a bunch of idiots bought $200 calls and don’t have the cash to take delivery so the options aren’t exercised. 

Some brokers charge a fee to exercise which further muddies the waters. But the real risk which is difficult to hedge is that option holders have until 5:30 to instruct brokers and a lot can happen from 4:00 to 5:30. So dealers do have some incentive to push the price to where options won’t be exercised so they aren’t taking some weekend risk. The dollars here are small though... it’s not, “if it closes above $200 I’m screwed and have to buy millions of dollars of stock,” it’s “if it closes above $200 there’s still some uncertainty on whether I’ll be assigned on some calls that are still open so I’m taking some weekend risk.” **MOST of the options have already been closed out before 4 PM. Most options buyers do not exercise.**

On SATURDAY the OCC auto exercises all options that are valid and have not gotten a DNE and randomly assigns the contracts to its members (brokers). In turn, brokers randomly assign the contracts among all the option sellers. 

So there IS usually some overhang on Monday in both directions. But it’s really very small. And then it’s a new week and we’re off to the races again :)

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can confirm, MM took my kidneys via BB calls on D day. Recovered but not forgotten. I felt like wolf of wallstreet seeing those gains then GUH’d to death like a fly"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought it would be the other way around. Since volatility goes back to the average. They would sell options at high implied volatility and have the crash going back to its average volatility make them money. The premiums would be a lot higher too when implied volatility is high and give the MMS more profit. Is that just how a regular options seller works and not MMs
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"In general there was a lot of call buying all this week and last week. Various strikes, doesnt have to be $220. And yes Friday morning there was a decent amount of call buying but it petered out in the afternoon and then the stock was kind of heavy heading into the close."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It seems like a message meant to educate. Since when has this sub been about education?

You’ve got your opinion that this is content relevant to the sub, others have a differing view of why these options courses are showing up here and not r/wallstreetnoobs or r/options and whether there’s an ulterior motive, considering how many bad options bets have been made lately and how much money has been lost."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Welp. I guess nobody wanted options lessons 😂
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes sorry if what I said was unclear. Basically - they sell you an option at 300% IV. Two ways they can make money- the *implied* volatility on the option declines or *the realized volatility of the underlying is less than what was priced in when they sold you the option. Or it’s kind of a “both” situation. So they sell you an option at 300% iv they make money if it goes to 200% iv or if the underlying realizes less than 300% vol meaning their dynamic delta hedging costs them less than what was priced in.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean... saying a post meant to “educate” has an ulterior or nefarious motive is literally insane dude. Take a break.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are one of the few people who don't give a fuck about karma and are not afraid to give invaluable, real, researched information.

2021-03-21 19:20:17,wallstreetbets,"PTON - Not Just a Becky Meme stock? &#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i9uoipljeeo61.png?width=1062&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec3d531f9eebb8b24f801fe9120b2570ed0fc68a

This is my first DD, so go gentle. Okay, so I looked at this on Thursday when it was announced that kid died, and the stock was closer to 100. That said, I still think this has room to grow, and once the price dips again I'm personally going to load up on calls. I think 120 is a good target. I'm on the fence between doing the April or May calls, but I think May is the safer play. 

&#x200B;

Now, I know most DD just has tons of analysis and actual information and walls of text and shit, but here's a pretty chart. 1year chart with bands and the weighted moving average. This says institutional value is at 140, so it's on sale now. Momentum has been dipped, likely from their fucked up logistics. But the stock rose like 8 bucks on the news their treadmill killed a kid, so if that's good enough for the market, that's good enough for me. Let's give Becky a ride, and get in on the PTON action.

&#x200B;

I think there is a good chance their earning call is rough, because my understanding is to unfuck their logistics, they decided to air freight all their hardware to clear the backlog. Sure, selling more bikes is a good thing, but everyone knows logistics is where the money is. So feel free to inverse me with some confidence too.

&#x200B;

TLDR 4/16 Calls @ 120 because the May ones are 3x the price"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Warmer weather + Gyms opening up + vaccinations = less people trying to work out inside their homes

I think not a great time to buy, but that’s just my stupid opinion."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"My biggest concerns: 

1. Rising yields. Market doesn’t want high PE growth stocks in this environment.

2. market isn’t interested in “stay at home trades” now that the country is opening back up. Look at ZM earnings. They had a huge beat and sold off. I don’t think there’s anything PTON can report to make the market happy. 

I would avoid this trade."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I think you miss-typed and meant to write “Buy PLTR”.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice DD.  Seems like a fair assessment. However, going on intuition, I would probably short here.  Now that COVID is over, expect lower demand and higher customer acquisition cost."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol I bought pton puts on Friday after that 5% ripper. Until bonds chill the fuck out I don’t think it’ll reach 120
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,At one point recently the valuation was $80k per exercise bike ever sold.  But it might be the next Amazon lol
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you are definitely right but people love being able to work out at home, plus the community it's built with competition with friends. I don't see people giving up their membership but instead will do both. As things get a little more normal towards the end of the year and people realize how much their are paying for both then they might start seeing memberships cut or slow down. I talked with someone else about Them and they pointed out their PE ratio is high but I do like the target of 120-140 if they continue to grow. My brother just got it last week and he's like the last person I'd imagine getting it."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I think that may be priced in with the 35% drop over the last 2 months
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but flip side is, gyms opening back up right? It's easy to assume it's just a Becky buying a peloton, but I would venture a guess that gym's are stocking these too. Decent business model for corporate locations stocking these to take advantage of all the rich folks who bought these for their homes and want to keep working out at lunch when offices force them back to work"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Plus, no one really workouts inside their homes, let alone buying 1k+ bike with monthly payments."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Not the typical membership gym’s but more like rental/luxury/condo building have 2-4 pelotons per gym. Also fancy corporate offices with gym’s have Pelotons. Hotel gym’s etc.

2021-03-21 17:39:36,wallstreetbets,"GME Overview - Week of 3/22 🚀 **Good Morning Everyone!!!**

Here is an overview for things to look out for this week regarding GME. Pray that Automod doesn't nuke me again.

🚀 **Option Chain Overview (As Of Close on Friday 3/19)**



Strike | Calls ITM | Puts ITM | Buying Power (# of Shares) | Total C&P ITM | % Calls | % Puts | Spread
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----
170 | 5,881 | 6,400 | -51,900 | 12,281 | 47.89 | 52.11 | -4.23
175 | 6,157 | 6,086 | 7,100 | 12,243 | 50.29 | 49.71 | .58
180 | 6,324 | 5,810 | 51,400 | 12,134 | 52.11 | 47.88 | 4.24
195 | 6,778 | 5,302 | 147,600 | 12,080 | 56.11 | 43.89 | 12.22
200 | 7,998 | 4,252 | 374,600 | 12,250 | 65.29 | 34.71 | 30.58
250 | 11,528 | 2,681 | 884,700 | 14,209 | 81.13 | 18.87 | 62.26
300 | 16,747 | 1,118 | 1,562,900 | 17,865 | 93.74 | 6.26 | 87.78
350 | 19,121 | 946 | 1,817,500 | 20,067 | 95.29 | 4.71 | 90.57
400 | 23,057 | 799 | 2,225,800 | 23,856 | 96.65 | 3.35 | 93.30

**Pease note that this option chain will change as the week goes on. This is only a preliminary scan.**

In order for the Option Chain to favor the HFs, they will want GME to get below 175 where more puts will be ITM than calls.

The spread at 200 is more than double the spread at 195. If Hedge Funds can't get below 170, getting it below 200 is imperative for them as the spread begins to get out of hand.

Total Calls and Puts ITM stays steady from 170 to 200, however that number begins to increase dramatically beyond 200. That difference is made up by a dramatic increase in Calls falling ITM. This means that a Gamma Squeeze may occur at around 250 and begin to compound if it reaches 300, 350, etc.

🚀 **Shorts Available Overview (As of Close on Friday 3/19)**

Actual GME Shorts Available - 10,000

Effective GME Shorts Available through ETFs - 35,647

ETF Data Part 1
](http://puu.sh/Hr7UQ/cafaad22b2.png)

[ETF Data Part 2](http://puu.sh/Hr7Vr/abd3aaf1dd.png)

These are the numbers of shorts that HF's can borrow through interactive brokers that disclose their available shorts. This number does not represent the total number of shorts that HFs have that have not been placed in the market. This also does not represent shorts that can be borrowed from undisclosed locations.

Looking at this data though, it seems that HFs are really low on ammo. The 2 million volume that we saw at the end of Friday might have been a good portion of their reserves. We will still continue to see attacks throughout the week, but it will be interesting to see how powerful those attacks are.

Reminder that shorts need to be covered eventually.

This is the best data I have at the moment. I don't have access to a Bloomberg Terminal or any non-public information. I am not making any assumptions as to where GME will be by the end of the week. I am not telling anyone to make any sort of investment decisions.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"What makes you think hedge funds are shorting GME using ETFs? 

To short $1M worth of GME using an ETF with 1% GME in their index, they need to borrow shares in the ETF for $100M, and thus pay the borrowing fee for $100M worth of shares. 

This means that the cost to borrow will be about* 100x more when shorting GME through an ETF, compared to shorting GME directly.

*) in reality this factor may differ depending on differences in borrowing fees between GME and the ETF. Right now though, GME borrowing fees are at an all time low (0.5%) and much lower than GAMR (10.7%) which is the ETF with the highest proportion of GME shares, massively favouring shorting GME directly. 

GAMR example (400x):

According to OP, GAMR holds almost 5% GME shares. To short $1M GME we need to borrow $20M GAMR at a cost of approx $2M. This is 400x more compared to borrowing $1M GME directly at a cost of $5K.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay so what we know (keep in mind, I’m a bus driver. Not in Wall Street or any formal schooling. Been here since the end of January. Just trying to paint us a factual picture): 

- Melvin took out a 6Billion dollar loan from someone with a BBB- rating. Which is the lowest rating you can have and still loan money out for investments. My guess is this is the only group that would give them money
Edit: was not a loan. Citadel offered bonds at 3.25% 

- We would have seen this pop Friday had it not been actively suppressed. There were a lot of calls on 200-250. That COULD have triggered a Gamma.
- Others have pointed out the news outlets have NEVER told the masses to sell anything for worry of “losing your money” they want GME hype to fail
- we got ER this week. 2/23 I believe. This should create some volume if the report goes well.

What are the odds that Melvin is using all that 6B solely for GME? Are they trying to make other plays? We need to get a solid picture and share it with the apes. They can see everything we post here, so the best thing we can do is make sure apes are informed.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON BORROW AVAILABILITY IN GME

There has been a lot of very inaccurate and false information being posted about the borrow availability in GME shares. The most common one is that IBorrowdesk (IBKR) is reflective of the total availability of borrow in the marketplace. THIS IS FALSE!!!  iBorrowdesk as well as most other offerings of the same sort from Fido, Schwab etc mostly just show the availability of shares on their platform at that moment in time. Ironically this means the more their clients buy GME on margin the more borrow availability there will be. 

THE REAL BORROW MARKET AVAILABILITY. 

In its most basic form, the largest holders of securities are also the largest lenders of securities. Hate to break it to y’all but there are a ton of institutional holders of this stock. When an institution such as pension fund, mutual fund insurance company buys GME ( or any other stock for that matter) those shares are held at their custodian. A Custody bank such as JPM, Citi, State Street, BONY aggregates these assets and if the pension fund is in their lending program (most are) those shares are lent to broker dealers. The large broker dealers all have Prime Brokerage groups that custody assets for Hedge Funds. One of the main functions of a Prime Broker is to lend stock to Hedge Funds to short. BDs act as the middle man between the Custody bank and the hedge fund. How does a PB know where to borrow GME you ask?  Easy, the Custody banks broadcast ALL of their stocks available for lending to Broker Dealers. The PBs aggregate this borrow availability from all of the Custody banks and broadcast this information to Hedge Funds. Included in this aggregation would be any positions that are available at the PB from their long clients who purchases those securities on margin. So each day every PB in the market aggregates all of the borrow availability they have access to and broadcasts it to HFS to short. Here’s the rub. THIS INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE TO THE  GENERAL PUBLIC!!!!!  Securities lending or stock loan is a purposely OPAQUE market. This allows the PBs to keep control over who gets borrow and at what cost.  On that topic of Cost, given that the general public does not have the same access to this information, the COST to  borrow a security can often be a more accurate reflection on borrow availability. Case in point: When GME first squeezed in late January there was ZERO borrow available to short. As such the cost to borrow the security went as high as 200%. Think about that. That high cost is untenable and impossible for a HF to stay short for very long. Obviously they covered a load of stock and the borrow cost came in and availability went back up. 

EVERY BD(PB)’s ABILITY TO BORROW STOCK IS DIFFERENT 

Think of hard to borrow securities like GME as an allocation of shares in IPO process. Not anyone can rock up and get an allocation of an IPO. The same is true of an allocation of stock borrow on a hard to borrow or “special” security like GME. The Custody bank will allocate limited shares of a hard to borrow to those borrowers (BD&PBs) that pay them the most revenue throughout the year. It stands to reason that the largest clients of the custody banks are the largest PBS that have enormous borrow demand. Thus BONY will lend GME to a GS or JPM before lending it to IBKR or Fido (both with very small PB groups). You with me so far???  So let’s look at the loan side of that transaction. BONY lends GME to GS. Now GS will lend that scarce resource of GME borrow to HF clients that pay them the most revenue throughout the year. Thus GS is more likely to lend GME in this scenario to a Citadel(I know I know), Bridgewater or DE Shaw vs a small 50mmAUM hedge fund. 

CONTROL AND AGGREGATION OF BORROW MARKET AVAILABILITY. 

Although the transparency into stock borrow availability is non existent for individual investors it is vastly different and very transparent to stock borrow participants (CUSTODY BANKS, BD/PBs). The largest stock loan participants have created an industry utility they control that aggregates each participants borrow availability. They submit total shares available for borrow by firm aggregate it all and distribute back to its participants ONLY!!!  So a stock loan trader at one of these firms can simply type in a ticker and see pretty much the entirety of the stock borrow availability as well as the cost!!! Because the BD/PBs & Custidy banks control this information they reveal only a subset to non participants such as the actual long holder (Pension plan, Mutual fund) and Hedge Funds. This is a main reason why large HFs have multiple PBs. Because everyone’s stock borrow capability is different, they want access to as many avenues to borrow stock as possible. 

The only way for an individual to anywhere close to an accurate number of borrow availability would be to call each of the large PBs and ask for the info. Obviously this is not going to happen. I happen to know several stock loan participants very well and can tell you that there are MILLIONS OF SHARES OF GME TO BORROW RIGHT NOW AND FOR THE PAST MONTH!!!!!  

Given that, the best indicator of whether or not there is a lot of borrow is the COST to borrow which is more readily available through your BD. Even if they aren’t showing you availability they probably still show the cost to borrow. Generally speaking, any cost to borrow below 10% implies there is borrow available. At .5% it is virtually a LIQUID or “GC” (general collateral) borrow. A further reference point would be RKT which squeezed several weeks ago. There was Very little to no borrow availability as evidenced by its 30% borrow cost at the time. 

Don’t even get me started on the availability of shares for retail to short. I generally DO NOT recommend retail investors going short. It is a sure fire way to go broke. That said even though your broker may show you ZERO borrow to go short, I GUARANTEE they are giving availability to their HF clients.   

Hope that helps. It does feel fairly rigged at times given the lack of borrow market transparency. I just hate to think individuals are drawing the wrong conclusions because iBorrow or their BD is showing no borrow. In the case of GME this has been the case all day today. Rest assured THERE ARE MILLIONS OF GME SHARES AVAILABLE TO SHORT."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like yolo calls as much as the next ape, but somedays I wonder if our brokers hand over our account metadata along with our order flow. 

It's really easy for citadel to fine-tune their delta hedge algo against a call they know has zero chance of exercise, ie my account balance is not $100k and I'm holding some 600c $GME. 

Buy $GME shares, it's the quickest way to the moon."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is confusing  to me

&#x200B;

## Share Statistics

Shares Outstanding 569.75M

Float 45.16M%

Held by Insiders 27.33%

Held by Institutions 122.04%

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So total of held shares is 122.04 + 27.33 = 149.37 %

How is it possible that 149.37 % shares are owned?"

The spread at 200 is more than double the spread at 195. If Hedge Funds can't get below 170, getting it below 200 is imperative for them as the spread begins to get out of hand.""

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Thoughts on $400 call for 4/2?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,How does the buy and hold strategy benefit a shares buyer? In order to avoid a wash sale the share value would need to be sustained for over 61 days to reap a benefit. This wash sale does not appear to apply to options buyers. So what is the incentive to buy shares when options have the potential to bring a much greater profit in a shorter time frame using less investment capital?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did they use all the shorts they grabbed last week, or are they still reserving some?"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The best kind of information is the kind that people can interpret and make decisions on their own. It's literally not financial advice, it's just data along with some Game Theory examples. I'm not in the business of telling anyone what to do."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Short answer is we don't know for sure. We don't have access to receipts that would tell us where the HFs are getting their shorts from. I've included ETFs as there has been a lot of DD regarding how they could theoretically short through ETFs. I agree that it is very expensive for them to do so, but if they are doing it, it would signal just how desperate they are to keep the price down."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe they borrow the EFT, take out the GME, and then return the ETF minus the GME. That makes the most logical way of doing this without paying all that borrowing cost.

Perhaps they swap GME with GMEV. That might work."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Their not using ETFs to short GME currently. Makes zero sense. Way more expensive to do that given that there are millions of shares available to borrow cheaply in GME. They may have been doing this in late January when the cost to borrow GME was 200% and there was no borrow. Makes absolutely zero sense to do it now
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct. All this talk of “hiding shorts through ETFs” is literally garbage. GME borrow cost is super low there are plenty of shares available, If anyone wants to short GME they can, they don’t need to pay a HIGHER borrow cost to short an ETF. 

Basically some scammers on YouTube came up with this and 90% of WSB bought into the ETF theory so now when GME short interest has declined they say “bUt tHey’Re hIdInG iT iN eTf sHoRtS” without understand how little sense that makes."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't have any good answers for you that wouldn't be pure speculation. There's a lot of propaganda out there with very little actual hard data.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Um... none of these points are accurate. Citadel invested $2B in Melvin the last week in January. They invested in the fund and got a revenue share agreement. Melvin covered their GME short by 1/27. Guys, there are other hedge funds in the world and Melvin has other positions. 

Citadel issued a bond this month. It has nothing to do with GME they have issued bonds before. Investors accepted 3.75% a year for Citadel 5 year credit risk. Lol the market is not worried about Citadel credit. 

Not sure what you mean by “actively suppressed.” Um, the price was where demand and supply intersected."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"People sold shares they don't actually have access to.

When you short, you're technically borrowing a share to sell in the market. The reason it's above 100% is because some people are selling shares that they neither owned or borrowed."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Nope. I was saying that that's what I think the HFs will try to do. Will see this week if they are successful or not.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you state that you fear 170, you would validate other people who also fear that but have not vocalized that. If you state that you're confident even if it hits 170, people who haven't vocalized their fear of 170 might rethink their thoughts and fear it less.

If you believe in GME, why state that you fear something and plant the idea that a certain price point is bad?

You're not a shill, I feel pretty confident about that, and I'm not upset. I just want to make sure that your investing beliefs actually match the comments that you're making, because those are the types of subtle arguments that bad actors can make to establish an idea of when the public should begin to panic and sell. You do not want to accidentally hurt your position through what you casually say."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,No idea. I've not been able to find that data.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,We'll discuss that if GME starts approaching that. :)
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's bitter truth but HF's strategy is working. Apes are not able to buy with same momentum like before and HFs are able to borrow shorts cheaper to push the price down successfully with the attacks. They are able to drive down the price from 349 down to 172 ish in 2 weeks. It keeps going up at times but again they are able to push it down. They may push the price further down by end of next week in 100s. There are number of posts going around about how HFs are out of ammo etc. which is definitely not true. If they would have lost it then there would have been a repeat of Jan 2021 situation.

The only few catalyst we can hope for are:

1. Huge announcement on 23rd and fomo kicks in with added help from stimmi (Also, for the worst, if the anti-fomo kicks in if the earnings on 23rd are not good then paper apes will start dumping the stock and HF will surely win. :( :( )
2. 1 or more whales (cathie or chamath etc. ) jumping in the long GME game
3. Price drops to 100s and apes + whales jump in in large numbers due to lower price point.

Other than that, sadly looks like HF are winning. :(

We need to build momentum or something needs to happen. If this drags on then it's the games of who blinks first. Unfortunately, at that game, apes are likely to lose. Apes needs to pay bills more frequently than HFs. Let's pray for the best. Either ways, I am holding on to my 100 🦍

&#x200B;

Edit:  Awwwwwwwww... Thanks guys. Means a lot to me. Discussing any uncomfortable / losing scenario automatically makes me a shill or a hedge fund hire. Sorry folks I forgot, there are no other thoughts allowed here. Like I said it means a lot to me. <3

Edit2: For those who can read my comment rationally and think. This is just discussion and not financial advise. Do not sell, no matter where it goes. Also do not buy expensive call options like 800+ expiring next week or so. Option sellers are making money off you.  GME has received free advertisement, cult like following, recognition, lime light from media (good and bad), status of a ""movement"" and lastly financial status of ""having potential to go up multi fold in short period of time"". And GME spent $0 for all this. CEOs can only dream such things for their companies. GME management, new or old, will cash in on it."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"So help this smooth-brained ape earn a wrinkle or two. We had a great week last week, and it was down to the cents on staying above 200 before eow close. My understanding was this was to hemorrhage the HFs with ITM calls, which would theoretically lead to a reaction and start to spiral this out of control.

So if this is the case, why are we talking about them just starting Monday off with some shorting, and testing a new floor at 175? Were the calls executed last week, and did they have any effect on the price?"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"No they don’t. They did before the high IV but now any OTM calls bought allows the HF seller to leverage those with the money received from your high IV cost. You are basically helping them push the price lower.

Unless GME trades sideways for a couple weeks to lower IV, Just buy stocks at this point and you’ll be happy."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,">	Short answer is we don’t know for sure.

I think we do. Hedge funds paying 100–400x more in borrowing fee than they have too won’t be around for long."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"To pull this off they borrow $100M of shares in the ETF and sell them, then they go long on the 99% of the shares that are not GME, using $99M they got from shorting the ETF, leaving them with $1M in cash and GME shorted for $1M. 

But they still have to pay borrowing fee for $100M."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,forgot /s
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,So true. I try to correct this disinformation whenever I see it. It leads people to the wrong conclusion.

Maybe I miss remembered but I swear they just did. As for the active suppression. I was watching the ticket basically all Friday. There was heavy resistance. Call me a conspiracy nut but as I understand it the MMs stood to lose a lot of money if those calls became ITM. Again I’m just a bus driver trying to learn all I can about all this on the go. It was way easier for the ticker to move down than up. I was watching my level 2 info for buying and selling, and there were way more buyers than sellers. I’m just trying to wrap my head around this. And I’m probably wrong on a lot of it."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I'm not sure what to make of it. The fee to borrow peaked at 83% the first time around, for comparison."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,No. Brokers report short interest to the exchange. It’s not self reported.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Unfortunately for individual retail investors this information is not readily available. But thinking logically if Fido for example is showing 100k shares available to borrow and they are a small participant in the stock borrow market it is reasonable and conservative to assume that the bigs JPM GS C BAC MS have easily access to 3x the amount of availability as Fido. Therefore you easily get to a conservative estimate of minimum of 1.5mm-2mm shares of available borrow

I know (a very little bit) about short selling.
But isn't there like a threshold or rule of thumb that limits the percentage that you can short? 

Or can you just go 10000000% short because you do not like the stock?

Isn't the SEC or FInra restricting this to value's that can be bought back realistically? 

PS

I like the stock."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not sure, for those who have bought the stock at $50 they will be fine, but for those who have bought over $250, it will be different. This stock can drop suddenly at $50 as it can skyrocket over $400"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I am confident? To be honest with you, for me it's like a bet between two strong teams. HFs Vs WSB,  I have bet on wsb so far, because I like the idea of being 9 millions members who could potentially hold . As we say the more we are the stronger we are. 

However, my doubt have been fed by reading posts that states that the stock weill go back around $50, and those guys have sold already.

However, when I read your posts I feel confident because you look like to know lot more about finance than the majority of us. (Ps: I am a noob who has started to trade since December)"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd rather buy 100 at $360 and then use that to do covered calls than lose a total of 7k from the original order.

I know we, the retail investors, are important in the GME fight to hold and not sell, but what we are actually seeing is a whale vs whale showdown. 

I think after the earnings call this week, and potential increased market cap and outlook, the more conservative institutions will have better fundamentals to support investing. I’m expecting to break to a new 250 support level (at least!) from Wednesday onwards."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok I think I can read the HFs strategy to push me to sell so I will hold
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m going to make a bold, but probable assumption here. I think you recently accepted an offer to spread the word of the Hedge Funds on Reddit and possibly other social media sites. A lot of these new ‘job offers’ specify that the applicant should have significant profile strength on social media - looking at your impressive karma score, I’d say you fit the bill. Also, not two weeks ago you posted a well-received motivational discussion about how GME is a symbol of power - quite the difference in attitude to this comment, eh?

I completely understand if you did take the job. It just might be some of the easiest money you’ve ever made, and I wouldn’t be surprised if you were planning to invest it all into GME. If so, I salute you. Now, your comment is clearly an attempt to spread FUD, and apes have endured enough of that over the last few weeks to not even bat an eyelid as they read this comment while downvoting it with their ever-stronger diamond hands.

I know this, because if you were truly worried that we were losing this war, you’d keep it to yourself instead of projecting your doubts on others. If you want to this squeeze to happen, you would acknowledge that this is a psychological game and you’d influence others to buy and hold, even if you believed we were doomed.

Now, maybe you made this FUD-heavy comment this obvious in order for apes to instantly see it as so, and not worry at all, while simultaneously satisfying your HF bosses by posting this. In that case, kudos sir!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Apes were not buying, those were in my guestimation ftds being forced bought in. The key being when they short attack on wed came, they knew the pressure was off, the ftds were covered and time to drop the market . That's my suspicions.

However, if Reddit does somehow forget that the call was happening, and some really good news comes out of it, the surprise FOMO would most certainly crash the entire economy. 

That's actually hilarious. It's impossible that it happens, but that would actually be hilarious.

Everyone becomes so tunnel visioned on fighting the HFs that Cohen steps out on Tuesday and essentially announces that HFs are fucked and that they had made the decision to force the squeeze a month ago, but waited until Earnings to announce anything because he wanted to watch the HFs squirm.

That would be so fucking hilarious, I would be depressed that I will never experience such a ridiculously hilarious thing again in my life.

There's no way in hell I want to offer that narrative to Reddit, because if they begin to believe that something like that might actually happen and Cohen doesn't deliver, that in itself would kill the squeeze."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You're gonna hodl regardless right?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I saw his edit at 1:11 and he already had the flair :'D
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Calls are very rarely executed they often are just bought back at a loss. Most people buying these contracts have no intention of then also forking over 100x the strike price when they could just as easily sell the contract and walk with the money.

Furthermore whoever wrote that contract likely hedged as it approached the strike price. So it’s not like Friday 4pm hit and suddenly now all these shares have to be bought.

I have no idea what I’m talking about but I did stay at a *Holiday Inn Express* last night"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"175 is the point this week where puts outweigh calls.

Last week, that number was actually 150.

They couldn't get it anywhere close to 150.

The next biggest call to put ratio swing was at 200.

Even below 200, call would have outweighed puts, but being above 200 had a significantly more amount of calls ITM than puts.

I'm assuming the same thing will happen this week. If they can't get the price below 175, they're going to try to at least keep it below 200. If GME jumps to say 300, they may have to adjust and try to get it to at least below 250. 

Their strategy for the week is going to depend on what happens with the price throughout the week. I'm not saying that GME will drop to 175. I'm just saying that if GME starts the week at 200, they're most likely going to try and play for 175."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,So I'm taking money from a retard? Geez that sounds bad.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Counter point:

Going all in on OTM calls is obviously fucking dumb, but at some point, the squeeze will be in full force, in which case, previously cheap OTM calls are now super valuable.

Having a small portion of your bet in OTM calls doesn't seem horrible to me. Over half of my ""portfolio"" is in shares, then I have a portion in ATM or near the money calls, then an even smaller portion in OTM calls.  Not saying everyone should do that, but it certainly doesn't seem ""retarded"" to me."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Its really not the definition and Einstein probably didn't say that.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,No.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the key people.  Either make reasonable calls or just buy shares.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,there needs to be a clarifyiable distinction when reffering to *deep* OTM calls and *hedgable* OTM calls. FDs aint gonna get this ball rolling.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If a majority of people thought that 800 was reasonable, GME would reach 800. A stock price is literally an attempt to get a consensus on a price that the average person considers reasonable.

A month ago many would have said that 200 was unreasonable. In fact, many HFs were happy to sell calls at 200 thinking it was unreasonable. However, general sentiment for the stock is now that $200 is not only reasonable, but reasonable enough to be valued at over $200 for almost 2 weeks. That's the entire reason why 200 was such an important price point for them last week. They didn't sell those OTM calls last week, they sold them weeks if not months ago. 

800 may seem unreasonable for you now, but what matters is not what you as an individual thinks, but what the market as a whole thinks. That's why the stock market changes every day. That's why it's so much fun for me. I love watching how opinions change over a period of time."

I guess I'll wait for the morning post and read some more comments then. My gut says that saving a couple hundred on a call isn't worth it since this thing can pop right from the bell.   


The main thing I'm not sure of is the borrowed shares. I know the numbers are really low right now, but I remember seeing 1.8 mill in ETF and 800k in shares. And in the past, those numbers would dwindle throughout the day and come back up towards the end of the day. It didn't thin time - but that doesn't mean the hedgies aren't still holding onto them. That's what I wish I could find an answer on"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,If GME's price goes above 400 this week.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the classic stop digging when you’re already in the hole example.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Short squeeze was Friday to Tuesday January 22–26. January 27 and onwards was the media hype and retail investors. It was sparked by the report in cnbc on Wednesday where Melvin admitted to losing 7 billion and closing their short position on Tuesday. 

The Short squeeze generated an insane volume of almost 200 million shares per day for three days in a row, and price spiked 4x from $40 to $150. After Melvin stoped buying shares volume subsided to less than 100 million shares per day, but retail hype still brought price another 3x. 

We have never been close to a volume of 200 million shares per day since to short squeeze.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,The number is a running total which includes the listed strike price and everything below the listed strike price.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean that if they have unlimited ammo, why did they let the stock jump up to above $200 in the first place? Why not just keep the stock below $40?

I just don't understand why they would let any of this happen if they have the capabilities to prevent it."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not do it yourself?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't know all of the rules. 

A short is technically the selling of a borrowed share.

If everyone borrows one share and sells it, the short interest should be at 100%.

However, there's apparently ways where you can sell a short that you've neither owned or borrowed. I don't know how they're doing the legality of it, the cost, or the extent of how much they can do it, but as of now, we haven't seen the limit to their shorting ability."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I would suggest that people getting shaken out are being replaced by those that will hold.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,But for every new paperhand there is apes like me who are just as excited if this stock goes down as up because then I can double down on my shares.

Why would someone try to convince you to sell a stock? If you didn't believe in a stock, would you go around message boards telling people not to buy and to sell? 

Chances are if you're not invested, you won't care enough to comment. Chances are if you would benefit from someone selling their share, you would try and instill fear.

Words are very powerful and we should be careful in which words we share with people."

""but what we are actually seeing is a whale vs whale showdown. "" I have read posts and theories about it but I am not convinced. I honestly think no one knows, who is playing whom. We do not know who is borrowing from whom, how much, interest rate etc. u/Corno4825 has posted updates but that covered just one site. So it's hard to tell IMO.

Yes, it did close above 200 but barely (200.xx) and it also took a dip (170ish) before closing.

Yes. I am also counting on those spike at the closing. I was hoping for a huge one last Friday, expecting to see closing price of 250+ but 200 was great too.

My belief is HFs are largely involved in selling both puts and calls, and will look for the strike where the sheer volume of both is lowest (basically within the strike bounds they were selling at)

Less shares ITM = less shares that need to be bought as well, the puts and calls don't cancel each other out, shares need to be bought for both"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,175 is enticing to buy at.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Did...did you just explain how to hedge a YOLO? How dare you be both high risk and low risk at the same time
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,If you aren’t buying 800 calls then you are just dumb. This is literally once in a lifetime play.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"That is why Tesla made $745 million in profit off selling cars last year (it's primary product) and somehow had a market cap of $750 billion a few weeks ago. That's a thousand to one price over profit. I understand that Tesla makes sexy electric cars and gamestop sells physical gaming paraphernalia, but that isn't what determines the value of a stock. People need to understand the power of raw hype."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for this text. That's an really interesting view on the market. As a bloody beginner it would probably have taken me some time to give some fast changing numbers such semantic.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The way I see it, apes should definitely buy shares and hodl vs playing the options game.  Citadel is the biggest MM in the options market, so they can manipulate it however they want to be beneficial to them.  Gamma squeeze could possibly lead to moass, but there are a lot of other things that also could, and the moass should be apes’ main focus.  The more apes can starve the GME market of shares, the better the chance of moass..."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"True but you don't begin your step at 800, you want to spread it with weight at atm calls or just couple of deltas above atm. Need to lead them towards 800s. It won't happen if many just took extreme position."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I like your posts and comments. Thanks for taking time and effort. Upvoted.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm thinking GME needs more even distribution of these calls in order to trigger a gamma squeeze. There is some pretty great volume b/t 2-400 and then it kind of trails off b/t 4-500.

Of course the volume @ 500, 600 + 690 is pretty huge.

Anyway if a squeeze happened now, looks like it'd be pretty difficult to get close to 500.

GME would need some sort of catalyst to get some momentum on the way to $250 + we would need to fill in the gaps on calls b/t 4-600.

My $0.02. 

EDIT: Swapped out some pronouns"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This [MIT paper](http://www.mit.edu/~junpan/npp.pdf) will help understand the asymmetric correlation of how buying OTM calls in a high Implied Volatility helps the options Market Makers lower the price of the stock to protect themselves.

The TLDR conclusion is:

This finding is consistent with option market makers changing prices in order to protect themselves from investors with volatility information and with their becoming more concerned about protecting themselves at times when informational asymmetry is especially high."

Edit: I'll explain, you pay interest on those shares until you return them. You can choose to keep paying interest forever."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Share volume was 2 million right at close on Friday. Even if the average volume per person was 100 shares ($20,000 each at $200 a share), it seems very improbable that 20,000 people all independently decided at once that they were going to wait until the last few minutes to make a transaction."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"184.70 is a key technical level - crazy how it bounced off of it 3 times

159.20 same thing..

If we get above 231.5 it's possible we run to at least 295.

edit: 250 also getting respected - so potential resistance; 172 also respected, which is a short term positive, don't be surprised if it bounces hard off 172 or 184.7 or 159.2, but we're holding 184.7 so far so good. And flip side if we break 348.5 let's kick the tires and light the fires"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I...feel like you didn't actually read anything I've posted. I never claimed that 800 is the first step. I don't think anyone actually believes that 800 is the first step. My original post shows that the total number of options that would be ITM stays steady up through 200. Once it goes above 200 though, the number of options that expire in the money increases significantly. It's showing that 250 would be the first step, followed by 300, 350, etc."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ooh. A peer reviewed source. Thanks.

I'll read it and see what I can understand from it."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just don’t overfeed them, we don’t want to krill them by accident."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm pretty sure its saying that if the stock price rises past those strike prices then there will be that many contracts ITM. The point of this post is apparently to give a guideline or benchmarks that need to be hit to start a Gama squeeze. I don't necessarily put a whole lot of stock into things like this, I think all the hype around Gama squeezes leaves people deflated when the price doesn't skyrocket the following Monday morning, but it's whatevs."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The subtitles are added for comedic value, but its not what is really said in the video. The video itself is an ad by the Berlin public transport company"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Chicagoan here. That's pretty cheap. I pay $8 for a single train ride from the suburbs to the city.

A monthly pass is $160-240 USD.

Edit: it was pointed out that our more inner-city public transportation is cheaper ($100/mo). The CTA lines would be these smaller routes whereas what I mentioned being $200+ is the Metra which can take you as far as 70 miles (112km) and would be on the upper end of cost at $240/mo based on it being the furthest zone from downtown."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I prefer my pain in monthly installments, like student loans."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You dont have to pay lump sum. You can pay per month for the yearly ticket and it costs 63 euro (maybe now its 66 for new contracts)
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,When I visited Berlin I just rode all the public transport for free lol
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,What does your comment mean sorry xD
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's 60,66. Also monthly, not yearly."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Monthly* not annual
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is still 60,66€/month (sub). A single monthly ticket costs 86€ but thats not what the ad is referring to.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The 86€ applies only for a monthly pass without subscription. With subscription and monthly payments it costs 63,42€ at the moment. Also, you can lend the ticket to someone else and take another person with you on evenings and weekends."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's €3 a day for the working week. I think that's fair. Especially if it allows you to go anywhere in Berlin (which I'm not sure about and so if you're a Berliner pls clarify).

A monthly ticket from zone 6 to zone 1 on the London underground costs £260.

Edit: and I have bern corrected. It costs €83 a month to go anywhere in the Berlin metro."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's cheap.  Day pass is 9 EUR, so 3/day for the work week is super affordable."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Seems cheap to me.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This reminds me of a famous German short story we read in my high-school german class.  There is a father who's pride and joy is a very nice copy of the bible.  He comes home to find his family is disrespecting it, and then he goes crazy, kills his kids, throws his wife out the window, and his glass eye pops out at one point.  It was not revealed earlier that he has a glass eye."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The joke is that we understood why it wouldn't be funny for a German speaker, but that we bring a bias of  a widely established trope that changes the interpretation.  Like, no matter how hard they try, Germans can't escape the fact that they aren't funny because of a pre-existing idea.

It's more of a laugh at my own expense over that fact that we're all susceptible to ""the bandwagon effect""."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,The Metra is not the equivalent. Our CTA (downtown metro) is comparable to what they are referencing. Ours is $105 for a monthly pass so it is still a little bit cheaper there ($78usd).

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Suburbs to the City and you DARE call yourself a Chicagoan!? 

But yeah, the CTA would be the equivalent as opposed to the Metra. Regardless it's still way cheaper since the CTA monthly pass was like $105 or something per month last I rode. Additionally, that pass lets you get *everything* for the CTA where iirc the Metra monthly pass is limited to zones except on the weekends."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well in germany public transport is free for children too

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Minneapolis here. Our Metro 31 day pass is $90 for local peak hours and $120 for suburbs/express peak hours. I thought we were pretty expensive. But there's still not enough public transportation here imo.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that's what the comment I replied to already said."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"1. there are three zones in Berlin ([1](https://www.visitberlin.de/system/files/styles/visitberlin_content_image_medium_visitberlin_mobile_1x/private/image/Tarifbereiche_Berliner_Nahverkehr.png?itok=XfS38CTD), [2](https://sbahn.berlin/fileadmin/_processed_/d/d/csm_tarif_map72_b926a683a7.jpg)), and this ad I think covers only zone A and B (the ticket these day costs 63€).  So it is the whole of Berlin including the outer regions, but the next state (that is partially included in Zone C) is not included and would cost an addition 33% (~20€).

2. This is only half the truth, because if you are a student at an university an apprentice at a company, you will probably pay half the price. Seniors are another thing entirely.

3. In addition, the ticket can do more than advertised. In the evening of every weekday and the whole weekend, you can take one adult + 3 children with you and they dont have to pay a dime. Also the ticket is not bound to your person, you can give it to a friend for a day and they can use it instead of you."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty silly to compare a zone 1-6 ticket to a regular ticket. A monthly zone 1-2 ticket in Paris is 68 euro.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Not really. But the whole system is better than Baltic countries and most other countries in Europe. And almost all European countries have better public transport than North America. So it is really dependent on where you are located.

With regards to the public transportation, it really is fantastic. Granted I don't have that many places to compare it to, but I thought Dublin, Ireland had a really nice system until I went to Berlin. In America, even most major cities have really bad public transit, and medium/smaller cities have next to nothing at all. Chicago is held up as one of the better examples, but it's complete shit compared to Berlin. Then Houston is.......yikes. Let's just say it's one of those where you definitely need to make more money and get a car.

Meanwhile when I was in Berlin (hard to believe it was almost 5 years ago!), for 81 Euro I got a Monatskarte, which gave me unlimited access to all forms of available transportation within the A and B zones of the city. That's a very large area, and I could get from virtually anywhere in the city to anywhere else in the city in less than an hour, including walking time. It was really nice."

But what the BVG does is quite clever. They openly acknowledge their problems (which obviously aren’t that serious as they are being made). In this respect, the video is indeed an ad because it makes them more sympathetic.

Even if you aren’t living in Berlin but somewhere else in Germany, chances are high that you know and like the BVG more than other public transport companies because of their regular and often self-deprecating ads. I don’t even know any ads of the company in my city but many of the BVG."

Being content with what we have was never something germans were good at! I can understand that it looks different for people from the outside, but it really went downhill since our railroad system got privatized. Same goes for the Telekom that owns majority of the telephone grid. Privatized and since then it went downhill.

&#x200B;

>Then Houston is.......yikes. Let's just say it's one of those where you definitely need to make more money and get a car.

&#x200B;

The same goes for if you aren't in a city in germany. The moment you are living rural, you absolutely need a car, or you're lost. I used to live in a village where we had no train, no bus, nothing. The next train station was about 10km away. We had a shared taxi, which you had to call hours before you wanted to go, so it arrived in time, if you were lucky.

&#x200B;

>I could do a *lot* worse than Germany.

2021-03-21 11:38:17,wallstreetbets,"Oil DD *Ape Noises* Let me explain.

When COVID smacked the world in the teeth OPEC decided to cut oil production by around 10%. Otherwise all the OPEC countries would literally go bust.

2019 oil production was \~101 million barrels per day.

To-date OPEC has still has a 7.5 million barrel cut on oil. Becuase they want to see REAL demand and REAL growth from economies before they increase supply again.

**Let’s do some intense math: 101-7.5 = 93.5 million barrels per day of current production.**

**Hmmmm**

What is current consumption?

Look at the pretty circle below. Road uses 35.23% of demand for oil in 2019.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[A circle](https://preview.redd.it/fhu1ntn24co61.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbfa930ea6a259fcf77c06149d131387d85a9eb0)

Not sure if you can see this next picture but it’s “August 2020 traffic volume trends” over the years. Obviously during Covid it fell off a cliff as you can see by the blue line below falling off a cliff. It dropped by about 10%.

So I equated that roughly to about 3.5 million barrels of oil per day. This pickup in driving has yet to come back. It has not yet reverted to mean. (average).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Traffic volume trends](https://preview.redd.it/gb4i15q54co61.png?width=446&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e8237c90d736a548419586c7334519b8f92dab0)

Airline industry next up. Althought airline industry only uses like 8 million barrels of oil per day (out of total pre-COVID of 101) it is still significant.

Pretty chart below shows number of flights per day (thousands). As you can see, pre-COVID it dropped a lot, and now is still down 40%. Which equates to a 3.2 million barrels per day missing that has yet to revert to mean.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[flights](https://preview.redd.it/z81qnzma4co61.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a5bf4453240718cf211f5203445c08f3af19422)

# Let’s summarise:

1. Road 35% (Still needs to revert to mean)
2. Electricity 20% (Stable decline in consumption yearly)
3. Petrochemicals 13.7% (Stable growth in consumption to offset electricty decline)
4. Non-road 11.47% (Don’t know)
5. Other-sectors 20.6% (partly airline consumption of 8 million barrels per day before crash)

**Current consumption (according to my envelope calculations) =93.62 million barrels**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[production currently close to consumption](https://preview.redd.it/do25f9xi4co61.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=e835c1c60ec04b2aa042d0b7e35a55c49477e877)

&#x200B;

# So consumption currently ~ production.

We have OPEC who recently got fucked from COVID now waiting for economies to recover. THEN they will increase supply. Imagine you’re business got reckted, obviously you’re gonna wanna make back your money before your reduce prices).

# My conclusion?

I think oil is going to hover here 60-70$ Until demand from airlines and roads pickup. THEN OPEC will increase supply, but I don’t think they will increase supply before."

Edit, this data is typically delayed since they need to gather the data to publish it."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the DD.  Always love to discuss oil.  A few things from an old oil freak:

A lot of the global production and demand numbers, take them with a grain of salt.  OPEC produces around 1 out of 4 barrells.  Most of those country's have law making oil data a national secret and they publish an 'official' account.  Its a bunch of guesswork, and whether its really 8 or 7.5, or 6 mil shut in is guesswork.

&#x200B;

What i know is US drilling has ground to a halt, and US production is down 1.5 mil barrels already.  We have a long way to go to get back to balance.  We also don't know how much work from  home can balance it all or not.   

So what the trade?  If anything i take the 'its going to be volatile' trade.  I might want to check out the IVs in OXY, the most indebted of the oil majors.   I bet they are high, but if they ever drop while oil keeps hovering at 60, id buy an ATM Call and PUT.    WHAT?  a Call AND a PUT?  Thats insanity.

Yes it is.  But if oil blows up OR crashes it pays.   If it stays put, I'm fucked on both.   

Its called a 'long vol' trade."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The long term trend for oil production is down. 

The switch to electric cars is being accelerated by western governments banning pure combustion cars in the next 10 years. China will likely move in this direction to cut pollution.

Combine that with renewable electricity generation and non-road consumers switching away from fossil fuels and there may be a tipping point where oil use nosedives.

In the next 20 years we may be in a situation where the only major consumers of oil are airplanes and large ships.

20 years ago we didn't have iPhones or Tesla. Now smartphones are ubiquitous and all major car manufacturers are making EVs and some, like Audi, have stopped developing combustion engines. 

In 20 years we'll have cars, trucks, and ferries that can be changed fully in a few minutes. Many of them will be self-driving and can be hailed like the batmobile.

These things are already happening and the tipping point is coming.

That's 9% of global oil demand. As the B117 variant continues to strengthen across the globe, with vaccines not keeping pace, we're going to see more shutdowns. And here, we now have 5k cases of B117 and we are opening up everything. we have only vaccinated 40 million in 4 months, and the vaccine only lasts 6 months. If we have to close down again due to B117, as well as other countries, you can kiss oil bye bye again.

2021-03-21 06:44:47,wallstreetbets,"Palantir: There and Back Again - PT $45 EOFY Hi everyone, this is my take on Palantir. I've been writing this for a couple weeks now and decide that I need to get this done today so hopefully it reads well. This post is my personal opinion and analysis. Welcome any questions and constructive feedback. For full disclosure I invest in PLTR and nothing beats doing your own research in addition to reading other people's DDs.

**Deep value investment for the most important software company, PT $45 EOFY:**

I believe Palantir has been and will continue to disrupt not just the software industry but how dozens of sectors and industries operate. What we’re seeing here might be the next Amazon with a company that does not mind short-term losses and invests aggressively to achieve long-term hyper and exponential growth. If you look at companies that shy away from making such a level of investments into technology to please their shareholders in the short-term, such short-sighted actions do no justice for those wanting to hold onto their investments over the medium- to long-term. I am incredibly excited about the recent Titan release with 4 new modules that includes an AI assistant and an automatic reporting tool. My target price for PLTR is $45 EOFY, key modelling assumptions include:

* Palantir will be a +$20bn revenue business by 2030, driven by significant growth in number of customers and revenue per customer, partially offset by 1-2% churn each year. Growth rate +30% over the long-term is consistent with what we've seen with Amazon / AWS and Salesforce. There will be increasing demand for data analytics solutions and full stack operating systems like Palantir as corporate/governments undergo transformations and identify new use cases for the data that they have.
* Gross margin around 74%, in line with most other software companies.
* Exponential growth and margin support by Apollo's automation of the implementation and post-implementation support would enable massive implementation across thousands of large-to-medium-size customers that would otherwise not be possible with the current headcount at Palantir. Like Alex Karp said, software allows small companies to compete against rivals 10x their size.
* EBIT margin will expand to 27% (including stock-based compensation) by 2030. This is conservative when we compare to MSFT which is operating at +35%. I also assume a normalised 18% on sales & marketing which is on the low side if you compare to CRM at 40-45%, but given Palantir's current partnership model I think this is justifiable. 17% R&D and 5% General & admin.
* Significant shareholder dilution going forward. I use a share base of 2.2-2.3B for my per share calculation to factor in the dilution. Assume no share buyback.
* Normalisation of interest rates to 3% and lower beta (basically lower volatility) over the next 10 years.

Note that while my PT is definitely lower than other moonshots on this sub (I'm talking 60/100/150/500), this is based on readily available datapoints, moderately conservative assumptions and assuming investors will not be willing to pay crazy multiples for the stock.

**Management is sandbagging revenue guidance, are we doing the same?** Management has been overly-conservative and this was one of the main factors causing the share price to tank following what I would consider a very positive Q4 and FY20. With 45% revenue growth for Q1 and 30% for FY21, this implies that Palantir has to really mess up a lot of things in one or two of the remaining quarters (y/y growth below 20-30%) to miss or even to just achieve their guidance. Below is an analysis I've done to show if their guidance is true they will grow at \~19% y/y in one of the quarters which isn't great. So it is more likely than not these guys will outperform their revenue guidance by a significant margin this year. With their 2025 revenue guidance of $4bn, I believe this is also very conservative and it is not difficult to believe the annual growth rate can be 35-40% y/y instead of the guided 30% CAGR. By 2030, at the current rate of growth plus a bit of uplift this business can get to $20bn in revenue or even $30bn – such growth is not unheard of if you’ve been following Amazon / AWS and see what they’ve achieved. Also, the TAM for PLTR might be a lot larger than what management has guided (I note from [C3.AI](http://c3.ai/) filing that they estimate their market opportunities to be in the range of $240bn and growing) but of course penetration of that TAM will prove challenging for Palantir.

&#x200B;

[FY21 revenue scenario, Assume Q2 and Q3 both grow at 30&#37; y\/y, this means Q4 grows at 19&#37; y\/y](https://preview.redd.it/4nu7jwnynao61.png?width=1616&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef8bd9288faf885fca364e9e837ee28946216231)

On another note, in FY21-22, we might see a significant number of customers entering the Expand and Scale phases. In 2020, Palantir had been able to acquire 400+ new Acquire customers on top of the existing \~125, making their customer pool 500+ at the lower end. If they manage to convert all of these new Acquire to Expand/Scale that would add +$4bn to their top line, assuming each customer roughly pays $10m a year to Palantir for the software.

**This business can become extremely profitable.** While both Alex and Cathie have focused their attention on investing more into the business by forgoing profitability now, in the long-term all businesses need to be profitable so I don't suggest we ignore profitability completely. The case might be that Palantir can become a lot more profitable than what we currently see with the level of automation Apollo and future add-ons can handle. Operating leverage will also enable PLTR to expand their margins. In a bull case, gross margin and operating margin may expand to +75% and 30-35% respectively as stock-based compensation further normalises in the future. R&D, sales & marketing and other expenses will still grow in absolute terms but will eventually become smaller portions of revenue.

**Future stock-based compensation will improve.** From PLTR’s SEC filing, I was able to get a sense of what the stock-based compensation will be over the next 3-4 years. I forecast stock-based compensation will reduce from $1.1bn in FY20 to \~$414m per year over FY21-23. I also looked at the stock-based compensation expense of other software companies to make sure that there is nothing odd going on with Palantir (see figure below). For my modelling I assume that over the long-term, stock-based compensation will stabilise around 8% of revenue (which is a lot lower than companies like ServiceNow but still above average for well established software companies). Besides the financial, it is noted that stock-based compensation allows Palantir to attract the best people as well as providing their people with incentives to further their contributions to the business.

&#x200B;

**How long is long-term?** With a stock like Palantir, it seems to be the case that Alex Karp's horizon is beyond 5 years, possibly 6-7 years. The trajectory of the stock will likely be sideway for long and moon/mars long into the future. The point when they reach profitability will be key to the moon phenomenon, which I'd say they can be profitable earliest 2023, base case 2025. So just to reiterate the same thing that Alex Karp has said but cater to our short-termism a bit better, if you're a short-term investor with possibly less than 2 years investment horizon in this stock (2 years is at the very least) then I'd go for SPACs or follow meetkevin investments....

**Key challenges to Palantir:**

We know Palantir has a very good product, but there is much to prove with its business model. Below I note some key challenges:

* **Relationship with IBM and Amazon:** It is great that Palantir has been able to secure two very good partnerships with two juggernauts. However, the level of leverage that Palantir can pull in these partnerships is weak imo as Palantir is still very small and has limited capacity to push through sales. Over time, I'd expect Palantir to become increasingly independent from IBM and Amazon, with the two only providing the hardware and cloud infrastructure for Palantir and Palantir to substantially upscale its direct salesforce to capture more share of the market.
* **Competition:** Though we may say the TAM is $120bn, $500bn, $1T or even $2T, it is clear Palantir won't capture the entire TAM. Organisations may continue to use their existing systems or choose another vendor. Palantir's potential customers may not have the same horizon as Alex Karp's and they may opt for quick one-off solutions rather than a long-term commitment to Gotham/Foundry/etc. Such level of inertia will slow down adoption of Palantir's products. There might be other companies jumping into this space. I do note however that it will also be challenging for other companies to compete against Palantir, especially the bigger players as their large structure prevents them from investing sufficiently for what is still viewed as a niche market.
* **Shareholder dilution:** Part of the reason why it seems PLTR share price does not go up as much on green days is the market pricing in the dilution. While we may think the share base to calculate the per share valuation is 1.83B, there's 500-700m more shares that will eventually dilute the stock, lowering the per share valuation (assuming no share buyback). This factor is also the main driver of the discrepancy in the PT that people have for PLTR, not really revenue and operating income by themselves alone. I note that this dilution is common for many companies but it is however very significant for Palantir. Valuation needs to consider dilution.
* **Transparency into financial disclosures:** Palantir currently does not have the best disclosures in their 10K/10Q/S1 if one has spent time looking at other software companies' SEC filings. For one, there is no breakdown between software and services in their revenue which makes it hard to understand how much of their revenue is coming from the actual software. The stock-based compensation structure is difficult for investors to grasp that somewhat have hidden the significant level of dilution that we're going to see in the future (that compounds with the investor base dominated by retail). The Acquire/Expand/Scale disclosure does not exactly show how many customers have moved from Acquire into Expand and so on. Overall, Palantir can do a lot better in their financial reporting.
* **Public relations:** In my opinion Palantir has not exactly done its best in terms of communications to its investors and obviously maintaining good relationships with the media and Wall Street. While Alex Karp may like the fact that retail investors are dominating the base, I think a more balanced investor base with growing interest from institutional investors will be healthy for the stock (which is actually what we're seeing more of). Good relationships with Wall Street will be key in balancing the investor base. This is not saying PLTR to forgo all of its long-term values but rather they should engage with Wall Street in more regular and healthy debates that will benefit both Palantir and the St, and giving the St more opportunities to understand the company better. This is also not saying Wall St should all put BUY ratings on PLTR because they have the right to have their own view, but a good relationship will give any PT and rating a more objective touch. In terms of communications, I envision Palantir to somewhat move in the direction of Salesforce which has done very well in this regards by developing free online courses and low-code/no-code chill-out conversations that investors/layman can jump in. This would further Palantir along the adoption curve and make Palantir a household name. Recently, the Titan release is not known unless someone goes through multiple loops to find the link so such release should have been announced publicly either via the News section or on Twitter.

**Palantir is still trading cheap compared to some of the recently listed software companies**

Price/Sales or P/S is the key metric for a company like Palantir. Anyway, you can see that Palantir is trading cheaper than 6 other companies at 41x (Snowflake, Crowdstrike, Roblox, Zscaler, C3 AI and Datadog), 4 of which have an average BUY rating from analysts. One thing to bear in mind though is that the whole tech sector has been trading rich for a while now so it is uncertain at this stage to know whether there will be a correction/normalization of multiples in a rising interest rates / inflationary environment. In other words, will 20x P/S be the new normal? Or +40x P/S will be here to stay, let's hope for the latter.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Very nice OP but a few key things to note: $45 PT for EOY is feasible, mine is $69.69. PLTR is also is a weird spot because so much of the business is “I can’t speak about that”. I personally really like Karp but I’m sure the suits don’t (especially Morgan Stanley) if you remember MS was supposed to be their underwriter but Pltr said Fuck’em and went direct listing instead. MS in feb 2021 said Pltr is underweight but upped the PT to $19 (from $15 in November) in October MS acquired Eaton Vance. EV and MS have been gobbling up shares (I believe EV has a $16 cost basis...) it’s safe to say that at the top levels of MS they know more about PLTR then 99% of government employees. They just want cheap shares... institutional ownership is at about 17/18%... they’re coming to load up.. Now for the growth... 8 of the top 100 companies with work with PLTR, 24 of the top 300... their clients spend more with them after being hooked... before they got 3M I knew they needed a medical supplies client...3M is a massive get. Medical supplies manufacturing is the epitome of what pltr is made for... now whose next? Imo it’s going to be from the following sector, tech or finance. MSFT needs help with this hack. They need to start analyzing the data they compiled and stop it/track it/end it... Finance, PayPal. This is just the beginning. 💎💎💎💎💎"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I miss these DDs and actual posts before WSB went mainstream bro there were actual ideas. I got into PLTR at $9 Oct28, sold at $29 shortly after the drop from first ATH of 33."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,EOFY = End Of the Fucking Year
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You son of a bitch, I’m in 😂"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the reminder. Need to buy more.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,How bout 45 eow
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Let me free up some monies... I'll load up more
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I think most of us need PLTR $45 at end of the month lmao.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I also like PLTR as a long play, and doubled my shares on Friday.
I think I'll continue to look for dips to buy more.

To me, they have a some great ideas including their Foundary ERP. If they end up being right, they will be ahead of everyone with a tech that their competitors will find difficult to replicate."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do you think the large float will inhibit high share prices akin to $SHOP & $TSLA?

People love to compare $SNOW being $300/share but Snowflake has a float of like 250-300 million... Pally is at 1.8🅱️illion"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,More like 450 EOFY
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Pltr is a buy below $10

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s your confidence level you applied? It seems like you hedged low. Interesting DD but I think your data and expected catalyst do show more upside. 60 EOY is fair value.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Tldr
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Hope your right. My wife and her boyfriend are balls deep in PLTR.   But DAM SON!!! 2030?

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This company’s software is the greatest invention since google. If you don’t get in now while its low you’ll be kicking yourself later when it hits 85 by december.With the integration of ibm Watson it gives software access to AI supercomputing alone,not even talking about AWS.But what do I know?this is not advice btw,just a idiot with an opinion"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pltr is too overhyped. Won’t be over $45 for long time imo 
Hope I’m wrong and you make tons of $$. 

Good trading stock though."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Where’s the WTFL;DR? Jesus Christ!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I guess you are doing a dcf. Instead of diluting the options, why don't you treat your future share based comp as cash expenses? 

Value all options at whatever palantir is valuing them on their 10-k and deduct them from your Equity value.

What's your WACC? and PGR? What tax are you using? 

I'm using 10%, 5% and 28%, did not model NOLs.

D&a = capex = 1% of sales

Nwc is 2%

I get to $40 using your 20bn sales by 2030 with 36% margin

[Edit 1] did you also factor in that they might need a follow on and how that would dilute?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,In papa Karp we trust

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"They are already profitable on a non-GAAP basis, .06 EPS last qtr.  This largely ignores RSU compensation, and means we don't have to wait until 2023 to see green EPS, which I think they will do regardless in 2021."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,End of the year? So long!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why does everyone keep fucking saying “might be the next Amazon” as soon as I see that, my brain recoils in horror and I stop reading... fuck I hate that shit"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,So many words
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not sure if it’s in your DD , but what is your expectation of PLTR reporting its first profit? - edit : is in the DD , estimate is 2023 -2025 ... though they already exist for over 10 years , what are the chances..

Furthermore PLTR partnering with Amazon for cloud services is a huge GPDR risk IMO given the sensitivity of the data that is processed. As an investor I’d definitely would like to see concrete plans to untie its dependency with AWS on the short term."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish i knew what EOFY means...

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I continue to be surprised by people’s hard on for Palantir. They received a huge 36mil contract to provide a data enclave for COVID-19 data from US healthcare institutions. They don’t know what the fuck they are doing. It’s the biggest shit show from a data platform perspective I’ve ever seen. It’s so bad that as part of the recent PASC RFA, the National Covid Cohort Collaborative (N3C), funded by NIH, is actually trying to partner with OTHER data platforms instead of using whatever crap Palantir has cobbled together. Ya’ll are wasting your money on this bullshit.

The entire collaborative has been working IN SPITE OF Palantir, not because of.

Total available PASC funding is around $2 Billion dollars. Should suggest something if people are dodging Palantir for this.

Edit: lol I share first hand experience regarding a tens of millions of dollars contract with this company that goes against the hive mind and downvoted into the negatives. Your money to lose, enjoy."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I think you're too invested in palantir. I've seen too many posts for palantir on wall street bets. It's a SUPER long term profit horizon and you have headwinds from an overinflated nasdaq. You're not reading all headwinds. I feel like this post is extremely misleading.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,ok... yawn fest then... \*sigh\*
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,So i didnt read because i cant but  in my head see world where the govt weaponizes retail investing. Pltr cia backed no? Investing in the “person of interest” seems so uhhhhhh cia made memes type. Be careful ape

At current price it is a great time to load up on PLTR."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha we all like that but hey here are the facts.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,when sometbing is this volatile it could easily hit 45 for a couple of days and crash again
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol for real, his PT is $45 by the end of the fiscal year but if you are a short term investor (<2 years) you should stay away??? I guess fucking 80% gains isn’t good enough. Super confused by that in this post. Sometimes he sounds like $45 is 10 years away."

We seen PLTR hit 45 only a couple months ago, now we're sitting at January levels again. This may be the only time you'll see it at 24 if they pick up some contracts after demo day."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is there a time limit on DD. Can't go past 2 years out. Please email mods in r/investing, let them know someone escaped their retirement home and need the nurses to go find him.

By the way, thanks for all you do for this sub!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's up to the Palantir team to execute on. Switching cost is high so they need to be able to convince potential customers on their value so they can switch from existing contracts to Palantir. Palantir does give out incentives in the form of $0 contracts to new customers so that might work. Also, once Palantir has demonstrated 1-2 years of values from the commercial contracts that they acquired in Q4 2020, they can put together very strong proposals to go to market. I do think there's always a degree of competition but yes no direct competition at this stage."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is hard to tell how the market will price tech stocks in the future and I'm no jpow. The market might take a more cautious stance on tech stocks so we might not see people willing to pay for previously high multiples anymore. What that means is it will take longer for PLTR to get to its valuation, the current price is probably safe with good support at 20-22. I already take into account higher interest rates in my calculation (just like what Cathie said on CNBC) and the market should already factor that in imo."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,The entire interest rate BS is bunch of boomer horse shit. Fuck em. I've been buying as much tech as possible
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree that the big banks do have very good understanding of Palantir, especially Morgan Stanley as you pointed out. The facts say it all. It'll be interesting to see how Palantir fares in the coming years. Obviously they have a good product with great customers but their goal is to go mass market and serving the medium-sized businesses as well as the large."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes unless they reverse split. 

SNOW has crazy stock-based compensation as well but nowhere close to Palantir (at least for 2020). Also SNOW is a much younger company that is growing faster but from a smaller revenue base than PLTR. I think these are the factors explaining the difference in where they're trading right now. Of course at \~100x P/S SNOW is very expensive regardless."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,45.0 EOFY. You forgot a dot there.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah my wife's boyfriend's DD is on target tho. Thx
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You're holding PLTR for 10 years?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If talking about operations and execution, on a scale I'd be more confident in Tesla than Palantir (not talking about share price just how the two businesses are being managed). For one Palantir is extremely promising but they do have limited track record in commercial and their capacity to push through sales themselves is still not there yet for mass market. They have shown they are able to execute relatively well since listing which is good, with a few key points remaining for them to improve on. 

There's certainly upside to the stock like it might be a $30-40bn business in 10 years instead of just over $20bn and they might get an operating margin of 35% instead of high 20s%. What I think make a difference between say my $45 and your $60 is the share dilution. If I assume tiny dilution then the target price will be closer to yours, but the market seems to be pricing in the dilution so I'm not confident on $60 myself. 

Anyway, at the current price there's a lot of upside potential in the stock."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,TLDR: He likes the stock.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,TLDR: PLTR
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,What about 2030?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol. Do your own research mate that doesn’t sound good that you don’t know what they do.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Possible but not probable.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Happy trading.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is almost a Day Trading stock, if you're patient with it, it's got a trading range roughly of about $23.50 to $26.50 right now.
So it's like an every other day trading stock, which will keep you out of hot water with your brokerage firm."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes DCF. Yeah could have done that just my method of doing this and other companies that I've been following. WACC 8-9%. TGR 4.5%. Effective tax rate 28%. D&A & capex similar. NWC ~1%. My revenue is actually $22bn and margin 27%.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"My share base for the PT is 2.2-2.3bn which basically assumes all in-the-money exercisable options are exercised + repurchased and + the RSUs and GUs as of today. But in the future they'll grant more options/RSUs as they hire more people which is hard to model. They also have a 2020 Plan for the Class A shares which I understand effectively dilutes 5% each year going forward.

In terms of cash flows, what I have is positive cash flows in 2021 and beyond, despite still negative net profit so it looks to me they won't need another equity raise."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes agree. I was referring to GAAP EPS.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sometimes I get that as well. I think the reference to Amazon is mostly to the philosophy and how long it takes Amazon to reach profitability. It's not exactly saying Palantir will be the same size as Amazon in 10 years, that won't happen. There was a lot of doubts in Amazon's early days, they were not profitable for a long time, they invest aggressively for the long-term and is now a giant, and that pattern sort of repeats with Palantir. In the text I think I did refer to Amazon but more about justifying my growth assumptions and also management's assumptions."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,What are you waiting for?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,10c 1/1 2030
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,My expectation is 2024. Also want to note their own forecasts might be pointing to 2023 because they expect to repay a major part of their debt that year. I think consensus is earlier than 2023/2024. Early profit might not be a bullish signal for the longer term though because they still need significant ramp up on R&D and salesforce to capture market share. Right now their salesforce is still below 50 while IBM is at 2500+ so that sort of shows a lot more room to grow.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes that is an assumption for the statement. You can assume $100k a year if you want. I just want to use a number that is slightly more bullish than the average revenue per customer they currently have. I’m not even assuming any of these customers will pay what BP is paying.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Make that May 19th to the 24th on their next earnings report. Just on speculation, I would think the stock would be in the low $30 range"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"PLTR to $45 ""Early on Fiscal Year"""
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Bots and HF interns use technicals phrases like EoFY.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If the broader picture recovers well I think $45 is easy. From where it currently hangs out it touched 45 just from a demo day and they have another one next month. PLTR's detonation was kinda foiled by the happenings of the last two months. 

As much as I cant wait for what I currently have to take off I dont mind a little delayed launch. I'm happy to pick up an extra share or two every pay day."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It can but less likely in this environment.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The way I see it is you have two sets of stocks. (1) is 80% in year 1 and 5x over the next 5-6 years. (2) is GME up 80% in 1 day but probably does nothing for the next 5 years or even crash down to where it should be. If you're long-term you go for (1), if short-term you go for (2). Up to you if 80% is good enough or not. If the $45 sounds like 10 years away for you maybe you're in camp number (2)? That makes sense?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,What's your PT? Why do you think $30 is more reasonable?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey guys, retard here. I hear lots of great things about this company and their lack of competition. Is competition really non-existent for Palantir? Would you think Google is a threat to this company long term? Google's stated goal is to develop AI, so I'm told. Google is sitting on piles of cash and plenty of bright minds and loads of data, so I believe they have the capability to produce something that makes Palantir irrelevant.

I'm kinda just trying to find some negatives. I am buying PLTR and will continue to buy dips. Thanks for the DD!"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you a novel writer for your day job?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yo thanks for replying , what’s your take on my point about GPDR?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It's public cloud so can be easier for hackers to penetrate.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"As someone who has dealt with GDPR very in depth my experienced opinion is Palantir has zero issue with GDPR.

First, GDPR has several cutouts that protect companies when they are using data for security reasons.

More importantly for anyone concerned about GDPR with Palantir, it’s not their data.  They provide the software solution to mine the data.  The organization who has the data using Palantir would be the ones that need to make sure they are GDPR compliant.  That would be like going after Microsoft for something  a bank did violating GDPR data because the data was in a SQL server.

Zero issues."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It's End of Financial Year. But you know what you can interpret it like with BFR.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn, so do the opposite."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Demo day will probably be positive again. Q1 reporting in May might go either way imo.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Touched 45 just from a demo day \*when there was a lock up of 80% of shares.  OP was correct in noting share dilution and the lack of stable institutional ownership has been an anchor.  Still bullish on the stock though.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"But PLTR was trading at around 10 in Nov 2020, which is just a couple of months ago. There is a good chance the stock may crash further given the overall volatility of the market. There is certainly room for that crash."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,yeah youre right
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Nope.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"My price target? That depends on what timeframe you are talking. This year it is impossible to know but  if it just stays at the current level that is great.

The companies you compared palantir with are also extremely high valued, thus making it difficult to gain a fair price on palantir by comparing them.


Interest rates are likely going to increase a lot the coming years, thus making capital harder to come by for palantir, which is going to impede their growth and increase the costs of their current loans"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think that would take years and too much effort. Palantir needed years to get the first government contract.
Imo it is much more likely that Google would simply buy PLTR if the price tanks. But as I remember the founders have special F shares with a huge amount of voting power."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, everybody out. Everybody out. Except Stanley..."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Amazon hold it is. Difficult to say where PLTR will land in 10 years. Can be $1000-2000 no one can be sure.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I see no reason to sell...the real gains will be made years down the road when they're done burning cash.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Chicken stock
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,The one in the post title
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Nope. I enjoy writing though.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't know the exact detail on which client goes through IBM vs AWS. IMO if I'm a public sector agency I'd consider IBM + PLTR because of the hybrid cloud infrastructrure over AWS's focus on public cloud. Historically PLTR has worked well on AWS and Azure so I don't think this is a major issue. Palantir also has their own data sharing and security measures to manage the risk. I suppose an absolute no no for Palantir will be Snowflake but if they partner with each other it'd be fun to watch for sure. I don't see the partnership with AWS to go away anytime soon because Palantir will still need AWS's cloud infrastructure and AWS is \~50% of the cloud market.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure there is a very strong security argument here- but last I checked, GDPR doesn’t cover security in great depth.

Curious about this since I have built a few GDPR compliant products (hosted on AWS) - am I missing something about GDPR or have I misunderstood your point on this?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"So did I. In this case I came up with dec. 31st. Either Google is very unhelpfull or eofy is a massively unnecessary way of saying end of year (EOY).

Wish I knew why dec.31st is EOFY..."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Nothing that you could officially share ? So you got all that bs out of your a55? At least back it up with sth tangible

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I suspect once PLTR reaches $20, there'll be heavy buying from institutions because that's where most of their PTs is. That will stop or at least slow down the drop to $10 if that trends."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"How about 1 year and 5 year PT? Of course it is impossible to know that's why they're targets and estimates. You invest in PLTR?
The comps table I have at the bottom include the major software companies and I suppose many trade high. Palantir is still in the growth phase so I wouldn't expect it to trade like an IBM. Comps table is good to compare the pricing of the stocks but not great for the fair value of the stocks so that was not my method for deriving the target price. Instead I used DCF."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"For sure, I hear you. I don't think Google would even be trying to create software or an OS like Palantir has. I'm just slightly worried that successfully creating AI would indirectly make companies like Palantir irrelevant, because AI can do it better than intelligence augmentation basically.

I read confirmation bias on companies I like all day, so I was hoping a few apes could fling some poo on some of my positions. I figure it's healthy.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Side note: My amzn price target was 3k when I bought years ago. Now it's here and I'm like...what do I do I never expected to get this far!

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Realistically in 10 years. I am feeling confident it hits 250-500

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Would have never guessed
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I think I'm just referring to risk of public cloud over hydrid cloud. I'm not an expert on GDPR so good that you talk about it.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you search for end of fiscal year USA? Because my Google search told me that the fiscal year begins Oct 1 and ends Sept 30

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The something tangible that won’t land me in shit will be when NHLBI announces who gets the funding for PASC and the data platforms being leveraged. I’ll give you a hint, none of them will have Palantir."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't look now, but PLTR is over $20"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I see that the price bounced off of 20 pretty hard previously. You may have a point there.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"In one year I really dont know. Maybe 28-30. 35 isnt impossible but it depends on the interest rates, how well the economy recovers, inflation. In one year we might even be below the current palantir price. 


In five years we might see 100-150, depending on how well they hit their targets and what their new targets are in five years. Yes I own palantir and I am planning to buy more over this year.


I dont plan on selling anytime soon though and I think palantir is a great case"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"PLTR does have its own AI. You can read it in their Titan release (but I'm sure they've had AI technology way before today). I think intelligence augmentation is more about using AI to help companies make decisions. The artificial intelligence way of thinking about AI is to fully automate processes so no human is involved (like Tesla's FSD, Google's search engine, IBM Deep Blue, etc). Doesn't really matter now as Palantir's OS is now integrated with IBM Watson through the IBM partnership.

Google can certainly enter the game and compete against PLTR for sure even though they'd be some years behind and might not have a clear edge for a while. The challenge with Google is because they're large, it is difficult for them to justify putting money into Palantir's target market because right now (or previously) it is still smaller than Google's other revenue pools and most of their focus is in AI not data integration. Google is also not exactly a company that is focused on enterprise software like Microsoft, IBM, Oracle so they don't have much of a competitive advantage in this space. Also, Google would be limited to its own cloud market share which isn't great - it is unlikely that they can partner with Azure or AWS to cover a larger customer base since these are all direct competitors.

c3 AI can be a competitor, noting it's more of a one-off solution than an end-to-end full stack solution like Palantir. 

Microsoft has multiple apps/tools that can be combined together to deliver what Palantir is delivering but would be more cumbersome and inefficient."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You do a new round of DD as if it's a completely new potential holding and use your findings to decide whether to maintain or exit the position.

This is not financial advice. I'm not even allowed to talk about my portfolio here."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Not serious. Too far away to tell.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,If they execute well on their vision I'd imagine that's possible. 10 years is a long time many things can happen.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Unsure how usa does it's thing so I figured there's a chance fiscal year is different from company to company, state to state, sector to sector or something. Added palantir as a search word and boy was I not impressed at the results. Shit in = shit out though, I guess.

Thank you for your superior Google skills."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"So potentially they might lose a contract which is actually fine to me. They can't win all the time as different organisations have different criteria that might change over time.

But can you elaborate on your comment ""They don’t know what the fuck they are doing. It’s the biggest shit show from a data platform perspective I’ve ever seen.""? How do you know they're shit? Which specific data platform do you think is superior to Palantir's?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,He belongs in this sub
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depends on his strategy, but if like 90% of his portfolio is index funds and 10% in in PLTR its not that crazy. He could have meant his only holding other than index funds."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's a good link. I haven't looked at many of these except from Tableau which belongs to CRM. But I've looked into IBM, SAP, MSFT, SNOW (not exactly competition I know but still need to look into) and AI recently and probably will look further into them and the ones in the link. Previously I had to divide my attention between multiple sectors so could not dived any deeper."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok yep that makes sense. I figure if PLTR can maintain around $25, demo day might push that to $27-28. If Q1 goes in the right direction that is a move to $29-30. Interest rates and inflation are big question marks right now. I think the first half of the year will be bumpy but second half will be a lot better. Nice loading up more shares!!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I really appreciate your DD OP. Thanks for helping me strengthen my very shaky thesis, if you would even call it that. Folks like you are the ones who make this sub great."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Fair point.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Let's hope you're right. Knowing this forum I just assumed it was 100% of his portfolio.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm glad you liked it. I have longs in PLTR but I'm not going in big yet because I don't understand their business, I understand what they do and their services but it is complicated for retard like me to understand and estimate and evaluate the value they are generating (it is not like AAPL that I could simply analyze their product and estimate how it is going to grow for the next 5-10 years) Your post is good but you are biased, I see a lot of smart people on the internet are bullish on this but I need more reasons to buy this instead of other opportunities. 

If you had the chance to look into those alike competitors and can update your DD it would be great.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well I predicted 30 by earlier this year and it didnt really happen. So given the fact that I'm a Retard and I only got lucky on amzn:

30-40 by November 21 (October is governments fiscal year). 40-50 by end of 2022. My long term price is anywhere from 100-300 for PLTR.

I own leaps for Nov and for 2022 slightly below those targets.

If you don't understand their business don't go big, invest in something else in addition to PLTR. Enterprise software is hard for retail to grasp so things like AAPL a lot easier.
Yes I'll have a look and write something up on that."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You weren't too far off. And it won't take much to get to $30 It's got a lot of resistance around 27. I think the next earnings announcement is around May 5th.

[Naked Short Selling: The Truth Is Much Worse Than You Have Been Told](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m9d549/naked_short_selling_the_truth_is_much_worse_than/)

Original Article by James Stafford:

[Naked Short Selling: The Truth Is Much Worse Than You Have Been Told](https://www.yerepouni-news.com/2021/02/03/naked-short-selling-the-truth-is-much-worse-than-you-have-been-told/)

Excerpt:

> Hordes of new retail investors are banding together to take on Wall Street.  They are not willing to sit back and watch naked short sellers, funded by big banks, manipulate stocks, harm companies, and fleece shareholders.

> The battle that launched this week over GameStop between retail investors and Wall Street-backed naked short sellers is the beginning of a war that could change everything.

> It’s a global problem, but **it poses the greatest threat to Canadian capital markets**, where naked short selling—the process of selling shares you don’t own, thereby creating counterfeit or ‘phantom’ shares—survives and remains under the regulatory radar because Broker-Dealers do not have to report failing trades until they exceed 10 days.

> This is an egregious act against capital markets, and it’s caused billions of dollars in damage.

> Make no mistake about the enormity of this threat: Both foreign and domestic schemers have attacked Canada in an effort to bring down the stock prices of its publicly listed companies.

Also:

> And big banks and financial institutions are turning a blind eye to some of the accounts that routinely participate in these illegal transactions because of the large fees they collect from them. These institutions are actively facilitating the destruction of shareholder value in return for short term windfalls in the form of trading fees. They are a major part of the problem and are complicit in aiding these accounts to create counterfeit shares.

Focus:

> Their MO is to short weak, vulnerable companies by putting out negative reports that drive down their share price as much as possible. This ensures that the shorted company in question no longer has the ability to obtain financing, putting them at the mercy of the same funds that were just shorting them. **After cratering the shorted company’s share price, the funds then start offering these companies financing usually through convertibles with a warrant attachment** as a hedge (or potential future cover) against their short; and the companies take the offers because they have no choice left. Rinse and Repeat.

This predatory short activity by hedge funds did, in fact, happen to Canadian pot stocks before the COVID crash last year.

Which other Canadian stocks are being attacked like this?

Moving on:

> McMillan also noted that “the number of short campaigns in Canada is utterly disproportionate to the size of our capital markets when compared to the United States, the European Union, and Australia”."

Some random ramblings:

Real-time or more up to date information:

In today’s rapidly changing markets, having 2 week old data is nearly useless. In this day and age there should be no reason why we can’t have real-time data on short interest and positions.

Right now shorts don’t have to disclose their positions regardless of size. Regulators should make shorts disclose their positions just like longs have to.

Fail-to-deliver: 

Regulators should require which entities are generating large amounts of FTDs, and why is that happening. Right now we don’t know who is loaning shares they don’t have. All we have is basic information the stock and the amount, but we don’t know from whom.

Dark pools: It is estimated that roughly 40-50% of trades are executed via dark pools. Some experts are concerned that this is causing an effect on actual price discovery. 

PFOF:

our orders be routed to the exchanges first for price discovery, then from there route to the market makers for trade executions. By ordering our orders to MM first, seriously opens up for abuse and conflict of interest."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"im in a canadian OTC (nexcf - nextech ar solutions) and we are waiting for the day the all mighty nasdaq accepts our uplist. its frustrating seeing spac's getting to the american markets asap for the cost of cash of course, meanwhile, having to battle being 60-80% shorted week after week after week.

&#x200B;

the volume is low also in canadian markets, making manipulation ALOT easier, in the stock im in, it has like 100-200k volume with 60-80% of that volume being shorts.  100shares pending the time can lower the price of the stock significantly.

&#x200B;

luckily im in love with the company and love the actually business side of things along with the staff, watch all the presentations i can get my hands on and loving the progression of the company over time so i can handle seeing swings in the stock over and over again.

&#x200B;

and yes im a degen, and actually have 95%+ of my portfolio in this small canadian OTC looking to get the almighty tendies!!!  (only 17k usd) so, seeing the gains over the past year has been amazing, but the last 8 months have been a roller coaster between 3.50$ - 7.00$ month after month it swings up, then down and all based on very low volume.

&#x200B;

pray one day soon, it will leave the canadian market and join the american market for the hopes of more volume and the hopes of more institutions to buy large amounts and hold."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Exro was attacked by Mariner Research who is a shit hedger that loses way more that it wins.  3 weeks now Mariner has been unloading shares as it looks like they have been warned or told by SEC that they can only unload shares and not affect the price.  I know it's long term commitment but just watching the stock sit at relatively the same price sucks.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"American here.  My best advice is to buy and hold something thats shorted into oblivion.  Then when your friends are curious or ask what you've been up too tell them, and tell them why you're buying stock x because stock market doesn't equal economy . Just a legal casino for the upper class. 

Find yourself a room and don't fucking leave,  instead invite some friends and share individual ideas and maybe they buy the same and hold .

Also everyday this upsets you, write someone who can help before taking it to internet. I do it too. Prime Minister, senate(?), or whatever yall have similar. Just lay it all out and let them know it all.  They'll either be fine and complicit,  which is ok thats where we are now, or they'll help.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Trudeau is probably in on it. Texas suing Biden because of the XL pipeline cancellation is more help for Canadian jobs than Trudeau has ever done.

That being said, it's not hard to see why some companies are being shorted when Trudeau keeps raising Carbon taxes and throwing up red tape deterring investment in the first place. 
Then there's the random taxes that could be added on to businesses at anytime.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maple Syrup DD:

Go Vermont Maple Syrup retard. Boiled today, came out with about 60 gallons (great day). Light freeze tonight and back up in the 50s tomorrow which is the ideal temperature fluctuation for sap production. The sap will be flowing as fast as your call options will be rising. 

Light winter this year and the ground never got a hard freeze here in Chittenden County. This is beneficial to the maple trees as their roots don't get a solid freeze. This enhances their sap production in the early springtime when you're making your golden amber syrup which is softer in taste and the typically choosen flavor around the world (you pussies don't have the stomach for dark VT syrup). Product line this year will include old and new favorites: maple candy, maple ice cream (several flavors), maple popcorn, maple cotton candy, maple glazed donuts, maple hot dogs and the age old sugar on snow. The new reverse osmosis machine enhances the purity of the syrup and efficiency of the system. The natural gas evaporator allows for consistent syrup production at a lesser cost. Getting about 24 inches of mercury on the vacuum system right now and sap is coming in like a bastard.

Add all that in with the fact that last year's season got cut short due to covid and with the vaccine distribution, people are ready to get out and about again. Sugarhouses already have been as full as can be so far this year. 

This is far better than ornamental gourd futures because if it goes tits up (literally no way it does though) then the worse case scenario is you have breakfast covered for the next 20 years.

In short, I like the real maple syrup.

This is not investment advice. I'm retarded and currently live in a state full of actual retards."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Demand for real syrup is a growing market. Too many people get sold a bag of goods with a claim in the product name that it's real syrup or real Vermont syrup when in fact it couldn't be any more fake. More and more people learn the truth every day.

Product development has allowed for year round syrup demand. While true production only lasts a few weeks in the early spring time, product sales are year round. In fact, some of the most profitable months have come in the summer during maple ice cream demand time. International shipping for syrup at a flat rate cost through USPS. National 2-day shipping for ice cream with a guarantee. Maple candies are always in season. Maple cream can go on toast or donuts any day of the year.

Improving forestry techniques allow for the healthy growth of maple trees and production. By definition, production will increase on a per tree basis as the trees grow in diameter and total root system and can accommodate more taps. Meaning tap counts on a per acre basis should improve year over year with proper forestry efforts until maximum capacity per acre yield is achieved. This would be the point at which your mature trees have a max tap count (3-4) and you have a healthy population of younger trees (1-2 tap count) to take the mature trees place when they die out as an on-going cycle that will outlast the sugar maker and hopefully be past down through the family or company. At the point of max capacity production, one should be making enough gains as to purchase more sugaring lands and rinse and repeat.

You're not wrong in your bearish assessment that total syrup production would not be able to meet a sudden mass increase in demand as things stand now. To this end, real syrup is not advertised around the country, despite shipping availability. I'm saying go long in this position. Look for above expected earnings reports around sugaring season as an indication that sugaring technology (vacuum efficiency, evaporator efficiency, RO efficiency, ect) is continuing to advance. The annual diminishing population base in the far north of the US also will contribute towards a lesser demand there and a high supply point going forwards.

Check out CDL and Dominion and Grimm products as they are the two maple product development leaders and any big news or a product release from them should be reflected in the following year's sugar production.

(For those who don't know, the entire process of getting sap and making it into maple syrup is called sugaring. Those who make maple syrup are sugar makers. This comes from a large increase in the production of maple syrup in the 1940s when the US government imposed the sugar ration to help with the war effort. To make up for this, people began making their own sugar products such as maple syrup to try to create equilibrium with supply and demand)

Population is helpful, not detrimental. Economy of scale.

Even ignoring that: Ontario provides healthcare for ~14.5m people. That's more than 46/50 states. If you really think more people is somehow worse and less efficient then only California, Texas, Florida and New York will have a harder time than Ontario.

> Wait until we have it in the states and the 30 million illegal immigrants (the entire population of Canada) beats you to the hospital.  

In Canada you need legal status to be covered by the governmental insurer. Illegal immigrants, tourists and whatnot are still getting handed a bill. Hell: a citizen can get handed a bill if they move between provinces and don't have their provincial coverage in order.

> No such thing as private practice doctors, they'll all work for government owned hospitals.

You have no idea how it works, do you?

>  My 48 year old doctor gave up his practice because the government wanted to pay him $18 a patient. $18 fucking dollars!

$18 for what? Doctors don't bill per patient, they bill per billable item or procedure. Current OHIP rate for a family physician doing a basic consultation and nothing else is $72.10. That price goes up if >50m and >75m is spent doing it."

2021-03-21 05:20:43,wallstreetbets,"$FSR is worth $58 a share I have put my life savings of $158,000 on Fisker (previous thread for proof) and I am going to explain why. Read before you shitpost.

Book value: company has $1b in cash and no debts. Its fair value is $5/share. It cannot go lower than this unless the company were to burn all the cash and create no marketable product.

Forward looking: Production is not for another year. The stock market is as psychological as fundamental. DeepFuckingValue primarily invested in GameStop before the new console was released because he knew investors would become excited towards the release date. It's a similar concept here. As production nears, investor sentiment will only increase.

Bears will say the EV bubble has already materialized for FSR. It hasn't. Here's why: TSLA trades 6.5x projected 2025 revenues, NIO about 3.25x. **FSR is currently trading <.5x projected 2025 revenues.**

So what is a ""fair"" multiple for FSR? I do not think Tesla or even Fisker's multiple is fair at all. Tesla has Elon Musk as a CEO's premium that Fisker will never reach because its CEO is known as a failed automotive CEO that has already bankrupted a company. It is also a battery company, along with NIO, something Fisker is not. That is outsourced to Magna. So those multipliers are unlikely. But a 1.25 multiplier is very reasonable. That is a $58 price target and 16b valuation.

Management cares. Fisker has already bankrupted a company before and he will certainly not want to again, pretty much it's all or nothing here. His life is on the line right now. He, his wife, the CFO, and others have shown this by all taking minimum wage job salary cuts in order to maximize shareholder value. The company has also utilized cashless warrants to minimize dilution (and shows they are confident in their cash balance to reach production)

Obvious risks: partner Magna cancels the company is probably cut in half valuation, reservations could miss, funding could miss, things get delayed.

It's worth a bet. I trust Fisker to make it right here. And if he is right, investors will be very well compensated. Thank you. You may shitpost below."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Who has 158k of life savings at 22?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,What kind of drugs did you sell in high school to get 6 figures?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Is that you Donald Trump?!?! Lol $158k of life savings @22 smh
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You can't have a life savings at 22. You haven't had a life yet.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,How is the EV market going to be different from the traditional car market once it's established with more manufacturers? Tesla has the main advantage of being firstest with the mostest. 5 years from now this market will be saturated and require huge ongoing capital expenditures and R&D just to remain competitive. What advantage does Fisker have in that market?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"FSR went kaput and came back to life because of EV hype, and still no car. Worth a bet but not your lifesaving. Obviously OP has no idea how hard it is to work for that amount of money.

Can go try Farrady Future another kaput company. We can get the gang back too - RadioShack, JCPenny, Blockbuster, they can promise not to go bust again."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Spoiler it’s not
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait. I couldn’t get past the first line. What kind of 22 yr old has $158k!?

“Life’s savings” at 22 is supposed to be like $5000 😂 maybe $20,000 if you didn’t go to college so you didn’t spend it."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol what kind of analysis is this. Tesla has a high multiple because of stuff like energy and fsd plus it’s already proven it’s ability to scale
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is honestly dumb. This ""multiplier"" is so arbitrary.  This company and the CEO is garbage. I mean maybe the stock will be doubled in a few years? Maybe? There is just so many more appealing long plays rn. FSR is just not worth the money resources imo. I wish you well though and I hope it works out for you. Maybe some big innovation will happen in there and you will get lucky"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I didn’t do the work myself, it would have cost me almost $3000 to retrofit a EV charger to my garage at my old house because I had to literally upgrade the wire coming from the street and my panel and meet updates code which included, I shit you joy, having to install hardwired smoke detectors in order to get the electric company and city to approve doing it. There is such a barrier to entry with these cars and the only brand with a network of actually fast chargers is Tesla. I now live in a city and to install a EV charger my building would have to be involved on top of the electric company and the city to approve the permit for the work and I would not be able to do it myself. For just me it’d cost $5K to get a charger in my own parking spot I pay property tax on. I used to be able to charge my car at work. Now I have to go to a charge station and sit there forever because they’re not the really fast chargers Tesla has. Yet another electric car company run buy a guy who has done nothing but fail in this arena mixed with the reality of barriers to entry on top of an already very expensive type of car makes me invest elsewhere. I don’t know where people think all this electricity is going to come from if we go all electric."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I worked at A123Systems.  Companies like this LIKE to go bankrupt to clear their debts.  Tread carefully.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You will make some money but this company is going nowhere in the long run. Where the fuck are you going to buy Fisker cars? GM,Ford, VW are going to be the real plays in the EV market (wait until Hyundai/KIA go balls deep into EV, that's going to be the big player)."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"How are you hedging against a recession that will likely destroy tons of companies without cashflows?

Not saying it's going to happen but it's worth thinking about."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds like a dumpster fire and a pipe dream to me. All the best though 👍
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m right with you on that it’s my second biggest holding behind FLGT. I think Fisker has it right
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree on Fisker and I am thinking of buying or flex leasing(Ie subscription) the fisker ocean as well. Just missed the stock at 15. Was hoping to catch it again.. I'm in for long term on this one when  it drops to a more affordable value for me.
The car, I will still try to get regardles."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can't compare a company that is relying on an outside partner to build the cars with companies that are actually building their own cars. My bet is at best, Fisker hopes to drag out the inevitable long enough for one of the big auto makers to buy them out."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is hot BS. Tesla, NIO? Add VW, GM, Ford, Hyundai, Toyota.. list goes on for the EV market. They are all fighting to get the EV customers, and they got the muscle to do it. Fisker is binary at this point, if this fails - everything fails. It's a huge risk, and there's a ton of better risk/reward stocks than this garbage"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You seem like a real prick putting your net worth and age in the first line. Your post history asking about mixing coke and viagra confirms this.

I also think fisker is a dumb gamble. With that said, I am long one call and up a decent bit on it. But that’s tiny part of my portfolio and I think there are so many better yolos. Why not split it between CCIV, NIO, GOEV, and XPNG? I hope you’re at least planning on selling OTM calls

Edit: also there is almost no DD in this DD"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,fisker is worth whatever the market is willing to pay for it. not what your stupid DD thinks it's worth. get that through your head.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here’s my take on FSR. I think OP is too young and really hasn’t done their DD, but whatever. I’ve made substantial money from scalping this ticker. But it’s not because i think it’s a non value company.

EVs are the future and there are a lot of companies out there - good/bad. If you do enough research, FSR is a good bet in the long run. This is not a get rich quick play but FSR has all the pieces in the right place imo. It’s not saying much and it’s not a DD. I just agree with the OP that the ticker is a good play, not based on OPs DD. I have my own DD on FSR and it’s my own. Do your own reaearch"

* You did not refer to irrational euphoria that exits in EV, particularly TSLA
* In a recent 12 mo period TSLA revenue up 25%, TSLA stock up 1500% - irrational euphoria = 1500.25 = 6000%
* Irrational euphoria, = using a company with no revenue and no salable product to companies with revenue and products"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I think the only victims of the EV bubble will by Lordstown and Ideanomix. The rest will find their place.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Fisker has a long way to go. A partnership with Magna doesn't guarantee success. They will have build quality but they aren't pushing much innovation.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"IMO?  His solid state battery tech is 4 years out, and by then someone else will be making the same thing (like TSLA)

He's not producing cars available for sale yet.

To be honest, it feels like hes trying to have another kick at the can, using the Fisker brand again despite the former bankrupted company.

As for this DD, meh.  go ahead and blow your ""lifes savings"" on a gamble.  Its gonna be a while before you reap any reward, if at all.  shit, one tech market dump or this guy fails to perform and miss a target or benchmark, scheduled release, and your life savings are gone."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"1b in cash, no debt and NO PROFIT. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,you must have done some serious research to find an EV company that makes cars with lower margins and worse build quality than tesla.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This smells like shit. Good luck.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah first sentence and I already hate this dude haha
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I didn’t have much. I only started off with a small loan from my parents of $158k.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,He removed the age lol
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Where does he say he’s 22
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Reminds me of the 19 year old who bought a quarter million of GME.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have a total net worth of roughly $70k at age 24. I'm throughly impressed with someone younger than me having more than double.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,He gambled 10k.to 150k. GME on the first round I guess.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe he cashed out on GME. Having $10k after graduating high school isn’t unreasonable and if he bought $5,000 worth of GME when it was around $5 a share he could easily have more than what his life savings are right now"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I request a salary of 158k/year.

Also can’t YOLO my 401k so that stays in aggressive ETF’s.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,What was your starting salary out of college?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good for you man. I was making a passive joke about his low key brag. That was unneeded information that he gave and societal cues indicates that's exactly why he said it and thus he came off as a jerk . It's good for him, but he doesn't need to let us know.

But, honestly, we're all just jealous. Median salary in the US is a little under 50,000. And that includes people working until they die. Hitting these numbers at 24 for you and 22 for him is amazing compared to most of the US. It took me another 5 years or so to hit those numbers and that's with being married in a dual income marriage. I have always considered us well off."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not. They should come back out and advertised that they are a gaming company and sells computer or parts for gamers like Corsair did.

These small potatoes should tone themselves down until they can proof themselve if they aren't trying to rip people off. Tesla manage to manufacture a bunch of cars and sold them before they IPO...these guys? Got a drawing and maybe a partial working prototype like Lucid, and then claim Tesla-like valuation."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,$20-40k by 18 is very reasonable. I graduated college at 22 with about $5k left. But where does a kid get $158k!? Not even assuming he spent any of his life savings on college. Straight out of college $5000-10000 is amazing for most people. Hell a positive net worth at 22 is even impressive

besides, an ex colleague joined Fisker to work there, and he's an engineer that has no engineering degree... He literally called somebody ""a idiot"" when that person called his bullshit for about 16 months before he left.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or dude just traded for money, just like everyone here has done"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it is indeed a big deal for many people. Very few people can say that they have 158k to invest freely, but you're able to do it at just 22. Many of us are skeptics, and to us, having 158k at 22 to spend on the stock market is almost impossible due to paying for school fees, housing, daily expenses, etc., so it's really easy to assume that you're lying, to put it truthfully. 

Some of the comments have been unnecessarily harsh though, I hope you haven't been affected badly by them.

Anyway, assuming you aren't lying about your age, I'll say good job on saving up so much at such a young age. I'm 25 myself, and I've saved up 20k for investing. Keep hustling"

The rest is in a savings account for unforseen expenses.

But my way to get a lot of money into my account is by working hard and a lot. I have had months where I get around $5k after tax and that sort of money really ads up."

I dont see the valuation being the same as your claiming. Tesla has to many things they are Into, thus, that value is higher.. battery. Charging. Hyperloop etc.

Fisker is just selling cars, not eternal energy and mars landing. I vote Why not on Fisker, if it goes up a little. I will take my cream of the crop and put it elsewhere. If not, I'm not losing 700 a share. Just 20ish."

Worth a bet nonetheless depends on how much you yolo, but I won't put anything more than 5 or 10% of my portfolio on this to begin with. Can't understand the 100% yolo - I would probably be more comfy dumping it all into PLTR."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Luck. I was had an internship through high school and they liked me enough to hire me full time once I graduated
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If F traded at TSLA multiple, it would be worth 5000/sh, Tesla just a hot new fashionable stock"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"HYLN looks interesting, but is it a SPAC? I want to be the one who times the SPAC crash"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice, my overtime was only x1.5"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,And put $30k into it the first 1-1.5 years!? 😳 man I took the wrong career path if I coulda gotten that right out of high school!
2021-03-21 05:12:28,wallstreetbets,First Post in the Group. GME to at least $400 by 3/26 
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"don't pay attention to the date,

the squeeze will happen tomorrow, we just do not know which tomorrow"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Next time draw some boobies on the chart, it’ll be more worth looking at!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck you and your dates.

Buy and hold apes.

It's the only way to squeeze."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I dunno. That shape looks more like the classic Alabama Hot Pocket. Not financial advice.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,But what does it all mean Basil???
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Im kinda annoyed now with these TA bullshit and writing down any date. We all clearly see that everyone fail in their TA as well as putting the date. Of course someone will be eventually correct, but thats just a lottery."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like a couple Star Destroyers headed to something that looks like a moon.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This means nothing to me. I’m gonna keep holding until I can name my price
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If this happens, I I'll take you to the bar of your choice and we drink till someone has to carry us home."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Ive seen enough of these types of “analysis” (and not just for gme) to know these shapes dont mean shit. They sure do have fancy names tho.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,For fucks sake can we stop with the dates
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Draw balls and penis so we can fuck the hedge fund.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Am I the only one who wants to see some skin in the game to go along with these triangles? 

OP has claimed $400 by 3/26 but shows no positions. 

OP needs to show positions or ban and give us an offering if it doesn't reach $400 by 3/26."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"1. Stop putting dates

2. This TA is worthless on a stock that isn't based on fundamentals"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it reaches $400 (during market hours) by 3/26 (inclusive), I’ll donate $1000 to the charity of your choice."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,The 2nd triangle looks like doritos
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"#the chart shows $401, not $400.  Can you confirm?...🤡"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Finally someone posted another date, I was getting worried it was gonna go to 0 😢"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop preaching dates. Full stop.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Confirm me harder daddy, deep inside my bias."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I want the mods to start removing posts that have dates on them.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy, hold, buy dips, hold, repeat and wait.  Be patient.  No one can predict the date.

All that said, the fact that great Apes like this are researching and posting and contributing is AWESOME!

All for Apes, Apes for All!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The Tendie Man just called. 

He said fuck your schedule."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I like these drawings
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,no 694.20
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"My plan when I first bought GME: Hold.

My plan after reading any DD: Hold."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Cool drawing
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Confirmed. Horned Pelican pattern is established.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Triangles yes
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,We hope so
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,your dingaton ratio is incorrect and displatted your fungerton value. Its suppose to be $600
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the stock.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Oooh flags!!!! I like flags!:)😁
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit!  With that many shapes and colors, there's no way your analysis can be wrong.  You know what they say,""A picture is worth a thousand GME shares"".  This is worth 10,000.  I'M IN!!!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"These technicals don’t mean jack. We need catalysts and volume. For example, Cohen becomes the CEO. If we continue to have low volume and no positive catalyst, the price will continue to trickle downwards."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Up arrows: check,
Lines all over the place: check,
GME in the title: check,

Buy and hodl"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Came expecting boobies on the chart. Leaving disappointed.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd say $500 🦍🚀
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like it'll form the 3 humped camel
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It would be nice but the more dates we put on this thing the more potential disappointment we set up for paperhanded cucks. This thing could take 4 years for all I care. If it means I can be a millionaire I'll wait as LONG as it takes!! All we need to know is HODL + BUY
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,First flag and arrow are smaller...second arrow is way bigger closer to 800 than 400. ♡ GME ♡
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,No more dates pls! We need to build trust and people to understand what buy and hold means for long term!!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Please no dates. this is so stupid and will only bring down moral in the long run
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Colors ✅

~scratches chin~

I'm convinced!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I think this guy is actually right.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Call or bust.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,The Tendie Man called. He said fuck your schedule.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,There was another DD that said 1000$ next week. So you are lying!!!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Makes ya feel better though 🤷🏼‍♂️
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you saying sell everything and stick 400c FD's up my ass on open? Cause if you're in I'm in 😏
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Everyday there is a new triangle prophet announcing a day
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If GME went up a dollar for each post in hot making a GME price prediction, we’d be sitting above $5,000"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is possibly the poorest attempt at a technical analysis I've ever seen. Your ""technical analysis"" consists of a bunch of huge up arrows and random fucking lines, which, by the way would not come in handy when analyzing important support or resistance zones."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean a certain coin hasn't hit 62k yet so my dream may be right and GME will hit $800 soonish
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"End if every month/beginning of the next there's been a little spike... next week's the week to see if the pattern continues. 

A note is. If or doesn't. That's ok. I'm holding anyway"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, I'm retarded. Would it better to buy in at market open or buy now, hoping it will have gone up over the weekend."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If its hits and holds $400 by EOW, I will shove $100 bill up my ass"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am a chef and that is a souffle rising........... oh never mind. It is just me pitching tent because I just looked at my 670 shares AMC, 30 shares GME . I am hoooooolding"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah, yes. Triangles. Nice."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought there was going to be no more talk if dates. When this doesn't reach 400 by then
It discourages people to hold. No more dates please"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,My 350$ 3/26 call really hopes you’re right
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ya, im expecting GME to beat earnings by a little this time, but next they will beat it by 100X
BTMFD is my plan"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Technical analysis on GME be like dumb shit.  Just go to the casino and play roulette.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This isn’t a chart of GME it’s my age, it goes up Friday. 

Come on guys, we gotta buy that float and Hodl. Let’s not put a date on stuff because the reality is until we Hodl all that float, we gotta deal with Shitadel and Melvin shorting the shit out of this stock."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,The man can write down a date if he wants. It's his fucking money and his shares
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Selling all my AMC at a loss tmmr to buy 3k more of GME
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Would you bet on it?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,So tomorrow just YOLO my entire saving at 0830? Well ok then I shall
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I seriously still cannot believe you fuckers see these charts and upvote it. You can seriously take any fuckin stock and start drawing circles , squares , triangles and lines .... literally any fuckin stock. Stop upvoting this shit. I’m in at 10 shares @ 34 bucks and still holding. Stop with the fuckin lines and charts for gods sake"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a common TA and it does normally signal up.  It’s not to be taken as THE answer but it’s a signal
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bet it's closer to $137 by the end of day than $400. Can we make it interesting, OP?

FWIW, I think this type of analysis you've given is as useful as astrology."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,IDK man looks 10M a share by tomorrow check out the swirling dickcheese double dutch anal bead.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,GME to 400 by 3/26 or ban
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Put some more up arrows that’ll help it rally! 💎 🙌
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,TRIANGLES!

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! 6 days
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the TA we are having a good discussion..... this is awesome!🦍
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I like those lines. Those are very nice lines. Vertical is my favorite
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah yes... lines that confirm my bias. I like.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm pretty certain what's been happening since late February is the redoing of late January squeeze, only several times biggest in magnitude."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks solid
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Sure. Why not.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe the plane lost some fuel due to adoptions.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I've always found technical analysis to be the astrology of finance.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This will either age well or it won’t. But I’m pretty sure it will be one or the other.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Get this astrology shit out of here 800 end of Monday
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,The only time that matters is 69 24/7.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Triangles, cups, handles, and now up arrows! The ape language evolves!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh this one got triangles AND arrows... must be good DD. 

Not financial advice"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Please don't set dates <3
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Needs more isobars...
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Shapes together strong

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It does look pretty
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,fuck me those triangles turn me on
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mmmm, yes, I do know these shapes as well. Triangles and Arrow."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seems good, I'm all-in"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I see triangles so it is good. Triangle * Triangle = Tendie^2
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh triangle, I love triangles"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah, triangles. The thinking man’s tea leaves."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy shares and hold.

Hedgies will do all they can to fuck your calls."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,No dates!!!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You forgot to put the k after that number. beginner mistake
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good, Ive been holding for my wife @$403"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The only date that matters, is the date ill be taking melvins wifes boyfriend out for drinks"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,That orange support line is what I've been watching. Very interesting.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Serious, How did you chart this? What studies did you use? I  a relative newbie. I truly appreciate your wisdom & knowledge."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fundamentals dont fly here.  
Only we do.  
\#rockets"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty colors, makes my mouth water for crayons"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I never understood where these patterns come from, and to me it just seems like astrology for nerds. Anyone else feel this way? Please help me understand."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro, I can see the hole story! I see a lot op apes ready to go to the moon, but before they will depart. It seems that they are raping a couple of HF funds.. 😂😂🛩💵"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dates to reach whatever share price might be shill tactics - As for me, I like the stock and ignore this shit!
💎🙌🏼"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I get we all eager for some squozen tendies, but this numerology crap is getting old.

No matter how many triangles and flags you draw, you can't predict the market. You can't predict what attacks the hedge funds are preparing.

All that adds to the euphoria and makes dumb people buy $800 calls."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Eventually you’ll be right. That’s enough for me! 🦍💪
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Upper bound should be 420.69
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for the analysis, but again every prediction we had always ocurred the opposite, thats why we agreed to not divulge dates, cuz fuckin shills gonna call daddy and say they expect 400 by friday"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Interesting... I see a lower shoulder, a head, and another shoulder... What does that mean?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucking TA on gme oh my days 😂
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Love when someone posts something potentially meaningful so you scroll through comments to see if theres further discussion and theres nothing but fucking stupid ridiculous nonsense. Im holding gme and i cant wait till its over.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thats the we gud line, its supposed to be purple tho"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah yes, the triangles, they give me hope"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Be careful of the long squeeze
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,ist it worth to buy them now?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Don’t you mean $420 ?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,gotta love a guy that has extra crayons
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Foolish of you to think TA works on GME, some might say retarded"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Do one for AMC!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this a shitpost? Lol
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Gotta stop posting dates. When it doesn't come true it kills the sentiment.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah yes, the long triangle, the most powerful of the stock shapes strikes again."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice crayons.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay so we know if it hits 400 its gunna be sometime after 3/26, got it."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Just finished my 8th grade maths geometry class. Ready to accurately forecast market movements now !
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck off mate, yet another date...🙄"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,One of these days the line drawings must be right
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are real traders risking their money based on some lines drawn in paint? Or this is just wsb thing? I'm far from trading, just saw this on popular."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,$400 positive thing is good but dont commit the dates. Apes dont care any deadlines
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,😂😂😂
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm convinced every one of these TA posts is trying to get people to buy options instead of shares and I'm downvoting them. You probably should too.

If you didn't buy options before the first run up, you missed your chance for the 20,000% option gains, now it's just throwing money at the people betting against GME."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you read horoscopes too?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ve seen so many DD posts saying when it’s gonna happen. Definitely THIS one should be the post on which we base our YOLOs. Thanks for the heads up! 
Derp."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I think we will easily hit 6 on this leg up
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I posted lulzy ""tech analysis"" on my profile if you apes want a smirk. 🦍"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dates are for paperhands. 

🤜💎🤛"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"We will see our tendies when DTCC takes the nuclear option and starts liquidating everybody involved. They've clearly been too screwed to cover in earnest going all the way back to when Cohen bought in. I don't know what phase of the HF grief cycle we're in but they don't appear to have hit ""acceptance"" yet, and it might take getting nuked to get there. This is why chart analysis may not be very reliable in the longer-term."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Mods should ban accounts like this that put meaningless dates and cause bait traps. If it doesn’t hit the mark in 26 ban his ass. Everyone just hold!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,They cannot get in trouble for issuing stock when they have the right to do so
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I see arrows in the money printing direction drawn in nice crayons, I’m in!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds legit
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Aaaah, I love the smell of confirmation bias on the weekend! I’m in, buy, Hold, rinse repeat"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"... ""at least""... ""by X date""...  


This is exactly the type of post that over promises and potentially under delivers. If your VERY PRECISE AND EXACT prediction doesn't come true - your credibility and that of the MOVEMENT are jeopardized. Just stop man. Use softer words, not exact dates, and for fucks sake just hold."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,An arrow pointing up means fuck all.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol whatever you say bud. Make sure to post your positions since you're so sure 😂😂
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,can we stop posting dates for fucks sake
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"After so many weeks of posts like this, and money wasted on weeklies, I’m beginning to think these are all just shill attempts to get us to piss away money on calls, instead of buying shares."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh shit, got Miss Cleo up in this bitch. Got it down to practically the minute when it’s all systems go for rocket launch. Get the fuck out of here with the dates. Enough with the dates. No one knows for sure. Buy and hold, it will happen when it happens."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,All that matters is that the next Option Call is at 170$ For the shit head HF’s. Hold and Buy the Dips.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Cant. Stop. Shaking. Need. weekend. confirmation. bias.   Ohhhhhhhhh that's the stuff.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn't all technical analysis just confirmation bias?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,stop with the dates bro it’ll happen when it happens just hold your god damn shares
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,The more shapes you draw on a graph the high the price will go.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the up arrows.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Hope you’re right. I just hold and buy when it dips.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is nice for confirmation bias but I think technical analysis is pretty meaningless for GME.

Show me the analysis that would have predicted the current situation.

You probably can't because that stuff only works when the market is doing its thing and the algorithms are humming along in the background.

Technical analysis is pointless when individual market participants are causing big moves that are not based on technical factors.

TL;DR Buy and hodl. 

Not financial advice.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Setting a price target and a specific date only raises expectation of newly arrived people and when it doesn't turn out to be that way, they get disappointed/discouraged, so I suggest that you present your TA without setting any dates on them."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I really love $GME and WSB community, but there are inaccuracies in this analysis. I suggest we re-visit the chart. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop putting dates and prices and screwing apes on options. Smells like shilling
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Again with dates only hurts us more !!!! It will come
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Quit fucking putting dates to this shit. This is what makes these idiots not buy shares.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If GME hits 410.14 by 10-12-2101, then I'll run for president and enforce a new law that all must donate a non zero number of bananas to the closest ape rescue and only work with palindromic numbers for the next 505 days."

Tea leaves are such fickle animals."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree but am unsure of the date, the jump to 200 took 2 weeks after the initial jump from 50 to 180, then to 100, im thinking the jump to 400 is more likely to happen in April, don't care if I'm proven wrong, just as long as it happens"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Using dates is soooo last year
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It could break down for all we know. Any massive date at this point has either been contrary to what is anticipated or a big nothing burger. Just buy and hold.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck! Triangles...my weakness
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,26th of March.... 2027
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,STOP SETTING DATES FOR FUCKS SAKES. YOURE SETTING PEOPLES EXPECTATIONS!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Triangle = BUY

I see."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"How many times will it take you stupid fucking OP's to learn? Stop setting dates, stop setting prices. It only works against you and your fellow apes. It is worse than FUD.

Set some prices alerts, lock your fucking phone, turn off your damn computer, and WALK AWAY. Too fucking easy, even a private can do it."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah triangles bitch!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,!Remindme 5 days
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I too hope it hits 400k
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,How there is enough time for my YOLO deposit to clear
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ve seen all of these, the cup and handle, the Tutankhamen pyramid, the teacher’s tits patterns and they’re always off. Just let this shit take off peacefully."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you're right, I'm gonna follow you"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Trash
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,we all know what this means. It'll sway sideways and tank at 230 by eow. cheeeeersss🍺🍺🍺
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"RemindMe! March 26, 2021"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"... ""at least"" means $397.98 before you panic sell.

DON'T SELL.  HOLD."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Time to buy calls and get fucked by another flash crash before my shit goes ITM
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,3/26? What year? 🤣
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh look another graph with made up lines posted as “analysis”
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,God I cant wait until gme bag holders get shit on so we can have wsb back.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,So all in 400c 3/26? Gotcha
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy $800 call expiring next Friday?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am going to repeat this message from here to eternity: Dates & DD don't mean shit. This is not normal stock. It is being manipulated to the nth degree. But the good news is they can manipulate it for so long and so many methods before it gets critical. Doesn't matter if ""all hedgefunds"" get in on it. All. Shorts. Must. Cover. Remember that. I will just BUY, HODL and STAY patient and vigilant. Let the cucks wriggle and squirm as much as they want. £2,000,000 a share. I also treat everything until the squeeze as a distraction. Even the stonk itself. It is merely the vessel to Valhalla. May we all reach it's peaceful shores."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,What's your stake?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Going to $120 got it.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,$2000 donation if we hit 400 by 3/26.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Wasn't it suppose to be 800 by March 19 lmfao moving goalposts
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This made my wifes bf  cry 💎💎💎🚀🚀🚀🙌🙌🙌🦍🦍🦍
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Earnings report cums in 3/23 and it’ll drop to $50 by the end of the week
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Load of bollox. People will panic sell before it reaches 350 just like the last time
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't clown this stuff. I used a simple tool to get a buy price on BB. Found one at $8.95 on March 16. 

$8.95 happened, but my date was way off—march 5. It's been up since then. Luckily I had some cash lying around, not as much as I'd planned for, but some. 

I was also right about the stimmies boost and subsequent drop—again, though, off by a few days as it dropped sooner than I'd anticipated"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh wow this TA is dank, let me get another hit of that"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably not
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,ah yes the old himbledy rimbledy bull shart chart here's my prediction based on how many eggs i ate this morning - moon balls on a day not a specific one just a day
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,(Insert really slow clap here)
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"First time making a chart too, I see."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Are those called vanishing lines?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,!remind me 6 days
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,That's my birthday:)
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"When posting prices and dates I already know you are a shill. We don’t put prices or post dates, the squeeze will come when it should and apes will just buy and hold."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dont do it, dont give ape hope"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well someone was born with a silverback in their mouth.

What’s this? A FULL set of crayons?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t want to criticize your marvelous drawing skills with crayons, but drawings are shit."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ya sure, mind sharing the exact time too?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Dont fall for this shit. Doing TA on a stock is like doing ur stock picks through palm readings
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"the arrows mason, what do they mean?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"every single prediction failed so far, so please stop it. Even because this is based on what? technical analysis? explain"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"First 3/19, now this week? Lol you 🤡s."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Is GameStop actually doing well or is this all the hype for the shorting bust up?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I concur.   
(though ER will be a wild card)"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,No
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"FFS.    How the fuck do you not know by now that buying options just gives the shorts more time???

And I see the shills are upvoting this bullshit

Congrats."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,If it does not happen you gotta give me 400 via PYPL
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This guy has so many different coloured crayons, probably only eats the brown ones like I do, a true commissure."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Can't tell if serious
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Another pointless post assigning an arbitrary date to something that no one can predict. How many inaccurate or incorrect predictions do you guys have to read before you stop upvoting these things?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"A ascending triangle just means a breakout.it’s more likely to go up, but could also go down.ta isn’t failproof"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Looks like you forgot to put one of your triangles in there, right after that purple arrow where it dipped hard"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Can someone here that is smarter than me rub both of their brain cells together and help me understand this?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm no technical analysis, but the squeeze hasn't happened yet so I'm not sure why you would be comparing non squeeze data with this unless you don't think the squeeze is coming for another few weeks (which I thought would come any day now but idk)"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"let me go put this on the fridge with a gold star. Good job, my lil ape. You drew some fake ass lines."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I wonder if GameStop actually started giving more value to games after all the support
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop with the fucking dates
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,!RemindMe 6 days
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"New day, new moronic “TA”.  Thanks for the laugh."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"OP post history has other comments saying “tomorrow is the day!” And several saying “please help I’m learning”. I like drawing shapes and colors with crayons as much as the next guy, but I’m hoping most of these upvotes are bots..."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Slowly I turn.... Step by step.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah yes, the classic ‘triple Phineas mode’."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Date prediction? Hope it comes true, but we're now past predicting dates. HF's only use these to their favor. The only plays now are BUY & HOLD."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,plz not TA again
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I too can draw colored arrows
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,NGL these posts are useless. Congrats on the cool Crayon box but what if the squeeze happens tomorrow then GME hits 30 after the peak. TA isn’t wise on this one of a kind situation. Now go get your wife’s boyfriend another cup of water. He’s tired
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,as soon as I see RSI and MACD i stop taking anything seriously
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,No boys PLTR TO 75
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,There's a graph....this DD checks out.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, tomorrow’s tomorrow is today’s yesterday"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"All you guys need to know is squeeze will happen sometime in the near future, during some point in your life. 
Just make sure you're not driving your wife to mandingo's house when it happens."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,He’s right you know.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I really want to be two days from now already. I want to read the complete story on wikipedia.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been saying this since everyone got excited for the 19th...don’t anticipate anything, don’t listen to dates, most people here a fuckin dumb (for real.), think for yourself! I get downvoted. 😂😂

Humans make me wanna vomit."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,What about yesterday's tomorrow? That'd be pretty great.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Just wait for market watch to tell you it's starting so you can jump in before the first big jump. They predict the future after all.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's been ""this Friday is going to be huge"" for the past five Fridays. If y'all wanna make people lose interest and get fed up with holding GME, you're doing the right thing. If that's not your intention, stop giving people set dates."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you just RAP at me??
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, he never started a year. Maybe we are waiting for 2095."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,We need a lot more people saying this. GTFOOH with your dates. It’s just sets people up for disappointment.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck the dates !!!!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes you're right this passive role of holding is not enough we need to find a way to get more buyers
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I have to wait for 2022 to get vaccinated, I sure as hell can hold for as long as it takes."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine really believing that a stock that has broken basically every rule and defies logic will in and way be predictable based on any kind of technical analysis.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree. Especially, since I wouldn't read too much into any TA with all the short attacks and manipulation happening. But what do I know ... I'm still pretty new to this monkey business."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do what I do

I get my investing advice from fortune cookies"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"if someone eventually will be right, then perhaps all of us need to give a specific date so that it comes faster. IF WON'T GUESS THE DATE IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN!

here is my guess: 20.03.2021

I'm a financial investor of D.N.G Capital, so you can quote me

&#x200B;

oh shit, wait DNG Capital is a real company, i didn't mean to give them publicity. I am from D (deez) N (nuts) G (give) Capital. So don't mix it up with the other guys"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Technical analysis is akin to astrology.  It will eventually fit some situation due to simple inertia, but there's no science to it at all."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s no moon. It’s a space station.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,And everyone is waiting for them to make the jump to light speed.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s because this chart is literally meaningless.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,">Ive seen enough of these types of “analysis” (and not just for gme) to know these shapes dont mean shit. They sure do have fancy names tho.

Pretty much.  TA is a fucking joke.  Especially with a highly volatile bstock doing illogical things.  Especially when applied by retards on WSB who read one article on seeking alpha about it and think they know what they're doing."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hear you. When price went from 40 to 349 after Jan, one of such shapes came true. You see so many such DDs / shapes here because many such attempts are being made to predict the future through analysis. Even if one of them comes true for a bull case then it's still worth the effort. So be patient, be supportive and enjoy the ride. Apes together strong."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Literally stonks astrology
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Also he’s basing his analysis on the last time it popped to 347 and then dropped 200 points. All of which was artificial and so TA is useless in this case.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Especially considering the earnings call is on Tuesday, which is a MAJOR catalyst. Who knows what will happen."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah yes the bullish cock and teste shape
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Agree
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, I do have skin in the game. I know asking serious questions is not cool on this sub anymore and diamond hands, strong together, etc. but I cannot even imagine what's going to happen on their earnings call on Tuesday, lol. They will have to finally comment on all of this craziness. They'd have to be idiots not to issue more stock, right? but I'm also not sure how that looks optics-wise or legally? Can they get in trouble with SEC for issuing more stock during this squeeze? Also, how do you guys think it will affect the share price?"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,GME isn't trading on typical stock fundamentals. Only boomers struggle to comprehend this.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think it will go that low, but I seriously can’t envision an earnings that will make it go up.  But yeah, I think it goes down a lot. I think Q4 will be great, but I bet the market cap will outstrip total yearly revenue by a lot (and sorry to the apes, but GME is still B&M right now; they haven’t pivoted yet)."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure yesterday's tomorrow is tomorrow's yesterday...and as always...I'm caught in the middle.

Still don't watch for dates, set alerts.

Don't buy on margin (unless you can negotiate some sweet terms for your kids lunch money), buy shares with cash.  No OPTIONS....like capes in ""The Incredibles"", they will be our downfall."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You have to marinate them for a couple of days.  They taste like boots if you don't

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,TAing GME is akin to trying to psychoanalyse a shit flinging monkey.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean it's stuck to support levels and resistance and it's consolidated and broken triangle supports and moved up. Actually it's very useful to use this DD for these stocks they they fit to it like a glove.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve heard stock predictions described before as horoscopes for men. It kinda resonated with me for some reason.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It would be different if this were a normal stock that hadn't been naked shorted down to <$5 and then driven up by a bunch of apes who independently decided they liked the stock, and then subject to massive manipulation by hedge funds and market makers colluding to control the price.  This isn't even Porsche v Volkswagen.  This is Terra incognita."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The the only reason people believe this shit is because every once in a while it correctly predicts the price movement. One of them coming true does not make it worth the effort lol. It’s just more confirmation bias for people who have zero fucking clue as to how markets work. You know how many charts predicted liftoff last week? A lot. Some of them even looked a lot like this one. I guess those were all worth the effort cause they COULD have come true, huh?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If one happens to be true, then it's worth it?  What kind of fucked up insane logic is that?  If I make 500 predictions about stocks and lose 99% of my money, yet one was right and I got back 10%, then it was all worth it!  GTFOH."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Wrong. Just got a confirmation message from the bot telling me they would remind me.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Does Tesla or Apple always justify their market capitalization with their earnings? Most of the time what gives the stock a momentum it needs is guidance or news updates. GME is suppose to replace their CFO by 3/26 and if they pick the former CFO from chewy then this could break into the $600 easily the next week with momentum.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,">GME isn't trading on typical stock fundamentals. Only boomers struggle to comprehend this.

And yet here is OP trying to apply TA to it. Lol."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Im no boomer but it doesnt take a genius to realize GME’s ER is going to be garbage and bring a dose of reality back to the stock. It WILL drop however what happens after the drop is anyone’s guess. It may just rise to $400 again later if everyone buys the dip

2021-03-21 04:48:14,wallstreetbets,"Apes, I think I nailed it! TL;DR Madoff cut his teeth with fraud with PFOF before moving to feeding off the whales, in the mean time, Wall Street adopted his fraud methods with PFOF to feed off of retail. It really is a big Ponzi scheme. I’ve been trying to dent my brain these last couple of months to get to understand what’s been going on and why I believe in GME so much, and then recently, I feel a bomb had been dropped on me with the talk about Payment for Order Flow and dark pool off-market buys. I’ve just started denting my brain by understanding how Fails to Deliver are hid in Out of the Money calls or puts or whatever and now I got to try and understand Payment for Order Flow?! Its like studying for the SAT and then someone knocks on the door and tells you, by the way, you are taking the MCATS tomorrow morning. WTF?!

So, apparently PFOF was started by Madoff! I think on the surface it looks legit, but it is easily used for wicked purposes by moving it to dark pools and off market buys, which explains why there is so much buying but it doesn’t move the ticker at all, while sells plummet it in seconds. I guess the SEC looks at this and says, ‘oh cool, this was started by Madoff and is now industry standard, nothing to see here, would you like a sensual hand job or an angry one’? Is this why Wall Street and Main Street haven’t been the same street in a long time? Since 2008? Earlier?

Its starting to feel like Wall Street is one big Ponzi scheme, I know we all know that, but when it happens for real its terrifying! Madoff has been butt fucking everyone since the early eighties, how deep does this rabbit hole go, how deep is his dick still in our rabbit hole?

This is my favorite part of his Wiki.

""Madoff founded a penny stock brokerage in 1960 which eventually grew into Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities. He served as its chairman until his arrest on December 11, 2008.\[6\]\[7\] The firm was one of the top market maker businesses on Wall Street,\[8\] which bypassed ""specialist"" firms by directly executing orders over the counter from retail brokers."" FUCKING GREAT!!!

Then I went digging around and looking at the brokers who adopted this. And holy fucking shit, its almost all of them! TD Ameritrade where all of my funds are at are listed, and Vanguard\* who I was hoping to transfer to. And now I got to sweat moving my shares from TD, something that makes me extremely nervous, thinking that I might miss out on the rocket launch I’ve been so patiently waiting on.

Any talk about moving from TD is simply not on here, lots of talk about Robinhood and Fidelity, but any questions about TD and I get down voted to oblivion. So much FUD, so little time...

I remember when Apes figured out shorts were being hid in ETF’s and how big of a bomb that was, this PFOF stuff feels bigger! I don’t think its getting the attention it deserves because we haven’t had any time to catch our breath from all the other bombs dropped, short ETF’s, hidden FTD’s etc. Good luck ever getting this talked about in Congress, they can hardly even address Naked Short’s. They are still learning arithmetic when we need to be discussing Calculus!

I’m so angry and frustrated and I don’t know who to blame. Citadel? SEC? Madoff? Myself for being so ignorant on what’s going on? I’m so confused and hoping some big brain apes can help. I’m just a homeless filmmaker, aren’t real adults supposed to be in charge of looking into this? What’s next, I wake up and there is Morpheus telling me to see with my real eyes? Have I become as crazy as all my friends and family think I am about GME? Have we become QAnon? WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?!!!

This really is the biggest fraud in history and we are the only ones talking about it, isn’t it? This is Madoff, only this time, Madoff is all of Wall Street!

Is every broker dealing with PFOF a toxic dumping ground? Is it worth it to move from TD? How long will it truly take? Is every broker fucked? Are we all fucked? All of these institutions are saying, ‘hey, trust me with your money, I learned everything I know from Bernie Madoff’.

FUCK! SHIT! FUCK! I want out! And I don’t know who to trust!

I’m angry, scared, exhilarated… Fuck it, no matter what, if I miss the rocket, if it explodes, if it launches me at 30 G’s into the sun, this has been a wild ride and well worth it. I hope I know what I’m doing, I hope that you do too. But, most of all, I hope that this changes things for the better! I hope all of you Apes are rewarded and safe on your Rocket ride!

I’m so confused and don’t know who to trust. The only thing I know is that I believe in the DD and I believe in you fellow Apes.

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated, Peace and HODL!

TL;DR I think Madoff cut his teeth with fraud with PFOF before moving to bigger fraud feeding off the whales, in the mean time, Wall Street adopted his fraud methods with PFOF feeding off of retail. It really is a big Ponzi scheme.

**Addendum:** You know the phrase, it isn't a loss until you sell? I think in Citadels' mind, it also isn't a buy, until you sell! (BOOM Ponzi!)

\*There is conflicting reports on Vanguard's use of PFOF. However, they are listed as using it at [https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/which-investing-apps-receive-payment-for-order-flow?op=1&r=AU&IR=T](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/which-investing-apps-receive-payment-for-order-flow?op=1&r=AU&IR=T)"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Updated Again\*\*\*

**TL;DR: Merrill Edge no PFOF both Stocks/Options or any relationship with Citadel. But it blocked GME/AMC in Jan.... so Fidelity it is.**

There's no payment for order flow for Chase/Merrill Edge/Vanguard/Fidelity/IBKR Pro (not Lite) if you are simply buying and selling stocks.

If you are buying options, then there's Merrill Edge with no PFOF and Chase with near zero PFOF. There's also IBKR Pro but the added fees there in general seem stupidly high for those who don't regularly trade 6 figures.

&#x200B;

btw, IBKR founder is the one that is openly against GME. And Merrill Edge blocked GME/AMC on Jan.

EDIT: **Chase and Fidelity can LOSE money** **when you guys buy/sell stocks.** Look at its 606 Form. It's crazy.

EDIT: **Merrill Edge has average execution speed of 0.012 seconds. Fidelity has 0.08 seconds. Cannot find info for Chase on execution speed. Too bad Merrill Edge blocked GME/AMC buys on Jan. Fidelity overall then.**

According to people here, Merrill Edge sucks as a brokerage. Go Fidelity it seems."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Better TL;DR: This dude thinks that over-the-counter trades and dark trades between big brokers may be causing stonk to drop a lot from a few sells, but barely move with a lot of aggressive buys. This could be achieved by big players trading dark based on your Payment for Order Flow, preventing retail buying from affecting price action."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I use TD. They only can do that if your buying on margin. It’s in all the documentation.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,My brain is too smooth to REALLY understand all this. BUT... are you saying PFOF is used for selling and the buying is done through off-market buys so it appears there is not much price movement?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,And Vanguard has a major GME position :D
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro you gotta chill. I'm on TD as well, all fuckin YOLOd in. DD no matter how well intentioned can be turned into and inadvertently spread FUD."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I decided March of 2018 that reality had already jumped the shark by several episodes and I was not going to give it any of the VERY SERIOUS 🧐 consideration i was taught it deserved.  Now I look at it as inane sideshow.  I have enough of things to live my day-to-day and I save for when I’m old.  I no longer worry about things like the collapse of the free market system, the weft and weave of this and other world governments being rife with Masonic deviltry and so on, school shootings, riots, global warming, kids with sixteen genders and no social skills raised by devices and never seeing whole faces again IRL and so on and so forth.  And I am really grateful for that paradigm shift.  I’m an alternately horrified and bemused observer of this world.  And it’s alright with me."

Doubt is always there,you are wondering if all of this is gonna be good on the end,emotions are hi
Most of us put more money then ever thought we ever will, virus happened,stupidity and politics behind it
Oil zero  back to 40, virus roaring ,they didn't want to stop for a month to control the pandemic due to greed oil and auto industry's were pushing it ,that is my opinion from the beginning and still is .
Wondering where to go only solution in my head was Berkshire ,to play it safe, trust the old man  ,Tesla like it a lot  but they just killing the guy  over and over and over,and then Gme came to play thx to  WSB /DFV
I am praying that WSB took a higher ground and see potential in all the retarded apes and put the game straight ,to show that we see it is  rigged .
I was also wondering when somebody will mention Madoff and there you are ,make sense ,hole is deep and they will not allow to be destroyed 
They are everywhere and we can try to outwit them in there game ,slowly and steady and we will push them to a corner even on 1 stock ,we  want them to feel the pain.
They will not back down of course they will ruin everything possible to get  what they want but maybe won't make it on GME ,they pushed it too hard and they hit the nerve of regular people and is too many of us 
Point basically we just have to swim with sharks
Small pond too many alligators!

The shills have been getting clever lately, with subtle misdirection to outright lying. So sad that they have to make living by scamming, and feed their family with that dirty money. I'm sure you agree that they are scums who have left morality behind.

Keep up the good work."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are right, PFOF is a scam.

If something is FREE, it means YOU are the product.

We pay for shares, RH groups them and gives the order to Citadel, they write an IOU for RH,

RH says: ""you bought shares @ 220"".

Citadel uses that money to lend shares, drops the price to 175 and  buys in darkpools the shares later, pocketting the difference and shorting your investment from day 1.

SEC doesn't do a damm thing."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"OP just wait till you look at how much cash  has come into the stock market and how little impact it has had in increasing the markets price.

Why would you ever want someone that is providing a service to you to NOT make money? Are you REALLY worried about 1.5 cents or what ever? TD is not trying to sell me a single product. Spend your energy on developing an investment strategy, not worrying who screwed whom in 2008."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"PFOF would be a fraud if the prices are different on lit exchnages than dark pools or otc. So if for example algos and market makers made sure the lit exchanges moved on very little volume or showed fake prices and the dark pools showed a totally different price, that would give incentive for someone to buy flow. Eg, Shitadel."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fun facts about Madoff - he wasn’t committing fraud with PFOF.  The SEC accused him of “front running” due to PFOF.  

Front running is when you take PFOF and make your own trades AHEAD of the moves your customers are attempting to execute.  - order follow says large volume flowing in to TSLA?  A front runner would execute their own buys setup calls, before executing customer trades.

Bernie wasnt front running, it was just a regular fricking ponzi  scheme"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I am reading this right, it would explain why the price of a stock moves when retail buys options but not when retail buys the stock itself. Buying the option forces the MM to buy the stock directly, and the order is processed legitimately and not as an off market side deal. I don't know if you are right or not, but we all do know the game is rigged."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"On the right track imh(ape)o. 

I think it’s worse than a Ponzi scheme because there  are *potentially* multiple firms/parties/individuals complicit in this. 

The light will come out on this. What can an ape do while ape hold?

Ape learn and study market and stock

But ape can also use publicly available info to look into the shady practices of these firms, their previous crimes, the individuals involved, and see how may connections there may be. I already know of one connection that is rather suspicious…

There are more. 

Make melvins lawsuits public news. Trend on Twitter, feed the info to press tip lines, etc., same with all the other parties involved on those suits. 

Make the class action lawsuits public news - why aren’t ANY of these actual news articles? Why no news articles about Melvins pending suits?  

No mercy. Legality will win at the end of the day. 

This sounds more like Rico (or what’s worse than Rico?), to me but IANAL.

There's really only 1 rule you need to follow to by pass any potential risk of getting ripped off... Send in limit orders... you will either get executed at your price or not...

The HFT algo traders are the predators and pose the biggest risk... But having them around isn't all bad.. They get a bad rap b/c they are sucking up all the excess spread that in a manual market was pocketed by traders anyway,... The danger they introduce is that they provide the majority of the daily volume, so they are either matching your order or providing depth to the order book... The danger is when they detect a irregularity, they aren't designed to figure out what's wrong, they are designed to cancel all open orders and go dark... This causes the volume to plunge and order books lose their depth and prices fall and fall quickly..."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ahh the good old days. A world view where everything is simple and probably makes sense somehow. 

I'll rip off the band aid for you.

Financial history isn't a story of slowly learning how to walk with small corrections and incremental improvements.

Financial history is the story of organized methods of growing your piece of the pie by any means. The goals is to do it in such a way that the rate off growth completely overshadows the previous financial disaster. Untill , you know .... That one thing that nobody saw coming , "" The perfect storm "" . Then everyone holding a shitload of money looks at each other and decides what everything should be worth during the recession and we start the whole thing all over again."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"For the service of being connected to financial markets (which requires a great deal of capital investment, time, and risk to make happen), you should expect to pay a fee.  In general, these fees have been getting lower and lower over time.  Now, many retail traders get ""free"" fees on their trades... so who is paying for all this infrastructure?

Well, you're still paying.  The way it works is that smarter market participants pay for the right to see your order first, which gives them the option to trade with you before your smooth-brained order hits the open market.  If you're doing something dumb, these smarter participants trade with you directly, make a profit, and give some back to the referrer (ETrade, Robin Hood, TD Ameritrade, etc).

In this way, everyone wins.  You execute your order exactly as you wanted (actually, often at *better* prices since PFOF often involves price *improvement* for the retail trader) AND you don't have to pay commissions.  If you're actually an autist, this is about as good as it gets.  You get prices *better* than if you were a professional trader!

It's popular to say that everything is a scam these days, but PFOF is just a good business model in which everyone benefits.  I'm sure this will get auto-removed, but maybe at least OP will see it.

Good luck!"

The Trillion dollar question remains, how much of a bitch are the rest of the Brokers? I think the bigger ones should be stronger than Robinhood, but, do you want to bet your portfolio on it? At the very least, any broker involved with PFOF with Citadel is sus af!"

1. Madoff creates Payment for Order Flow early in his career.
2. Madoff realizes that he can use this as a Ponzi scheme. Essentially taking peoples orders, buy in under-regulated dark pools, use it to manipulate the price.
3. Takes what he has learned and goes for the big bucks with the Whales and eventually gets arrested for the biggest Ponzi scheme in history.
4. Bad faith actors catch on to PFOF and how you can use it to manipulate market.
5. PFOF becomes the dominate method for brokers with Citadel being the hub. All is fine and dandy until GME exposes the irregularities in the market caused by PFOF, exacerbated by Citadels' panic to cover and hide shorts.

""By going along with Robinhood’s tempting $0 trading commissions over discount brokerages charging commissions of a few dollars per trade, investors missed out on $34 million over a roughly three-year span thanks to inferior trade prices, the SEC alleged. **And that’s after factoring out the cost of five-dollar trade order commissions, the regulator added.**""

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Even crazier is how the brokerages linked to the largest banks (BoA and Chase) has some of the best brokerages (Merrill Edge and Chase You Invest).

Especially didn't expect from Merrill Edge considering how garbage BoA is.

0.012 second average execution speed + no PFOF on BOTH stocks and options.

I hate the Merrill Edge UI but I guess BoA isn't all fluff.

The platinum honors cashback (5.25%) on BoA with Merrill Edge looks solid for those with money."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I moved to fidelity but when I tried setting high limit sells I got a disclaimer saying max limit sell price of 50% of current stock price. Kinda weird
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think IBKR can stop you from selling securities.

(I mean it can but... I doubt it. There's no way there's that much corruption, right?)

Pretty sure that would create a whole array of mess that IBKR does not want to partake.

It can limit buying though. Selling shouldn't be issue in even brokerages like Robinhood.

Selling works differently from buying from DTCC side. Selling should have no issues cause you already have the security."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I had a chat with IB the other day. They said that there would be no way that they would interfere with selling shares that you own, as long as its a cash account. But freely admitted that they may restrict further share purchases to ""protect clients"".

Personally, i ACATed my shit out of there as their chairman's behavior regarding GME has been dogshit. They were very quick to halt trading which makes me believe its possible they were/are taking the side of clients with short positions that were out of control and should have been margin called."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look at Vanguard's own page instead of some random businessinsider site: [https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/v719.pdf](https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/v719.pdf)

>Vanguard Brokerage does not receive compensation for directing order flow in equity securities. Vanguard Brokerage receives compensation for directing certain options securities to our execution partners

You can also see from the report that equity trades don't have PFOF:

[https://nms606.karngroup.com/vgrd/606a/2020Q3/588e3c62ff](https://nms606.karngroup.com/vgrd/606a/2020Q3/588e3c62ff)"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"That sucks.

Merrill on paper is really good brokerage: super fast execution and no PFOF (no profiting off you).

I guess the only option then is Fidelity or Vanguard :/"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's a great brokerage. It does take some profits from your order flow when you trade stocks if that's what you mean.

There's a reason why r/personalfinance constantly recommends Fidelity, Vanguard, Schwab. The three brokerages are great overall: Schwab has the lowest cost retail target date index funds in the industry.

And Schwab refunds every ATM in the planet (Fidelity only domestic with 1% fee on international ATMs). Schwab is great for those who travel a lot cause of the no foreign transaction fee (uses Visa's daily rate for foreign currency conversion).

Now if you mean purely in the context of just buy/sell stocks, Fidelity will be better. That said, Schwab is exponentially better than Robinhood if that's your worry."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like its UI. Quite beautiful on a mobile app. Sometimes I even use it to stare at stock price just like Robinhood App.

As for strictly trading purposes, it is absolute garbage. If you look at its 606 Form, WeBull takes almost a dollar per 100 S&P500 stocks. Robinhood in meantime only takes 40 cents a dollar per 100 S&P500 stocks.

My experience with WeBull has been it definitely trades slower than the big brokerages (irrelevant to PFOF). Merrill Edge average execution speed is 0.012 seconds and Fidelity is 0.08s econds. I don't know about Robinhood and WeBull but those two does feel noticeably slower overall.

That said, PFOF is highly overstated. It's generally fractions of a penny to about a penny per trade. A penny here and there shouldn't kill you. Honestly, PFOF is overall a good change in this industry because it made brokerages go from charging $4.99 a trade to commission free (with PFOF of about a penny or two here and there).

Anyways, the UI of WeBull makes me feel like I have a futuristic app so there's that going for it at end. :) Plus it gave me a lot of free stocks so I'm happy with that."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity takes no profits from your order flow for buy/sell stocks. Schwab does.

Outside that:

* Schwab Investor no foreign transaction fee on debit purchases + ATM withdrawals
* Fidelity Cash Management 1% foreign transaction fee on debit and no foreign transaction fee on ATM withdrawals
* Schwab reimburses ATM fees end of month
* Fidelity reimburses ATM fees within a few days
* Schwab has 1.5% cashback while Fidelity 2%
   * Schwab uses Amex while Fidelity Visa (Visa is used more everywhere)
* Blue vs Green (pure preference)
* If you get referred by Schwab client, you can get some bonus ([https://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/nn/referred-prospect.html](https://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/nn/referred-prospect.html))
   * Fidelity doesn't really do these stuffs
* Schwab has the lowest retail target date index funds for everyday people
* Fidelity has the lowest mutual fund fees
* Schwab partial share starts from $5. Fidelity partial share starts from $1.
* Schwab UI makes trading options more intuitive than Fidelity

Overall, both are very similar in quality. Biggest pro with Schwab is the no foreign transaction fee when you travel abroad. Really nice for converting cash. Life saver of a bank when you want to convert your cash to whatever currency you need while on vacation abroad."

Want to roll a spread, tough.

Want to sell multiple CC's, well maybe it will work maybe it won't.

Therefore, I believe the DD stands and I wouldn't want to mislead anyone about what's going on. But, I do love TOS and would love nothing more than to hear that TD has cut its ties to Citadel.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or you don't get filled at all, but you would have at other brokers. Sometimes you'll be filled at a better price than your limit order, not so much with PFOF if they don't have to. If you know the rules you can maybe still try to game the system and come out ahead, only trade very liquid stocks with limit orders + don't trade options. But you're doing it at the expensive of the less educated that trade on the same platform. Judging by how much they pay for taking customer orders, it seems to be most lucrative to take on Robinhood customers, probably a lot of people use market orders there and don't care."

Basically, you earn more money than you should have if you trade stocks in Fidelity. In other words, Fidelity is the way to go for traditional buy/sell stocks.

&#x200B;

Holy crap. What the actual... who knew a brokerage loves to lose money. Damn, it really is a great brokerage for traditional buy/sell stocks."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, if you even go to the citation BusinessInsider does, you will notice if you go to 'See SEC rule 606 report' for Vanguard in the line, the 606 Form literally states Vanguard took no PFOF on stocks buy/sell.

I think the author of the article simply made a mistake because he is referencing a link that proves Vanguard does not engage in PFOF on buy/sell stocks."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just noted that Merrill Edge doesn't even do PFOF also for options.

Look at its 606 Form. It's literally the cleanest and most basic.

&#x200B;

And its execution speed is 0.012 seconds. Fidelity and Schwab in meantime is 0.08 seconds.

Merrill Edge is fast as hell and takes no profits. I always dismissed it cause of its garbage UI (and its relationship with BoA post financial crisis) but for strictly trading purposes, it seems the best (outside IBKR Pro).

The UI of Merrill Edge for trading though is really garbage. So there's that takeaway (UI makes it difficult to trade quickly for me)."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You raise excellent points and agree that Market structure although its evolving needs to take the next step.. One thing to remember is that Reg NMS requires order handlers to route to the best available price, if they do not they are in violation..
Citadel's defense is that they operate in sub penny numbers while the exchanges do not, allowing them to occasionally provide ""price improvement""..
In the end, there is a service being provided that needs to be paid for, if it's not the MM it will be the exchange itself that takes the fee... The other very important role the MM plays is that it's required to provide liquidity which is deemed crucial.. 
I don't claim to have the answer, I just won't pile on the easiest target - PFOF model - and claim it's the villain, when in reality its been the retail traders best friend against the ""pro's"" who rely on sucking up the spread for their piece of the profit."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It all boils down to what routing in a timely manner means. What Citadel/Robinhood was doing is to wait/lag with your order to see if they can make money off your trade a couple seconds later, if the current spread is unfavorable to them due to NBBO. You as the customer wouldn't really notice the difference, but the cents they gain this way really add up. They paid the SEC fine without admitting guilt - they are probably still doing it to some extend. I still believe they make more money on the average Robinhood user than $5 per trade, so in the end most power users with more than $10k would be better off paying for commissions + getting better fills. Especially with options, where bid/ask can be really wide sometimes."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity is first a long term investment brokerage, not a trader's brokerage.

I don't see other brokerages doing a loss leader on some of its products (cause no one cares to look at these stuffs. Does anyone bother to look at 606 Forms when choosing brokerages?).

Fidelity seems to be doing loss leaders in: trading stocks and fidelity ZERO funds.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are profits taken for Fidelity and other brokerages too. But the pricing is transparent (no hiding profits through PFOF). It's 65 cents a contract (Fidelity is same while Vanguard is $1 a contract).

For contracts, paying 65 cents for the premium to execute faster is worth it. Even 1 cent difference on share price can more than make up for 65 cents cause 1 option == 100 shares.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"That makes sense, from my perspective.  Pretty much every 401K I have had was through Fidelity.  And I had fairly limited options 20 years ago.  Now its amazing what I can do, lots of fund marked without fees and other discounts, I guess it help lol.  I have access to some trader pro tool, but I don't think I need that kind of access.  


If I see a mention of something here that looks interesting they make it easy to throw some money at it.  With GME I learned I needed cash on hand.  But I ended up buy shares lower to split the difference.  Now I'm mostly up, but no reason to sell.  I didn't bet the farm."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s not a literal belief. More like I choose to. For funzies. 🤷‍♂️
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Good on you for being true to yourself and living an authentic life. I wish you the best of luck and much happiness.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shit got weird after the late, great Harambe. R.I.P"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,My bad. Good woman.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ya. Fidelity became famous because of its Magellan Fund back when Peter Lynch ran it (Peter Lynch owns a part of Fidelity). Peter Lynch was a genius investor who averaged 29% a year and remains the best performing mutual fund investor in history over such extended period.

(and his return after mutual fund can be followed through his wife's IRA (1974 to today): [https://afterdinnerinvestor.com/peter-lynch-wifes-retirement-account/](https://afterdinnerinvestor.com/peter-lynch-wifes-retirement-account/))

It's first a mutual fund company. Everything about Fidelity is geared towards long term investing. There's just more money to be made in asset management (Fidelity manages $9.8 trillion in total customer assets).

Finding a way to get even 0.2% a year from customer assets is like almost $20 billion a year. (Robinhood's entire AUM before GME meltdown was about $20 billion)

That said, Fidelity is trying to keep up with times. That's the entire premise of Fidelity Spire app it is trying to work on now (cause a lot of Robinhood converts are demanding it).

I'm guessing Fidelity is seeing this more as an investment opportunity for the next generation to prefer its brokerage for long term investing over other brokerages.

&#x200B;

It's probably why Fidelity really doesn't care what happens to GME.

The goal is simple for Fidelity. Attract customer base. Convert some of them to long term investors at Fidelity. And continue the tradition cause who cares about traders when the real trillions are in asset management. At this rate, Fidelity might be managing like $20 trillion in total customer assets in the next decade.

It's literally the biggest money making machine. People will always have long term investment accounts. And considering US Stock Market historically doubled every 7 years, even the smallest fee from that total customer asset is... quite unfathomable. Makes even the total profits of top hedge funds bring a joke (when you consider profit per work involved). And best part, Fidelity doesn't have to do anything special. It just literally needs to continue being Fidelity and let customers keep trusting in Fidelity. That's it."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't forget my favorite feature: the lowest fee S&P 500  fund (FXAIX) in existence. The fund is laggy for buys and sells, but who cares when the expense ratio is this low in comparison to say SPY.

Edit: 0.015% expense ratio and zero fees if you hold a Fidelity account.  

Edit 2: Make sure you understand the risks before buying this. Trading of the fund occurs at the end of the day, so there is up to a day of lag."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Like religion
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow very good read. Feeling a bit wrinkly, not gonna lie."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like a solid business model to me!! Thank god I diversified with them when I realized RH might not let me sell at some point. I actually still have some in RH to sue them afterward if they do pull anything. I would LOVE for them to try it, see what happens."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity also has excellent customer service. All of their reps have been friendly, professional, and helpful."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks!  I’ll add some of that to my HSA account.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"FXAIX is a mutual fund. It's not ETF. It trades once a day after market closes.

If you are going for mutual fund, why not just go for FZROX. 0% fee.

Also, mutual funds (outside Vanguard) do have a bit more taxes than ETFs.

It's best to just buy ITOT on taxable accounts. On tax advantaged like IRA, lowest fee should win out all things equal."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Perfect! This is what I have been looking for. Thank you!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, let's say a managed fund makes you 7% per year and charges 2% in fees. After 10 years, the compounding means you now have ⅓ of the amount you could've had (5% instead of 7%) without the fees.

Guess where the rest is.

Converting any customer to a managed fund customer is a huge asset worth running a loss leader on."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know this is 6 hours later, but man that's clever sneaky snek thinking, I like it!   I'm opening a RH account and buying 1 share on there to follow suit.

In a way it's shorting them, or betting on them to fail while you profit out of that."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"1. My bad on the terminology, comment updated.  
2. FZROX does not track the S&P 500."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"“To follow suit” I see what you did there XD 

Exactly!! And you don’t even have to buy puts to do it!!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"S&P500 is close enough to US Total Market.

That said, if you truly want an ETF version of S&P500, then I guess there's SPLG, VOO, IVV all at 0.03% fee each."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"With all due respect, you're missing the point of my original comment: **""the lowest fee S&P 500  fund (FXAIX) in existence.""**"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah ya. That part is true. Yap. Fidelity mutual funds in general are damn legit when it comes to fees.
2021-03-21 04:17:13,wallstreetbets,"$RKT: A Bull thesis on Short/Long-term value 🚀 Hello Apes,

I am laying out the case on why $RKT - Rocket Mortgage - deserves a deeper look, and the value it has.  We have all seen the amazing DD's floating around, talking about how amazing the company is. Now let's talk about some of the catalyst that will propel Rocket to a higher valuation and amazing company. (Spoiler: No short squeeze discussion here, there are other DD's floating around for that).

&#x200B;

Several risk factors and plays affecting RKT price NOW:

* General market was in a downward trend - FED meeting
* Rates got spooked and ticked up
* Raw Material Shortage
* Lack of housing supply in prior months

Now lets look at some of the catalysts that will work in RKT's favor in the coming months:

* **Spring Housing Boom**. It is known that spring and pre-summer are the most active in real-estate, and this year is no different. We should expect an uptick in movement/sales/refi/building.
* **Biden Administration $15k first time home buyer tax credit & DACA eligibility**. This administration is kicking housing into full gear the next couple of months by offering MAJOR incentives for first time homebuyers. They are also making the 700k DACA recipients elidable for federally insured mortgages (guess where younger folks shop for stuff? Online)
* **Housing data comes out this week**. The outlook looks positive so far (I will go over this thesis in a bit) with the release of housing data, we will get a peer into the real estate market and trend. Overall, the market is still very hot, with huge demand spikes. This will only carry over into the spring housing market boom, and will incentivize more owners to capitalize on this selling opportunity and for builders to kick things into high gear. Overall the trends look good, and in favor of RKT.
* **The new inventory spike**. With homes selling quick, and bidding wars happening, supply will soon catch up to this demand and we should see an up-tick in home sales. Last month, severe winter storms temporarily disrupted some of the supple of homes nationally. As we move into March, we should see more movement.
* **Interest rate uncertainty**. This is a double edge sword. If we think of the inverse, with homeowners knowing that rate increases are imminent, it will incentivize more refi's before. On the flip, what happens when rates go up? RKT adjusts their financials as well. There are many articles analyzing the affect of higher rates, and overall, it seems to have little impact on the short term demands in the coming months.

&#x200B;

Now let's try and break apart the data we have access too, to try and predict how the housing data will look next week. Let's start with the MONTHLY NEW RESIDENTITAL CONSTUCTION, FEBURARY 2021:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zf5ev4mds9o61.png?width=703&format=png&auto=webp&s=57e053936be22dc7c1344af79f7757358f612ad7

What we can gather from this, is Feb had a down-trend in Permits/Starts/Completions. Let's dig deeper into some of the numbers from the report. When we do, we can see that the New Privately-Owner Housing Units Authorized (Basically new builds coming up), was higher this last month by +28.9% YoY and +3.9% MoM. Ape speak? More supply is on the way!

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/388skcdht9o61.png?width=707&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b75bdffc2aebe76caceacc7fb36f40bc6b41bee

The report goes into more detail, I encourage everyone to take a deeper look. *The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.* The outlook on supply catching up to demand is in the numbers, we should see more sales happening over the next couple of months, and see a positive upward trend.

Also a good report to look into is the [Weekly Economic and Housing Market update.](https://www.realtor.com/research/video-weekly-economic-and-housing-market-update-mar-19-2021/) They talk about most of the points referenced here, but one snippet stood out:

>""Despite higher rates, our latest Weekly Housing Trends View shows that prices are rising and homes are still selling faster. More supply is needed, and is expected as we approach spring.""

&#x200B;

Another release by First American [here](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210319005055/en/Rising-Rates-Unlikely-to-Dampen-Spring-Home-Buying-Season-According-to-First-American-Potential-Home-Sales-Model). 

>Rising Rates Unlikely to Dampen Spring Home-Buying Season, According to First American Potential Home Sales Model  
>  
>—Even if mortgage rates continue to rise, increasing household formation, in conjunction with more favorable market conditions, will keep home-buying demand high, says Chief Economist

&#x200B;

As a final thought, the special dividend payment is going out this week. There is a chance of re-investments back into the stock, and valuations going up. I like the stock. I am holding this for the value.

As always, do you own due diligence before buying into any stock. Don't listen to me, I'm just an ape with a keyboard and some crayons.

Edit: Thank you everyone for the karma and awards! Much appreciated the kudos. 💎💎"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you're short it's a turd. Nothing wrong with RKT, it's just easy to manipulate. I set up a small long term strangle at this level. I'll likely add every month. Most shorts in housing right now are betting on a market crash like 2008. But the problem with that idea isn't the data that supports it, it's the government that is supporting main street mortage holders. They will have to for years to come, but that will be better than a slow 12 year recovery like the last time.

But let's look at the positives that we know, first time homebuyers have been on the sidelines for years and are taking out loans now. Supply is short so builders are working like crazy now making up for demand. The supply side of the market is still projected to be 10 years out, not accounting for new generations. These all create fine jobs. 

RKT is going to be aggressive in changing the industry towards modern tech and timelines. Mac and Mae are still accounting for risk in the market and stopping risky investments on their portfolios from multiple property owners, one of the causes of the 2008 crash was investment property risk. Boomers will be downsizing their properties for the final stages of retirement. Projections say they are 40% of the market. 

While this catching up to the levels of 2008 was crazy fast, a year, no one is looking forward to a repeat. There is massive incentive to keep prices at this level. 

Downsides. Funding of property down payments with portfolios last year was alarming. 
Investment properties in high cost cities got higher HuD funding, double edged sword, this might be speculative for micro bubbles as exodus from the cities from work from home companies is increasing. 
The average price of a home increased at such a level that securing a down payment became out of reach for more and more people. Government has not kept track with this hidden inflation. As such lenders did not assume risk and passed it on to consumers by raising credit score limits. Tightening the noose on the pool of borrowers even further. This in turn canceled out the pool available for first time home buyer grants such as discussed by the $15,000 credit, or even the current $12,000 credit, or getting 2 mortages, 1 @20% for down, 1 for 80%. 

Mortage rates rising. Neutral positon. The market needs to calm down in order for supply to catch up with demand. If boomers decide to dump 50% their properties and retire, great. Those houses will be snapped up at these rates. 

Our biggest problem with the market is simply the majority of houses are old, fucking 70's old on average. Flipping houses is great, but most people don't address anything other than cosmetic fixes. Supply needs to demo and rebuild modern housing in most markets. Like the 50's, 80's, and 00's did. This would offer some realistic benefit to the entire infrastructure, as electrical, energy savings, and mechanical systems could increase value while decreasing usage. The more modular a system, the better for cost. Imagine if HUD, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac were part of the carbon offset buisness as well. And as a home owners you get a cut. 

Our second biggest problem is that wages have not kept up with productivity. If we were to see wages jump 10% and catch up with the 1990's, lol. Wages should always be tied to productivity. Accurate compensation is by far the biggest thing controlling supply and demand in the housing market. If the majority of wage earners could simply build a house with a few years of saving, the market would blow the fuck up. My family has never taken out loans, but has always owned land and houses, why? We build out of pocket. I haven't wanted to build another house for the housing market until this year. Global wages are just as bad.

Third problem. Giant banks need to get out of mortages, and by all data points they seem to be. RKT, UWM, both of them have come to a point in their business that they need to keep the pressure on supply of mortages so demand increases. They need to work on positive government regulation for generation inclusion in the markets for years. They should call Disney

Fourth problem I don't know shit"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope you're right and I hope this shit happens Pronto. My 4/16 28.89 c looks like dog poo right now
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel like RKT has such good things going and should be higher but is stuck like PLTR at 23-26.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You son of a bitch, I'm in! (I was in since last 2 weeks already 24.5$ average)."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good DD, thx for the links 🚀🚀🚀🚀"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"RKT is a 3-4x stock in 2021. You read it here first, on WallStreetBets. If the Biden administration passes the $15k tax incentive for first time homebuyers, new mortgage applications will skyrocket. IMO, the chances of this tax incentive being passed soon are very high.

FHA loans require a minimum of 3.5% down payment, which is $10.5k on a $300k loan. Closing costs are typically an additional $10.5k. This means that before a new buyer needed to save $25k (to cover reserves). Now the government will cover $15k of that, at closing, not at a later date. Now they would only need $10k saved to close a deal, which is very realistic.

I’ve always been bullish on RKT. If this tax incentive passes, this will be a hyper growth stock"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great company, great managment, great product and technology. I'm holding 9,000 shares of RKT and plan to add more very soon. Bought them at 23$, sold at 33$ and bought them back again at 29$. Thanks to the dividend my cost is 27.89$. As I said, i'll add more as long as it stays below 35$."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice post man. I dig the effort
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is good, love it. I’m a big fan of $RKT. Company has a culture that will devour everything.

Like Amazon, It’s not just selling “books” online, it’s going to be a way of life."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Me wonders how much rkt would benefit from bidens 15k first time home buyer tax credit
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm partially shilling in saying that RKT is a fantastic choice to go into. I've made over 12k in calls and the short interest is still high. It is being artificially kept down by the hedges and while it's not as popular as GME, it is going to make a lot of people rich if it's played right."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You forgot the part where a special dividend is paid out on March 23rd.

If the dividend is reinvested, that would likely be a nice bump. 

Technically the special dividend is $2.2B. I wonder if the dan and jay will reinvest their special dividend into the company, that would be nice. 

Shorts running for the hills again."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Interest rate uncertainty I totally agree on. People will refinance or take equity before rates creep up if they do. Certain segments of the country have very hot real estate markets. Where I live in the NE 30-100 people per day per open house that is no exaggeration.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"RKT, $36 EofY"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Need more ape support on this incredible opportunity.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Good DD.  I'm bullish about 🚀 myself
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice analysis, i really like RKT lot of good things going on for them right now."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait for the uwmc crew to downvote this post or watch it get deleted. 

Both Rkt & uwmc are under valued. Does one have more potential? Yes, depends on who you ask. 

Both have their strengths, both will go up. Enough with this hating/shiting on each other, when there’s plenty of tendies to go around."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Solid DD... it isn't a sexy Lambo stonk... more like a BMW... or... Lexus?...
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"One thing I’m seeing in my area that may be showing up elsewhere (or about to) is that inventory has CRATERED because now nobody wants to SELL because they’re afraid of the bidding wars they’ll need to win to get a new home. Demand is high, inventory is even lower, which means fewer deals are possible."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Why are rocket option strike prices not on the dollar?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Great info! TY.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,RKT is currently running +150%
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,home shoppinh club now on temporary break until fed realizes they fucked the 10 yr for a long time... have a nice day
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,lol still pushing rkt? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Can't forget about the mortgage moratorium ending at some point that will also bring a good 5% of the houses in the US back to the market.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"What about the moratorium on foreclosures? 

Is RKT exposed to foreclosures and the lost servicing revenue? 

With the moratorium on foreclosures releasing  massive supply of housing inventory on the market, will that also be a catalyst to surging mortgage applications and servicing? 

Assuming the foreclosure pace is the same as 2008, that suggests the surge in new mortgages comes early 2023."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok but what is a “mortgage?”
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Balls deep in GME and AMC...If my cash machines go BRR and RKT is still at a decent price I'll be in.

Anytime I see a chart where shares peak and drop, peak and drop, but the Market cap remains positive I put my tin hat on figure they're trying to push up but they're getting shorted back down every time and it's rampant."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you think UWMC will track RKT or reverse it?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks I will buy more GME on Monday. See you there

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Uwmc a better bet
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck rocket 🚀
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"😂😂 great write up bro. I agree with most of these points for sure. Hence why I have short/long positions. Longer term, Rocket will be well position as a company to lead the next generation of home buyers to home ownership, which like your analysis shows will be 6-12 months out once full supply catch's up. Short term, there are plenty of roadblocks, but I still think they are being WAY undervalued, and shorted against the view of another housing crash, that I personally don't think is there.

But who really knows... Going to ride this rocket ship till we get there 🚀"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Like in the Big Short, being early is the same as being wrong. People always get the timing wrong. This is easily something several years problem down the road."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was going to comment here but you nailed every point. I assume you’re in the industry. 

There are some small short term worries that may ding the stock price here and there, but not the housing market’s macro trends.

If you’re a home owner and have been watching rates, refi-ing, and watching neighborhood sales, you see how bonkers it is and how imbalanced supply demand still is. Hot take: rising rates will create panic fomo by buyers."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Very well written!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,your words r gud

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Bag holder 🤡
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Undervalued for sure. I like the stock. And it has great upward potential.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like both but I'm retarded so.

RKT and PLTR I keep adding to it every dip but it keeps dipping."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It's only stuck because we don't get enough volume to push the shorts off. Last time we got volume on RKT it went to 44 a share from 20
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It was literally just at 46. I thought It would take 2 years to double my money and it took 2 weeks lol last month.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Riding this to the moon rocket 🚀
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I like it. But the supply is not there. Also a 2020 300k house is now $350k+ but people are not selling as the next house they need to buy is at premium 🚀. Materials for building a house are 20-30% up on average so that dictates the new market price. In the region I live every new construction is *luxury*. These 15k will not go a long way in a bidding war. Rkt will still do great.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,15k for some one to buy a home for the first time is really unfair.  Suchs to be the bitch who just closed.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,What do you mean by devour?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"We'll.. just look at what the demographic group of these ""first time home buyers"" would look like. They sure as hell arnt the Melvin's and the Boomers of the world. Younger generations are most likely to take advantage to this, which also means they will most likely do their research and buying online, which also means Rocket is in an amazing position to swoop in."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It won’t. It will make encourage people who are unable to keep up with mortgage payments to buy houses and increase the chance of another 2008 happening
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Which calls though? Just during the last squeeze?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good point.  I will be reinvesting my divi and JAY, DAN and all insiders will be reinvesting !  This week will see nice volume."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Even if they don't reinvest, institutional ownership is at about 70%. Using that as a proxy for reinvestment, that would be 3M shares that need to be purchased, or 2.8% of float. To match the continued drive down in price would require shorts to double their short volume, and cut significantly into shares available for short."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,just wait till every one starts using option arm mortgages again!  this boom is just getting ggoing!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Better be, bagholding at 33 :/"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or you could hold both, although I sold off enough rocket on the first big spike to cover my position when I bought back in on the dip"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m currently uwmc gang (was rkt too for that initial spike and made a few), but wouldnt downvote this since the catalysts are also applicable to uwmc. Or am i wrong?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The problem is volume, if we're divided by both were never gonna get enough volume for either. In my opinion RKT is a mile ahead of UWMC."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Its the Tesla Roadster Kind.  I just placed my order.  When RKT takes off I'm going full geek baller!

They're a beast.  I don't worry about this short term shit.  So the stock drops a few points on a slow this or that.  Fuck it.  We are going to Valhalla in this Rocket ship in a year or two.  BOOOOM!   Shorts are fucked.  They can't stay short for years while this RKT carves up and disrupts the direct to consumer mortgage market."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right now major roadblock is supply. Foreclosures will bring that fresh supply. I personally think that may turn positive in Rockets position, help bring in new loans from the new buys in the market."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Citadel is a market maker which means they buy and sell a large volume of options contracts across the spread in milliseconds.

I wouldn't put too much faith on 13Fs for call/puts it doesn't tell us much for a large MM like Citadel, SIG or Virtual Financial. It's impossible to tell what they are up to. 

If you look at that same report, Citadel also sold 1.3M $RKT shares for $20 between quarters, which to me is a big tell. 

I have a position in both $RKT and $GME."

I was able to drop mortgage insurance just by refinancing saving me $750 a year and lowering my payments. The mortgage insurance was baked into the life of my original loan and would not fall off at 80%"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,... yeah .. that’s what I thought after buying 20@37..(my second deal) ...

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depends on what you mean by that. I want verifiable Reasonably supported facts. And I don't mind some upfront conjecture based on those facts, or honesty on why it can be difficult to know some things for sure. There are plenty of subs this controversial and slippery term of a conspiracy theorist is at home in."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s culture is all about customer service and innovation. It’s not about ultimatums like UMWC which is stuck in the past. 

RKT culture will allow it to devour more market share and expand into other fields. I am seeing it become the Amazon of fintech."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Also worth pointing out that first-time buyer is defined as anyone who hasn't owned a home for three years. Opens up the pool to people who may have downsized to a rental at some point.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Please tell me there are more regulations in place to prevent that from happening.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well personally i bought 3 calls that expire this week at 26$, but i speculate they will expire worthless tbh. I bought shares to hedge. Will see how it goes i reckon"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Most of it came from that squeeze, however I've still made a few thousand post squeeze which I've profited. As I said another squeeze is a possible as long as it's played right buy us."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The problem with being in UWMC is that they are in a downtrend in earnings. Who are they losing to? RKT, being in both is just asking to cancel profit with loss on another. Also UWMC only had that pop due to speculation they were going to get added to the Russell which is not happening. Expect a bloodbath monday."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m in both as well. More stake in RKT because there is more data to go off of for long term investment.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed. More people are willing to sell in the spring and summer time. Inventory will increase in the coming months!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you may be too confident in this part of your DD, just pointing out what I’m seeing on the ground as a 20+ year real estate investor. Supply is decreasing based on the factors I described and I don’t expect new construction to catch up anytime soon.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You're saying they had to deliver on calls they wrote?  Now they are low on inventory (effectively sht rkt).  Is that what you mean?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry I didn't mean to ask for a limitation on numbers like I had like 6 in mine, so the profit motive  is that rkt continues to grow and will outperform.."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m not a real estate expert nor in the field. 

I refi’d my condo mortgage via RKT couple of yrs ago as rates were dropping, but then my debt was transferred to another lender. (This is common and not fault of RKT). 

I keep hearing this feud between RKT and UWMC, but simply said there’s always two sides of the business. From what I’ve been reading, UWMC is a wholesaler and would deal mostly with mortgage brokers. IDK if RKT is doing DTC(direct to consumer) business or not and/or only targets ppl with higher rate to refi. (As in my personal case)

It’s whichever company gives the most kickback to mortgage broker whether UWMC/RKT that may be favorable for the loan officer to choose. If overall real estate mkt is to improve(again don’t know if it will or not) then both companies should be able to benefit. Not knowing the kickback details from mortgage brokers between the two companies are what is unknown to me."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Sure but everyone and their mother refinanced to lower rates last year. Not many people are going to be refinancing to higher rates this year and into the future
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ppl on e sidelines due to inventory watching rates rise and fomo, yes. I’ve both bought and sold into that before."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah! At least all those other ones are grounded in reality!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,No shit you can't get a gamma squeeze without volume .
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You know, being Amazon devouring whatever is bad right? I m all in RKT, but I don't agree with monopoly, it won't work in the long run. If u mean investing in other sectors, sure."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well perhaps it wouldn’t be the same, and lead to a crash. But encouraging people in that way to just jump into a lifelong commitment is irresponsible. This type of increase will inflate housing prices more than they already are due to higher demand. And it will lead to people who probably shouldn’t be indebting themselves to do so. It does look good on the surface, and could help a lot of people. But in the long term I believe it will hurt more people than it helps, especially if those people are not thinking in the long term about their life, the market, their job situation 5-10 years in the future.  More education about that sort of thing would be more beneficial than just cutting temporary financial relief."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,and then theres that whole hostage taking attempt of theirs... ouch.  RKT is in the drivers seat now!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Then paper hand the shit.  RKT is a long term winner.  Whats 1 soft quarter when they are revolutionizing direct to consumer mortgage lending.

This is an Amazon situation!  No one is close.  They at like #150 in the finance catagory in the app store.  80K reviews 4.8/5 stars.  The next best app?  Crickets.  There are no other apps that do this, not even close.  Half these guys dont have an app you can even pay your mortage with.  They never invested in this, these are bankers, fuck you give me your money people.  They don't want to be good.  RKT has them beat, its over.

2021-03-21 03:20:42,wallstreetbets,"What Do Bonds and Yields Mean? I have noticed that a lot of here can't read so of course I decided to write up about Bonds. Who cares nobody is going to read it anyways.

A bond is a loan. When you buy a bond from an entity, you are essentially loaning them your money.  like any loans, a bond has a face value ( principal) and coupon rate( interest you get for loaning the money until the loan matures). So when I buy a $1000 bond, let say for the face value which is $1000 and a coupon rate of 2%( a year), it means  I will get 2% of the principal which is $20 yearly and at the end of the term when it matures I get my principal back.

A bond yield ( there are different ways of calculating this but for the most part you need to know yield to maturity rate)  =  annual coupon payment / bond price. so for the example above the yield is the same as coupon rate of 2%.

So reading this you might ask yourself that why the yield fluctuates. Referring back to the yield formula above, for yields to go up, either the coupon amount has to increase or the bond price needs to drop. coupon is usually fixed so the only way the yields can go up is for the bond to depreciate in price. Remember regardless of how much you pay for a $1000 bond, you will get the same coupon payment and $1000 principal at the end.

Imagine you are selling a car  and you have a buyer who is willing to pay $9500 and your friend asks you if you would sell the car to her and she will pay you $10000 in a year. Is this a fair deal? In order to answer this question you need to determine how much $10000 a year from now is worth today aka present value(PV) of future cash (FV). This is a fundamental concept in putting a value on an assets(long duration) like stocks or bonds. In simple terms, what you do is to look at the rates for a one year loan and let's say it is 5%.

PV of $10000 = $10000 / (1+0.05) = $9523

so if you wait a year you get more money for your car.

&#x200B;

In the example above, I assumed there was no inflation ( =0). but what if the inflation is 2%?  Let's do the same PV(present value) calculation only considering inflation:

PV + PV\*Inflation = $10000 (FV) so PV = 9803.

&#x200B;

so now considering both rates ( interest rate + inflation):

PV +PV\*interest + PV\*inflation = FV -> PV = FV / (1+ inflation+interest).

So going back to the car example and including inflation:

&#x200B;

PV = 10000 / (1 + .05+ .02) = $9345.

So, with inflation,  now the 9500 offer sounds better than 10000 next year.  The higher the inflation, the lower the PV of a future cash flow.

&#x200B;

This is the main reason for the all the volatility in the past few weeks. As the inflation fears grow, people start discounting the value of 10 year treasury notes to PV and realizing that it is not worth it to pay as much as last year to buy the bonds because of the fear of erosion in the pv due to an inflation hike and are paying less to buy bonds and that causes the bond yields to go up.

&#x200B;

A similar method is used for stock valuation to determine the PV of future cash flows of a company. in this process, an investor determines the PV of  the future earnings (cash flow) of a company and based on that calculates a fair price. So for the growth stocks where most of the cash flow is in the future, the the higher the inflation the lower the PV of those cash flows and hence you see multiples on those stocks drop.

So in high inflation environments, value stocks are preferred since a good chunk of their earnings is happening at the present especially the ones with pricing power. i.e. banks, energy, commodities and industrial."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Good  wrap up from a fellow autist. I'm just learning this investment/stock market shit. That helped.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I bought a bond at a discount (Let’s say, $850) and I get back par value ($1,000) at the end, plus interest payments along the way, it doesn’t seem like a bad thing. The worry comes from considering that even though I’ll make money, I won’t make enough money to beat inflation?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh shit, now CNBC, WSJ, Bloomberg, Barron's going to go bananas talking about how WSB is obsessed with Bonds and won't stop talking about it. 

Maybe this is 4d space chess though, might get that nasty yield to drop if people start FOMO into actually buying these worthless slips of dinosaur skin.  Then tech comes roaring back!

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Excellent overview of the dynamics, thank you for posting this!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"A bond is essentially a loan, GE wants to raise $100mm and they offer 5% interest rate to pay you for the loan, the longer til the bond (loan) matures the more interest they’ll need to pay.  At 5% that’s $50 a year for every bond you buy ($1000 increments) that $50 NEVER changes however the price of the bond fluctuates based on several factors.  Now it’s 5 years later, the loan (bond) doesn’t mature for another 25years (30 yr bond) if the price of the bond is lower, say $800 and the $50 interest stats the same, now your yield on those bonds would be 6.25% (divide the $50 by the current price of the bond, $800 and that’s YOUR rate of interest.  800/50=6.25    Does that help"

TL:DR - bond yields are up because of expected bump in inflation. Nobody would pay for a 2% return when inflation is expected to be ~2%

Inflation goes up = value stocks are preferred because they’re making money now.  Speculative tech stocks with high multiples will take a dip because you’re betting on future revenue (not as valuable as earnings now during inflation)

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"yes, what you own in dollar amount is just a number. I would encourage you to look at dollar in the context of purchasing power."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,But you won't lose 40% in a crash. I had bonds.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you bought a $1000 par value bond for $850 you bought a bond after the interest rates went up (for whatever reason.)

Imagine you buy a bond with 10 years to maturity for $1000.  At the current 10% interest rate in the going market, you will get paid $100 every year no matter what for however long you hold that bond.

Now imagine that 1 second after you buy that bond, interest rates jump to 15% percent.  Now you go to sell your bond to someone else so you can get 15% yield instead of 10%.  Someone else in the market with $1000 could either buy your bond and get 10% yield, or they could buy the bond with the new 15% yield for the same price.  They are obviously going to buy the bond with the higher yield.  In order to sell your bond, you have to discount it.  In this case, the price of the bond would need to be sold for $749.06 in order to be competitive with the new bonds in the market.

So in short, you arent getting a ""deal.""  You are paying fair value for a bond based on its coupon rate relative to comparable bonds' yields.

Edit: I added a word that didnt need to be there and I am a loser that needed to fix it."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"And the bigger consequence is that they have to increase the rates to keep bonds attractive. That means it costs more to borrow money. That slows growth, i.e. it's riskier to be long in growth stocks."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ya , a bond with this low yield after like 10 fuckin years you get  $150 + $200 return on your investment. If inflation is like  1.5- 2% per year 
 it cancels out half your profit."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"And that is why yields are blowing out, because no one will buy. GME is being played against a couple hedge funds the bond sell of is Infiniti wars and thanos is about to snap and half those here will no longer exist financially."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bond good, ape like bond"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Additionally, once you own the bond, you can sell it at anytime before its maturity to a third party (Bond traders/ Brokers etc) at the prevailing market price."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is not correct.

First, you already paid $1000 for the bond.  YOUR rate of interest will ALWAYS be 5%

Second, the 6.25% that you are referencing (which is an incorrect value) is the current interest rate (the yield for a comparable new issue 25 yr. bond) that would cause the price of your bond (if you were to sell it) to drop to $800.  

In your scenario, for your bond to be worth only $800, interest rates would have risen on a 25 yr. bond to 6.665%.  

This means that between two equally rated bonds, a rational investor with $1000 will always choose the bond with the higher yield.  Your 30 year bond 5 years later is now effectively a 25 year bond.  25 year bonds will yield 6.665% while your bond only yields 5%.  No one will buy your bond.  In order for people to want to buy your bond, you have to discount it.  The fair value price for your 25 yr bond that pays a 5% coupon rate in a market that offers bonds at 6.665% yield is only $800."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"They are discounting the value of future earnings, since they will be worth less due to inflation. That means a lower multiple, which means it is worth less. They then evaluate whether their position needs to be reduced by the new proposed price of the stock in the future, and sell a needed.

At least that's the theory. In actuality it's just herd mentality, and knowing that growth stocks will be sold if yields rise. It provides a great opportunity for those that plan to hold growth stocks, since the earnings of the growth companies will likely increase just as much by inflation."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Rates for loans are comprised of multiple things.  For simplicities sake, just just think of those things as multiple risk factors.  The more risky an issuer finds that it is to loan out money, the higher the interest rate will be.  The longer timeframe, the riskier it is the person you loaned to will default.  Therefore in order to take the risk of giving out money, the bank will require higher interest paid.  Same with credit risk.  Someone with terrible credit history, or deemed a liability based on current financial situations will be more risky to lend to, therefore higher interest rate.

Start with the risk free rate.  Which is basically the US treasury rate (risk free, basically because the USA is a Lannister, and a Lannister always pays his debts).  Add on top of that all of those other risk factors, and you come up with the interest rate that banks have determined you need to pay for them to give you a loan.

Edit:

In this case, the 5% is determined by the market, not by GE.  The market for a 30 year comparable bond has determined that at the time, based on the time horizon, credit risk of GE, and inflation risk (and a few other smaller risks), in order for people to buy the bonds GE would need to pay 5% interest."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Cum loud
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Growth stocks don’t have much current cash flow but they are expected to have future cash flows and they usually have a high EV multipliers as their EV (market cap net of debt) is disconnected from the fundamentals of the business. Because of discounted cash flow and the principle of the time value of money, those expected future cash flows are worth less and people move from investments that are riskier and speculative. $1 in five years is worth less to a company than $1 today; with inflation that $1 in five years is worth even less, so it’s generally a prudent move to invest in value companies that can weather the storm of inflation and gave cash flows today."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"$10k or 10 bonds pays a total of $500 interest ($50/bond) and while you can sell anytime generally bonds are bought for the income and held, only your specific situation would determine if you sell and take a loss or not."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,basically. Becasue normally you buy bonds when you want to guarantee not losing money at the risk of drastically reduced upside. Generally you might want to sell the bond at a loss if the market starts to take back off and you still think that $800 will become more than the end result of the bond.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It could be for a host of reasons. Yes, you might believe interest rates are about to rise , ie the price of the bond will drop. You may have found an opportunity elsewhere, another bond maybe or perhaps a stock that offers more value.  You may decide to switch your bond for a similar bond on a different part of the yield curve.  Or simply, you just might need the money.

You aren’t alone others that were leveraged do the same. Now all these paper hands are taking losses to get something “safe”, US dollars. This leads to more articles and fear that stocks are falling and to run to this safe investment US dollars. Little do you know, the US dollar is in free fall. Your safe money was better off investing in a company with a low balance sheet that makes a percentage of GDP.

In other words, convert US dollars to something that will hold value. Borrowing US dollars is only tolerable if you know there’s future cash flow to cover it. Only buy stocks you see as long term investments because you trust it more than that “safe” money your parents sold you on, US Dollars."

If or when GME goes nuclear, I'm using 10% of the payout to fuck these banks and institutions and tech companies right in the ass by shorting their stocks and buying puts on them as the market crashes. I can't WAIT for a stock market crash - I'll just buy the dip in the companies I like when it is all over. It's about time billionaires saw their net worth evaporate faster than the average person's savings. And the kicker is, all of that hard stolen money, all of those ill gotten gains... go straight into normal peoples' pockets and taxes, EXACTLY where the billionaires were stealing them from.

Their asking for bailouts will be fucking glorious this time, what with societal restlessness being what it is. I would like to see them try. Let's see if they are as sucessful this time as they were in the past."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"""investors have agreed to work together to buy shares and out-of-the-money call options""

Well, the article got one thing right. Remember, how certain someone decided to hype himself by predicting a gamma squeeze on Friday based on the number of call options for that day? I wonder how many apes got into the call options and got burned hard on that Friday. So the lesson is 1) don't read hype DDs, 2) don't dabble with options, 3) only buy and hold, and 4) there is no we.

This does not.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was reading up on how Greggs founder (UK) used to deliver yeast on his bike as a kid. Then he delivered flour and eggs until he saved enough to start his own bakery.  
  
I thought that is a great idea. So my son and I grew veg in our garden. We would bag it up in to small salad bags and herb bags. I would then send my.son out with his bike and a red wagon type trailer knocking on people's doors asking if they would like fresh veg or herbs for £1 a bag. Each bag contained 2 cucumbers, 1 gem lettuce and 5 or 6 tomatoes and herb bags would be a stalk of each herb we grew.  
  
It started pretty well. My son would come back with a fair chunk of change each weekend until one day the cops picked him up and brought him home. Apparently theirs laws preventing this shit now. When I brought up the Greggs start up story and asked how he did it they replied ""This law didnt exist then"" we looked at getting the permits and licence etc... for my son to start his own business... yeah he can't start until he's 18 and pays £10,000 for shit just to sell the locals some fresh vegetables for 1/8th the price of the local super markets.  
  
The only good news is CPS in the UK dosnt want to prosecute a 9yo so we're just ignoring the law. When he's 18 he should have saved the £10,000 to actually get all the licences and actually start his own salad farm which would be good for him."

2021-03-21 02:44:52,wallstreetbets,"DD and Analysis on Poshmark (POSH). Why I think it is undervalued and why there is room for a lot of growth. Founded in 2011, the company's online marketplace for secondhand clothes, shoes and accessories is akin to eBay and Etsy. Poshmark connects buyers with sellers, who often list items from their own closet. And it makes money by taking a cut of every transaction.
 
Poshmark (POSH) went public on January 14, 2021, at a price of $42, but when shares opened for trading the stock reached $104.98. Since then the stock price has fallen to more reasonable prices and is currently trading at about $46. 

The company owns and operates a social marketplace. This platform is used to buy and sell lifestyle products in the U.S. and Canada (and it is currently expanding to Australia). POSH sells apparel, footwear, beauty, and home products as well as accessories and jewelry. (As it expands to Australia, it is trying to enter the pets market and distribute pet supplies and accessories like Chewy)

As POSH is a social marketplace the company encourages repeat purchases ensuring a high customer engagement rate. It ended the September quarter with more than 31.7 million active users, 6.2 million active buyers, and 4.5 million active sellers.

POSH claims active users spent 27 minutes on average each day on its platform in 2019 which resulted in 20.5 billion social interactions. While the company’s sales rose 38% year over year in 2019 to $205 million, its net loss widened by 236% to $49 million.

In the first three quarters of 2020, sales were up 28% at $193 million. Further, the company was also able to turn profitable and reported $21 million in net income. For the last quarter ended Dec. 31, Poshmark's loss narrowed to $4.06 million, or 31 cents per share, from a loss of $14.75 million, or $1.20 per share, a year earlier. After adjusting for one-time items, the company earned 5 cents a share during the quarter.

Revenue climbed 27% to $69.32 million from $54.74 million a year earlier. That was higher than the average revenue estimate of $68 million, reported by Refinitiv.

For the first quarter of 2021, Poshmark is calling for revenue to fall within a range of $75.5 million to $77.5 million. Analysts had been calling for $79.2 million on average.

Consumers, especially younger ones, are increasingly turning to these types of internet marketplaces for secondhand goods. Sellers are starting to prefer the site as they do not have to deal with estimating shipping price. There is only USPS priority. This allows the item to reach the buyer much faster and saves the time of the seller. Items over $500 are sent to Poshmark to ship to the buyer. This is to verify authenticity. This reduces/eliminates any scams that sellers or buyers have to go through for fake item claims. Trust is essential. Convenience is key. 

Poshmark said its count of active buyers reached 6.5 million in the fourth quarter, up 20% year over year. The company defines active buyers as unique users who have purchased at least one item on the platform in the trailing 12 months, regardless of returns and cancellations.

Cowen & Co. has previously estimated that the resale market in the U.S. is valued at $30 billion to $35 billion.

TL;DR After DD, I feel that the stock is undervalued. I like the stock.

Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. Just the DD I’ve found."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,POSH skews to the higher-end reselling market.  Thredup is for the cheaper stuff.  There will be a lot of sales as Americans realize they need to size-up after covid.

Mercari takes 10%, their website and app is janky but works.

Poshmark appeals to trendy people, mainly higher class women.  I think of as the Apple of clothing seller platforms.

Its good to buy from, but bad as a seller.  That 20% fee ...oooof."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,All I see is a massive PE ratio
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,She’s my favorite spice girl
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah...except...most of the sellers on Poshmark kinda hate Poshmark. I mean I kinda hate it but I don’t leave so maybe you are onto something here. 

Their customer support is about as good as robinhood’s, and Poshmark heavily favors the buyers in dispute cases and lets buyers return things against their own TOS (pants didn’t fit oh and by the way I ripped the zipper trying to force them on, here’s your ruined pants back) just to keep buyers happy and drives a lot of sellers away for that. 

Also Poshmark loses a ton of “off platform” sales where sellers cross list their items on PM/mercari/eBay and when they find a buyer on PM they say “hey I have this for sale cheaper on this other site bc Poshmark will take 20%” and the sale actually happens on another site

Not to mention PM has increased shipping prices 2x in the last year from around $5 to almost $8 per item which really turns a lot of buyers off. Sellers end up paying half or all of the shipping for the buyers just to close the sale on top of PM’s 20% cut and that turns off the sellers so it’s a no win

I could rant about a lot more

Full disclosure I am a pretty successful PM seller and have made a lot of money doing it, I just don’t see any real value growth in the company until they fix some core issues"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"They advertise on TV where I live. I find the ads funny - they target buyers, saying the buyers supposedly get good deals on high-fashion items. And they target  sellers by making it sound like they are making money when in fact they are getting maybe half of what they paid for something 6 months ago when they bought it new.  ""I'm taking a trip to Fiji by clearing out unwanted items in my closet!"" 

I have some co-workers that in the Before Times had new clothes every week seemingly. I wonder if they are buying used on Poshmark and flipping them after a short time for a small loss. Maybe it's a lot cheaper to dress like a baller if you can do that - get a $300 blazer for $150,  in a couple months sell it to someone else for $110."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"“ The company defines active buyers as unique users who have purchased at least one item on the platform in the trailing 12 months, regardless of returns and cancellations.”

So not to spread fud but how is that good news? 
Average active monthly user would be a better metrics. So if you take their number of active buyers and divided by 12 their active monthly user is likely around 1/2 million only. Assuming from Nov to Dec that is probably the largest number of active users. So not sure if this is a good investment at this high of valuation?"

2021-03-21 02:38:35,wallstreetbets,"GME - Possible Tesla Like Short Squeeze? - DD In the comments of [yesterday's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8racu/bloomberg_terminal_gme_data_as_of_eod_0319/) by u/yodisc I saw some commenters mentioning that this is looking similar to the 2020 Tesla short squeeze, so I did some digging and I'm here to share what I found with everyone today. 
&#x200b;  
#GME Graph and Shorts  
First, let's look at the graph of GME. According to sources such as S3 Partners, Ortex, Fintel, Yahoo! Finance, and a few others, most short interest estimates I have found range from 20%-80% of the float, not accounting for shorts through ETFs. This is down from estimates of about 140%-150% during the first squeeze, if this information is to be correct, it is clear that the first squeeze had numerous shorts covering, but not all shorts were covered. This leaves us with the current range of 20%-80% interest, which is still quite high.  
&#x200b;  
https://i.imgur.com/BSpHXlu.jpg  
&#x200b;  
Now, based on Fintel information, we can see that institutional put/call ratio is 2.81, meaning there is still a large portion of shorts compared to long positions. We can also see that for the past 10 trading days ~23% of trading volume has been short sales, which could provide support for the theory of the price being shorted so it doesn't go up too much.    
&#x200b;  
https://i.imgur.com/Mp5cJXD.jpg    
&#x200b;  
#TSLA Graph  
Now, if we look at Tesla's graph from 2020 to now, we can see the process of a slow short squeeze along with catalysts and improving value for the company. (Namely Model 3 sales)     
&#x200b;  
Towards the beginning of 2020 Tesla short interest was estimated to be ~20%, ending now at ~5%.  
&#x200b;  
Tesla seemed to follow a similar pattern to what we are seeing starting now, where it has a bit of a squeeze, corrects, more squeeze, corrects, rinse and repeat.     
&#x200b;  
https://i.imgur.com/KB4hKRu.jpg    
&#x200b;  
#Is This Similar?
Based on the numbers available and the patterns available, it appears this could be a similar squeeze to the 2020 Tesla short squeeze. However, this scenario is also different, we are dealing with a situation with a lot more press and larger short volume, not to mention an almost war like scenario, David and Goliath style.   
&#x200b;  
It is also worth noting, company catalysts fueled the Tesla squeeze, similarly we can see the recent squeeze from $40 to $200 was because of digital transformation plans, but for this to follow the same pattern catalysts would need to continue coming.  
&#x200b;  
#Unknowns
Now, a few things I wanted to briefly go over while I have my little stage here. First, there's no way to tell how earnings will affect the stock, if it will. Earnings could come out surprisingly well or have good guidance, and it could be a catalyst. Shorts could use the opportunity to push the price down more, after all markets tend to react negatively to earnings, it would be a good way to hide it. It may entice some of you to sell prior to earnings and buy again at a lower price, however because of the strange nature of this stock, if you want to be here for a potential squeeze it would be better to just HODL.   
&#x200b;  
I would also like to note, there's no way for us to accurately see who is currently still short GME, such as if Citadel or Melvin still hold the same positions they were in before. Melvin reported they owned 60,000 puts on GME with no calls to hedge as of 12/31/2020, you can see this in their [most recent 13F filing, which was filed 2/26/21.](https://sec.report/Document/0000905718-21-000248/)  
&#x200b;  
If you would like to see the most recent info on institutional ownership, take a visit to [holdings channel, which gives a good view based on the most recent information from filings.](https://www.holdingschannel.com/bystock/?symbol=gme)    
&#x200b;     
From this we can see that Citadel and Melvin are (unsurprisingly) some of the largest short positions, however Melvin has no hedging but Citadel also owns a large amount of calls, which I would assume is to hedge.      
&#x200b;  
That's all I have for you apes today, thanks for reading, and I feel as though this is required;      
Not financial advice."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did you really print the graph and then took a pic of it? Wow, that is beyond retard even for someone on this sub"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"THE NUMBERS, MASON. 

WHAT. DO. THEY. MEAN."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I assumed since the start of the GME hype train that the reality would end up being something similar to Tesla. 

If somehow the MOASS happens, awesome. If not, hold tight and ride the roller coaster to Tendietown. 

We’re just missing a Cathie Wood price target of $25,000."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"ive proof read and tldr’d op’s post with the 4 brain wrinkles i have.. he said

-buy and hodl

youre welcome"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel like GME will experience a slow climb up instead of a violent squeeze.  Regardless I am not fucking selling.  Biotchhhhhhhhh. Downloaded the gamestop app, make a few purchases and signed up for the rewards program."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Where did you get the 20% short vol from? I see the SS but can't see the actual source.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"no, actual shorts are way way fucking higher than Tesla"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,HODL🦧
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I noticed that you didn’t put a tldr so I’ve gone ahead and summarised it as short as I can.

TLDR: 🚀"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Recall of shares would be a win win for GME and Apes would it not?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way 💎💎🙌💎💎
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Short interest percentage is much higher than 20-80%
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,😱😱😱
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I would follow any many stepping in here with a printed out chart. Onward brother 🦍🦍🚀🚀🚀🚀
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,So basically buy more GME then forget the password to your brokerage account so you can’t sell
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Similar with TSLA in 20. I will buy and accumulate shares and play weeklies C's 1-2 times per month. As Cathie ""Can get my"" Wood said, the longer the base the more sustained the parabolic move or someshit. I don't remember, I was looking at her neck veins, imagining her on her back."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"TESLA has novelty that GME does not, for the time being. A push towards VR would be valuable imo. VR and other tech like AR are game changers that are not appreciated by the average Joe. 

Going digital is great but is nothing new when there are so many competitors like steam and that other thing I use that offers me some free games for time to time. 

Amazon like shipping is a good move that sets roots for future prospects, but VR/AR is imo an avenue that only a physical shop can advertise properly."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope everyone is reading the DD on the best way to prep and make sure they capture the squeeze when it goes over a milly
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Apes, if they probably attack on earnings day, just hold. Emotions are dead. We are calm. Earnings are often used to fuck stocks"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"TSLA is a futuristic autonomous electric vehicle company run by the world’s richest man who sends rockets into space and plans to live on Mars. 

GME is a struggling brick and mortar game store chain, with a few big hedge funds shorting it to hell and back to cause this frenzy, with prospects to turn it around and move more to online. 

They are not comparable no matter what chart you look at. You need “my disabled son’s car will be able to drive him places” change the world sentiment to have the same kind of sustained run. Can it squeeze, sure. Can it maintain it like TSLA, no?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn't even read any of this. Saw the post title and got the point. HOLD!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I wonder what would happen if u held a gme LEAP and somewhere in that time it squeezed
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Tesla wasn't a short squeeze
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I found earlier DD showing similar trends to TELSA. Haters constantly attackimg hype with shorts but an overwhelming retail love and call buyers. Hence how tesla stock is valued at 100x the company sales currently. Right now GME stock is barely 1.5x its yearly sales. I think 6-12 months from now we see gme trading close to 1k.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You write good for ape
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,If the first squeeze removed 💯 of the float and there may be as little as 20% left; what do people base the 🚀😶 on?  Seems more likely a top cap of maybe $450 based on solid smooth brain 🦍🧮
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,https://youtu.be/nLnw2_q5iMk
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think this more closely resembles the tesla call infinity gamma dqueeze then the tesla infinity short squeeze, but maybe it's a combination of both? Tesla went from less then 70 to 1400 in one year. That puts our price target from let's say 4 to 14000000000 in one year? 

Is that right, I didn't eat enough crayons today so my brain is a little fuzzy?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,If Melvin isn’t hedged then maybe they got bailed out by citadel bananas and Citadeal hedges for both of them with the calls
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Dad is shit 20-80% is hardly a fkin range
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree, this is why I'm selling options on GME forever"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I’d rather have the squeeze.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,We have the best DD because of GME
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. Yes I did.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This is some shit my 60 year old dad would be doing to more easily “analyze” charts.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Strong boomer energy tbh
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Beautiful, this is the level of retarded I’m here for. Will pick a couple more up Monday in honour of this."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,OP is clearly a boomer
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, I'm not retarded enough to give this comment a gold, but it defiantly deserves it"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"> they just keep kicking the can down the road

Yeah but it's a long ass road"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The whole point of comparing to Tesla is the repeated catalysts, which OP mentioned but basically said ""I don't know.""

I'd be much more interested in tying the jumps in stock price to the timing of previous catalysts, such as the announcement that Cohen and Sherman came to an agreement, the firing of the CFO, and the formation of the subcommittee. Seems to me those sparked each surge, and with a fascinating delay built in. Could be the short attacks are fomenting those delayed reactions and influencing how large the surge is."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Um Melvin bought puts, they didn’t sell them. And they’re no longer short shares."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,LMAO
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Qqq options priced well atm? Should we take a punt that it’ll go down
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"YES! you see it too, the QQQ etc. positions taken

&#x200B;

if I had any money left, I'd go all in short in QQQ right two weeks ago

&#x200B;

not bearish: realistic"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Stonk
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, with as much manipulation as we're seeing and the range of information from different sources, it's a lot easier for me to imagine a Tesla like situation at this point rather than just a huge MOASS all at once."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol Cathie so bullish it is almost comical
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I am with you !  Supporting Gamestop whenever I can.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I agree. That's what my post has evidence for."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm thinking slow, cyclical climb until a violent squeeze."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Just like TSLA. 😝. Come one dude. GME is nowhere close to TSLA. One is cutting edge technology and the other is boomers Atari.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,[That was taken from the Fintel website](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme)
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do not rely on Fintel or S3 or Ortex or whoever. They recently changed their formulas to make short interest lower. Additionally, naked shorts are not counted in in short-interest. Also, short volume is different than short interest. Short volume can include shorts that are covered in a given day, while short interest is shorts outstanding. Also also, any ETFs that are shorted that have GME are not reflected in the numbers given by those websites. Also also also, Citadel among others have been sued many many many times over the years for hiding the true short interest on stocks. Fintel could say GME had 1% short interest and GME might truly have a number closer to 70%. You can't rely on it."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm speaking on the sources I could find, there's no way to know for sure."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Interesting idea, could work out quite well, but at the same time premiums are quite high, and the risk is too high for me to recommend it even if that is your expectation."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Wut? Ford at this point is just a car company. Tesla is into multiple areas of buisiness that could be absolutely massive in their own right. Anyone following them knows this. And I would point out ford has had a massive spike just on releasing one good electric car.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It was partially a short squeeze partially a value play. That's what I mentioned with the catalysts and transformation that would be needed to combine with the current gamestop situation to fulfill this outcome.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope so but I've heard that over and over again lol.  Imma just hold and chill and if we get some nice action it happens.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stop preaching dates, you lovely retard."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You guys say this every week. Last week was bootie.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It could be more, but I think the squeeze won't necessarily be an MOASS now, but instead a slow squeeze similar to Tesla's, given GME can adequately move to digital properly. It's an interesting situation, that's my personal speculative opinion. At the same time the numbers range so much a MOASS could even be possible. Know way to know for sure."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"3 month account telling people to stop posting about GME because ""it will stir the pot"".

Definitely nothing suspicious here guys. Nothing at all."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Youtube link with no explanation, I'm gonna assume this is a rickroll."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let's not forget catalysts, and personally it's hard for me to have a price expectation, but over $1k wouldn't surprise me in a good scenario."

Everybody measures them by what a flip phone can be while they’re ten steps down a path that flip phone users can’t even see. 

Then I looked into the new FSD beta and the ground-breaking neural net processing behind it. Fuck this company is pushing envelopes that most people can’t even comprehend.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Similar to Tesla? Are you high? The holders of GameStop stock now are assuming there will be a squeeze and  as soon as they don't believe that is happening they're going to sell out and take their money. GameStop certainly has potential on a pivot but Tesla at the point it was bought by many people was still undervalued as a potential game changer in multiple areas of the market.

Re: covering, they definitely covered, they said so under oath, anyone who believes otherwise is a delusional conspiracy theorist. And they made money in Feb despite GME spiking which is further anecdotal evidence"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/13ffaq.htm

Question 41 : What about short positions?

A: You should not include short positions on Form 13F. You also should not subtract your short position(s) in a security from your long position(s) in that same security; report only the long position.

Question 43 Q: What about options and warrants?

A: You may report put or call options that you hold and that are included on the Official List of Section 13(f) Securities. See FAQ 7; Rule 13f-1(c) under the Exchange Act (an institutional investment manager may rely on the most recent list of such securities published by the Commission pursuant to section 13(f)(4) of the Exchange Act); Form 13F Special Instructions 10 (de minimis positions) and 11 (how to report put and call options). You should not report put or call options that you write. This means that your short options positions like your short equity positions will not be reported on Form 13F or subtracted from a long position in the same issuer."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree with this take. I think Tesla's valuation was / is absurd however I do believe them being worth more than any other manufacturer is probably fair even if they don't make money. Fucking stellantis is putting v8's from 2001 in their new wagoneer and want to charge $80,000 for it. It's incredible."

Is it fair to say we don't actually know if Melvin wrote puts?

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep. The price ICE makers charge for yesteryear’s rehashed trash is criminal.

And a half year from now, when the new FSD is bubbling up to the awareness of the general public, people are going to see that Tesla is not a car company, but a tech company who has done what no other tech company has come CLOSE to.

I STILL see industry-watchers compare Tesla’s (early limited beta) 4D-persistent adaptive neural self driving model to approaches like Waymo’s. It’s insane Waymo is basically doing what video game devs have been doing for 40 years, mapping AI behaviour over millimeter-precise pre-mapped levels.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"HFs have to buy the shares back at some point (no one knows exactly when) at a price lower than the option price so they make a profit, if I understand correctly. If not, what am I missing in the high level understanding?

I am curious about the specific phrase ""finish the job"". What job is there to finish for the big players (the institutions with long positions)? Why is it a ""job""? 

A job suggests that action is required by someone, but the short squeeze will happen even if no one does anything, due to expiring options, right?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Melvin is out they get bail outs and suffered massive loss. They are most likely balancing long positions to outweigh any other puts/shorts they need to cover. HOWEVER citadel i think is in a bit of trouble with calls
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fintel mentions using FINRA as one of their sources, however what I find interesting about these two is that they have different overall volumes as well."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,short vol is not how many shares are being shorted
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I'll admit I don't know much about FSD. I also don't trust Elon-at the end of the day he's still a car salesman.....But what I do know is that Tesla is the real deal. Theyre not going anywhere. They have their issues but I do believe other manufacturers are in trouble.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I believe finish the job in this context referred to Citadel being drained of all resources and liquidating their assets. possibly an unnecessary step in removing their dominance in the market at this point. It's a simple case of market share being divided up by competitors when one competitor makes a bad decision financially speaking.

We do know when a short position *must* be closed, it's 21 days after a failure to deliver."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea, big difference too."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I trust my eyes.

You can watch the lead engineer of the neural net system talk at AI industry events. See the challenges they are solving which are bleeding edge in the tech world. 

You can watch the videos of the very few folks with the FSD Beta. See it improve from week to week with only a MINUSCULE amount of miles driven by the fleet. 

It is YEARS ahead of the competition. And it is just around the corner. (Beta is expanding to 1,000 or so very soon, with many more shortly after that.)

There are going to be goofs, accidents, probably even a few deaths (as expected no matter who’s driving). The media will FEAST on these ‘missteps’ (as they do with the most trivial ‘nothingburgergates’ with Apple).

That won’t change the fact that for YEARS Tesla is going to have the only car that provides consumers Level 4 autonomy on all public roads.

Elon and everybody else tout Level 5 autonomy, but Level 4 is the world-changer. 

Level 4 can drive with no driver in most circumstances, pulling over safely and calling for help when it’s not confident. Level 4 lets your car pick you up from the bar. Lets you share your wife’s car when she’s in a 3h marathon with her boyfriend. Lets you send your car out to go earn you money.

Level 5 is doing all that, but in ‘all’ circumstances instead of most.

When you think about it, there really is no such thing as Level 5. Humans can’t drive in all situations, so arguably aren’t Level 5. Level 5 is just a point where we say Level 4 is more capable than an arbitrary percentage of human drivers. 

By the end of the Summer Tesla is going to have L4 that’s more capable than the average human driver (still a fucking menace)."

No doubt everyone that owns anything related to tech has witnessed this bond shit show take place for over a month now. Bank stocks up, interest rates up and bears bank account up. This is the part where I'm supposed to say this isn't financial advise and other shit so there. While most bank stocks have went brrr lately one has been left out of the mix, SOFI. All of the smart money people on CNBC are screaming tech has died so long live boomer bank stocks because of the fucking 10 year bond rates going up.But the dumb fucks have forgot about Sofi, which just bought a bank and have applied for a national bank charter. If that happens this stock should print big time also higher rates would be good for them as well. In late 2019 during a round of funding Sofi was valued at over 4 billion. As of now the market cap is around 1.8 billion before the ticker gets changed probably some time next month. They offer more services than traditional banks granted there investing isn't the most user friendly UI but for fucks sake it's nothing an upgrade can't improve and they never restricted trading in any stocks in January. Just my opinion but mixing tech and banks together into one company seems like a winning bet.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Apparently you didn't they bought huge quantities of every meme stock but UWMC you clown.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depends. It depends especially how long til expiration and how high you bought em.

Let's say you bough uwmc 9c 4/16 for 1.10 premium. One costed 110 dollar at price of 8.80. If price drops Monday to 7.80 at market open instantly because premarket, the contract loses 50% in value. So basically instant 50% loss.

Now if you dont sell, with about 25 days out, theta eats 2.5-3% of the value per day at the same price. So if you hold it for 10 days you lose about 30%. The thing is, if you expect it to go higher than 8.90 until then, you're still better off keeping it.

Also if you think Monday stock price will drop hard but rebound, you should keep it. But yeah, sometimes a 50% loss is better than 100% loss.

But imagine uwmc getting added next Friday to the index because they conclude they made an error. Stock goes to  upwards, and you lost 50% plus potential gains.



If you wanna make sure to don't end up naked, sell at a loss. Close to expery options are always bets."

What UWMC said in the tweet basically amounts to ""Russell thinks less than 5% of our shares are available to the public. We disagree and will contest this decision.""

Pretty simple language when paraphrased... Still raises more questions than answers if you don't already know how index inclusion/exclusion can affect trading activity."

2021-03-21 00:51:11,wallstreetbets,"$GME Options for April 16 (27 Days) are absolutely nuts - Decryption assistance needed looking at OI I was scanning Gamestop options over the next 4 weeks sorting by various numbers, and when I selected open interest I was met with some very interesting information. Someone please look at the options distribution for 4/16 and tell me what you think it means.

From Fidelity's option chain table: PUTS EXPIRING 4/16/21 in order of Open Interest quantity and including dollar values if ITM - NOTE these are just dollar values of the shares if exercised, it is not the dollar value of the CONTRACTS representing the shares. I need to eat more wax fruit to unlock options math level 2.

\-50 cent strike - OI of 58,862 - $2.94m

\-10 dollar strike - OI of 33,581 - $33.58m

\-5 dollar strike - OI of 29,438 - $14.71m

\-1 dollar strike - OI of 18,839 - $1.88m

\-40 dollar strike - OI of 17,686 - $70.74m

\-50 dollar strike - OI of 15,606 - $78.03m

\-20 dollar strike - OI of 14,464 - $28.92m

\-3 dollar strike - OI of 11,098 - $3.32m

\-30 dollar strike - OI 10,876 - $32.62m

all the rest are under 10k contracts OI, with the top being the 7 dollar strike with an OI of 8,444 - representing 5.9m USD worth of shares if ITM

honorable mention due to dollar value - 200P 4,048 OI = $80.96m

This is where it gets wack, because the calls are all anticipating a moon, but do not have anywhere close the open interest of the puts despite having very similar dollar values if ITM. The 800C far outstrips any others with a whopping 15,581 OI ($1.24 BILLION WITH A B worth of shares if ITM), the next highest being the 400C at 4,582 OI ($183m if ITM), and all the others (100,200,300,500, etc.) have roughly 4k OI or less.

Is this the day of reckoning??? If hedges were betting Ch. 11 filed by April 16 that represents 353.6 million dollars worth of shares now ITM, no telling how much was paid in premium to acquire those. The value of the top 2 call strikes (If GME were 800+) represents a quadruple return over the 353m if GME were at zero.

Whats the alternative? Based on this, it seems to me like they are going to ride this squeeze and cash in the options and make a profit 100x what any retailer will -*from their own mistake*\- and the manipulation over the last few months is what enabled it. My gut tells me that most retailers dont have the cash to mess with options in these quantities due to IV spiking premiums.

&#x200B;

What do you think is more likely now - the puts go out of the money and the calls print, hedge funds make fat $$$ off recent their recent big bet to acquire tons of high strike calls... OR Hedges original bet of GME hitting zero was actually correct and the puts print? This does of course mean that GME must hit $800/share or higher for the options to be cashed in...

&#x200B;

Not financial advice as I cant read or write."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,just a reminder apes IF YOU WANT GME TO SQUEEZE FUCKING BUY SHARES NOT OPTIONS
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"the reason there are so many 800c is because it's the cheapest possible call option to hedge against a put for your more complex option trades on margin

basically in order to cap your loss from infinity, and therefore let the trade go through, the broker says ""you have to prove you can cover this position if it goes to infinity""  and so you say ok fine you asshole i'll buy the cheapest possible insurance for my 100 shares (THAT I'M NOT GOING TO NEED BY THE WAY, because remember, I think the stock is going to go down) to ""cover my losses"" (again, i'm snickering thinking you're an asshole for needing this ""insurance"" the whole time)

therefore, since you don't think it's gonna happen anyway, you buy 800c, the broker is happy that your losses are now capped, you're happy because you only had to spend cents on the dollar to insure your short position, and that is why you have huge interest on either end of the spectrum

it's not that people are purchasing these positions individually trying to make money, that's basic baby shit, come on guys do you really think that's how this thing works

the majority of these calls are expected to expire, they're offset by the huge gain for the -100p they're selling on the other end"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I think the 800 calls are idiots giving their stimulus money to call writers
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"What does it matter if the hedges calls blast ITM and the print bank from it? Once the share price is over $400 they are gonna get margin called and surely those tasty call profits are ripe to be liquidated by brokerages to pay for $2million dollar GME shares? I doubt a bunch of 800c is gonna offset a $2 million per share damn margin call!

Although I agree the long whales have the price exactly where they want it after yesterday's battle for $200. Lots and lots of hedge puts turning to dust every week."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"They will try to keep it afloat flat so both calls and puts expire worthless. The more people 💎👐,the longer they will milk it."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't want to hear any more about specific dates. It sets our collective intentions on something arbitrary and gives hedgehogs the ability to mount all their traps in one place.

Just one apes apininon. I hope your theory is sound and brings you many tendies, but I'm going to do my best not to cloud my judgement with silly calendars"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Institutions want their calls and puts to appear neutral when they are not. All that is listed on their disclosures is total calls and total puts owned on a security, not what they are. So, they buy a bunch of wayyyy out of the money options (because they are cheap) that are the opposite of their actual position. 

Why do this? First, so competitors cannot mimic their positions. Second, and most importantly, they can fuck with the market and not appear guilty. Pay no mind to way out of the money options."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dreamt that GME mooned to millions and to celebrate I started  frying up chicken tenders for gamestop employees and investors and apes, even hedgies that rode the moon with us. That's all the DD I need (not investment advice)"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you have been around this sub long enough you will remember that the original play was stock or call options expiring after the March earnings.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Wasn't there DD saying this is where they could be hiding their shorts in these or something to artificially lower SI% ?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"There were similar numbers for yesterday's options. It's the monthly cycle.

Also, I don't get why there is so much open interest in the $1 put. The 800c makes sense in it's stupidity since it has infinite possible gain. The $1 put can only gain $1."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is just a continuation of their long term bet it was going to fail.  Every monthly options contracts expiry are loaded like this.   Same goes for this 3/19, with 160k put last below 10 dollar strike price.  Hopefully those weren’t naked because you’ve got T(+2) to pay your debts rebel scum.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,That's when DVF calls expire
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"All I know about that date is DFV has a big slug of call options expiring that day. It will be interesting to see how it all plays out leading up to that date. His timing has been perfect so far, hopefully it moons again. Can’t wait to see his final YOLO update."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"All my options are on 4/16 but it's because it was both long dated at the time of purchase but not extremely long dated enough.

Didn't really have other options on dates that looked as suitable."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Look at the open interest on 2022 and 2023 $950 strikes. Its retarded as well
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve been playing gme since September and the answer is the January 15 and April 16 options have been available for a over a year. Other options like the 50c weren’t even available until January. So these are likely legacy contracts from the past year and their owners likely picked these up a long time ago. Nothing much to look into imo.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe because those low strike puts have been around longer? Remember that the price of GME was under $5 for most of 2020 so of course there would have been low price puts issued but not too many people would have been interested in an $800 strike call back then.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here we go again, 3/19 pt. 2!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I was just thinking about DFV’s 4/16 and then see this post Pog

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am probably late to reply so my comment will be buried but I have looked into these puts in great detail over the past couple weeks and there are really only 2 explanations, in my opinion:

1. (The explanation we all WANT to be true): Hedgies have sold puts to be technically long thus canceling out their shorts and leaving them not having to report SI - plus they get $1 for their ""trouble""
2. (The more likely, less sexy, reason): Its basically free income to anyone selling puts. You have to put aside 50$ to get 1$ back basically getting a very quick 2% return to bet that Gamestop doesn't go completely bankrupt within a month. Other stocks with this same phenomenon are stocks that in the recent past went up from nothing to high numbers...TSLA has some high open interest $1 calls as does NIO. Higher strike prices have higher returns, but higher risk and also require more capital to sell the put."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,🌈 🐻 Suit dummies will continue to short GME to death until they get some popcorn tendies.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe that April 16 is when DFV’s calls are due as well. Or maybe it’s puts. This ape doesn’t understand both but believes that DFV understands and that’s all that really matters 🦍
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am willing to bet MOST of those puts ($50s and below) are people scalping the volatility premium by SELLING puts. I think this because I'm one of them. Except I've gone further out to Jan 2022 in selling $50 puts to scrape $18 a share in premium. If by some miracle GME is below $50 by January, my basis in the shares will be $32 (put break-even price, also cash at risk). Wouldn't that be nice? I suspect we will so far above that price, however. So for now, I'll just be content on earning $18 for every $32 risked, aka a 56% return in just 10 months writing a put contract on a stock I really like."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"To all the shills in the comments, if you really think the stock will go back down buy some shorts and put your money where your mouth is."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Copying myself from another thread:

Well, it's notable that this would be right after the anticipated share recall date of June 10th. This recall has to be announced 60 days prior; which is April 11th, but due to it being a Sunday, this would actually make it April 12th. I find it an amazing coincidence that DFV's call options expire on the Friday of that week on the 16th. **DFV accurately predicted that the price would rise in January, 6 months before it happened.** Just something to keep in mind. Whatever his secrets are, he surely knows what's going on."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn't this the date DFV has his 500× 15C expiring?

You weaken them slowly, let them drown in their own blood - until one day, when the Long whales deem appropriate (I would assume after the 2nd part of the regulation of DTCC is passed), they will go for the kill.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,">Shorts appear to be hedging against sudden surges upward with calls?

If us apes are correct in our assumptions about massive short interest (hidden through ETF:s etc), they aren't even close to properly hedged.   


I've seen estimates of SI up in the hundreds of percent. There are currently ""only"" calls worth \~24.8m shares. If *every single call option* is held by the shorts, they are still *very* fuk if true SI is anywhere close to the estimates by various apes here on reddit."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also you don't want trigger a halt too early because they simply don't care about  the penalty for Flash Crash, they save up ammo ready to do that and hammer the price down to exactly where they want it on the lower side, penalties and fines be damned if they make more money doing this than the penalty it's all just the cost of doing business to them.

The meticulously planned out rise in price during spike times has been narrowly skirting triggering any halts, I suspect this is the reason it's meticulously dropped back down again so as not to trigger illegal Flash Crash tactics from the brazen criminals who simply pay the fine for acting in this way if it serves their position to do so.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"exactly!!!!!!   this is much bigger than all of us understand... take note, and just my dumb ass yelping... with the 10 yr still below 2% this alone doesnt hit tech but it did... i sold all my big tech, all of it....  i think lots of big money needs as much ammo if theyre on the wrong side of the bet... that bond market has super itchy fingers and now fed is essentially stuck... may not seem like a relationship exists but it does, simply the shares do not exist!  if any kink in the armor occurs, expect volatility!  hedgies are prolly shorting tech if not outright selling... they need lots lots of cash to make this work... hedgies are fucked with markets a close second... one thing i know if gme hits over 10k  it will cause a major sell off in the market!!!!!  my guess around 20-25% similar to oct 87"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,There are loads of people selling CCs or wheeling GME right now. It's basically free money
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm using the wheel strategy to get more shares.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait what? You think someone with shares worth $200 are going to exercise $20 puts, effectively torching $180 per share, just to drive the price down? It makes no sense."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Does anyone have a clear answer of what happened on 2/24 or 3/10? From what I understand 2/24 was mostly about dfv doubling down but it seems like there's more to it. I only bought some gme at $38 back in January because that Ryan Cohen Attack on Titan clip gave me goosebumps. I don't know much about the market.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not just DD, the SEC has put out an announcement on it.

Here ya go: [https://ibb.co/YWx1kfw](https://ibb.co/YWx1kfw)"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Level 1 theta thug vs level 99 theta mob boss
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,My thoughts exactly. Chances he exercises these? Has to be very high given his conviction to his own thesis
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Rocket companies
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m not that well versed but a short is different from a put. There was a great write up a few weeks back on this. Maybe just google positions and options.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,A lot. Multiple millions of shares were covered
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It was Iron Condors all along

That's all the market is, Iron Condors, all the way down"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,We'll see the effects before that because short interest seems likely to get margin called around the $350-$400 range given the intensity with which they're protecting that price point. I think the $800 calls and delta ramp in the middle are just icing on the cake.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s just how daddy likes it. 💎🙌on my 🍆
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yey paydays!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds good to us :)
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Buddy the 2/24 rocket ride that put this second upward swing into motion was halt after halt after halt after halt.  And it was fucking fun to watch.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"huh, what, i zoned out in the middle."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Read whole thing but me ape no can read. Joke on me.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Would you like fries with that?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Would you mind explaining how a flash crash triggers?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Look at the largest shareholders of GME. They will be the largest lenders of the stock.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you have a day to waste and are really interested go check out Public Pension Plans websites. Calpers for instance (the largest such plan in the US) earns roughy $100,000,000 per year lending their securities. It’s a very lucrative business obviously. That said, that $100mm goes a long way to pay the retirement benefits of teachers, firemen and police in California."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Assuming that this info if correct. Why would you ever want to reveal your actual weakness? These guys read The Art of War. Billions are at stake. It's war. Lying is part of the game.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Citadel one of the shorters was multiple times fined for lying in shorts report.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Correctamundo.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only holds true if the shorts are actually borrowed. If they are naked, they don't have to pay fees."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes but isn’t the real thesis that they never covered and the original short interest is much higher than what they are borrowing at now?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,No one can afford the squeeze theyll just freeze trading again
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,If they do then I'll be selling everything so I can buy GME.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,My smooth brain is more wrinkled now.  I need to eat more bananas. That’s all.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s possible these puts were bought when the price was super low in the $10 range
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it goes up to say 400 though, could they sell 800c on the momentum, for higher than they bought?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"nah you (and I) have a little more reading to do, i think. the premiums are sort of irrelevant to the wider market--that is, the options market is a different market. the options could have been bought at any time and at a time when gamma/IV was low and subsequently the premiums were cheap and while they can be resold, that means you need to be looking at *volume* and not just open interest"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,How to make the minus sign go away?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have to weigh the pros and cons. Sure buying call options causes more shares to be bought than buying shares outright unless you are purchasing a call option that's just being resold at which point hedging would already have occurred for that contract. However, if the option ends up expiring worthless, then all those shares hedged would be sold back into the market. Then the money was wasted as it could have purchased shares instead. So there are some bad sides to buying call options too.

But there are no bad sides to simply buying shares and holding. Takes away volume and drives price up."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buying an option that expires worthless gives the seller cash, if that seller is fighting on the side of the shorts then that just goes into their warchest."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,There are 2022 and 2023 $950 calls for gme lol
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Enough with the fucking date predictions already.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,!RemindMe in 20 days
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,U think the mods got comprised?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"cheers dude. It’s giving needless ammo to the opposition as well as giving apes false hope. It’s impossible in my opinion now but apes need to wise up at this stage of the game, change how things are done. The biggest strength (free speech, rapid spread of information, hive mind) is turning into the biggest weakness. Apes just need to stop and ask the question - how much useful information do we see coming from Wall Street? Exactly.Nothing.

TL DR: fuck off with the dates"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,My new thing is telling people that this is the squeeze and it's happening thru 2021.  Hop onboard and enjoy the ride.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,">day traded the swings the past 10 days. 

That sure helps with the squeeze. Keep it up, champ!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"> expect volatility 

it's priced in"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It would be even better if there was a full economic crisis which helped gme rise even faster and further
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Dwight Schrute: “That’s a very real possibility”
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I personally prefer the Bronze Blumpkin...
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"No if puts get exercised then everyone will be fine, I know this post is based on puts I read it as call options (my fault) we don’t want low strike calls getting exercised"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"He had many expiration dates worth of calls when he started.
I think April was the furthest monthly available at the time he started his yolo."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Aah yes...this was their risk memo and yet they do nothing while this is happening. Thanks for the link!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah he will definitely exercise them he absolutely loves this stock
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I can’t compute without emojis
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I saw a guy who sold like 100 4/17 30p for $800 a piece or something retarded during the late Jan crash. $80k in 2.5 months. If I had the capital (all in shares oops) I’d be selling puts out the ass still
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah the $350 point was protected really well last time. The next time we approach it I don't think they have enough bullets to defend it a second time.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,That Wednesday morning sealed it for me. This baby is as real as it gets
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It sure was fun and intense, thought my eyes would pop from my eyesockets 👀"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,By dumping a shit load of stock at the same time.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone with a 250k acct thru fidelity can opt into share loaning for $
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for the tip I’ll add it to the list of resources - much appreciated!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why would you assume that vastly different market participants with different stakes and interests would illegally collaborate to the benefit of one specific money manager, and at the expense of multiple others, and even at the expense of the own product they themselves are trying to sell and market (as brokers, as market analysis providers, etc.)?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Is Citadel the group that sets short fees?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"In this case, the original thesis that ""maintaining these levels hurts shorts because they have to pay fees"" is still false.

So, my point holds true even then.

edit: if anyone disagrees by downvoting, please tell me how naked shorts will have to pay fees on naked shorts they don’t have to pay fees on"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would they pay a higher short interest than the current (low) short interest rate available on the market? That doesn't make sense. The current short interest fees represent what people are paying currently.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm pretty sure that it never makes sense to hold a short and long position on the same security. 

Let's say you hold one short and one long. If the price of the stock goes up by $1, then you lose $1 on the short and gain $1 on the long, which cancels itself out to be even. 

However, you have to pay premiums on the short position. So it's always more beneficial to use your long shares to cover your short. 

So essentially what you're suggesting is that the hedgies should cover their shorts"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Congressional hearing says hi
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"more people trade monthlies than weeklies. they're the default go to because expiries 30 days out are pretty standard options to purchase

Witching etc"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's like a three million percent chance those things aren't covered but if the stock gets anywhere near there then it's going to asymptomatic, so $800 is the least of their problems."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just for the sake of argument, I've written calls on an uptick (not GME), and bought them again when it dropped. Rinse and repeat. Whoever didn't buy their shit at a lower price? Yeah, they're fucked."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"But then we would have to cross reference the calls, because those MUST be new (GME was not trading over 100 until very recently, so the options weren't available to be written)

Would be very curious to see deeper data on the puts, although another poster said it could be retail scalping premium. The low strikes require very little collateral to sell as a put, and the example he gave me was a 50+% ROI (was like a $3000 risk and getting paid $1800 up front)"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Lose more. Then the negatives cancel out.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You think there is no squeeze to be squozen?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I like celery a lot.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Well said.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The strike price for max pain on Friday was $160, not $200. Market makers got fucked, badly, from selling calls this last week. I predominately buy shares, but ITM calls have done great for me."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Also what are shares
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not manipulated sideways. People just stopped trading them and so the spread naturally widened

Ironically everyone just holding all of the shares is what enables this manipulation"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It's not long vs shorts. GME isn't a team sport.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mark my words, young one."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahahahaha you are hilarious!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,In addition to your tin foil hat are you scared of 5g?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought in last November and sold up in Feb.  I did my part.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t get my tea from Iran. I get my tea from Ahmed. You need to find a new tea guy.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,2 words: I like the stock
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,That Wednesday I was staring a my phone watching the price.  I sent my partner a message saying I had to either throw down some money or quit watching.  It was just flirting with 50 at that point.  By the time she got back to me it was up 30%.  I was already making an account.  I got it funded then the market closed.  I didn't know how to order AH so I didn't get in til $120.  I haven't stopped staring at my phone since then.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep. Very efficient process. They just borrow them at will
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm saying that those on one side would gladly lie about something, they lie all the time, the shorts have every incentive to lie about their vulnerabilities, the viability of their operation depends on it."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Because they've done it before maybe?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I think invinsible hand of market sets them. The more stock to lend the less pricebof borrowing.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"In the end, the broker carries the risk. So we expect that they receive compensation one way or another.

EDIT: Many of the ETFs have 10%+ fees. It is possible that there are only a few GME shares at <1% to borrow for show and the rest of the shares cost more. I don't know."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,The original short interest on their original shorts was much higher than the short interest now. When they bought the shorts back in Dec/ Jan/ Feb if the short interest was 10% then they are still paying that amount. The interest you see now are on NEW shorts. They are still bleeding from the original short interest not really on the ones they are doing now. An interesting DD would be to try to figure out what average interest they are actually paying on their shorts from when the price increased and trapped them in their short position.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,If the hedgies went long on call options they would need millions to cover their millions of synthetic shares. The premiums alone would be enormous. When the squeeze does start they loose on the short side for every dollar they gain long. It is too late for the shorting hedgies. That train has left the station. That’s my thoughts. On a side note I already exercised my April 16 calls expecting fuckery. It’s nice to see the cash shares safer in my account. They arrived overnight Saturday and will be home for the duration.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,But if they have bought call options all the way up to the moon they can cash them in and ride it just the same as us though. I guess it depends if they have the money to buy enough calls to be able to exercise them and/or profit from the contracts themselves enough to offset their shorts
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"right but a ""hedge"" in this case would be a call, not a long position, capping your max gain but insuring you against infinite loss. but if you are paying a fee to maintain your short position and a weekly premium to hedge against losses...at some point either you exit your position or your narcissism tells you to accept infinite risk and fuck the world and any consequences"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are many reasons to do that.

1. Lower the margin requirements for the short position
2. Limit potential losses on the short position
3. Lock in gains against the long position, 

I owned calls during the first squeeze, I sold synthetic short option positions against my long calls, locking in the spread.

When the price stabilized at 40 I entered a synthetic long position to lock in that spread. Leaving my long calls still open in case it squeezed again.

I was then able to short shares against my long calls and lock in the spread again against my long calls. 

Then when it settles down, I will enter a synthetic long position to lock in the gains again, then wait to see if it runs up again."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,What is this comment based on?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it possible people are buying 800c to sell other calls? I was looking at options that date as well and it looked nice and dirty. After seeing how they played Amc Friday I’m predicting they’ll set the price that makes them the most money and collect the premiums from contracts outta the money....
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Triple witching is quarterly. OP is talking about April, so a watered down version"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I have no idea. I know there’s a ton a short positions open. I just don’t see anything to force the buying to squeeze the cheeze. time will tell I guess.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s great, and I’m pleased you did well. Perhaps market makers did get fucked selling calls...but what about the puts? Further, going forward, if retail keeps trading in options, it just gives the Market Makers *potential* to make profit off premiums...depending on where the price ends up. Make your own decisions, but shares are not only a lot less risky than options generally, but also avoid any risk of contributing to MMs profiting from premiums, refilling their coffers.

And I love options...but no more for me on GME besides what I already own. Going forward, I’m shares only."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,When you say itm calls how in the money are we talking? And why would already itm call print if iv is wack like it is right now?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't stick your neck out past the whales since they are your only defense at 4:59 Friday. Or sell before power hour. Does that sound right?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"lol, I guarantee I’m older than you. I hope it does happen by then, but everyone with these obsessions with dates and predictions is really getting old. Sit back, head down to the Winchester or whatever and just wait."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I swear I’ve read somewhere that the squeeze comes from shorts needing to buy shares to cover, which is made easier by people continually selling their shares. 

Imagine if everyone was regularly giving them opportunities to cover. Sure that’d work to our advantage. Spread the word, maybe publish a DD on how day trading will help the squeeze take shape."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,">2 words

I can't count either. A+"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Set some price alerts, make a plan for what to do at certain points, and then get back to your life man"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"So no actual factual analysis.

Forget independent market analysts, forget the short float being less than 25% (24% as per Bloomberg, 10% as per S3), forget the penalty for lying under oath in a Congressional testimony, forget short interest borrow rates set by brokers, forget the daily short volume being only 25% of long volume, forget the possibility that it might just be easier to benefit off of the hype with a long position.

""They're short because I think so and they're lying because they're probably lying because they lied before"""
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Copy+pasting same comment cause it applies here:

So no actual factual analysis.

Forget independent market analysts, forget the short float being less than 25% (24% as per Bloomberg, 10% as per S3), forget the penalty for lying under oath in a Congressional testimony, forget short interest borrow rates set by brokers, forget the daily short volume being only 25% of long volume, forget the possibility that it might just be easier to benefit off of the hype with a long position.

""They're short because I think so and they're lying because they're probably lying because they lied before"""
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. So now that short fees are less than 1%, we can conclude that the stock isn't extremely heavily shorted."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can you provide a source that says that short fees are ""locked in"" when a stock is shorted, and do not change even if the short fee rate changes?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I think the short hedgies are shit out of luck but im sure there are hedgies playing our side of this also.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Partly the post about the guy who works at a fitness place and had a conversation with a hedge employee who was dismissive of the company's upside and arrogant towards the op, sorry can't find the link but it's not more than a week old. I think generally otherwise, arrogance is befitting to the people participating in these nefarious Madoff-esque strategies, as they've been doing it successfully for so long in the shadows and they control so many aspects of the market like vertically that I would imagine they feel somewhat shielded from consequences, as they rarely face any, but it's just conjecture

As obvious at this whole thing is to us, I think the public is largely ignorant to what is happening"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"800c is about 4x the current price, which is similar to the calls DFV bought."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's probably saddling, they can cap their losses, but maximize their gains. It's an IV play. They don't know which way it will go so they hedged. If it  moons, they can sell the puts and cash in on the calls. If it goes the other way they can sell their calls and cash in on the puts."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It absolutely does make sense and this isn’t a GME specific thing - look up IV skew
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,If you buy 800c at 200$ they make money when the price goes up! If you have a lot 800c you can sell them when the price reaches 300$ and you’re in the greeen!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I‘m not really obsessed and 💎🙌 no matter what but it’s fun and games to see if one is right. There s a few interesting events that align together in that week that have the potential to rocket this ship into the next galaxy
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,2 words. 42069.00
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I take it you haven’t seen the real daily short volume and the data for all the ETF’s involved in this then? I have...
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn't an article come out early this week/last week stating shorts lost another 600 million dollars?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Absolutely
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm also certain of that. The GME battle gives opportunity to everyone
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,The short hedgies changed strategies a month ago
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Why do so many people on this sub seem surprised when they notice the hedge funds are hedging their bets.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I disagree. I think it's people who've done this think it'll tank and a lot of people think it'll rally. The numbers are too insane. If it was double or go in half I'd possibly agree. But it's way way way past that. A bunch of people who don't know what they're doing are propping it up and a lot of other people are just waiting for it to return to earth.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"My smooth brain just twitched. I guess I agree with this based upon my limited understanding. Its just an interesting concept of liquidity, who is writing the calls and puts and who is holding each versus the apes just holding shares. Does the saddling in any way drive the price horizontal and or are MM trying to suppress the moon rocket? If the highest call is 800 and the price 🚀  to Andromeda will they write new calls for 2k etc?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,High IV is the single best way to make money flipping options on GME.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,They aren't delta hedged to 1 though.  As soon as it gets near and they start.  Moass.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Nothing would make me happier - I have a metric fuckton of shares.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I take it you think that ETF cloaking is somehow a real thing, and that the daily short volume posted by Fintel is somehow false, to the benefit of a single hedge fund."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah we cant kill all the hedgies but we can fight a few.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah most likely though no one really knows who is playing what strategy. All i know is that based on price movement there are definitely large parties that have a big interest in this stock  going down. So through many scientific investigations I have concluded that I will hodl and buy
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,A straddle or strangle is like one of the smartest moves you can make with GME options rn
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,So what do you think it’s going to happen? This upcoming week I see another volatile week.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ive heard opposite. Perhaps i should do more homework. I know when you buy with lower IV  and then IV goes up with a relatively controlled climb in price, and with gme even sharper dramatic rises premiums go up but i was under the impression if IV balloons too much with those price spikes you could (key word i know) have a hard time  capitalizing those gains cause the possible crazy swings down too

Edit: especially for way OTM options like an 800 strike. Cheap premium but crazy swings. If you miss out on selling calls or price declines goodbye gains. Again, perhaps i should do more homework but that is my understanding"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,They are better off letting the price slowly rise and hope that wsb guys won't be able to resist selling at 600 700 whatever. Hope they are content with 4x their money.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"We‘re talking about the week here when GameStop could finally, officially announce the recall of shares. Now that would be a huge ass catalyst, straight up breaking HFs neck, not like some earning calls or quadruple witch day or whatever they call it, no one gives a fly about fundamentals here anyway.
Still, not getting my hopes up too high for that specific date ofc"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,There are many ETF’s with GME exposure but you already know this. The data is out there so I don’t know why you guys even bother. and we are not talking about just 1 hedge fund here but again you already know this...
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m betting it’s all retail investors betting against one another. The hedgies are selling spreads and naked $800Cs and making a killing regardless of where the price goes.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s the difference between the two?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I think it'll drop hard by the end of the week. It'll probably get propped up again because they will think the squeeze is happening. Eventually they'll turn on the stock and it'll end somewhere around $40. It really doesn't look good for the people in. I very well could be wrong but they really need to announce something spectacular for Tuesday for them to organically rally
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don’t get me wrong, it isn’t a walk in the park but the higher the IV the easier it is. Approaching the security in this fashion removes you completely from the emotions of the trade and you’re capitalizing specifically on those wild swings.

I tend to plan my hand out, set in appropriate limits and let the price action do its thing. It’s all about what strategy you deploy but high IV is an option trader’s feeding frenzy.

Your understanding isn’t wrong but perhaps your thinking how to play is. The key is to have good entry and exits and as long as the price is volatile and you know what you’re doing you should have no problem making bank week after week on this thing."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I took a 25% profit off my holdings at 400 last time.  I started buying at 12$  I need atleast 1000x my money now for the rest of my shares.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You don't know this, but shorting an ETF to cause a single stock to drop in price is:

* not how ETFs work

* financially unfeasible, even if this *were* how ETFs worked

So your theory is that market makers spend tens of millions of dollars shorting an entire basket of stocks just so to get exposure to the 4% of the ETF represented by GME? What kind of strategy would that be? How does that even make sense?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Strangle is different strikes on the call and put while a straddle is the same strike.

Straddle has a higher payoff but higher risk"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Obviously going to get downvoted for that sentiment but I'm with ya. I was all in on the first squeeze when SI was still off the charts but with earnings coming up I think any ""whales"" that are still on the buy side will see the reality of the financials and close out. Full disclosure I have 3/26 put debit spreads and naked puts so I'm cheering for it to hit $90."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Short the ETF then go long on everything inside the ETF EXCEPT $GME... 

There you go, you just shorted ONLY $GME through an ETF."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Checking your posting history are you a paid shill or are you just debating to feed your ego and to feel smart?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Since when does anything have to make sense to be the truth? Sir this is the stock market, nothing makes sense."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Some of the people begging to hold are probably just trying to get out at a better price. I dunno if it'll hit 90 this month but when it does fall it'll be brutal
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,☝️at least somebody gets it
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you have anything constructive to say?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup you know it man. Shills gonna shill
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,do you?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I gave factual information about how ETFs worked and you responded with the literary equivalent of an angry emoji.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You have a pattern of dismissing GME and the folks doing DD. And you have the aggressive dismissive tone in it that I got when I made a thread a while ago where I was panicking back when the consensus was ""5000 is not a meme"".

It became endless mockery, meanness and people laughing at me and saying GME was never going to reach 80€ let alone 100 ever again... And telling me to just sell.

Had to delete the thread because I couldn't take the abuse.

You remind me of those people..."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"So the long story short is that you're still letting emotions affect your judgment. You don't have any facts, just ""You remind me of people that hurt my feelings."" If you take issue with something specific I've said, then say so. Give me a reason. If you can't refute a single thing I've said, rethink your mindset."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just think you are singling out GME and you are being a bit too aggressive in it and in your tone... making me wonder if it's a side earning opportunity for you, or if you just like being contrarian to boost your ego.

I'll be first to admit I don't know anything about finance I just follow people's advise and read the DD and try to understand as good as I can and probably letting confirmation bias guide me. But it's ok. 

I fomo'd near the high point when GME came in the news, and due to my specific circumstances I need GME to sell really high to make it worthwhile. Basically my monthly income is income replacing allowance for the handicapped which is about 1.040€ per month which I lose as soon as I gain more than 24k in one year (along with the social tariff for gas and electricity, the no tax paying, the no road tax, the lower VAT for car repairs, etc...).

So either GME goes to the moon and I can park some money in a specific bank product to gain me a monthly passive income equal to or higher than my allowance and all the benefits of the other social measures I have a right to, and still have money left to enjoy life and fix my car, maybe buy a better pc, fix some things around the house etc... 

Or GME never goes high enough and I hold on to them until I die allowing me to fantasize a few minutes per day about a ""what if"" and feeling happy and worry less for a few minutes a day.

I don't really care about the FUD you and your kind spread, I singled you out because of your tone which triggered something in me."
2021-03-21 00:49:59,wallstreetbets,"Selling Puts: How to Profit Off Stupidly High Premiums with Put Call Parity So everyone is trying to teach you about how the market makers are scared shitless of selling your dumbass GME calls, so they try to [deter you with stupidly high prices](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9229p/stop_being_robbed_of_call_premium_for_the_mirage/) to protect themselves against a squeeze.

Some people on this sub suggest buying the stock outright. Well let me learn you some additional market mechanics.

Say you own 100 shares of $GME at $100 and you can sell a $110 call covered call for $10.

Given that price, what's the cheapest a $100 put could be to buy? Well, it better be $10 or greater because otherwise there would be an arbitrage!

Say the put cost only $9, then you could pay for the put with the $10 call, and guarantee yourself $1 per share.

So what does this mean? As call option prices are driven up by MMs, put option prices must rise similarly, and this introduces another opportunity to influence the price of the stock ***by selling puts and collecting a fat premium.***

Say you sell a put. What does the MM need to do to hedge their risk? **They need to buy stock because they are now long a put to offset the negative delta in the put.** What happens as the price moves upwards? MMs will sell that stock at a slow rate since gamma will drop off slowly. What happens if the price moves downwards? MMs will need to buy the stock an accelerating pace since gamma will increase rapidly on the put.

**This strategy will essentially put a floor on the price on the price of GME and you get to collect the premiums being induced by the MMs on the call side.**

It's also a way to lock in a buy at a lower if getting assigned on an option is your thing.

Downsides: you're short convexity on this trade, so don't expect your account to double or triple. Then again, the MMs are trying to prevent run up, so convexity is unreasonably expensive to begin with. Additionally, it's very capital intensive (unless you hedge with long puts instead of cash security).

Aside: Put call parity is actually a far more complicated mechanic with American options due to early exercise, but the point still stands that puts must increase in price along with calls if MMs try to discourage gamma squeezing.

Important Edit: Take a look at puts prices sub $100. Even a $50 put out a few months has stupidly high premiums to eat up."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,How do MMs drive up the premium? I though the premium was high for calls just because everyone wants to buy them.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"MM conspiracies are old as time and usually wrong.  Most of market making is computerized/automated these days so this is extra funny.

MMs are not nearly as powerful or influential as retail traders make them out to be.  And they certainly have little to no control over options pricing. That is driven by buyers/sellers. An MM just finds the balance between them.

Theres some good info in here though, but a lot of the MM nonsense just isnt true."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This is garbage. If you sell a put you are on the hook and no one else. MMS don’t need to hedge your put sales.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel like if you sell a put, abd tge squeeze pops off before expiry, you wont be able to sell your shares, as you will need them for collateral. This soubds like a terrible idea.

Edit: I had it backwards, you need money collateral to sell a put, not shares. Dummy."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Been selling and rolling CSPs since January and it's been the best way to get free money. Since doing CSPs I'm like a loanshark to dumb hedgies that in the worse case gives me more GME ownership at cheap prices. Plus I don't get tempted by the 800C's with the rest of the apes.

The trifecta triple-dip of the GME ape is: 

1) buy and hold shares

2) loan out shares to hedgies that are shorting

3) sell and roll CSPs weekly (invest profits into dips for more shares)"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy shares retards
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This post is suspicion. Really
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are we sure market makers are buying the puts and not someone else? 

We would need a trial example to see if this works.  It seems like it would be easy to manipulate if true."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I never said it was 1-to-1. I actually said they would have to buy and then buy more as the price moves downward, which actually provides the stock with a downside coushin if enough people sell puts.

\>  $10,000 in unencumbered cash in your account for every $100 put you write.

Yes, but I personally buy in full lots to allow me to sell calls.  Rather than buy 100 at $100 outright, I would much rather sell $80 puts."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It depends on how far ITM you go. Selling $50 puts seems like free money at this point.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats exactly why.  Good job for having sense.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This isn't a conspiracy. Go read about delta hedging. It's a common practice.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Not to mention it's a shill strategy to get people to give money to Citadel Securities instead of buying GME shares outright.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"\> invest profits into dips for more shares

This is exactly how I got to my current stock holdings in GME. Lol."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fucking ban

r/investing is 👉"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hear you.  It’s been said that 90% of long options expire worthless, so it seems the smarter play is to be the seller, especially when the IV is retarded high."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,🤣 😂 😝
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I love the greeks. I made a post on theta not too long ago
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct me if I'm wrong.  But, in your example, GME doesn't have to finish below $190 *next Friday.*  It can dip below $190 anytime between when you sell the put (Monday, in the example) and next Friday for the other party to exercise the option and force you to buy 100 shares @ $190."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is, you just need enough cash sitting on the sidelines to do it"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, so have the 800CC at this point. 
Except I get the share appreciation on top as well. 

I know everyone thinks differently and selling CC now introduces price risk on the underlying as well. 

But I really don't know of many who aren't bullish on GME at this point in time. 

You just leave so much money on the table writing short puts in situation like these. 

The only reason I can it makes sense now is if they don't have the capital to buy the 100 shares. 

Like if you only had 15K, then yes by all means sell a CSP on the 150 strike."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I delta hedge my own positions so I understand it. Thats not the issue here.

The first paragraph alone is nonsense. That is not at all what an MM does. Pure conspiracy.

MMs also dont drive up options prices. Its a market, prices are driven up or down by buyers and sellers. Pretty fundamental stuff.

Finally, manipulating a stock price via options trading is almost pure fantasy.  Youre up against a computer here, any short term machinations can and will be corrected."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,3/26 50p is $0.315. That’s $30 for tying up $5k for a week. Not exactly jizz-worthy.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shit, the level of 🦍we have today"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re right but early assignment is rare, and I’m not trying to act like I know everything just thinking maybe my jumbled example might help someone think twice before diving in with limited understanding. You can also roll to the next week but on something like GME you could be digging yourself into a hole. I know someone still rolling USO from last year after it rebalanced when oil went negative. Extreme case though but he’s almost profitable again"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"When you sell a cash secured put, you should usually set the strike price at a point where you’re happy to own the stock. If you do get assigned, then you can choose to hold until the price rises again, optionally selling covered calls against them, or cut your losses and move on.

In a normal situation, if a stock approaches your strike price, you can try to avoid assignment with a strategy called “rolling the put”, where you buy too close your position and open a new one with a lower strike price and further expiration.

There are other strategies you can use to minimise your losses, such as buying a further OTM put when you sell your own."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right, but if I paid $2700 for a $190 put, my break even point is $163/share so I’m not going to exercise above that share price. If anything, I’d close the put early to be free of the contract and move on to the next play."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exercising early isn’t a good idea because you lose time premium

People usually just trade contracts till Friday"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This isn't a conspiracy. It's entirely reasonably behavior. If you're trying to prevent a gamma squeeze and you're the majority counter-party for long options, what would you do? You'd increase the price."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because the entire premise of WSB for eons has been to make ***shit-your-pants-level risky bets*** in the markets. We play to lose big or win bigger, and most of us are smart enough to bet money we can afford to lose.

There are other subs for your perspective."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait for IV spikes. I snagged some 30 puts for $3 a while ago that expired in 45 days. If you want to entertain this now, you'd need to go farther out in time and at higher strikes. A 7/16 at $49 is $9, and thats a really decent return. If you go wildly farther out, you can pick up a 2023 30 put for $12. For comparison, the corresponding AAPL put is $0.25. That's all IV in GME."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, it's not fancy, but it IS 0.62% per week.  Do this every other week (if you're lazy) and that's 16% per year - nothing to scoff at."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,someone has to put in the work 🤷‍♀️
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"market makers exist so you that when you sell or buy an option there's (almost) always a counter-party. ie, they take the other side of your trade. since they make money off volatility, and not bets, they have to hedge to remain delta neutral"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro 95% of the time the MM takes the other side of options trades buy or sell
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"An MM does not have control over the price. Thats why it traditionally was such a hard job. Im not sure why this is hard fpr you to understand. Prices are set by buyers and sellers, not the MM.

An MM, in the purest sense, just manages the flood of bids and asks that are coming in. Most of these orders are from unfriendly hedge fund bots trying to fuck the MM.

An MM just rides the flow and tries not to get fucked in the process. They have very little control over market.  

Sometimes, though I dont know if this is common, theyll run a blend of MM and a prop book (ie trade with directional bias). Depends on the shop.

In any case your argument, while logical, is based on a false premise."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,But this is a tie up shitloads of capital for modest return play lol

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've done this with vizix last Wednesday. Tied up 2.2k for a 22p Jan 2022. Got $960 in premiums. That's a 43% ROI. Just to tie up 2k for a few months?! 

Hell given how vizix is jumping, if I closed now to free up the cash, I'd still net $100. 

Cash secure puts is the best when IV is +100%"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah i get that but they take the other side of the bet more often when there is a stock with less liquidity. Would that not be the case? That’s not really a problem with GME at the moment. They price also moves based on where buyers and sellers generally meet therefore there are large numbers of people to meet the other side of contracts around those prices (not the MM).

If it were the MM picking up the majority of the other side of the contracts then would that not just mean that when they need to go out and hedge then surely they are about to buy a contract from themselves? If not and there is someone on the other side to sell it to them then it just sounds like that contradicts the argument that its the MM on the opposing side of most contracts.

Not being argumentative just trying to be logical about it all."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes MMs do not set price ***in general***. But if everyone is attacking you to force a gamma squeeze (HFs included) and you're the primary counter party in an incredibly lopsided market, you actually do have pricing power on a volume basis and your risk profile would behoove you to increase the price to discourage a squeeze. Who else is selling all those calls?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you know where you are? Yes stay away from options if you dont know what you are doing. Will ruin your life if you fuck up. Very good. This isnt a sub for sensible discussion of which boomer stock will best help you beat inflation this year. Wall street bets. BETS. The internet equivalent of an 80s trade floor. You may as well be preaching christianity to satanic sex cultists.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Vizix?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Options, in general, are illiquid. That's why the spreads are often so wide. Also consider what happens when demand for calls exceeds natural supply. Spreads go wide because MMs need more profit to make the risk worthwhile.

For more info, read the paper called the economics of the dealer function by Treynor. I actually found a Coursera that covers it too: [https://www.coursera.org/lecture/money-banking/economics-of-the-dealer-function-the-treynor-model-QUmfw](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/money-banking/economics-of-the-dealer-function-the-treynor-model-QUmfw)"

2021-03-21 00:43:51,wallstreetbets,"Enough with the techno mumbo jumbo A Fundamentalist Analysis of UWMC - Why I'm doubling Down Right, I’ve been hearing a lot of doom and gloom regarding UWMC and a lot of techno analysis mumbo jumbo regarding technical analysis. Now, I do not know too much about technical analysis… I analyze things from a fundamental perspective, and those of you who are dooming and glooming like your pants have caught fire need to stop and take a breath.

I am not going to lie, and state I was not laughing when I was seeing some stuff like “It might go down below 7.5,” or “Could it head to six or five?” Well, the tangible price to book value of UWMC is 7.65. The price-to-tangible book value ratio measures a company’s market price in relation to its tangible book value. The ratio denotes how much investors are paying for each dollar of physical assets. In short, if you liquidated everything, you would get 7.65 dollars per share. As it stands that is a tangible price to tangible book value ratio of 1.169. The CEO has already confirmed that the first quarter of 2021 is going to be gangbusters, and surpass the last quarter of Q4 2020 which was… You guessed it, gangbusters. So why is everyone screaming at the top of their lungs, and acting like this bad boy is going to nosedive worse than CDProjectRed’s reputation after Cyberpunk came out? This despite the tangible book to value ratio easily, easily, going above $8 dollars a share after Q1 2021. I will try to answer that in a bit but let me go ahead and go through some other valuation metrics.

A value stock refers to shares of a company that appears to trade at a lower price relative to its fundamentals, such as dividends, earnings, or sales, making it appealing to value investors. Common characteristics of value stocks include high dividend yield, low P/B ratio, and a low P/E ratio. As a generalized rule of thumb P/E ratios for value stocks are meant to sit anywhere between 11 to 15.

The 4th Quarter of 2020 was very good for UWMC as they got a net income of $1.37B and for the full year it was a net income of $3.38B. There was also a total gain margin of 305 bps in 4Q20 (3.05%) compared to 110BPS in 4Q19. It is important to note that for Q4 2020, this is pre-tax and so the net income is $1.0925 Billion. Starting from Q1 2020, it will be post tax for net income. Total assets at the close of Q4 2020 was $11,493,283 (Spread across cash and cash equivalents, mortgage loans at fair value, and mortgage servicing rights).

UWMC maintained an average application to clear to close time of approximately **18** days in Q4 2020. This is while the industry average (in management’s estimate of the industry) grew to -52- days (This is due to the mortgage and refinance boom). This was 10 days higher than the nine-month average off 42 days. For the month of December, the days to close was 16 days, while management’s estimate grew to 54 days. Furthermore, the delinquency and forbearance rates are well below industry averages.

Employees grew from 4,907 on December 31, 2019 to 7,475 on December 31, 2020. This represents an increase of 52 percent in employees and is a bullish indicator of the mortgage market in 2021 and beyond. A part of this is likely because they intend to restart their jumbo offerings which are expected to go live in March 2021 and which management expects to materially increase purchase volume during the remainder of 2021. The wholesale channel, which is where UWM is #1 and which is their sole focus, continues to be viewed as the growth channel of the residential mortgage industry. It represented only 17.2% of the total mortgage market for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Of that 17.2%, UWM had grown its market share to 34.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Finally, the non-funding debt to equity is .49 which is important for later.

Management is projecting Q1 2021 closed loan volume between $52 Billion and $57 Billion, which would represent an increase of 22.6% and 34.4% from Q1 2020. The total gain margin of 2-2.35% is an increase of 110.5%-142.1% compared to .95% in the first quarter of 2020.

Yes, yes, but what does that mean? Well, we know that they beat Q4 2020 EPS by a staggering 30 cents and reported a .62 Earnings Per Share. We also know that it will be even better, for Q1 2020, but that analysts are expecting .40 for this quarter, and a FY of 1.27 EPS (which is ludicrously low). So, let us look at the future P/E ratio in a normal scenario, and in an analyst scenario (analyst scenario being the worst-case scenario). For the normal scenario we use Q4 2020 EPS so .62\*4= 2.48 in earnings per share for the FY EPS (I am projecting higher Q1 and Q2 revenues, to account for the slowdown in winter). This would make for a future P/E ratio in 2021 of 3.608 if the price stuck to 8.95. A P/E ratio of 11 would mean that the stock would hold a price of 27.28. Let us look at the analyst average now. A current P/E ratio of 7.04 to the current price point of 8.95 would apply **right now** if the consensus analyst average were met. For a P/E ratio of 11 the price point of UWM would have to be 15.62. Alright. Undervalued. Gotcha. But let us see if it meets the other metrics. Even after Rocket’s massive sell off, the price to earnings ratio for Rocket is 13.56, and they hold a market cap of 49.55B. Please remember that the tangible book value of UWMC is over $11 Billion, and as such that is over 20 percent of the market cap of RKT which is a diversified company but also is in the Wholesale Mortgage Market and holds the title of 2nd largest wholesale mortgager while also having a private broker channel with higher margin.

At .40 in dividends per year, the yield at $8 is 5%, and at $9 it is 4%. This is deep value, as the stock made a profit margin of $3.38 Billion. As the market cap of the company is currently sitting at 13.4 Billion… This represents a profit margin to market cap of 23.5% rounded up. The tangible book to value ratio also means that the company could conceivably pay the current dividend with no profits for over a decade. As such, the dividend yield is safe and is in fact due for a raise. Q1 2021 is expected to be quite profitable as well, and I expect management to beat their projections, but we will discuss why later. It is also important to note that the balance sheet is a fortress to weather downturns.

But, HB, that is not what we are scared about. We are scared about 2023, and 2024! Well, before I begin, let me make one thing clear. The mortgage market is here to stay, and it will be continuously growing. The only question is at what rate. I seriously hope you are not betting against the mortgage market, because the only thing that will kill it is WWIII, or depopulation. However, I will entertain your doom and gloom fanfiction because I am nice like that. There are currently around 75 mortgage companies operating in the United States in a highly fragmented market. UWMC engages mostly in the provisioning of home purchases, while Rocket is more geared toward refinancing. Let us get one thing out of the way first, before I continue. The notion that refinancing was all pushed forward and that the mortgage industry just had its income all front loaded is absurd. Before Covid the Federal Reserve was hiking rates up, and it is only because of Covid and the Fed’s resultant dovish policy that the interest rates crashed below 3 percent for the first time ever. Rates would have otherwise gone up. This has helped mortgage companies because they conducted refinances that would have otherwise never occurred. Furthermore, at least in earlier quarters, the interest rate was effectively above 3% because of the sheer demand which allowed companies to charge above a 3% rate. Furthermore, WFH has allowed home prices to increase across the spectrum from rural homes to exurban and suburban homes due to increased demand. In the case of a mass market crash, UWM’s dominant position in the wholesale mortgage industry will allow it to gobble up market share from struggling other mortgagers, while it is fortress of a balance sheet will allow it to reduce profit margin to be more competitive and effectively aid itself in squeezing out competitors. Finally, it can just flat out weather the storm due to its balance sheet, while keeping its dividend. This will happen regardless, but a crash would accelerate this.

Now, for the more likely scenario. Demand is booming, but inventory is scarce, and it takes time for supply to be made to meet demand. Let us look at the current demand, however. To look at this, we need to look at the stock of home builders. Therefore, let us look at Lennar. Lennar’s quarterly earnings per share were up 60.63% over the past year to 2.04 which beat the estimate of $1.71. It has a P/E ratio of 9.67 however, and a fair market value that would have it a little above that. More generally, the estimate is that it will take 5 years for home builders to get inventory equivalent to demand as homebuilding takes time. What does that mean exactly? A metric fuck ton of buyers, but only so many homes. In that sense, perhaps interest rates are not the boogie man that people think they are. Why? Well, I’ll put supply and demand in banana speak… Just for you. You are all apes, and you live in trees, but you need to buy the tree you sleep in with banana’s. The trees cost too much for you, so you need to take out a mortgage to buy the tree with your bananas. However, the bananas per month expected of you is rising because of higher interest rates that those pesky humans are demanding. So, less apes want to buy trees, and as a result, the price to buy a tree drops to meet demand until demand equals supply… Except supply is so low that demand will always beat supply even with higher interest rates!

To account for all this lack of homes, people are deciding to do cash out refinances in 2021 as a means of getting cash out of their home so that they can upgrade their starter homes to fit their growing families. Furthermore, sales of new homes were up 19% on an annual basis according to a MarketWatch Economic Report on February 24, 2021 even though the cost of new homes were rising due to increased lumber costs. That was a stunning 4.3% above the already upwardly revised pace of 885,000 in December. Furthermore, inventory dropped slightly to a four-month supply. A six-month supply of homes is generally considered indicative of a balanced market. What does that mean? Simple, demand outstrips supply for newly built homes. Hard. Finally, millennials are in their peak home buying years. Finally, a new survey from Zillow found that 70% of homeowners said they would feel comfortable moving to a new home if there were widespread vaccine distribution, compared with just 52% who feel that way as things stand now. What that means, is that demand is expected to increase as Covid 19 moves further and further into our rear-view mirror. It has gotten to the point where there are affordability concerns. Demand has gone so off the charts that a record 26.4% of new homes on the market do not even exist yet. Of the 307,000 homes that were on the market at the end of January, just 42,000 of them had been completed. At 13.7% that was the lowest on record.

I will briefly address the ultimatum Ishbka made. It is smart, and while it might cap the ceiling a bit, it substantially raises the floor and protects the wholesale market. There will still be growth in market share. He is basically doing a solid for his clientele because he does not want what Zillow did to real estates to happen to his customers. It will also stunt top line growth for Fairway and Rocket.  Furthermore, the Rocket 8-K for more financing, is also a bullish catalyst for UWMC.

So, let us look at some positive catalysts for UWMC:

· Infrastructure Package to bring more growth, and perhaps even increase productivity. It is a more general positive catalyst, but it is good for UWMC as well.

· Minimum Wage increase. Whether it be Mitt Romney who wants 10-10.5 and indexed to inflation, or Bernie Sanders 15-dollar minimum wage.

· Jim Cramer’s interview with the CEO of UWMC.

· The Q1 Earnings Call and 8Q. I expect a dividend raise, a share buyback, a special dividend, or a combination of all three.

· HUD’s confirmation of Marcia Fudge as HUD Secretary who is focused on racial equity because minorities (Especially latino’s and African American’s) lag far behind white American’s in home ownership. Fudge has stated in her press interview on March 18th that there is an immediate housing concern in the increasing price of home ownership. The average price of homes is higher in her words, and the “inventory is much less” than hoped. A major problem she noted, is that “Credit is not available and accessible for people who do actually qualify.” She stated that since FHA is in her purview, they would work with issues of “restructuring,” “access to credit,” and the “down payment” as part of the solution for this solution. Finally, she stated that she was going to make sure people who qualify have access to credit, and she shares the same vision as President Biden to include in this plan policies aimed at closing the racial wealth gap. As UWMC handles FHA loans, this is a boon to them.

· Meeting the growth targets in 2021 and coming back to full employment by the end of 2021.

· I will mention interest rates, but I do not think it really matters as demand is so over supply that it has stopped mattering. It is also very important to note that rates remain very low by historical standards, and even though they have trended up their still well below pre-pandemic levels. The average interest rate on a new 30-year mortgage loan was above 3.50% in Jan 2020, and those who obtained loans to buy home sin 2019 or prior likely had loan rates close to or even above 4%. Meanwhile refinance rates always tend to be a little higher than rates for new home loans are hovering in the low 3% range.

· Continuing demand in 2021, and onward.

So, what does this mean? Well, let us look at where I am right now. I hold 200 shares at 8.66, and 7 options contracts. UWMC $9 Calls for 4.16 with a breakeven at $10.39, and $7.5 Calls for 5/21 for a break-even price of 10.15. I intend to purchase more shares if it climbs lower, and even purchase more options to average down my cost basis in them (I didn’t buy them at the top, or at the bottom). I will likely roll my April calls to May closer to the expiration date, and I will very likely exercise these shares if they are between the strike price and the premium. I may just exercise them period, so that I can go on to sell covered calls at a price point above what I bought them at. Likely $11-14. This would decrease my cost basis. To exercise these options would cost me 6,000, which I am alright with doing. I also have almost $1,800 in shares, and I intend to raise my share count in this manner. 1) Buy tentatively at 8.95, 2) buy moderately at $8.50, 3) Buy aggressively at $8 and below, and 4) Should It legitimately go below 8 dollars. I may legitimately start liquidating most of my other assets except AMD and a few other select holdings to purchase a massive number of shares in UWMC. Then, I intend to sell covered calls at a share price I would be comfortable selling at, but I do not believe will be met with the strike plus premium and will therefore not be called. The dollar value of my shares should likely reach 2500 on Monday, unless the drop is precipitous, in which case it may rise to 5,000. If it reaches 8 dollars, I will raise it to 10,000. If it goes below the current tangible book value of 7.65, I will likely have an aneurysm at the idiocy, but I will raise my stake to my entire portfolio, excluding my 110 shares of AMD. This will likely be around $24,000 dollars, including my exercised options as my portfolio ranges from $31,000 to $32,000 at current.

At the end of the day, I am not in the market to lose money or gamble, but to make it. 25,000 at a five percent dividend yield is 1,250. And I expect the dividend to be raised more and more. The company has a fortress of a balance sheet, competitive and technological advantages over its competitors, and the largest market share in a highly fragmented field where it can take even more. It is also increasing its profit margin YoY. I do like Rocket too, and that is why I have 50 shares in it, but its P/E ratio is far above UWMC’s and is equivalent to a value stock. While I do think it is going to go higher, I think that UWMC is the correct play at current.

If a 7-10 percent increase in the share price due to Russel inclusion where the share price would have increased 62 cents to 89 cents is the metric which you would have bought and held this company, then you are a swing trader and while it is unfortunate it is ultimately small potatoes. I would heavily, heavily, urge you to reconsider selling because the potential upside is much higher than the downside. The stock going below 8 means that the price to book value in May will be less than 1, and by a not insignificant degree. Patience.

This has honestly been such a long write up I’m not even going into the Total Fertility Rate for generational population growth (and thus demand/inventory over the next 1-3 generations), because I think this is enough.

I do expect, despite this report I’ve compiled, that there will be a significant amount of paper handling, and I’m okay with that because I believe in the fundamentals of this company and I can wait. Lowering cost averages is what I do. I expect a runup in late April to earnings, and some juicy announcements come Q1 2020 Earnings. I’ll also tune in to Jim Cramer’s interview with the CEO when it happens.

Thanks for reading. I shall go ahead and state that this is not financial advice, but the thought process that I am going through with this on a forward moving basis. I have some thoughts on GE, and was compiling a report for that too, but I’ll shelve it in favor of this for now. GE isn’t going anywhere.

&#x200B;

Okay fine TLDR: UWMC is a steal, even with higher interest rates.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I actually read it all. Great write up. Was on the fence before but now I may actually lower my cost average too depending the sell off we get Monday.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Disclaimer: I work in the industry.

The biggest challenge that the mortgage industry faces is not credit availability or qualified buyers but lack of supply (which you touch on).

Many of my clients are sitting on spreadsheets of buyers that they have qualified for home purchases but are struggling with two different scenarios:

1. No inventory available at their qualified price level.  Essentially, I can get an individual with decent credit, a good debt to income ratio and at least a 3.5% down payment (for FHA) pre-qualified in Phoenix for $275k, maybe more.  The problem is that any houses that should be valued at that price are outbid nearly every time with offers anywhere from 10-40k above asking prices.  Check out time on the market for most listings.  Also look at Atlanta, which is a great housing market, people will get many offers within hours of listing their house.  Historically, this is not common at all.
2. Lack of housing in general.  This is definitely touched on and I've seen the five year metric you outline in your post.  The only thing that can be done about this is to affectively increase the output of builders, which is something I don't know or am not qualified to speak of.

I can say without a doubt that we are in a housing bubble.  Supply is so far behind that it won't match demand as you mentioned for five years and as the value of the home appreciates and wages remain stagnant that most people are fully priced out of purchasing a home.

Great DD however, I fully agree with all key points and run across UWMC often in my day to day.  They are a good company and worth owning a part of."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"My guess is that the company is going to release some sort of statement this coming week to ease any investor panic stemming out of the russell inclusion falling apart - which seems like an FTSE oversight given their own rules.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,thank you but fuck.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I personally like both companies. I think RKT had more long term upside but UWM got more value at these prices especially if it dips tomorrow. The market so fragmented that they could both grow to win 50% and be 100x multiple on each stock. It’s the only market that’s really missing a dominant plays in them due to the regulations and complexity of mortgages. RKT is going to have the edge with millennial flat out but I see opportunity with both companies.

My best guess, is the earlier run up to $13 resulted in profit taking and then panic selling to create this dip. The other bearish idea is skepticism due to the SPAC aspect (there's a lot of short seller's targeting SPAC's and sometimes finding dirty laundry to report on). This might have put UWMC in a higher risk category by association in investors minds. I think UWMC is a great value investment play and is good for swing trading at the moment also.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you have Bloomberg, FT, or the NYtimes i would invite you to read these articles on Canada's Housing Market. You may find it instructive. While things are somewhat different, I find that the underlying metrics are largely the same. One difference being that otherwise credible candidates for home purchase are being priced out, but that is why I am okay with higher interest rates taking some people off the market, because if demand substantially lessens then home values will lessen therefore increasing demand again.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I'll sell you those Puts.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Some people like to live in nice affordable houses and not a tent thats under a bridge in san francisco.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,>You missed the part where the beat expectations...
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"So bear with me I can only sell cash covered puts. If I sell cash covered puts, which means I have to sell other shares that I might not want to do otherwise. I also do not really think it will go down that much. However, I have margin. I have more than one portfolio (Brokerage), but I do my options on only one of them and I intermingle it with stock purchases.

However, i don't really fuck with margin, because of the chances of losses, so when I'm playing with margin I want to be /really/ careful. Margin Maintenance for me is 4,875.55 on this brokerage. I have $15,209.60 in this brokerage tied up in stocks, and $91.56 in cash. Of the 15,209.60 tied in stocks, 14,238.6 are tied in shares, and 971 are tied in call options. Of my options, 5 are 9 dollar calls. The premium, however, wasn't the best as i was tied in GE short term at the time and when i got around to buying it was doing its little run (though I didn't buy at the top). The April 16 calls will matter later.

I have around 350-550 that I have yet to deploy from my bank account. While I was going to put them in my other brokerage, they can be cash deployed anywhere at current.

I obviously want to be extremely safe from margin maintenance, so I will take the value of my total brokerage in this account, and then deduct the options (due to theta and volatility). This gives me 14,330 to work with in shares and cash. I'm not going to include cash deployable for now. Minus the margin amount and the sum total becomes $9,454.45 to play with, with margin safely. As stocks go up and down, I want to deduct a further 35% in case of a flash crash bearmageddon. That new number that I am willing to play with on margin is $6,145.39. Finally, when deducting, I want to deduct the amount of shares I have in UWMC. This leaves me with $4355.39 if I am playing ultra-safe. I also have 55 dollars coming in from my RKT special dividend which turns it into $4,410.39.

However, this doesn't take into account selling the cash covered puts and selling covered calls. We'll use EOD Friday as our baseline for purposes of calculating for now. I'm going to be selling 14 dollar covered calls, and they have a premium of .28, of which I will be pocketing .25. I have 2 covered calls I will be selling and so that gives me an additional $50. The idea is that with my cost basis of 8.61 I will be making a 39.6% profit if they are exercised, and for holding these shares for less than 1 month I would be ecstatic for these returns, especially since I had already sold another covered call. I also have call options purchased at 7.5 in May, and 9 in April. I'm more than happy. Selling 7.5 April 16 Put Options would net me .40 in profit per cash covered put options after three cents are taken off. In order for the put buyer to make money, the stock would have to go below $7.07. As each contract would cost me 750 if exercised, with the margin I have allowed myself to use, i am able to purchase 5.80 cash covered puts. 5 cash covered puts would net me $200 dollars, which would give me $250 dollars in cash in sum total if you count the covered call. This premium would actually put my allowable sum for margin at $4,660, which means that I am comfortably able to purchase 6 cash covered put options with a bit of money left over.

The yield on the puts would be 5.3% if exercised at 7.5, and I would get a dividend yield of 5.3 percent on annum. The yield on my cash covered calls would be 2.9% based off my cost basis of $8.61.  If both were combined- .65/8.61. The yield on my basis at current would be 7.5% if both expire worthless.

If I get assigned on the higher leg, I'm ecstatic. If I get assigned on the lower leg, I will get exercised with a cost basis of exactly 7 dollars almost. I'm ecstatic too, because that is a 5.7% dividend yield per option purchase, and I know the stock will bounce back.

To be clear i expect the put option premium to be higher tomorrow, while the covered call option premiums will be lower. But the due diligence is there and the cash amount worth of cash covered sell options I can purchase is set."

Hence the 5 year horizon to meet current demand for home builders if demand is sustained. It’s not a bubble so much as a lack of forward planning by home builders as they have been too dovish. It’s really not a bubble, so much as a good problem to have, but if you want to consider it a bubble, then a pop in the bubble would reduce the time it takes for inventory to meet demand by a few years.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is insanely priced, but the gist of it is that it has spread all over Canada and that housing bears including those that were with Burry when he bet against America's housing market actually lost out, and people have been saying it for 13 years. 

As for your calls, just remember to roll them to May as expiry nears so Theta doesn't kill you. Earnings are before the May call, and so you may feel it's a safer bet as there is a certain defined catalyst there.

Edit: On further thought. You could also sell a 4/6 12 Call (or 11 if you're feeling a little spicy), to reduce your premium. This is a credit spread, and it is a way to reduce your margin. Once it's clear the sell call isn't going to be ITM, you can roll over your call to a 5/22 (I haven't checked the exact date) 7.5 or 9c. It'll lower your upside, but i don't know what your premium is, and so it might be worth it to do this."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Lordstown might eventually have a good product but in light of the recent Hindenburg report they've lost the trust of investors and they'll need to earn that back.   Until then you might consider investing in WKHS (Workhorse) which is better positioned for growth and has ties to federal EV contracts.   WKHS recently lost a bid for post office fleets but is appealing this contract and is a favorite of Cathie Woods (Lordstown has also licensed WKSH technology for it's vehicles).

Edit: I bought into both in the last week. I’m near current price as my basis. Huge potential upside. Not much more room to go down.

Read the Hindenburg report on RIDE. It’s sketchy. 

Hiring a company to generate orders is like hiring marketing company to sell your product. They are pre-orders. It makes total sense they are non-binding. The product will not come off the line for 6 months. The marketing consultants doing the selling were incentivized to find potential customers (what Hindenburg refers to as make up orders).

The questions about production are not really substantial, and rely heavily on one prototype catching on fire. When dealing with battery technology, this is common. Just ask Samsung. RIDE has responded by locating the issue and solving it. It was human error on one part that will be automated in the line."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are they actually selling EVs? I thought they had ""preorders"", and I use the term as loosely as possible, considering it was all with marketing companies that specifically said the orders are non-binding, when interviewed by hindenberg."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Somewhat.

Postal service contract killed WKHS. So it’s stock price is the result of a different problem. 

However, there is a bill for more funding more EVs for USPS. Green energy and EVs are a big part of Dems platform once COVID is over.

The main reason USPS didn’t go with WKHS was because of funding, but if this bill goes through, WKHS is the only company who can produce more EVs for them.

Osh Kosh is making mostly vehicles that can be converted later, which I don’t think really looks good for politicians who are pushing quick climate change action. 

WKHS is who they will turn to once funding is increased."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I’m aware of that. But if RIDE fails during it after this SEC investigation, WKHS will be fucked. But Mama Cathie will probably double down again."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is no info or evidence saying that USPS didn't go with Workhorse because of funding. That is purely speculation. They could have chosen not to use them due to other reasons like believing they had an inferior product, believing they weren't capable of producing the vehicles reliably and in enough quantity quick enough, or that they weren't experienced enough being a company that is only 5 years old. Since USPS has given no info on why the chose Oshkosh over Workhorse we can only speculate and gamble at this point."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mama Cathie knows RIDE is the way. 

SEC always investigating Musk and she love Tesla."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The postmaster general said electrifying the entire fleet was too expensive, which is why they went with osh Kosh. It’s actually mentioned in the lawsuit against WKHS.

WKHS also killed Q4 2020 earnings. They have a lot more business all over."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve read every piece of news and information on RIDE and WKHS the past few weeks. It’s not too crazy to believe they will be successful. RIDE has plenty of cash to operate this year and next year.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Ark has a position in WKHS in the ARKQ fund. They do not hold any RIDE in any Ark fund

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,...yet
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Who else can produce that many EVs? 

It’s not Osh Kosh...which is why they aren’t making EVs. They are making vehicles that can supposedly be converted to EVs later. It’s how they undercut WKHS.

If this administration is as serious about EVs as they are saying, having EVs sooner rather than later is a big win. WKHS is the company that can do that with more funding."

2021-03-21 00:41:38,wallstreetbets,"$GME Potential Pattern: Descending Triangle to Cup Handle Formation and Possible Bullish Overturn Breakdown with MACD, W%R, and DMI. This time with pretty shapes! Hi all! I made post yesterday about the bullish/bearish trends that GME exhibited in the past 4 months. I wanted to make a follow up post and share some pretty shapes I found in the charts with a few indicators to support the patterns.  🌈🐻  thesis included.

First, here is where we are with some lines drawn in:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2m0xkmipu8o61.png?width=484&format=png&auto=webp&s=3cdb729fb4541e134f9605ee40be674451ac3441

Second, according to Investopedia, there are a few conditions for a real cup with handle chart pattern:

1. **Trend:** To qualify as a continuation pattern, a prior trend should exist. Ideally, the trend should be a few months old and not too mature. **Check**
2. **Cup:** The cup should be “U” shaped and resemble a bowl or rounding bottom. A “V” shaped bottom would be considered too sharp of a reversal to qualify. **Check**
3. **Cup Depth:** Ideally, the depth of the cup should retrace 1/3 or less of the previous advance. However, with volatile markets and over-reactions, the retracement could range from 1/3 to ½. **Kinda check?** We fell from 483 to around 38 so this was a very abnormal retracement, and so we need to be a little weary.
4. **Handle:** After the high forms on the right side of the cup, there is a pullback that forms the handle. Sometimes this handle resembles a flag or pennant that slopes downward, other times it is just a short pullback. The handle represents the final consolidation/pullback before the big breakout and can retrace up to 1/3 of the cup's advance, but usually not more. The smaller the retracement, the more bullish the formation and significant the breakout. **Kinda check again?** We fell from around 340 to 173, at one point. However, if only opening and closing prices ranges are factored, it would be 275 to 201. This is only a 27% drop and a 33% drop would be 183.15.
5. **Duration:** The cup can extend from 1 to 6 months, sometimes longer on weekly charts. The handle can be from 1 week to many weeks and ideally completes within 1-4 weeks. **Almost there**
6. **Volume:** There should be a substantial increase in volume on the breakout above the handle's resistance. **Maybe one day?**

Okay now let’s look at just the handle:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ru5bg80yu8o61.png?width=489&format=png&auto=webp&s=16083754a6dbdef77db377f2eadac0e28b7f68ea

So we can clearly see downward trend lines with a support line hovering around 180ish here. It is also backed with decreased MACD momentum, slight overselling (W%R trending down), and signs of a DMI convergence (evidence of bearish sentiment). We will need to see if a downward triangle forms in the coming weeks. If one forms, then that further confirms bearish sentiment.

Looking back at our handle rules, we can see that a handle must be formed in 1-4 weeks, and it looks like the handle formation began 6 trading days ago.

Knowing that our bear trends for GME usually last 6-14 days, the timing lines up perfectly for proper handle formation.

The only thing left is to wait out the handle and get a solid breakout with huge volume. Then GME go boom boom.

Evidence of cup with handle pattern: two high resistances with a low “U” shaped support in the middle. Formation of 1-4 weeks of price stagnation with a downward trendlines. Handle supported by W%R, DMI, and MACD.

Potential reasons cup with handle might fail: Price fell too low out of expected range during “U” formation. Potentially, price might fall too low during handle formation, and most importantly there needs to be large volume to breakout of the handle. Also, there may be a sub pattern forming as an inverse cup from 3/16-3/19. I have not analyzed it much yet, but it was pointed out to me by another redditor.

Edit: Added one more potential reasons cup with handle might fail.

Edit2: Removed links.

Edit3: My bad yall! As pointed out in comments, not descending triangle as that is a continuation pattern not a reversal pattern. Changing it to say ""downward trendlines"" instead, cant change the title unfortunately LOL what can i say im retarded

Obligatory emojis: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was reading articles last night about past short squeezes, KBIO and HCMC.  Basically, when things are shorted like GME is and a short squeeze is imminent, just throw all fundamentals out the window.  

The shorts and long whales are gonna manipulate this thing wherever they want it, regardless of technical indicators.  Just sit back and wait for things to blow up."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It will go up or down, trust me."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I trust in gme, its still a great long play right now! The real pipe dream is to have Cohen announce GME is announcing a special dividend of X dollars, then a day after that dividend the company will split the stock by a factor of 10.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t buy the cup formation argument with GME. The left side of the cup was primarily caused by trading fuckery and app restrictions on buying. The news caught wind of it and quickly spread it as a “it’s over” type of thing. Then it dropped way down a day later.

For the cup formation to be a true indicator of market movement, that dip at the end of January would have had to been naturally caused (I.e., no fuckery). Any other cup formation in investing history lacks the fuckery element like the one we experienced.

I’m still holding, but not because of any cup theory."

It’s important that the fleeb is rubbed, because the fleeb has all of the fleeb juice. Then a schlami shows up, and he rubs it and spits on it. They cut the fleeb. There’s several hizzards in the way. The blamfs rub against the chumbles. And the ploobis and grumbo are shaved away. That leaves you with a regular old plumbus."

Trying to apply TA onto a meme stock such as $GME is absurd to say the least. There are so many factors at play outside the realm of normal market conditions that you can throw your TA right out the window."

These HF MFers have teams and like to cheat, as we have seen.  What would make them happier than getting an injection of all our stimmies right into their pockets? What's preventing them from rigging the game and paying a fine or 3 while lying to congress or telling them childhood histories from Bulgaria sans repercussions? 

I am undereducated Ape that relies on much of the DD on here, as I'm still learning. 

So back to my first point.  There has to be some greedy asshole that wants to transfer all  our stimmies into their pockets, especially after we took 7 billion(so far) from them.   We fucked up their plan and even though I am diamond handing and buying dips, I still worry that their teams of smart people are trying to figure out a way to turn our checks into a bailout for them. Like keep it artificially ""low"" at 200 so the can short it and make it drop to 100 or less or  some shit.

I'm not pro Trump, nor am I pro Biden.  Just because he is competent doesn't make Biden one of us.   After 4 years of the dumpster fire, I think too many people have too much faith in the current admin that they assume he will sacrifice some billionaires.  But who got him elected?   ure there were small injections from retail traders, but there were for sure billionaires in there and I guarantee you he knows more than a few on a first name basis.    

This Ape is getting worried because, as Rumsfeld put it, there are unknown unknowns.   And to me especially, when it comes to the market and this big win that mathematically should be coming our way.... I just worry that we will get fucked somehow.  

I didn't trust the gov't when i was a teenager, and I still don't now 20+ years later.  Hopefully there are enough peopoel like Bernie and AOC in there to keep us from getting fucked, but the longer this shit gets drawn out the longer they have time to plan and smooze and get cajoled by their billionaire HF friends/donors.  

Sorry.  Just wanted to get that off my chest.  I love the fact that 200 seems to be the floor and the shorts are fucked.   I love how RH's method of buying shares - essentially shorting them and now people know they never actually owned them - being a thing.  

But we have always joked that ines are cheaper than losses when it comes to wall st and I hope that isn't the case here.   

All that said.... Apes strong together.  HODL!


 am not a financial advisor and this is just my ignorant ass writing out my worries so I can sleep tonight.  Hopefully OP and more read this and reassure me that it'll all be OK and we will get to 50k a share at minimum.   As a disabled person with few shares I wanna be able to have money to pass down and money for school for my kid.

Basically all of the hallmarks of a socially dysfunctional individual or relationship.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Your analysis is just as good as mine
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,All jokes contain truth
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If we've lost momentum and all hope is lost as you state, why is the price above $200 the whole past week despite the best efforts of the short sellers? Even just this past Friday, it jumped to 215-220 and stayed over 200 the whole day. Seems more like a holding pattern, a stalemate if you will.

Shortsellers are scared of the price going low because as you stated, people are eagerly waiting for the price to dip so they can buy in. That by itself can trigger the squeeze. So either way, us apes win. If price goes down to 100 as you state, that will trigger a squeeze causing it to go well above 500. If price goes up from the current 200, it will also trigger a squeeze going well above 500."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Large volume comes from where it always comes from: Whales! Although retail is not insignificant, in the grand scheme whales have billions to throw at this if they want to"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You might be right! I saw this formation, as it was pointed out by others too. However one counter argument: what if the new inverse cup is just part of the price stagnation of the larger handle?

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"TA is one of many tools we have. You can choose not to look into TA, but retail is so disadvantaged, it's in our best interest to look at all tools at least with a grain of salt"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The handle actually requires shorting conditions. It's not a bullish action, it's a bearish action. So actually shorting supports the pattern up to a certain point. We don't know exactly what will break the pattern but my guess is anything under 100 would definitely break the handle. 

Alot of commenters mention manipulation, but I think they are new to the game. Anyone with experience will tell you all stocks are manipulated and that TA is a result of manipulation. Think about it wouldn't all stocks just stay at a certain agreed upon price with no movement without manipulation? 

Now it's not always as blatant as quietly asking brokers to stop buying or ordering large short orders in under 15 min, but manipulation occurs with all stocks when bears or bulls see a potential breakout opportunity."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I’d literally nut for a .69% dividend that would force all the “duplicated” shares to be called back basically forcing the squeeze

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I assume earnings will be good. This earnings report includes the start of the new console cycle (PS5/Xbox Series X) as well as what will probably be a small bump from all the publicity they got. This report includes earnings up to the end of January 2021 which was well into the time when GME hype was brewing and people were taking some of their initial profits to buy shit at GameStop. 

But earnings have been dumb as fuck recently. Good reports resulting in a huge drop in stock price as well as bad reports resulting in huge increases so at this point earnings are hard to be confident about. But I think as long as this report is good (which I think it will be) then it will be overall positive for the squeeze. 

I’m fuckin stupid tho and I heard all of this info on this sub so it’s probably all wrong"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,That is my fear as well.  I feel like there is too much risk of this dropping the share price to $40 though.  If they wait for the price to establish a higher floor and stabilize (lol) for a year they can do an offering without causing everyone to evacuate.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I also read it and it was brilliant. It showed on spot why we see high volantility every 1 -2 weeks and then a steady decreasing volantility until the cycle reboots. It's very likely the HFs creating high IV -> then selling options. Then bringing IV down and forcing the price onto their own price target to make the profits by keeping the premium and making the buyers of these options the bag holders.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way 🍌
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Wednesday premarket is gonna be nutz
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Cool. Not judging anyone or their financial decisions. Im just wondering if/how we will get the volume needed.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"There was a chart by CNBC (gathered from Citadel data) that showed Retail was about 30% of the volume for the week after it shot up to 480 in January.  I'm guessing it was more the week of/before.

Volume for those days was 50M-180M.  Retail has power, but reddit is only a small portion of the retail."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I think retail owns way more of the float than people realize. If half of WSB owns 5 shares then there is half the float. Not to mention the people with hundreds and thousands of shares.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,hey just an fyi! this is exactly what TA is for. Finding the right buy in periods and feeling out if the waters are too hot to jump in are great ways to use TA.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"60% of the time, it works every time"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The way I understand it is macd tracks current average (MACD)compared to average price over a longer amount of time (signal) so green/up is bullish (not sure about histogram). I'm working on learning what to do with this info and how to use it along with other trends that we see happening. As volatile and irregular as it is, gme is my first stock that I've tried to watch TA on. I'm trying to apply what I learn here to my other investments in the future. I started an account in November so I could have maximum control over part of my investments while still contributing to my 401k, so this is all still really new for me, and even newer for a lot of people I assume. Thanks for the help"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I agree that market action causes the reduction in price. The question that we need to answer is whether the form of market manipulation we saw in January is substantially equivalent to the natural market action that (we hypothesize) normally causes the left side of a cup formation.

If no, then we have to determine if despite the cause being different, can we still expect the same (bullish) outcome we would expect from a cup formation.

I don’t know the answer to that. But I do hope GME goes up haha."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Good ape
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Something about Citadel owning 99% of the options market, bleeding fools of premiums keeping the price right at 200. Find that DD, believe it, and you’ve found your answer."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I see it more as a repeat of last time than losing all hope. Each time the floor will raise as every peak raises the perceptions of what the bottom will be if it comes down until the bottom is so high that the peaks touch the moon.

It has dipped fairly hard below $200 a few times so I don't think it will hold at $200 for much longer. A stalemate won't last forever and while a rebound might come sooner than expected as the downward momentum isn't as high as last time, closing at $200 is practically teasing the prospect of falling below and staying below for a while.

I can't say for sure but I bought 5@54 and sold 5@260 after failing to sell @300 on the way down. I'd love to buy a dip to $100 and get more free money but if the rocket leaves without me then congratulations and fuck you as is the custom to say here, even if it goes my way you'll proably still be fine holding through the dip,  that's just my opinion though."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Did I catch a niner in there. Were you placing stock orders on a walkie talkie
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Completely safe!
50-50!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"ahhhh, now it all makes sense, god I'm retarded"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I see your point.  My half assed counterpoint is that they don't want us to set sights on them next so will try to not let this become a normal thing.  

Ideally they would learn not to over short, but at the same time do they hate the other HFs more than they hate us poors?  

I'm in for the ride.  I just worry that they can't fight all us apes and hope you are correct in that they would rather kill a competitor and join us instead of fighting us.  But their bottom line is money so maybe they don't see the sides the same way we do.  They probably want the squeeze to happen too as they probably bought it.

Just night time worries.  Still hodling."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, I think you must realize that there is a difference.  One stock broker used WSB to lead a large mob of people to invest in one selected stock specifically to pump up the price to unnatural levels isn't following the trends of normal stock trading that is usually based on fumdamentals like the future earnings potential of the company."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"TA is basically the highest form of confirmation bias and then comes cognitive dissonance. So believing all virgo are a bit silly, and you being a virgo you will have tendency to act thus. Believing a cup and a handle is bullish will make people bullish, without any solid reason why it is so. A cup and handle that is not bullish eventually gets noted as ""wasn't a true cup and handle anyway, the handle dipped to low"". 

Nevertheless I am not here to argue, but to merely state the first two rules (according to me) of stock trading. I base those two rules on factual data, that anything can happen anytime (see GME saga) and never to bet on odds with money more than you are comfortable losing."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"No I agree with that I’m I am definitely new to the game but when I started hearing people talk about the cup and handle the information I read was more pointing to human psychology of sell high, buy low, and when it plays out it forms a cup and handle.

I agree that something has to affect it and agree the market is always being manipulated but could not find any research on cup and handles based on shorting instead of the cup being formed by selling and buying back in low.

That why I was curious your thoughts if we are looking at something new if it follows the same pattern because all the DD says no one has sold and the dip of the cup and handle was caused by shorting.

I find it fascinating that it’s taking the shape of such a bullish chart in a scenario where if no one sells its extremely bullish.

What are your thoughts?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Those who have the money make the rules.  Hedge funds and market makers were caught off guard once.  You can bet it will not happen again.  If you watch the swing in price and volume it becomes evident that the retail players are being jerked around and the institutional traders are making money at every turn. 
Don’t get me wrong, I would love to see the “little guy” win.  It just doesn’t happen in our world."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The thought of that being announced is better than any sex dream I have ever had. And what’s even better is that it could fucking happen.

Let’s fucking go!!!!!!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"A dividend announcement wouldn’t force a recall, but it would force the shorts to pay that dividend to the lender of the shorted share. This would obviously place more financial pressure on shorts, as long as there isn’t collusion between the lenders (blackrock) and shorts (citadel) as some have suggested. In that scenario the lenders may waive the dividend obligation from the shorts. 

A stock split may also put pressure on shorts, but only immaterially in the sense that a lower share price might encourage more buying. The biggest thing that might influence a short squeeze aside from a runaway gamma squeeze, would be individuals transferring stock out of CFD brokerages to brokerages that don’t use CFDs, thereby forcing those brokerages holding shares as CFDs to find shares on the open market. Or perhaps the DTCC margin calling risky brokerages and hedge funds and thereby forcing them to close their short positions. I am waiting with much anticipation for the approval of the DTCC amendment of supplemental liquidity deposit requirements. Once this policy is activated, any catalyst has a much greater likelihood of triggering the MOASS."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Proof or ban.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"IIRC they don't have to be called back, but the borrower's of the shares would need to pay the dividend for each share outstanding."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,For sure. Number 3 would definitely trigger the MOASS that we have all been having wet dreams about.  I have never wanted something to happen so much in my entire life.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right but if they announce a good plan for the future, then all of a sudden the fundamentals can change setting a projected stock price of let's say $600 a year from now (or hell even 2 or 3 years from now), then $200 to buy in now is a very attractive deal - squeeze or not.

I'm also suspicious that the ""long whales"" or ""STONKY KONGS"" might be waiting for an entry point so the squeeze looks more organic.

Just my thoughts idk 🚀🚀"

If they ever had a reforging plan, this is the time to share it. Merely giving away some modest or bad earnings may just cause the stock to plummet. It's a coin toss at this point."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,anyone of these things = moon.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Switch outsold the Xbox and Play Station last quarter and Gamestop does great selling Nintendo products. The pandemic has been great for video game sales in general. I got a feeling they will crush earnings compared to 4th quarter 2019
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Funko pops smashed their earnings and GameStop is their biggest retail partner. A small price of business but it bodes well.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Ikr?! It’s like I must be stupid if most of my research comes from this sub but seriously 😐 there’s good fuckin solid Ass DD in this bitch!!!thank you for REAL!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"While im holding no matter what. I think incredible earnings I'd already ""priced in"" so to speak. Then again we are way out of the proper fundamentals so everything is speculation now."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Earnings year over year  or quarter over quarter might be good, however it's stupidly based on whether or not the earnings beat the expectations, how much they beat it by, and if anything else if offered up (new tech direction, etc...).  I think it's a given that the street expects a good earnings report.  The question is whether there will be additional news and if they exceed the expected beat amount."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"PS5s are still instantly sold out the moment they go on sale, so Gamestop has maximized sales on that."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s awesome that this is happening to GameStop. Everyone talks about the VW squeeze which is cool and all but I’m sure lots of people who gained money from that squeeze didn’t go buy Volkswagens. Pretty much everyone on this sub is into gaming in some capacity and so much money from this squeeze will probably go right back into the company. Ryan Cohen is a smart dude, I’m sure he realizes this. Especially after seeing all those posts of people buying 5-10 Nintendo switches from GameStop and donating them. He’s hit the jackpot with this whole situation and I doubt he’d intentionally do anything to fuck up the squeeze."

I suspect the same kind of thing is going to happen this time around... Except the starting price will be $100+"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"And yeah you could be right! However, the important part of your statement is ""if"". The trouble is we don't have clear access to that kind of data, which always puts retail at a disadvantage. One constant though is that institutions hold billions and they fucking love making more money, which is why large volume can safely be attributed to them making moves"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately, TA won't help against shenanigans like several brokers cutting off buying for days.  That was like blowing all four tires at once while your transmission just fell out."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You dont even know what TA is. TA isnt just patterns. Its the price action in each candle. Youre arguing about a topic you know nothing about. Refer to my original comment and read a book or two
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Awesome! I think it's so cool how GME influenced a new wave of traders into the market. We are witnessing history! I recommended this in another comment here, but Trading for a Living by Alexander Elder is the only book you need about TA and general market psychology. Give that one a try!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I see your points and understand where your coming from 

Just know that 'they' are not out to get us. HF don't give a shit if retail wins or looses and that applies to the 'good and bad' whales. Whales simply love money and take any opp to make more.

All market actions are the result of bearish or bullish HF wanting a piece of the pie. The best way to trade is too figure out who is winning during the time frame you are looking at and place bets accordingly. TA is one of many tools to help us achieve this goal"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"What you describe is actually normal bullish movement except it applies to wsb not a HF. I'm not trying to sound arrogant but if you follow several stocks over a number of years, you'll see that manipulation is always occuring. As retail investors (and not market makers) it's advantageous to try to figure out if the bears or bulls are winning and pick a side"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yah! This is a great discussion thanks for your points! I'll answer your points in the order recieved

You are correct! In that all chart patterns are visual examples of market psychology. Except that these known patterns are statistically proven and well studied. For example the cup with handle is 85% accurate if all conditions are met. 

I actually sent another commenter examples of historic cup with handle examples and those might help see that the pattern occurs when there are longs and shorts battling for prices. What you can see in those examples is that both bears and bulls want a piece of the pie and usually they actually both win.

Also if you read dd that no one has sold, that's just simply not correct. For example during the 1/27 action, retail accounted for ~25%+ of volume. Today retail accounts for less than ~6%. The reality is this was always a battle of whales and while retail is not insignificant we have way less influence than the billions that ""good/bad"" HF have

It is super fascinating! I agree. I don't have much more insight on the last point except that I agree!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well I see where you're coming from, but even if the big guys make bank from this, from what I can see, shorts aren't covered yet, and total ownership of the shares is still higher than the total float, so when they buy back the shares they owe, the price should go up.

But hey, no way to know till it happens (or don't), and you do have a point when you say retail never won againt those guys, so I guess time will tell if retail actually has power or not ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,If GameStop wants to make loyal as fuck customers for the next decade that’s all it takes and I personally think they know it.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,this
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,For sure. I like the last point about the whales using it as an excuse to push it higher.  Sometimes I forget that it isn’t just the apes who benefit if this goes intergalactic.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you just make up stonky kongs?? I love it 🤣
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This stock was trading at 10 bucks. I don't see any scenario where an announcement for ""a good plan for the future"" would justify the $200 price we see today. That is why I don't think any announcements regarding the company's operations will have any effect. If we were to consider the fundamentals, you and I both know that it isn't worth $200 a share.

&#x200B;

That said, I do believe they can get there once they start executing on their transformation. From what I can see, they already started that transformation, but there is no data to support an exploding stock price.

&#x200B;

They should just issue a modest dividend and force the shorter's hand though, that would be nice to watch."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I completely agree that the whales are making the moves at this point. I think they are also seeing that people are holding and that is probably influencing their moves.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right. Which candle? 1 min? 2? 5? All tell a different story and the analysis is always post facto.

I also agree that it is the whales bot retail speeding this thing up.

Could you link the comment you mentioned of examples where there was shorting driving a lot of the movement instead of selling?

Also how do you feel this handle is forming in comparison to the other cup and handles you mentioned?"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME is currently valued as a depressed brick and mortar store, and analysts take into account things like rents, theft/loss, employees and so on. They've factored that in based on depressed traffic due to the pandemic, etc...  The current direction is in the technology/ecommerce committee that was formed which will change the valuation of the company and will lower the amount of brick and mortar stores, employees, etc... and use a similar valuation to other ecommerce stores.  This will most likely justify a 1000-1200 price just on fundamentals if calculated like other ecommerce stores (Chewy, etc...)"

Of course I can always buy more at $500 on fidelity because I like the stock and know $500 is merely the bottom of stratosphere on the rocket ride to the moon but I’m definitely curious if my $147 avg cost shares will be untouchable. 
Thanks retards.

1k upvotes on this autistic ass question? Just goes to show how much each individual here hates you vlad, I hope you see this."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The squeeze isn't happening this week. Why? Because everyone keeps saying ""the squeeze is happening on x"". This causes people to buy lottery ticket options which might actually delay the squeeze."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I moved on Wednesday still waiting on RH, it says expected to complete on the 24th.... I’m slowly biting my fingers off"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"bitch if you genuinely get stuck, we'll provide for you.  The important part is you got off RH"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah i switched to TDA a few years ago from RH.

Jesus TOS is a godsend. Have an upvote."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don’t put too much blame on robinhood.  After all, it these guys aren’t are that good at being criminals, it takes time."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,i too am finally done with RH. just pulled the trigger on transferring from RH to schwab.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Transferred from RH to Fidelity in February when GME was gradually coming down. Took less than a week with no problems, paid the transfer fee with proceeds from a sale of a (non-GME) stock. I opened a Fidelity account first and bought GME shares there before the transfer so maybe that helped.

Getting out of RH is the way."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idk how yall are transferring your stuff so quickly. I submitted my transfer from RH to Fidelity back on 3/2, almost a month later and Fidelity has done their part, and waiting on RH to do their shit. Please don't take off without me guys 172 @17$"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I processed mine Wednesday night and was finished this morning, but my shares show they are margin so phone call on Monday"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I said fk it after a month and a half of being in fear of the squeeze happening. 

Started it today, to be finished by the 29th."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"After the Jan 28th fuckery, I knew I couldn’t trust RH. But I was hesitant to initiate a transfer for fear of my shares being tied up in limbo during the squeeze. Instead I opened a Fidelity account and since then have been accruing more and more GME shares there. Both my Fidelity and RH portfolios are 100% GME... that’s what they mean by diversity right?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You’ll be ok don’t worry you won’t miss it and it won’t happen during the transfer next week. Patience and trust in the thesis will reward you. It’ll be next week is the kind of fomo that might make you lose money. Having the transfer might actually save you a few bucks
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good on you for getting out of robinhood, if the great squeezining happens while your shares are tied up I'll give you one shares worth"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m in the same situation with a $143 avg at 11 shares, I’m thinking about switching over to Meryl edge but what if the squeeze happens yk"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I am also processing my share transfer to fidelity from RH. I don't trust that company to even acknowledge that a squeeze is happening if it were to happen.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,i think the exodus itself might cause a squeeze of sorts as i hope that is what is happening
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Basically you will be SOL Until it transfers. However your shares are will keep its value.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Submitted the request to transfer on fidelity app last Sunday and by Thursday, everything was transferred out of RH. Longest part of the whole thing was waiting on RH to do their part"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Man I've been shitting myself too. I started my transfer on Wednesday as well and the tracker on fidelity hasn't updated at all and I'm stressing. I think we'll be okay. Hopefully both your shares and mine are out by Monday or Tuesday and we can wash our hands of RH.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I did a move from RH last week too. Lemme know how this goes. !remind me!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did the same thing man. I just transferred to a TD account from Robin Hood. Hopefully it should be fast but we will see. I was getting nervous with all their bullshit the past few months. The squeeze will take a while so even if it starts this week, we will be alright more than likely. Try not to stress about it and I’ll try to do the same 😅

🚀🚀🚀🤠🤠"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't forget to get your margin shares pulled out of margin. When I transfered  RH to Fidelity all of my shares were on margin
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Dick in hand is better than dick in ass. Good that you finally ditched RH.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dick in hand 😂 definitely lol’d
Hope you are not stuck that way if the squeeze happens"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You should have read the post that said to just do a partial transfer of just gme shares, I did mine on Wednesday and it was done in 24 hours."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,My four shares are in cashapp. I am a retard
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"E*TRADE made me wait five days, even though they acknowledged they had certified they had my money immediately (some banks are worth their word, and I had sent it to E*TRADE from USAA).... E*TRADE is run by mouse dicks!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I started a partial transfer, not exactly the same thing, from RH to Fidelity on Tuesday and it went through just after market close last night."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"To anyone attempting a transfer from RH to Fidelity: TURN OFF RH INSTANT DEPOSIT.  
  
This feature is enabled by default and makes RH accounts appear as margin accounts, with a margin debit that is flagged during the transfer process. Some of y'all waiting for a transfer to go through might not even know it's been held up or cancelled on your behalf. I had to make two attempts, and the disabling of instant deposit is what enabled my second attempt to go through successfully. Will my cost averages ever update? Who knows, but at least I'm out of that garbage platform."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Every Broker that did that corruption in January should be reimbursing their clients for arbitrary losses. They had no right to stop buying without communication on the matter. I’m out for blood now!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did this on Friday and really hope I don’t miss the squeeze in the meantime,"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have faith.  You should be ready and transferred by this coming Tuesday.  Most it took me was 4 trading days and what a relief it will be for you when all was said and done.  I know its the scariest thing but ever since the first squeeze, I was scared to transfer because every week was ""this is the week""  i finally took the dive and made the transfer to Fidelity with over 100K in assets.  Im hearing other fellow apes saying 2 days, 3 days for transfer.  You initiated on Wed.  You will be good."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks good to know my fellow retards will still buy at 500$. All aboard the tendie train boys and girls. Keep your hands inside the ride at all times.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I transferred my broker when they shutdown buying more in Jan.

Legit thought I'd get back in at 1k plus, but they put GME on discount instead.

GME follows no rules.

I'm legit sure you're safe, don't get FOMO. There's no sign they're going to quit anytime soon."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You'll be fine, even if it booms Monday for some reason, it will likely take several days to payout.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m not a shill, autobot or decipiticon, but generally asking is RH that bad? I knew there was a capital issue when people were swarming  GME, but apart from that I thought they were good"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"**THIS IS THE WAY!**

**APES STAY TOGETHER, BUY JUST REAL GME SHARES AND PLEASE DO NOT WASTE MONEY IN OPTIONS!!!!**"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wondering ... when RH IPO’s .... how many investors will short the shit out of it!

Edit: I love that this has gotten downvotes. That means it’s a possibility!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I transferred 260 shares out of RH to Fidelity this past Thursday. The shares showed up in my fidelity account this morning. You should be good!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey buddy, I was in the same boat as you around 2/20. The price did soar a bit and I didn't have the time to get in super low but I still got in at a decent price and my expectations were more than satisfied. Hope that helps. It took fidelity about 5 days to process mine."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,My transfer to fidelity from robinhood only took 3 days. I think you’ll be fine. Besides when this squeezes it’ll last for several days.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would imagine you can’t be selling shares in the transfer limbo dimension.

All I can say is the VW squeeze to 900 lasted weeks.  So I hope this brings you some peace of mind."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Most DD about timing the squeeze/exit strategies suggest that it will last days from the start to the top and days from the top to the bottom. Chances are it isn’t going to skyrocket at open on Monday so you’ll most likely be able to catch some of it at an elevated price if not the top itself.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,How tf does anyone still use RH after the fuckery in January?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It moves quicker then you think. Move out of RH ASAP
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,The squeeze will take more than a day. Your good my dude
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,They won't let me transfer out of Robinhood
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I initiated a PARTIAL transfer on Wednesday, thinking incorrectly I would be able to hold onto and control half my shares should something happen Thursday or Friday. I lost control over ALL my shares on Friday during market hours, but fortunately nothing too insane happened and the move was completed by Friday after-hours. I should mention my last purchase was also on March 11th, grabbed 4 more shares from FOMO (fortunately I already had a bit over 100, so even though I bought them at 260-something my CB only averaged up to 40 bucks), and my last move before that was on Feb 25th."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stash told me it could take anywhere from 5-30 days. After 2 days all my gme was in and cleared and as of tomorrow, the rest of my amc goes in. So it could take anywhere from 3-7 days. But usual acat transfers should only take 5-7 days and anything after that is unacceptable"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I started the transfer from RH to Fidelity on Wednesday. It completed today. Hopefully it transfers fast like mine! Also side note, I had full access to my shares through the entire process. I always was able to access them."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Rh doesn’t own or have your shares, if everyone did this, they’d be fucked, can’t transfer naked stocks."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,RELAXXX ! IF the squeeze happens on Monday it will take DAYS EVEN WEEKS to settle down . Most of us will not sell at the top we will wait to moon first !
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The squeeze will take days. Even when it peaks, it’ll stay on the moon for awhile. You’ve still got time."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Opened a webull for the 4 free shares. Then sold and transferred out.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am in the exact same boat brother, I heard others had their accounts transferred in less than 5 days but at this point who the fuck knows."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I only transferred my GME shares, took two days.

Haven't done the rest just yet."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Took from Monday to Thursday moving to schwab for me.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I transferred my account to Fidelity about a month ago and it only took three days although I'm sure there's a lot of factors at play which determines the time frame.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I transferred just GME from RH on Thursday, was finalised on Saturday.  Will transfer the rest, but I’m doing it a little at a time per others comments that transferring one type of stock at a time usually goes quicker than transferring the whole account."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I started my transfer on Wednesday after lunch, and I just checked Fidelity today to see that my shares had transferred over even though it's Saturday. It was a lot faster than I expected, so hopefully it goes the same way in your situation."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have this same issue. I started using Robinhood way back in the day, before they pulled the major steaming shit last month.

I put my money to invest in GME during January thinking, “hey what’s the worst that can happen, right?” Well the worst DID happen as we all know, however I know from experience how slow all of their processes are (all EXCEPT the actual investing of course), so as much as I hate it I have to stick with them as long as I am holding. 

I already opened accounts with other brokers for future investments, so once I am out of that shithole I am never coming back."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It took me 2 full days, don’t worry friend"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone transferring to webull? I prefer to use them
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didn’t have any shares at RH, but I had them with Stash and SoFi. I initiated GME transfers to Fidelity today. They said it would be done by the 29th. Hopefully, it won’t take that long, like it did for others in the comments. 🤞🏻💎🙌🏻"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look brother, you don't plan on selling in 5 to 7 days right? We want to sell in front of an audience of non believers at an unsuspecting Friday night karaoke event after the bars open back up right? We gonna hold with our laughable $100ish averages that mainstream buy in a month because eVeRYoNe doing it. When they are freaking out cuz their seing volatility on their $900 averages and we haven't slept  in 4 days and are dicks are chapped and we are jacked to the fucking tits"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone transferred from RH to Schwab? How long did it take for you?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are safe my friend.   5-7 days grossly overestimated.  Personally I did a partial transfer of all gme funds.  It took no less than 72 hours or less... I didn't worry, I received no confirmation text.... it happened, quicker than expected.  ( fidelity )"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is everyone transferring to fidelity? Never once did I ever consider them. Been with TD for years.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The short is so insanely high it doesn’t matter it will peak for days possibly more (not financial advise, I dipped my nuts in molten diamond and am eating grass atm)"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you single-handedly cause the squeeze by transferring out and missing it (which is exactly what would happen to me), I'll share some of my tendies with you. Thank you for your service."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I moved about 2k of stock from robinhood to fidelity, only took about five days surprisingly. Just do it, you’ll feel better. If you miss the squeeze, I’ll drop you off at your job in my mclaren. Even pack you a lunch and everything."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Upvote because ""cuckening"""
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"There’s more than 2 types of squeezes. And one of them is the squeeze Robinhood would have put on your balls if you stayed with them. You’re acting like if the squeeze happens and you stayed with Robinhood, you wouldn’t have your dick in your hand. But when they inevitably try to wreck squeeze day, that’s exactly where you would have been."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You'll be fine. If anything the squeeze will last quite some time with many ups and downs which should give you the time for your shares to be available. Hope that luck is on our side!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m in the same boat dude. I scheduled a transfer on Wednesday night as well from Robinhood to Webull and I am freaking out about missing the squeeze. I’m having nightmares of watching my account balloon to like 20,000 and then just dropping like a rock back down to like 3,000. Scary shit. I still don’t regret doing it though."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,you'll be fine bro no chance the squeeze will peak next week
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,robinhood stinks
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,The reason it’s taking a while longer could be because Robinhood never actually purchased your shares.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I started a transfer from one Swedish broker to another on March 4th. My shares on the transfer account is now black-holed for as long as 5 WEEKS. Yeah, weeks. Meaning my shares are removed from my old account but yet to be transferred to the other broker. Effectively black holing them. I have zero access, can’t do anything. Administration, they call it. Fuccking bullshit. They assured me however that selling and rebuying, on their part, was strictly prohibited during this process. Do I trust this. Nope... 

So like any good ape I started over on my new account, since AMC was part of my transfer. Ended up buying 5 times as many shares on my new broker."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy at 1k sell at 100k 

X100 profit"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I started transfer after close on Thursday, GME sat in RH all Friday, but transfered sometime after close on Friday evening.  I only initiated transfer of GME, leaving other stocks in place.  I'm throttling those other stock over to Fidelity based on nothing in particular.

**FYI: Fidelity didn't transfer partial shares, so I was left with less than one share on RH.**"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm going to open an account on Robinhood with the sole intention of shorting Robinhood when they IPO.  I'll only buy boomer stocks with that account to keep the number of trades down so they don't make much money off me.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s with all this fidelty shit? Seriously? They own shares in GME and that’s why?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I missed a couple thousand profit on the last decent GME spike because Robinhood took like 2 weeks for my transfer to go thru
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I was watching vlad earlier on the Bloomberg hr or whatever and he kinda made my skin crawl the way he dodges questions and take no personal responsibility for the fiasco including a death they caused...
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shouldnt matter if ""you're not selling"". 

So what ya worried about?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"unrelated- when GME gets halted going up towards $1,000,000 per share. will they actually let us sell or will all the brokers get our tendies for being sore losers? asking for an ape"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't worry dude, the squeeze will last longer then a day just from the amount of shorted shares they will need to cover. Look at WW squeeze, took them like 4-5 days to cover, and GME is waaay more shorted."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Why fidelity over etrade?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Got an upvote from me for title alone. Now what were you saying?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I transferred mine late Wednesday and it went through Saturday morning. I wouldn't give up hope yet.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I transferred a couple weeks back from RH to TD. Took 5 days. I’m hoping yours get in sooner. Best of luck ape
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,1k upvotes for “fuck Robinhood eat my ass Vlad” that’s where you went right sir
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well thank you for your sacrifice. Now that you have transferred its guaranteed to happen during your transfer window.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I salute you."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Just sell the stock you dont have like shitidel. You can reasonable aquire shares at a later date right?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Good on you! Fuq RH!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I need to get out of RH almost 10k investing now. What broker do you recommend this 🦍 to go to. Honestly I don’t trust RH to many bad reviews about them.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets," You decided to kick off your transfer leading into the 2 biggest dates gme apes have been looking forward to since Feb? (3/19 & earnings).

Good thing these dates probably mean nothing!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I started a partial transfer from RH of two different stocks, and options on one of them, at around 5 PM pacific on Wednesday and saw my shares in my fidelity account this morning. I’m optimistic that your shares will finish the transfer soon."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Can’t stand vlad
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It won't squeeze, dw buddy"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I knew Robinhood would cuck me so I just sold everything and rebought on fidelity, yolo"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way. Fuck RH
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,There will be no squeeze. Only 10 million or so shares short now. S3 says
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You'll be fine because shit ain't gonna squeeze. We've been at this for months now. You think billion dollar organizations haven't set up hedges by now? Jesus... Shits just volitile, and all these gme posts are being written by anarchists from communist countries."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Why does this have 1.9k upvotes? GME isn’t going to $500 next week lmao
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I transferred everything but gme shares & partial shares to Schwab In February after that fd up situation with RH. I wasn’t aware of wsb when I bought my gme, bb, nok & AMC last summer. I wish I did because I wouldn’t have been playing with buying low AMC & gme & selling both high and buying when it dipped again. Just made sense to me with new consoles to be a good company for at least 2 years before RC even signed on. AMC was just betting against covid. Gme all the profit I’ve made has been reinvested but wish I still had my original stock holdings that I was playing with. AMC sold off at$14 (bought in avg was $3.49) and tossed that profit at gme. I didn’t want gme to be stuck in limbo in the transfer. Partials I’m waiting for a dip when I’m positive, sell those and then hopefully buy those partials as Schwab slices. New gme stock gets bought up in Schwab."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Don’t worry I will give you a mil if it pops next week 🤞🏽
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I've had Fidelity for years now. I recently applied for level 2 options. After two weeks a waiting they approved my application for level 1 options. After the first week of waiting I downloaded the Robinhood app and within 10 minutes I had $1000 ready to trade and level 2 options enabled.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If/when it goes over $500 a share you'll start to see all the bigger brokers fold too.  Everyone seems to forget Robinhood wasn't the only broker that cut off buy orders.  They were the last ones to restore the ability to buy but the morning it happened there were at least 3-4 different brokers that stopped buying.

$1000+ a share the market will start to crumble.  Strap in y'all.  Just remember that money has to siphon from somewhere.  When it starts to moon they're going to have to sell off everything else to pay the tab.  CHAOSSSSS

😈😈😈😈"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The fidelity app sucks my balls.

Also, no pre / post market trading."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It takes forever to get the base cost transfered, I'm still waiting 13days later."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve transferred everything but GME. Didn’t want to chance RH dicking it up

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"While attempting to convert to cash account on RH, I’m sure someone has seen the “must wait for funds to settle 3-5 days” bullshit. But why does it say that on my moms account that she hasn’t even opened the app in 2 months? Feels like RH has disabled the convert to cash feature for everyone."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,What about my shares I have with Cash App any issues with those guys? Have not heard them brought up much.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,What about options??? How do u transfer those
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I started mine in February. And they're still dicking with it
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Charles Schwab brah...
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep I moved from robbing hood  too bank. Then into td...just for those resinam  I did it in pieces....big one time u get this shit.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s starting to feel like a bear market only happens when mainstream media convince enough people that a bear market is happening. Let’s just stay unconvinced. And not let them influence us anymore.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It listed all my holdings...plus a cash debit that made no sense since I bought everything on Robinhood with my actual money. Sent Robinhood a support ticket saying my shit is and always has been paid for. Then a day later all my holdings disappeared from the Fidelity transfer screen as if it started over. Hoping I get my account transferred by the 3/25 estimate I was given for Fidelity. FUCK ROBINHOOD.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I do believe fidelity will actually front you the shares until they hit your account. Like how they let you trade with your money before it deposits. I could be mistaken though
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Are there any other brokers that would be good other than fidelity? I already have an account there and want to spread my shares out to another just in case
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Took me one day to transfer
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Vlads a skank ass ho. Mighta seen him giving some hedgies a handjob behind a dumpster fire.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Apparently squeezes last days so you can't miss it. Also it's almost April why the hell are you only just leaving RH 😂😂
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"ME: when exactly will it processed and cleared?

RH: that is a good question.
Thanks for giving me a chance to answer that question.
When I was a young boy in Bulgaria...."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Jabroni. Lmao
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,shoulda left when the shenanigans started
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just call rh or fidelity, whichever has possession of your account at the time and they can complete transactions over the phone."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only question I have is, what took you so long to get out of RH? I’m genuinely curious."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm in the same boat! The transfer started early morning on Thursday. The transfer tracker is telling me the estimated completion day is 3/24/2021. PLEASE DONT LET THAT ROCKET LAUNCH JUST YET!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm stuck in limbo.

Converted account to cash
Started transfer 3/17 mid day
Still waiting on 3/21

I'm hopeful they will show up on Monday."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You can short it when you'd sell and cover from the transfer.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,If it makes you feel better I can buy thus making sure there won't be a squeeze this week and you will get a dip.

what is an ass question"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"How do people feel about Public? I’ve got some shares on RH (cash account), but more on Public. Would people recommend I transfer both to Fidelity?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes or No
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I had been trying to transfer off Robinhood since it happened, finally went through this week."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I transferred to fidelity as well. They said the whole process will take about 5-7 days. Fidelity moved super quick and finished their end in essentially 2 business days. Robinhood is what causes the slow up. They also never sent all my papers to fidelity.... so fidelity is still tracking down my papers so they can get my cost basis. Fuck Vlad
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I did a partial transfer (just my gme shares) and it took a little less than 2 days.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Transferred to TDA a few weeks ago. Only took 3-4 days for RH to close partial shares and transfer whole shares and cash.

However, I still do not have cost basis info, which is annoying. I'm afraid to make many trades and have my cost basis cemented in my 1099 as $0."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was told to transfer then told by the same guy that his transfer failed and all his shares were lost in limbo. Yeah, no thanks. As long as they don’t remove the sell button during this, RH holders should be okay. I definitely don’t want to risk LIMBOing my shit."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,The squeeze is still gonna happen ? 🙃🙃
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm stuck with RH until this is all over. I've had a TD account for years. But I'm worried Vlad will pull some cuck shit and screw me over again. 😒
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The hedgies want the apes to sell.  They don't like it that so many people want to hodl.  They really, *really*, won't like it if RH won't let apes sell."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I transferred the same day as you and mine was completed yesterday morning. Beware of this trash boomer app though.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Started the same transfer yesterday.

Fidelity says the 29th

🤷‍♂️"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Whoa what? My transfer to fidelity said it would be completed on March 11 but the tracker says it’s still waiting on Robinhood to complete it...
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,true
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"From what I've read from various redditors when the RH migration was in full swing, is that if you call Fidelity, they'll get you fully setup while you're on the phone. May take a little while, but everything I read was positive aftermath.

Fidelity has customer service, and it's pretty good. Also, they know they're getting a TON of new users migrating off of RH, and they're not letting the opportunity pass them by. Lotta folks on here were getting the $75 RH transfer fee reimbursed to their Fidelity account too... but idk if they still do that (can't hurt to ask)."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s funny seeing all apes turn into a herd of cows circle jerking each other. I hate what happened on 01/28 and had some good looking loss porn but the blame lies with the big financial players and regulators (looking at you DTCC). 

All these retarded ape brethren literally giving their trendies to the larger financial corporations who are even shittier underneath the surface layer lmao"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't get too worried it took me like three days and I never got a notification from Robinhood. 

The only thing that I like about Robinhood is there ability to dollar cost average in at very low sums. I have a whole trash & trains portfolio on there where I just put a dollar in everyday into like 30 stocks.  Yet to see a service like that out of any broker...but also fuck robinhood."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I started my transfer on Wednesday and it just showed up yesterday
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Last week...     
      
Lmfao. Three or four years late, but better late than never."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"My fidelity transfer came through after 3 days, including weekend but I only transferred the one stock that matters.

You won't be left behind. squeeze will last days"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds like yer lookin to get out of those 147$ shares mate
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop blaming Vlad for your own stupidity.... you transferred your account based on tin foil hat RH-anon theories. Who would do that knowing rhat shit will always go tits up with RH? Why not wait for it to be over? #APE
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I tried to do this in January and it got canceled after waiting a week. Eventually I sold and rebought elsewhere
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,So you’re saying GME is rocketing on Monday? Is this financial advice?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You had 2 months to do this. If you missed the squeeze because of this, you could really only blame yourself. Fidelity transfers should be 2-3 days."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've posted this elsewhere:

For people transferring from RH to Fidelity...make sure to downgrade from RH instant (default account type) to a Cash account first. Otherwise your shares will likely be on margin and things get slowed down with the transfer. You also run into the possibility of being blocked from selling those margin GME shares (until you deal with customer service to convert to cash shares) in Fidelity since Fidelity defaults to a cash account when you open it.

I have a cash RH account and started a transfer of 1/2 my RH GME shares to Fidelity at 3pm on Thursday (3/18) and the shares showed up in Fidelity today (3/20). Super fast!

If you look at your portfolio in your RH account info, there should be a pie chart that depicts your investments. If there's orange, you have some shares on margin. Additionally, I've read that just being on an Instant RH account could result in Fidelity tagging your shares as margin.

(EDIT)
Here is the email I sent support@robinhood.com that resulted in successful downgrade to a Cash account:

Hi!
My name is LadiesLoveMyPhD, my account username is @XXXXXXXXXX, and my account number is XXXXXXXXX.

I would like to downgrade to a traditional Robinhood Cash Account.

I can confirm that I have $0.00 in unsettled funds and no pending transactions.

The reason I am downgrading to a cash account is to prevent myself from spending too much time in the app. Knowing things have to settle first is better for my mental health.

I understand that I might not be able to re-upgrade to Robinhood Instant at a later date.

Thank you for your help! LadiesLoveMyPhD"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,i also did the same and see the stock in fidelity now. not sure if anything is left to process but i can see it so that's good! hadn't thought to check until i saw this thread. thought it was going to be at least Wed...![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|feels_good_man)
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Took me almost 2 weeks last summer. You got lucky
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your account isn't HIS account. There are a lot of variables at play when factoring the time it takes to transfer. 

His account my be more diversified, may have options that weren't closed, may have more capital, etc. 

OP, you'll be fine, but don't expect the exact same results as anyone else."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Initiated a transfer from RH into my Fidelity account on Thursday afternoon, it completed today."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"well shit, I initiated my full account transfer today - RH to Webull. Hoping to not miss anything, doubt I will - but juuuuust in case I do: Does this offer extend to other apes? :)"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I also transfered out on Friday, ngl, I am terrified of missing the squeeze."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,My shit has been in transfer limbo since the end of February. I’ll probably be good but it’s good to see guys like you around
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ll do the same , just dm me"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Question, what's the reason to switch to cash for your shares? Is it the prevention of loaning them out, or something else?"

Pray for ya monke. 🙏🦍🍌🚀"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This is why I specify the squeeze as a theoretical
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Same here. I spoke to a rep at my local Fidelity office and she said they were seeing a huge amount of transfers from RH to Fidelity last week. Has not stopped me from looking at my Fidelity account every five minutes.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"fun story:
Early February i liquidated all my positions except GME with the plan of withdrawing and moving to fidelity. Robinhood wouldn’t let me withdraw my funds for like a week though and in that time gme began to go on the rise so I dumped all my buying power into gme and here we are now. Dick in hand."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I did a full account transfer once it clears rh will not control a single crumb of my tendies

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Lick my taint vladamir!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve only ever heard good things about fidelity so that’s what I moved to. I’ve heard Schwab is good as well.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I’d rather be in limbo than trust my tendies in robinhoods hands
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn did the hedgies give you a free handy to post this or what
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s because I’m a great writer and captured the attention of the audience with my autism
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Just buy gme and don’t sell it?

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow that’s crazy how much money did you lose

I also got immediately approved for level 2 option trading on Fidelity without even having to put money into my account so something doesn’t add up here"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Let me guess you were offered a free blowie from RH execs to reply with this?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Fidelity lets you trade ah/pm!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Keep your head up bröther 🦍 
Seems like a lot of people are saying their transfers went through quickly. Some other advice I’ve been seeing is just transfer your GME to speed it up"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Called them Thursday around 11:30 an had my transfer completed by Friday
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,they can transfer your shares. but they can never transfer your massive balls
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup, I also transferred on Wednesday, and I checked on Saturday and everything went through. Way faster than I had expected. I only transferred my AMC and GME stocks, because I heard a complete transfer takes longer, so just wanted to get those two stocks out of the way. You’ll be fine!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Mines took about 2 business days also when it moons they shall be halts which shall slow it down plus the hedgies will probably dump on it to slow it down.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a pending dividend (announced) on a stock I no longer own. It’s the only thing that’s pending and the dividend payment is like late April. Any thoughts ?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,How can I tell on Fidelity if the shares are margin or cash?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Were you on margin? Did you do a partial or full transfer?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m pretty sure fidelity will cover that $75 transfer fee. Just ask them. I know they covered one of my friends when they transferred over.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Fidelity should refund that 75 if you ask.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I tried transferring out of Robinhood twice to my Fidelity account and it got held up for a week and then rejected on Robin hoods end.  Called fidelity and they say Robinhood rejected it.  The second account transfer was just rejected and my RH account was never even locked.  Just transferring money out now after each trade.  Bunch of snakes.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Old man gets mad and yells at the wind
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,ah man you shoulda called someone from fidelity and tell them how shit RH is and how the cucks are making you pay $75. I'm sure you couldve persuaded them to cover the 75
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just a heads up, if you're trading on margin fidelity will block the transfer, even if it says it's been processed on their end. After RH finally unlocked my account I closed my margin positions, started a new transfer and it went through in two days."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,There's no fee if your transferring at least $2.5k I think.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,There is no way to transfer fractional shares between any two brokers.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you go about starting a transfer?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah. I moved from RH and b4 I did i sold all partial shares. RH is a shit bird. Took 3 days. So anything longer than that RH is fucking u.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow, you're lucky.  Mine took 12 days.  Although I went to Schwab, not Fidelity."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck, I love the general sentiment. I’ll admit I’m too scared to move from RH. These are mad times. No one knows exactly when the squeeze will squeeze. I know RH sucks. I do not believe they’ll try to fuck around again. That’s my hope. I’m a scared little bitch."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks! I appreciate it. I'm just trying to help calm a fellow apes nerves in case things go crazy
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I already extended it to another ape so why not. I doubt you will either, part of the reason I'm doing this honestly, is that I really just want to help people have peice of mind during such a stressful transfer and act as a little insurance for incentive to get out of RH. Just in case this does become relevant this coming week I will emphasize that I'll need plenty of evidence that you are still mid transfer at the peak, but if it happens I'll try to share as much as I can without infringing on my own financial situation based on how many shares you have transfering that u cant sell."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I believe you will be fine. Even if the squeeze started on monday for some reason, I believe itd take several days to actually peak. But seriously, if something happens, and this thing goes to the crazy heights mid transfer, feel welcome to dm me proof and I'll try to compensate. If this thing even gets close to 10% of what people hope for I'll be set for the next 8 years of my life."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Ape here to fuck Vlad🦍 💎🙌
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah yes thank you very much for the question. This is a great question. Let me start from the beginning when I was a young boy In Bulgaria
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes or no?

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure hope it goes through soon, Ill just buy more gme in the meantime I guess lol"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,They liquidate partial shares as well after ur full shares r moved and account is closed

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn’t mean to imply retail. I’m sure there’s an HF whale that thinks they could make money on it.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Encourage your friends to transfer before it's too late.

It should only take 2-7 days since most people left a month ago. And any squeeze will last considerably longer than that."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Fidelity sounds like the right move thank you. 🦍💎✋🚀🌙
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Fair enough. The next few months will certainly be interesting.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,No but my gme short positions give me POWER.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed now but when I was buying in the summer at $4-6 and selling at $18 it was price points I had set to sell at. After I bought back in at $15 and sold at $30 was when I first became aware of all the fuckery going on and bought back in with all the profits I had made. I just bought stocks I liked. I still like the stock but I’m relatively new, about a 1 year playing on markets. I was told to set sell limits from a friend who does well in the market. Initially just buy things I know like aero, stores I buy from such as gme or companies I buy products from like Mattel, funko (have kids). By summer I started betting that companies would beat covid, broadened aero, cruise ships, movie theaters. I no longer have target sells just keep everything because I also sold magnite. Friend whom told me to set limits laughed at me for gme and magnite. Magnite was first company I researched and that friend who does well thought I was nuts for both of those companies. I no longer reach out to him for stock advice 😂"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"So far I'm going to have to pay taxes on $5,367.59."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It's probably the mass exodus from Robinhood into Fidelity that made my options application take so long. Fidelity website said something like it would usually take less than 3 business days.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t use RH. Also, look at my post history. If I’m a shill, I’m the worst shill in the world. I literally have a screenshot of my Fidelity account as a post.

Webull is a million times better.

Also, suck my balls."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,No
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah I was trying to transfer gme, but they rejected due to an unsettled share i bought on wednesday..ugh"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I just said 500 is the top.  I didnt buy in at the bottom.  I wouldn't touch this trash with a 10 foot pole.  I wouldn't buy GME with your money.  I would rather get mauled by a lion than buy GME.  I would rather hand over all my assets to the IRS than buy GME.  What kind of stupid ass comment did you even write?

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm creeping up on margin account land with fidelity. Got any tips to study for options? Are the even needed to avoid the PDT restriction?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I went through this last week.  Make sure you say your liquidity is 50-100k and your net worth is at least 100k+. Also make sure you have the investment goal setting on your account set to ""most aggressive"" and you have at least 2 years with all investment products.  You'll be auto-approved for level 3 by the algo."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Vlad can transfer these balls into his mouth whenever he pleases
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Per my conversation with Fidelity support, you have to call them to convert the shares to cash"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,In the Fidelity app click account -> position -> select the stock you are interested in -> look for type which should hopefully say cash
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just looked at my account and it looks like they covered mine, I was about to transfer $75 over to RH but looks like it’s not needed. Fidelity is the best!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I think that depends on the value of your account
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol yeah they offered to cover it for me when RH didn't transfer all my account balance at once and caused a margin call from the transfer fee.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,TDA (or at least think or swim) refunds the transfer fee if you ask and provide the statement you area charged.  Required to be logged in to request (website).
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Ask Fidelity to reimburse it and they might do that. Not sure if they take into account the size of the account getting transferred over though
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeh...
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Robinhood is really good at blasting your buns to keep you locked into their platform
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s still just a debit that I haven’t paid, I think I’ll try on Monday"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe I have margin trading turned off
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I did a partial transfer and it went through but the transfer says my account was on margin - except I had turned off margin on RH. I’m super confused about it. Gonna call Fid tomorrow and try to figure it out but any thoughts?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Mine was less than $2k and I got charged the fee but Schwab waived it.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Was on the same boat as you. I had not done any trades since end of January on RH so I did partial transfer to Fidelity on Wednesday aftermarket. Everything cleared on Friday EOD. I only transferred the stock I like and still have little bit of that stock on RH. I might transfer the rest on Monday since it only took about 2 days.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know that feels bro - trust in Vlad right now is fucking terrifying.

(Transferred to Fidelity Wed night)"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I personally don't think the squeeze well happen soon. The HF still got $ to bleed and they ain't about to roll over that easily. 

Got no clue what other cards they can still play but I suspect they'll attempt something before the last straw that breaks them."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I have just started a transfer of half my shares. that way I'm not screwed either way hopefully.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,r/WSB banding together like this is what makes the world go round
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am sure it will be just fine. Part of the reason why I asked this was exactly the same as you: give others a little bit of peace of mind. I waited with my transfer until after the 19th, just in case something did start happening that time. Knowing it is currently ""out of my hands"" is actually a welcome feeling. The next couple days I can be a lot more relaxed about this. I made my decision and I am happy with it."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you fellow ape, I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors. I will hopefully see you at the top"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck Vlad the flaccid dick.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Every upvote to the above comment is a rusty trombone vlad has to personally give to an ape
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Add the $75 transfer fee, so maybe $180?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Which is followed by Monday.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you have any positions you recently opened? I did a full transfer including 2 nok calls I purchased on Monday but my gme has been in my possession for a couple months now
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"On mobile the 0 on the keyboard is right below the reply button, I actually fat thumbed clicking reply instead of typing two more zeroes"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Gotta find some banana scented crayons I bet those are delicious
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea robinhood literally forced me to stay with them lmao
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same here, I heard Vlad didn't even get his grade 10. I don't trust him with my money."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I went to Schwab but only because I had a Roth IRA with them already.  Been happy with them so far.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,The power to get assblasted

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Oooooooof my heart
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey.... fuck you! 
But yea I’m well aware Fidelity’s app sucks nuts luckily my nerd ass sits at my computer all day so I don’t really care"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,What fucking nerds
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I said you take it in the butt
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Reddit profile information checks out. lol
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,The fuckery comes in when you apply for the higher levels.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish I could figure out what to say to get level 2 because I'd like to sell at the money puts in my ira to buy stock in groups of 100 to then sell improbable strike price calls on top get me more thank 6k tendies per year in it.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,They approved me for level 0!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lvl1 options trading on fidelity will get denied on a transfer if u have options open in RH. Mine did, I had to apply for lvl2 for fidelity to transfer my options from RH"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,My full account transfer from RH to Fidelity took exactly 6 days. Initiated transfer the Thursday before the first squeeze and was able to buy and sell again the following Wednesday.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Everything with Fidelity went smooth for me only thing was that I couldn't trade OTC until the extra cash I added settled but thats normal I believe.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Basis some feedback in these pages I did a transfer of just GME in batches ..first lot came through in 24hrs to fidelity..hopefully next lot will come thru by Monday
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't want to spook you or anything but the options MIGHT hold up the transfer. I would first email Robinhood and see if they slow or halt your transfer until the options expire and afterwords call Fidelity and ask them the same. I'm only saying this because my transfer was a day longer than most and I had a call expiring this weekend AND another user on this subreddit said it took weeks for his but he had options expiring a few days before his transfer went through. Again, I'm not trying to spook you, but you need to find out the answer to this question. If all else fails, you always have the option to contact RH to cancel the transfer."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did the same, but only for GME and it went through yesterday."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I wonder if options take longer to transfer?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Only if they were margin when transferred from a previous broker
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't see ""type"". Would it be term? Mine says short."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If Fidelity knew any better, $75 is a drop in the bucket knowing full well they’ll be adding thousands of new millionaires to their user base."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I’m sure a larger account helps. I’m not sure of the size of my friends account but I’m pretty certain it’s under 20k. fidelity has great customer service never hurts to just ask and explain the situation $75 is nothing to retain customers.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I think fidelity will cover that fee for you if you ask
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,When I transferred someone mentioned fidelity would cover that fee. Not sure if they’re still doing it but you could call and find out
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,hello me
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity will reimburse the $75. Just ask them. I also had an issue where robinhood transferred everything on margin bc a lot of accounts in robinhood are listed as a margin account (even if you don’t use margin). Then, fidelity started charging me interest on my margin debit as my account came over piecemeal. So just be on the lookout for this. If it comes over in margin, don’t panic just talk to fidelity. And for gods sake call the margin department at like 11pm. Hold times are insane (1 (800) 343-3548, say margin at prompt). Below is what robinhood replied to me re margin. Fuck RH:

 
“Your Robinhood account is a limited margin account. Some activity that may occur while we are processing your ACAT request, could lead to higher margin amounts than expected being transferred to your new brokerage. Here are a few examples of activities that could possibly cause this: 

Recent transactions (like unsettled sell orders),
Pending bank transfers (In your case recent $700 withdrawal)
The $75 transfer fee or Market movement.”"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didn't have any trouble and Schwab reimbursed me for RH's $75 transfer fee.  I don't think the size of your account matters (at least with Schwab) because my total portfolio and cash were less than $2k.

However, it took 12 days for all of my portfolio and cash to get to Schwab.  It took two sweeps to get it all.  The good news is all my stuff came over the day before the Ryan Cohen announcement and I was able to hop on GME when it was still in the $40s.  The bad news is I only bought five of them.  Still kicking myself."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think I’m in the same place as you. My transfer went, and it shows they’re debiting me $75 - but cuz of margin?  My transfer notes say that my account was on margin except I turned off Margin on RH so I’m honestly a bit confused and pissed. Going to call Fidelity tomorrow and ask if they can help me figure this out."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mans got a Vlaccid Penis,

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,arent you choosing to stay on RH
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Source?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,If u don't have available cash in you acct to.cover the 75 they will debit the connected bank.account
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same on TDA, just a negative balance on your account.  Refunded if you ask and provide proof from the RH statement."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea I have a 75 debit being transferred to my fidelity
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,COOL BEANS
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did a partial transfer of only GME.  That was my main concern at the moment. I did buy some shares on Monday.  Don’t sweat it you made a good decision.  Should have plenty of time.  Thinking about it and all the problems they had on the first go round, they probably want to move your GME as fast as possible so there not on the line when the time comes to cash in."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets, No all my shares of GME were sitting in there for at least two weeks before I initiated the transfer
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,♥️

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I went through this last week.  Reapply and make sure you say your liquidity is 50-100k and your net worth is at least 100k+. Also make sure you have the investment goal setting on your account set to ""most aggressive"" and you have at least 2 years with all investment products.  You'll be auto-approved for level 3 by the algo."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"When you apply, say you have 6+ years experience trading options and futures and answer the risk tolerance questions appropriately.

If your first application was submitted recently and the answers vary significantly, you may be SOL."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Would make sense in my mind, more things involved etc."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct. By default though, RH is a margin account."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like you are looking under ""tax lot"" instead of ""position details."""
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,And taxes on any earnings. If you do the transfer you don't have to worry about gains
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,If you sell on rh and buy on fidelity you are hurting the 🚀and helping shorts. ACAT won't hurt the 🚀. This is not financial advice.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Winning would be only using half your capital on volatile meme stocks so you could buy in one account and sell in the other at roughly the same time.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Was gonna say this^ (unless of course you have peanuts in your account)
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Meet the *real* me
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,If it makes you feel better I bought one share at 40 then bought more at 155 when I saw it going back up. I’m not good at this “investing” thing

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I think that was my problem and I also forgot to count my 401k in my net worth so I thought I was like just barely positive with my ira and bank accounts and home equity barely offsetting my mortgage and student loans.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,They do. A bank told me they'd use my options positions as collateral for a secured asset line for a down payment on a house...month later they couldn't transfer the options and I was fucked
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks. I was using the website. I used the phone app and I'm ""Cash""!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,most brokers will cover the 75 transfer fee as they want you as a client
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're never out, unless you leave some behind..."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, if it was me (and I did swap recently) I'd take my investment dollars from the bank and put them in a new account.

Then I bought a few gme shares in the new account, and sold in the old account the same number. Repeat with each stock I wanted to keep. Only I did it during a $10 swing in price, so ended up buying at 202 and selling at 212 (which more than covered my commission costs). If I were a lucky ape, it would have mooned during this time but I'm not. 

Then i withdrew the funds from the old account to replace the transferred funds in savings."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,What are gains?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is why I did the transfer and waited. The IRS can get theirs after moon, even if it takes 5 years."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ha ha, too funny.  I'm still learning, too.  I have since bought 12 more shares of GME but now I have averaged up to $174 a share.  However, when it moons, I'll be glad I had 17 shares as opposed to just five.  Might even buy some more on Monday!"

They also said that the transfer would take 2 to 3 business *weeks.* fml. 

Maybe it would be faster to open up an account with fidelity and then transfer??

I'm curious, does anyone have any experience with Vanguard?"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look at the options chain for pltr- especially leaps.  It is very clear the market is expecting pltr to run.  It’s been consolidating at the 22-26 range for a while now.  Daily volume is still very high telling me this this stock is getting ready to break out.

Bag holding at 32 and 35"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same here. I am tired of watching, buying and selling stocks. There is one stock which is obviously the best pick. Holding 4740 PLTR and 1 gme share."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"PLTR is going to do some interesting shit long. Biggest problem right now are folks who wanted to short term blitz like GME and got in expecting that -- then get mad when nothing happens.

As long as expectations are set early on she's going to stay in the mid 20's for a while and slow burn...it's all good. Hell, I'm thinking about writing a few LEAPS and just letting her soak for the next few years (look at the 23 options chain...someone is really expecting her to ramp in a few)."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is what im doing with $BB . Wanted short term, started researching and found out its long term. 

Serious question. Better to write Leaps and forget about it, or write weeklies?"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Since when is buying the stock a YOLO.

Putting everthing in one stock is a YOLO. It's idiotic. 

^(let's just ignore that 80% of my portfolio is in AMC right now, I'm a retard too ok)"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"its a high volatility stock. I consider stocks on a highly speculative growth company on par with options on a megacap.

&#x200B;

also, honestly, you guys need to wake that that word is out on options. There is flagrant market manipulation going on; even when youre right you still lose"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Well technically it is we just not suprised cos we expect it to moon...but yes if I was him I would rather buy 2023 Leo’s to get even more Tendies
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,What are ur strikes on. The leaps ??
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"> What app is this?

that's just RH, isn't it?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Jealous of that entry point
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Got some at 23.40 roughly for long term
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You must’ve never held a bag to think that’s bag holding 😂
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This isn’t bag holding dumb ape 🦍

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This year? How r my 6 PLTR @1.89 $50C Aug 21 looking lol
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell some covered calls and put these shares to use
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Happy cake day dawg
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,See you on the other side brother🥂
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It was just at 27 last week lol. 30 when things recover🚀
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Well that would be green.... I’m ok with that.

and with over 400 shares, you can keep selling 4 sets of covered calls against them to get some kind of return while you hold.

my last set (300 shares) just expired on 3/19 with a $35 strike that i got around $120 for. planning to something in that same $35 strike range tomorrow with a 2-4 week expiration depending on how the premiums look."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Two sides to every coin really

Selling weeklies to the rest of us morons will give you a better chance at keeping the premium while having less reinvestment risk moving forward if you want to buy back in if assigned, but that premium will be lower since extrinsic value is lower and the chances of the contract being itm at expiry are slim.  

Selling leaps grants you an ass ton of premium now that you can use to buy more shares, something else, or hookers. The downside here is if those leaps are itm anytime relatively soon and it keeps going up you cap your upside unless you buy them back at a big loss. But, if you sell the leaps for a price you wouldn’t mind selling the stock anyway, then no real sweat to it bc in the end you still sell for the gain and keep the premium."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Write weeklies. Time value decay on options greatly accelerates as you approach the expiry so you will generally make more money writing a bunch of short to medium term options than writing a single option way out
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,🤣
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure it is fluctuating currently. It is a GROWTH stock. Hence why i made the joke about this post belonging on the investing sub. 

And OP tagged this as a YOLO, last i checked you can sell a stock at any point even past a given exp date say like an option which would be a yolo. 


And yeah, there has always been market manipulation. Remember '87, 01, 08, 20&21. Pepperidge farms remembers."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,06/17/22 45c. I picked them up when pltr dipped down to 21 a couple weeks ago.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,if they're EVER near ITM sell immediately
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,U must’ve bought this when we was in the early 30’s but yeah it might hit $50 by August if ur lucky 😭😭
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"What would you sell them at, in order to collect the juice but not miss the launch?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s an interesting case of loss aversion psychology. You consider a loss when the number turns red to be more real than a loss when the number is green but smaller than if you hadn’t sold the cc.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thats what i was thinking. That im selling time each week. 
Its riskier, but should net more."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,question about writing calls - I was trying to write a call contract on robinhood and it said i needed to have a balance in cash in my account. why would i need to keep a balance in my account to write a call?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Very fuccin smart fellow palantard..see u in the other side
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"> RH?

robinhood"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"He has 400 shares (enough for 4 contracts), which means he could sell 1 or 2 covered calls and still launch."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,How would it be riskier?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"First of all, get off Robinhood.

Second, are you writing covered or naked calls?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"oh right, thanks"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Each week you have the chance of getting assigned. A short bit of volitility can fuck you.

For example $rkt was constant for a long time and then jumped up the moment i wrote an iron condor on it.

It eventually flattened out again but i was fucked because that week it was volitile"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah i know but i had so much on robinhood before the GME shit and don't really want to pay the transfer fees to somewhere like webull

it would be covered calls. i own enough to write 3 contracts"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"But you can adjust the delta at which you want to sell the calls every week, whereas if you write a single further out call you're stuck with whatever delta that call happens to have at any given time."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol. You don't transfer to Webull, you transfer to a real brokerage, e.g. TD Ameritrade or Fidelity or Charles Schwab or Tasytrade, and then THEY cover your transfer fee if you ask them to.

If they're covered, I don't know. You'll have to ask RH, but as I understand that's impossible."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"He's saying if you write a weekly at the delta you want and something explosive happens that week you are in more danger because if it stays up or down for that week you lose, where a longer deadline allows it to go back to normal."
2021-03-21 00:40:11,wallstreetbets,I’m just waiting for my tendies to cook 
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,What the hell 1200 shares.  Me sitting with 205

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,What is stock is this
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s what she said
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree. I think it will rise organically and there will not be a squeeze. The squeeze would be a bonus. Profits are starting to come in. Let's wait and see. I certainly see 20 on the horizon.
2021-03-21 00:26:47,wallstreetbets,"Me trying to ""perfectly"" time buying the dip "

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep. This is me. 1000 dollars later and I said screw it.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL I CANT BELIEVE I WATCHED THE WHOLE 2:50 OF THIS.

APE???

Also, anyone cant stop staring at the number going red and green?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought the dip was $300 in January and $270 now and I bought at both. Both times it never went above those prices again. So when I buy, you run"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Good to see some people are learning that timing the market is a bad idea. I learned the hard way too.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This shit deserves an Oscar or Grammy or whatever the fuck award the richies like to give themselves
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Heck yes. Cleared half the positions in my one account to make room for GME and used it all when the price was last at $290 so I’ve been pretty stoked ever since
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"BRO

how does wsb consistently have the most accurate, specific, fresh memes, all the time. thats why this sub is so good. so many GOOD fucking memes out of such a secluded point of interest"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m retarded so I buy GME as long as the price isn’t over 69,420 because I also eat crayons and can’t afford that price."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao this is why I set limit orders at 5% down for every dollar for a $20 range when im going in again. I mean this past two weeks....Prior to that this is the exact representation haha like first buying in at $300. Fuck it. Its all a dip at this point haha.

Hell yeah! 

Actual autisin view of next week? Look around.

Ps, I may have found a way to tell that AMCs ticker runs almost the same as GMEs on days without latter attacks.


From my findings , AMC is slightly quicker and you may be able to see the full dip before it happens on GME depending on volume.

But never mind all that, ill bring this up later.

I'm just happy I'm finally able to say this shit."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"What was the lowest dip for today? How is it actually fluctuating on a day to day basis?

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You didn’t buy the dip at $40 last month when the stock was crashing but you’re willing to buy in at $200. Y’all not being serious
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,When it showed the dead body??
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,What's the name of this show/movie?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well great, now I have to remember the name of the British comedian who plays the starter even though this was shot 30 years ago based on his age."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s called “Big Train” (1998)
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,The only difference between me and this guy is my Velcro shoes.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This is also me :)
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Accurate!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It ends at $69,420.00. Nice."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is Soo fucking me except I keep thinking I'm buying the dip then it drops for its daily morning dip and I feel stupid. But hey I am stupid, I'm here on a rollercoaster to the moon  🚀"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Anything under 300 is a dip... JUST BUY AMD HODL
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,🦍This is the way
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha $69,420.00"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Omg that is me🤣🤣🤣bought 2 shares at $222 and then it started to drop and never go above it.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,instructions unclear. i bought the dip at $347.50.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Whew. The ape thing... man. It was funny like, the very very first time I saw it. Every single time after that, wham, lame and dead unfunny forced meme. Let's try to rein that in, yeah?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,And if you insist on trying to time it. May as well keep trying to time it. No harm in loading up the bag.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't buy on a dip.  The best way is to buy regularly on a monthly or weekly schedule.  Eventually all will even out and you will generally be ahead.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Question, when will this shit skyrocket again, i want to see the news that day, and watch people blame you without fundaments for a matrix fail that is their fault"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just buy when it gets back down to a low resistance level and hope it holds. Don't buy because it looks like it is going back up if there was already a lower resistance level that is likely to be retested, and especially with options don't ""chase"" increasing prices when you are already late to the rally unless you plan to sell literally 30 seconds to a minute later."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,When you figure out why financial advisors recommend 'dollar-cost averaging' lol
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Makes 100% perfect sense to me
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I swear this actually works so well I have a hard time buying more than 1 share at a time. And then of course miss out on the juiciest of dips.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,A friend of mine and me actually did this a couple of days ago. We were incredibly 'lucky' to buy like 1/3 share at two peaks 10 minutes apart
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,hopefully u don't pay comissions
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,The struggle is real 🦍

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Im trying the method but I buy high hoping it goes up baby. It hasn't worked but I'm stupid so I'll keep trying
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Something like that
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same here, I buy it drops"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"But 1, watch it drop, then buy 100."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't do that, then you'll crash the entire market.

This is not economic stability advice."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You have this power too!?!  If you lend me a share I'll sell one and then you can sell whenever it finishes mooning.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Price doesn’t matter
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,How low are your transaction fees that you can go a single share?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Some days.. hmmm. I'll just setup some buy orders at 20, 25, and 30% down and some sell orders at 30, 35, and 40% up.  Good for 60 days.

Broker, after I come back from lunch: Dear Retard, In the last hour you executed 4 trades of the same stock, do it once more in the 5 days and we'll call you a day trader."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Too impatient for that.  Market value time 😎
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Limit order.

To execute this what I did last time was to stagger the buy order to average down.

Started with a retarded position at 283. Having noticed that the share keeps on dipping, I distribute my purchase order at 150, 120 and 90. Of course, it dropped down all the way to 40, but I was already left to eat nothing but grass and sky juice. So yeah."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Tis the way
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Can that be done on stash?

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Never sell, like really all you have to do is hodl and buy more if you can. Not that hard."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"> i panic sell

Well there's your problem. You wouldn't panic sell an investment house you're living in just because the value dips in any given week, so why would you panic sell a stonk. It's because you think the stonk is money you're losing, but it's not. You only lose it when you panic sell the dip or when the company goes tits up, same as you might lose a house if it burns down. If you consider your stonks like houses you're living in, then it's not money it's an investment house of stonks, so it means fuck all if it dips a bit. Just live in damn house and improve it over time. Stonks go up, then you sell the house.

Of course the house is a casino in this case and you can't actually live in it, so only bet what you can afford to watch burn down and this isn't financial advice."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hello, me"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine panic selling. DISGOSTANG.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Ever since last year when all brokers over here went free for trading shares I buy just few shares at a time. Before that in 2018/2019 those trading fees of $6 did eat into my tendies but not anymore.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Back when it dropped to around $40 for a number of days I was fairly sure it'd drop a bit lower so I held off.  I clearly can't time shit.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Was it me?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I was sitting and watching as well. No orders but easily would have been +xx dollars per share before it even updated in my holdings
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"limits are great. you need to use charting to help you set realistic limits and not get fucked.

Volume-by-Price indicators are one way of helping with this. My limit was 185 and I got filled at 180.  


\>  You dont know where the bottom is   


true. but you can estimate it pretty well with practice. the goal is not to hit the bottom with 100% accuracy...the goal is to anticipate the swing and get close-ish."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you always use market orders, then you’re giving up the spread. Beyond that, you can use limit orders to take advantage of inherent volatility by setting your limit just below the bid — this will add up over time and many trades.

Sorry to bring info that’s not apish or cheeky. I hope you guys can cut me some slack here."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Make a 3-layer dip of limit buys
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,$ 175  😉
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Nope definately me. But least my 200 buy got triggered
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have felt this pain so many times the last couple weeks. On the plus side, I have been so close to measuring the bottom a bunch of times, good confidence booster."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Dont choose a multiple of 10 number like 170 or 160 as your limit buy/sell. Always go a little bit above your target if you’re buying or below it if you’re selling. The reason is such integers tend to be a psychological target for many people and they keep their limits there. So what happens is it will either move too fast that you wont see it hit that number or market makers will set their limit orders just before the main target. The multiples of 5 are also strong psychological prices but less so than the multiples of 10.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was surprised you can’t set a buy limit which is above the current price. As in: I don’t know how low this will go, so I want to buy just after the bottom of the dip and I can keep moving the limit down as it’s dropping. Seems like a missing feature to me."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You guys are weak. Just set buy limits every $5 down to $5. You won’t miss the dip!

I intelligent ape!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Somehow I was able to score that day as I put my limit to 172.58 😆
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actually no. I tried to set a limit order at $100 on Thursday with Wells Fargo so I could hit that dip, and they wouldn’t let me set it at less than 50% the current market  price. I was $4 too low. Lame."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,>A lot of the same post
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a wrinklestick that helps me sometimes
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup, set a big buy at $108 a little while ago, it wasn’t dipping so I bought in at $147.

Next day if dipped to $90 I think?

Ah well, still making money once we moon."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jesus, trigger warning pls?"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,So the goal is to average down as close to zero as possible? 😆

Dragged in the clip, then just went with the flow. The boyfriend on the mind was a late addition, but I thought it kinda fun. The idea that he’s not really paying attention to the stonk dips because of the wife’s boyfriend."

2021-03-21 00:17:05,wallstreetbets,"Siren Song of the Marketpocalypse As you know, WSB posts around timing market corrections and crashes have a… notorious history. Some have made us millions; some have destroyed portfolios. But I just CAN’T resist hammering out this DD. Maybe I was born with bear blood.

I present to you my thesis as to why the market is looking vulnerable to a correction in the next months, and why the new challenger—bonds—presents a significant downside risk.

\--

**Exhibit A: Enormous market inflow of new, paper-handed money**

Last week we saw a record $56.8 billion flow into equities. That amount is staggering, and much of it is no doubt due to the Biden Bucks landing in bank accounts. That new money to the market with terrible cost basis is weakly positioned and notoriously paper-handed.

**Exhibit B: A new challenger enters the ring: Bonds.**

I can hear you retards whining about it now. “But I don’t give a shit about bonds, why are they even relevant?” Yes, these are your grandparents’ bonds. They also make up a significant portion of 401ks, pensions, and endowments. This is BIG money. These funds go through a quarterly rebalancing where they sell-off what is high and buy what is low. I expect a massive amount of profit-taking in tech and overvalued industrials as those funds seek to lower risk, rebalance, and take advantage of the juicy higher yields.

**Exhibit C: We are again at historic P/E multiples**

Back in the old days, the value of a company was a factor of its earnings and future earnings potential over the next several years. It’s no secret that stocks have completely left regard for fundamentals long ago and are instead priced as speculative instruments. Take TSLA for example. To make its valuation make sense they would need to have a 100% market share. Maybe they will be selling forty-thousand-dollar cars to millions of kids in Africa next year, and I just missed that at the shareholder meeting.

Current P/E rates on the S&P are touching 40 on average. In 2000 we briefly touched 44.

**Exhibit D: The bond market likes to get cute and crash stock markets.**

Many crashes have been proceeded by a rapid rise in bond yields. Now, I hear what you’re saying, JPOW announced the FED won’t let them get too rowdy. I absolutely do believe that, and I don’t think we are going to see another black Monday when an overvalued equities market was met with a sudden spike in bond yields. Again in 2018, we saw another decent correction driven by an increase in bond yields.

Now, I’m not fighting the FED on this one. I do however think we are overripe for a juicy correction, and this is the perfect catalyst to set it off. As we get into 2-2.5% yields on the 10-year-note, quite possibly in the next month or so, we are going to see some money moving. There’s just no way around that, and we already see it happening with the high-flying tech and the QQQs. A lot of that money found shelter in value stocks, which are now rising parabolically like growth stocks. You can see where I’m going here.

**My play:**

As I’ve been burned trying to time these things in the past, I’m loaded up on longer-dated puts on SPY and QQQ. If we see a parabolic spike in SPY this week (as we did with ALL the corrections on the run-up this past year) I’ll look to be adding to these positions. Also keeping plenty of dry powder for buying opportunities when the correction ensues.

Positions:

QQQ 5/21 270P

SPY 5/21 380P"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have a lot of coworkers talking about stocks, and which ones have made them decent money past two years (all of them) I’ve tried explaining that this rise to P/E of 40 is equal to a 2.5% ROR, and if we correct down to 5%, that’s cutting the price in half. They don’t like that answer, they want to make money, not lose it, no way Apple gets cut in half, it only goes up."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree with your two catylsts for bear markets, but I think we need to consider what a full scale reopening would do. On the one hand I bet sending would skyrocket, but then people would also use their newly found stock earnings to fund it.... 

I don't know which is more likely"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Upvoted simply because this was legit DD and not the thousandth retarded post about how ""GME iS gOiNg tO dA mOOn, $800 iNbOuNd *tHiS* wEEk (fOr ReAl tHiS tImE)!💎👐🚀"""
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Longer dates are better IMO because I think the next correction will be higher highs and lows than historical bubble bursts. I think we'll breeze past records.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"As is tradition we must wait until 3 doomsday posts reach the front page, and once they fail, then it shall be time"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I get distinct dotcom vibes lately, the vibe has died down in the past few weeks despite the chorus of certain stonks, but it's not gone. I suspect any correction will be rocky -- as things stand."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"That new money to the market with terrible cost basis is weakly positioned and notoriously paper-handed.

I think this is the most compelling sentence in the whole thread.  Great post brother."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good hedge is to buy steel stocks. Commodities will be going up and have already started. Look into purchasing MT or CLF or other steel companies, those two are vertically integrated and will benefit the most from the rise of steel prices. 

Just google steel prices and you’ll see plenty of articles confirming the unexpected continued climb of steel prices."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I’d say the reason this analysis is probably wrong is because those rising rates are likely due to increased inflationary expectations vs. rising real rates. If you look at yields on TIPS the yields are still shit
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"market drops a bit and everyone turns bearish and talk crash 

you eventually going to be right but donno then if you could keep shorting along the way 

&#x200B;

the problem with stock market is, it goes up like 90% of the time, if anyone trades commodities or forex would understand what is my point here; you keep shorting and losing money until you give up and then it turns to downtrend and you wait or keep buying until it turns back up. 

if you are bearish on QQQ and SPY and your price target is 270 and 380, where you might like to buy (or lower), please sell put at those levels or sell calls OTM calls, the cash flow will be small to your account but it will keep coming until it doesn't 

not a financial advice, my wife just came back home from her boyfriend's place and she couldn't walk, brings tears to my eyes"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Based off your positions, I am guess you are predicting a crash within the next two weeks? Otherwise, I would recommend rolling those puts out further, so Theta doesn't kick your ass."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,When does P/E matter again? Is my question
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Real question: didn't we just have a ""marketpocalypse"" with covid? Or do external events like that not factor into the boom/bust cycle of markets?"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't know how much the reopening is going to seriously boost the economy. Yeah, middle class is doing well and they will spend, but the middle that was struggling or maybe dealing with debt, or lost their jobs will still be struggling. Unemployment is still really high and there are a lot of people who are going to have back rent due. I'm expecting a lot more evictions which could lead to a spiral.  Just my 2 cents."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because a large contingent of investors watch it, and they have a longer investment timeline than the other tribes.  Combined effect is that over longer periods they tend to be right."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but they papered over it by printing a metric crap ton of currency. It really should have been much worse. My thesis is that they didn't fix the problem with their actions, they just kicked the can down the road. 

Covid just exposed an issue building in the markets, I believe they weren't allowed to play out. The major contrarian risk here isn't of a correction (it has to happen) but whether we melt up or down."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,There’s quite a few things propping up the market right now. If you’re watching March Madness you’d see commercials literally hawking $QQQ.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This year both SPY and QQQ showing a lot of momentum loss and weakness in the technicals.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree, but I think its a good thing. There won't be a market crash, but there will be a sector specific series of correction over the next months/years."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think we will see a popping of all the bubble crap.  EV, ARKK, SPACs, etc.  I doubt we will see a dot com level crash on big names like Apple and Microsoft ever again.  30% is the max percent down I ever see the big names going in a crash and that will get bought up immediately just like the covid crash.  Even without QE infinity."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree, there are challenges ahead that we’ve been largely putting off with stimulus and bandaid policy. Things will undoubtedly get better this summer, but it won’t be all smooth sailing."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"True, I just know of a lot of people coping with isolation are planning more expensive trips with the money they didn't spend but to say they will set the general trend would be a lie for sure.

For instance a lot of my coworkers were Covid denyers and spent nearly the same or more money during this whole event (mostly on healthcare and over priced beer buckets). 

At this point I almost has as much faith in OTM 0dt spy puts as my investment research."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Reading an article is not DD, nor is hope, I agree. I do my own on GME, but it technicals are so far off, that all I can say is 6.5 bil in revenue for a 163 bil revenue industry during a pandemic isn't bad. Especially considering the last 10 yr rev. peaked at 10 bil. The main bear bet is that it isn't Amazon. But if I buy a game from Amazon, I can't even get a discount. So might as well get up and get the kids to GameStop. Digital copies are alright, But I'm not buying them from Amazon, or Gamestop without a discount. So do I think the founder of Chewy can change Gamestop and get it's revenue to 14 bil? Well Chewy is a $6.5 bil rev company in a 86 bil rev industry. I'm personally loading up or averaging down under $200, and then sitting on my hands with GME"

2021-03-20 23:54:26,wallstreetbets,"British American Tobacco ($BTI/BATS.L) - Riding the Altria ($MO) Momentum **Oi, why don't yew yankee wankers buy up some $BTI (not investment advice), so I can send the bird and her new BF on holiday. She's going to give me a proper bollocking if this goes tits up.** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ugzs426t58o61.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=e75f1b777dcb0e559e525301b0200ddd7a76983b

**BRITISH AMERICAN TOBACCO:**

They sell tobacco. They sell cigs (Newport, Camel). They sell vapes (Vuse, Glo, Velo) . They sell snuff (Grizz). The business model is extremely simple and has been a cash cow in the traditional tobacco market. Still beaten down as investors shift away from cancer in a stick and move to 50x price / sales companies. As investors start to worry about inflation and shifting to value, you're looking at value stock #1.

&#x200B;

**FUNDAMENTALS:**

Not going to spend a ton of time here as everyone knows tobacco stocks are cheap and i know all you lads don't really care about them. (also these are multiples from Friday 3/12).

EV / FWD EBITDA: 8.4

Price / Forward Cash Flow: 6.8

Price / Book: 1.0

Dividend Yield: 8.0%

$BTI is legitimately is 10 - 20x cheaper than all these tech darlings which is understandable, but maintaining this business model is simple. CAPEX is minimal and they maintain complete pricing power. Okay, well all this is obvious, so why should $BTI move up? Enter Altria (**$MO**).

**THESIS:**

* **My main thesis is that the move up in tobacco has already started.** $MO is showing strength for the first time in years. Go search for $MO on twitter and you'll find a bunch of **stick-men (technical analysis)** analysis like this:

https://preview.redd.it/8rmw9ttxd8o61.png?width=1186&format=png&auto=webp&s=d50d47e6c81b34313f26742a97777d914d2721e0

I have a piece of the $MO run-up  (not to brag), but am shifting those tendies to the better value, $BTI. I still like $MO a lot and think that the confluence of stick-men, your divvy crew, and overall lack of ""cheap"" stocks are contributing to the run up of tobacco. Now that the runway is clear, other tobacco stocks should follow ($IMBBY,  $PM are comparable if you're looking for other industry plays).

(Side note: the $MO play is straight out of the Michael Burry playbook, and may his soul rest easy after selling both $GME And $MO early. I bet his soul is resting easier after his $C calls are most likely waaaay in the money. if you are a frequent visitor, Michael, please feel free in joining me in $BTI so that you may relieve the pain of selling $MO too early).

Back to your regular programming. When you stack the performance of $MO vs. $BTI when the pandemic started, you get:

https://preview.redd.it/ab0o4l8e78o61.png?width=1084&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1041280bb39f87b988c05ec5a91a6359e1b144e

$BTI clearly lagging after trading in tandem for a few months. This divergence has dramatically increased over the past month. Now you may say that $MO deserves to trade higher and that it must be related to performance, right? Nawww, **$BTI has outperformed $MO on a per share fundamental basis the past few years, yet still trades cheaper.** The pure strength of their combustable market is incredible. 

https://preview.redd.it/bv9m37e0e8o61.png?width=874&format=png&auto=webp&s=78dc47910d38d8c6d9ecdf827adbb8534730038a

Seems like these should could trade closer in price, no? I have a theory or two in the risk/other section, so go check that out. Anyway, I think **\*both\*** trade higher and lift each other. Tying this all together: **My thesis is that I'm expecting $BTI to follow the $MO move and break out of its choppy zone. You'll then start to see the divvy crew and stickmen start to post about how they're adding for income or that they ""trade the chart and not the stock"".** I'll feel rekt about this if $MO reverses, so if you've gotten to this point and hate the idea, the opposite side of this whole thesis is to buy puts on a $MO reversal.

&#x200B;

**OTHER TAILWINDS:**

* **Fears of inflation?** **(Skip this bullet if you don't like economics)** You're looking at one of the most demand inelastic products on the market. People have bought tobacco and will continue to buy tobacco for years to come. There is no better place to look at this moat than with Australia (where a pack of cigs is 5x more expensive compared to the U.S.). In the past 10 years tobacco prices have doubled, yet demand has decreased by 20-ish percent. They have complete pricing power, or an economists wet dream. I'm not here to FUD you to death about how inflation is going to wreck the economy, but price increases are already here. Go look at any relevant commodity/house price/vapor ware chart and you'll see inflation baked in. $BTI has complete pricing power.

* **Growth exists for vapes**, and seem a bit undervalued after the JUUL disaster a few year ago. BTI is looking to triple their vape segment to $5B by 2025. If this was a pure tech company you could throw on a 50B market cap by that volume/percent growth alone (i know this is not comparable, but I will still keep harping on it)

&#x200B;

* **Ride the cannabis wave.** $BTI recently bought 20% of Canadian cannabis/CBD company Organigram $OGI. Would have loved to see this in 2018/2019 during the true downturn in weeeed, but these acquisitions are positive imo. A low key benefit to acquisitions in the space is that they can strike out a few times without crippling the business. Must be nice to have billions of dollars of free cash flow with small relative CAPEX [https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/21/03/20123796/bat-invests-175-7m-in-organigram-to-work-on-next-gen-cbd-products](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/21/03/20123796/bat-invests-175-7m-in-organigram-to-work-on-next-gen-cbd-products)
* **They are literally making a covid/flu vaccine and the irony here is next level.** You can't think of a better way to ~~create more nicotine addicted customers than injecting it straight into their veins~~ change the narrative about tobacco as an ESG plant. I guess there is a real precedent here as they've successfully used this tech for ebola. Anyway, not sure how this plays out in the long-term, but it seems like a net plus. Currently in phase I trials, I imagine successful results headline could give the price a bump. No idea when they'll announce results, but phase I trials started in December. [https://www.bat.com/group/sites/UK\_\_9D9KCY.nsf/vwPagesWebLive/DOBWBPMP](https://www.bat.com/group/sites/UK__9D9KCY.nsf/vwPagesWebLive/DOBWBPMP)

&#x200B;

**THE TRADE:**

* **Calls are cheap.** Like 20% IV cheap. $MO moved 20% over the past one to two-ish months and a similar move in $BTI could result in massive gainz, depending on the strike/date. The price on these bad boys are simply too cheap. I currently have been easing into calls with dates and strikes: **4/16 40, 6/18 40 and 45.**

&#x200B;

**RISKS/OTHER:**

I will tell you though, that even though i may lie on the spectrum, I'm not blind. So that you don't obliterate me into being completely biased, I have a few reasons why **$MO** has outperformed and other general comments:

* Respective Index performance: The **U.S. indices have massively outperforming the U.K market** and their stock prices are moving more in line with the index.
* **$MO has investments in beer/liquor from Anheuser Busch.** Some armchair analysts think they should sell that position as they are eligible to sell later this year. 
* **Both have shitty balance sheets** packed with oodles of goodwill from all their acquisitions over the years. $BTI has a worse debt load (Reynolds acquisition) compared to $MO so their capital allocation is less flexible (also why they earn more?). This has allowed $MO to start investing in share buybacks.
* **You're buying cancer in a stick**. I'm completely aware that large institutions and many individuals won't even look at tobacco as it's the polar opposite to any ESG play. **My mega brain** tells me that this is contradictory to many investing in any ESG plays that actually guzzle oil to operate, literally any fast food/sugar company, or most tech stocks that are melting/stealing (privacy crew, wya?) our brains. **My galaxy brain** tells me that investing in humans is the most non-ESG idea possible, so let's countertrade humans by investing in products that kill humans (was that too dark? definitely went a little dark there).
* There is **beef (lawsuits) between $BTI, $PM and $MO**. $BTI is currently suing the two for patent infringement on some of their vapes. I'm not even going to pretend like this is good or bad news for the company given the length of these timelines and unpredictability of outcomes. There is an $HCMC suit that also files against $PM, but any predicted outcome feels like pure speculation. Someone smarter than me can tell you why this case is positive/negative
* **EX-DIV is next week** at $0.75 per share. The price will trade down post recording. This is always a chicken or the egg argument, so I won't bias you in either direction. Bulls will tell you that the stock price will trade up before as investors buy in before to get the dividend, while bears will tell you owners will dump after the dividend is recorded. No opinion here, but something to be aware of.

&#x200B;

**Summary, TL;DR:**

**You're buying a company that offers a highly addictive product with complete pricing power and free cash flow to the moon. The industry outperforms in inflationary or recessionary environments. Investments in alternative products (vapes, CBD, vaccines) are all niceties and should help the business grow, while the cash cow of tobacco remains king.**

**Their main competitor, $MO  (sitting on a 52-week high) has cleared the runway for $BTI to make a similar move as the stick-men and income investors look for yield in an increasingly expensive market. The implied volatility on these calls are cheap (IV at 20).**

**BS pRiCe TaRgEtS: 1 $MO ($50.55) = 1 $BTI (Currently, $39.27). I'll let the stickmen tell you where it can actually pop to, but I believe these are fundamentally the same company on a per share basis.**

**Positions:**

Higher Risk: **4/16 40C, 6/18 45C**

Lower Risk: **6/18 40C**

**Cheers lads. Decent that, but I'm knackered and going to have a few bevvy's to wind down.**"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"1.5x position MO.  
1x position BTI. 

Already been a run-up in both, so content to hold. Great positions for inflation, as so much cash is in near time periods. Good DD OP."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly I could easily see BTI going back to the 60 dollar range and it would still be undervalued
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for a good article. Sold 20% of my MO on Friday due to the run-up you mentioned. Always good to put tendies in the pocket! I’ll take a look.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m in for some 4/16 40c 🚀🚀🚀
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Complete pricing power?

Excluding regulatory tax requirements which in the UK for example currently make up about 80% of shelf price and increase each year"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I had 10k in BTI for like 8 months last year and it moved like 5 pennies over the whole time. It's a good stock but it's not for adrenaline junkies - it was legit my most boring purchase I've ever made.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Large portion of NW is BTI LEAPS
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice to see some solid DD on Big Tobacco. I have started investing in $MO over the last few months and will continue to do so. Until their recent purchase of cannabis companies, I was bearish on $BTI, but now I'm starting to eye them as part of a solid cannabis portfolio. We still don't know who exactly the major players will be in the US cannabis market but there is no way that Big T will miss out on this once in a lifetime opportunity. I see both $MO and $BTI having solid growth with cannabis legalization."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Trump banned vapemail last year, really shitty. Soon you can't buy any vaping for delivery.

Why didn't these guys stop him"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,for sure. no one BATS an eye at 60.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah, and that’s why pricing power exists. they are able to increase price without demand suffering (to an extent). in fact demand is so inelastic that they’re able to make even more money with price increases offsetting increasing variable costs. at some point they may lose that pricing power benefit, but not in the near future. cigarettes are 5x expensive compared to aus vs the us and the same relationship has held"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"yes, and it's traded it a tight range for a few years. it definitely doesn't have to break out. if $mo hadn't broken out, i would not be in this position."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah, and it's tough to imagine a scenario where they aren't involved. it's nice to see BTI with an initial investment, and nice to see that no one really missed out from not investing in 2018."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Same. Cashed out of GME at the end of January. Went from 100% GME shares  to 95% MO shares. (rest in various calls/puts). I’m not disappointed.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It's my hypothesis that the Big Tobacco companies missed out on vaping and were caught unaware at how popular it would be. They really just recently got into the vape market with e-cigs but have been fighting off patent and IP infringement suits. I suspect they simply didn't care enough.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel PLTR is so slow moving compared to many other plays to be in now. I’m still holding 100 shares but contemplated moving it into more GME
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gambling with his money, battery percent, and 6.9% loss, nice."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Shh. 🤫
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Why?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I am considering doing that for my 800 shares (still need to learn a fair bit about CC's) but premium for weeklies is pretty abysmal to be honest.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m in at $31 and have been selling CC myself.  I have a long way to go before I get to break even.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Came here to say same. I bought 300 shares months ago mostly just to sell calls against.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Get assigned, my guy."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,What strike price? How far out?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm sorry 😭
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Everything is slow compared to GME
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This is wallstreetBETS. Plus this is boomer shares. U must be new here.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,That's not true. If you could get Amazon for 15% below the typical analyst's fair value and it dips 50% by some miracle - averaging down would not seem irrational.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn near worthless april 1 30c. -75%
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because they have already signed some large contracts and have backing from some of the largest tech companies. They had their IPO the same time as Asana, and I believe both will be good long term investments."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,No it’s not...you regularly can get 1% on strikes in the 30s for a weekly. PLTR is a spectacular theta farm right now.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I do care about the strikes, I want something close to the money for the right price. $30 is very doable in the near term and once IMT the worry of theta is out the door. It will also appreciate more in value compared to shares. If PLTR hits $30 by May I'll be up 35% or so. Versus 25% with a move from 25 (current) to 30 a share.

You could go as far out as possible on the strike like u/fog_ did with his Disney leaps... that doesn't happen every time (not as smart to see that shit coming). Its all about your risk tolerance, I am a conservative ape. I like to be the monkey in charge of bananas versus hopping for them."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I normally wait for PLTR to get to like 26-27 and sell calls at like 29-30, wait for it to dip and buy them back, repeat as possible. Worst case it goes over and i get called, i get the premium plus at least 4-5 bucks a share. hasn't happened yet."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Whatever strike is comfortable for your cost basis, I typically look for 2-3% on a high IV stock like this. <45DTE to start capturing theta decay. Sell on a green day and buy back on a dip. I don't own any PLTR currently but I sold some 4/16 22p that are doing pretty well."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Divide the principle of your investment by how much you make an hour, spend that time on research, and buy/sell at a price target."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s dollar cost averaging which is completely different. A lot of new traders avg down versus cutting losses and buying back in....it’s pretty simple if you do the math on paper. Avg down is always a terrible ideal
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Holding at 63. I’m not happy but I think selling now would be a mistake. Though I’m a dumbass so make your own decisions.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe i am looking for the prices at wrong place or something? [I have used yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PLTR/options/) to get an idea and for example 31c 26 march is just 0,09? (9usd/100 shares)"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm learning here so this is a real question, not a critique of what you're buying.  I read that buying leaps a little ITM is a better idea because you're better protected against falling stock price, and also you get a better delta.

For $9.25 you could buy 20C 01/2022 with a delta of 0.74.  30C 01/2022 are cheaper at $6.10, but the delta is only 0.56.  With the ITM call you get $0.74 for every $1.00 rise in the stock price, but only $0.56 for the OTM call.

Is there something I'm not considering that favors the OTM leap other than price?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks fellow ape
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"AMC is the only company on earth, with a market cap of 500 trillion."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think a lot of people like the feeling of ""going big"" on a position. They tend not to stagger their buys over time. If they want a $10K position they're in it within a week or 2 (maybe faster)"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It may not be ideal for day trading, but it's a great strategy for a solid investment vehicle. That's why I used Amazon rather than a SPAC as an example."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are right in both cases, its about price and time. Both that you mentioned are good arguments for other possibilities. I am a mixture of waiting to be as far out as possible, price of the call and reasonably OTM. Just my own strategy. 

Long story short this is a casino, we don't buy ITM calls."

2021-03-20 23:04:37,wallstreetbets,"The AMC Stock vote will be a resounding YES on the part of the Majority, and how it affects you. Read more inside. So this isn't a new tactic by a long shot, and this has been around for ages, but it's time we talked about something that corporations and especially boards of directors and large fund managers use when shuffling corporate wealth and influence around during periods of restructuring.

The majority shareholders absolutely want the value of $AMC to go down. Why? They need to buy A WHOLE LOT OF IT.

Of course they know issuing more will devalue the shares significantly, but only for a very short period of time.

Welcome to a second type of short , the inside short. In order for a company to shore up it's own valuation, it will issue large amounts of it's own shares in order to lower it's own price per share. They will immediately snap these up in bulk to hold as much of the stake in the company as possible.

Here comes the fucky part... Ready? When they have these majority cheap shares, and the market is flooded with shares under value, they wait for the company to enter a period of stable growth and profit. There's two things that happen here, there will be FUD, which leads to selloff, and there will be just plain more shares. They will snap up as much of these stocks as possible until things are normal again. This is called a Stock Buyback. That's when they issue what's called a stock reverse split.

The stock reverse split suddenly takes their 200 Million shares and turns it back into a reasonable 20 or even 5 million shares. The value stays the same, but the cost of owning just one share just became a little more difficult to pony up to. This means they maintain their status as majority shareholders, but they also cannot be taken out by a outside investor who is soaking up penny shares on the outside market. Consider that right now, you have a weighted vote in AMC. Now consider how much less of a influence your vote carries when your share count goes from 200 to just 50, or even 5. Sure it's worth the same amount of money, but it doesn't carry the same weight in the company. 200 Votes isn't the same as 5 votes. They've marginalized low end shareholders and shored their positions.

This is how companies control board room decisions and how they ensure that control over corporate direction is firmly in the hands of the people they decide they want it to be. You can't trickle your way into a deciding factor in a major shareholder vote. You are either in the money, or you're left out in the rain.

Edit:

Everyone should remember that a LONG position on this stock may be the best position to take on this. It's not that the stock is doomed, but the MOASS is probably doomed for sure.

AMC saw what happened to GME. They are not in a position to accept becoming the next volatility stock. They're literally opening their doors this weekend. They are not in a position to become a meme when they are about to stabilize their business for the first time after a complete year of lockdowns and shutdown businesses.

Thanks for the Silver. This was my DD. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk: Note. None of this is financial advice. Almost all of us, including me are literally cats.  


Edit 2 :  


So lets talk volume. This is what becomes the most important. I THINK this is what most people fail to grasp. You own 5000 shares out of 1 million, but 10 million come up tomorrow. You are now swimming in a much larger sea. Previously, you were, perhaps a middling to un-fuck-withable predator. Now the sea or lake as you would prefer has gotten much bigger. MUCH MUCH bigger. You are now much much smaller. In order to maintain your size, you must consume a lot more shares and, even though they come cheap, it will cost you that much more money to get back to your previous position. Now you need to own 500k shares JUST to be back to where you started. Growing bigger got much more expensive, and it gets more expensive as the company continues to do well. The longer you wait to get into the pool, the more it costs you.  


This is why they issue more shares and eventually why they drain the pool when they are satisfied with what is available."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Where do you people come up with this shit?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Voting no in dilution, yes on recount. I just like the stock and movies idc what happens 💎 🦍 🍆"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Selling first thing Monday.  If there’s a massive drop I’ll re-buy in and take a larger stake.

I feel like AMC will see a resurgence at least through its first year of being back to fully operational, but the dilution will drop the price in the short term."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,ehhhh....
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,so is holding until the 26th when they open nationally a good idea and should i sell shortly after? i’m 92 shares in on amc and it’s not a lot but for me it’s a majority of my $. i held when it went down to 6 and it’s back up to $13. i was hoping the reopening would create some hype and the stock would go up a bit close to its $19 peak a month and a half ago. what do u think?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"the dilution will not happen with this many people voting against it, why are you bringing this up you little twerp brain?

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,i doubt it. im voting no
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Cats?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"A little of the opposite. The idea is to prevent AMC from becoming the next meme stonk. The board has decided to issue more shares in order to lower it's value just by enough to keep it off the short, but just above the mark up.  


This is a normal tactic in order to prevent big shorts from shutting down companies on the edge of recovery. It's basically a way for them to NOT become GME. No one can admit that GME is realistically worth $200, no matter how much we like the stock. It won't be worth $10,000 if, and when it does hit that. The point is AMC may, MAY not be able to handle that kind of volatility.  


They are issuing insurance. Not profit."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Thought the same.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I learned from others actually. People who ""lost"" or didn't gain a lot of money because they were victims of huge buybacks. I've learned that HUGE ""FUD"" events surrounding companies that are not changing their stock symbols or company names in restructuring are not ""going out of business"".  


They lost money cause they got letters. Physical letters in the mail that caused FUD that made them lose their position and they could have gained 15-3000x their value if they had just held. I hold. I hold until either it's gone or whatever. If all things are considered, why are you putting money into a company you don't intend to own a part of? I mean sure, it's one thing to lick the sweat off of Nike or Intel, but $GME and $AMC literally were struggling and we're pushing them literally back into the biz.   


Never, ever consider that owning stock in a company means you agree with them, but consider that if you want to own stock in a company... It means you want them to be successful. Be aware of how they move stocks, how they issue stocks, how they do biz. That's how ape becomes stronger together.  


Not financial advice. I think I ate a pair of scissors a minute ago."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not being a doomer because I don't like the stock. I'm actually bullish on the stock and I might lose a very good option at this point now that this has come around. This has  fucked me royally on the back end, but I'm just going DD on how this is going to play out on what insider shorts look like. They want it to go down and up again with more shares in the pool. They are now doing the old buyback play and I got caught in the middle of it. I wanted to let you all know how to read the board."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea, naked shorts will be forced to cover and the real squeeze will begin"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Buying calls can lead to gamma squeezes
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct. You should expect the dip and the maturity to rise with the stock. The wash is just a plot for a buy back. The more you own the more you're worth. It's not about gains on the front end, it's about making sure you earn gains on the back end."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Should have bought gme lmao
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It used to be where I would read shit here, not understand it, dive deep and come out more educated. 

Now if I dont understand, it’s likely the OP is speaking gibberish or just a dum dum."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This guy has replied too much on a Sunday morning to not be paid... if he listened to the investors call, he'd know that their primary objective last year was to raise capital to save themselves. This share issuance vote is about bringing in more capital. If the insiders wanted to profit, they'd leave it like gme and use their shares and options but they need cash for debt. Selling shares makes sense when you have strong buying sentiment. Issue shares, take the money, pay down debt. Recovery growth still happens albeit slower and less likely to squeeze dramatically with more shares on the market. Just keep holding and buying."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"They are very protective of the company, despite all things people think of them..."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think this is the goal, yes. AMC is trying to avoid becoming GME. They will throw more shares to avoid going to $300 a share over a bunch of apes on Reddit while not enough shares to fuck the shorts out of hitting the target price.  


It's a question of who hodls and who folds. I am strong bull on AMC, issuing shares in a recession economy is not a typical move for most companies, even ones that have been doing well.  


Not financial advice. Meow."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Unless this triggers a share count in which shorts would have to cover causing the squeeze.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is clearly the most CNBC bot of all CNBC bots.  


What the hell are you even doing here?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You might possibly be, with the exception of the other person who got downvoted to hell, the single most useless person on this sub. I cannot imagine you've ever made a dime in your life on wall st. Pls evacuate yourself out of the wall st. air lock."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"OP was talking about the reverse split.

Going from owning 20 shares to owning 5, but the 5 being the same value as the 20."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Math is FUD!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's a little different. So you went from selling 1 slice for a dollar to selling 2 slices for a dollar, but the difference will be that you get the same slice. The idea is that some people will go half-sies on or cheap out or hold less than what it takes to make up full slices.  


Eventually when you want to make full pizzas again, you end up with very short slices and you either get slices you own or you get paid back for the partial slices you don't. Those slices go back on the market. The idea is that the guy who owns 6 slices has way more influence than the guy who owns only 1

That's why reverse splits are done. They want to reduce shareholder influence in major restructuring decisions. They are doing something and they really don't care what you think. They also might be close to becoming delisted. Companies move their influence in stock up and down to keep themselves afloat on the market. AMC is really teetering on the edge and they are aware that they're a meme stock on opening weekend. If they want relevancy they have to dilute the stock so they can be taken seriously again."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nooooooo.  


Not exactly. It's kind of the reverse boogeyman. Too many stonks, trading volume isn't changing enough and some companies do like a little volatility. AMC in particular needs some volatility. It's been in the gutter for so long and now it's basically on all four legs.  


A reverse split merges all of the stocks issued so that it causes more ""stability"" Issuing stocks causes some instability but also gives the stock some room to float. You can't really short a company that has a excess of stock on the market, because you can't borrow against stocks that don't exist. They exist, and if you shorted them you have to buy them.  


This is a double diamond hand moment really, if we weren't all, all in on GME. If AMC floats a few mil on the market we could snap that shit up so fast. Leave like 100k or less avail and wait for the squeeze; But I doubt it'll ever reach $GME status.  


This is how $AMC avoids the short squeeze and also prevents becoming a meme stonk like $GME. It's a catch22.  They are protecting their brand really. Don't blame them, but at the same time, we wait and see what happens."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"NO. Buy when shares are issued. BUY BUY BUY the dip.  


But only if you like the stock. None of this is financial advice."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Shoring a position against a reverse split is like holding more trees. Eventually when someone asks do you own a tree or two? No mofo. I own a forest.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mind you I don't expect a reverse split for a long time. Probably into next year. If you're shorting $AMC into next year there had REALLY be a problem, like aerosol EBOLA."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It can, if enough of the extra stocks are absorbed so fast that it becomes scarce it will force another short squeeze."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC is not on a bound for demise. Issuing stock is not something a company that expects a downturn would do. It's actually really fucking good. I will do my part and buy the dip. Not financial advice. But that's what I plan to do.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why yes, yes they are. The minority shareholders. Majority shareholders are fine."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I admit nothing I've said is financial advice, but I've been caught in this fish trap before. I've known people who have fallen into this one before. This is a major, major, major red flag when companies do this. Ultimately, yes, it's good. If it wasn't good, their owner/operators would be running for their lives. This is for the wholesale benefit of the company.  


The idea is that this will   


A) Fuck the shorts. It will dip but not dip. Price goes down but your short option is divided in half as well, so you don't exactly get to say ""JEEVES I SAID $6 AND NOW IT'S $6!"". No, they issued more shares and now it's above $6 but gaining, because the shares are getting snapped up like fire.  


B)They roll it all back up later. Meaning they double, triple, or even quadruple it's value overnight. The chessboard is set and they are playing the game."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is both correct and incorrect. Your stock will still rise, but if you're bullish you should buy more of the stock in the wash, just like the majority shareholders would do. Shore up your position and do it at the lowest price possible. Let it gain value in maturity."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It's literally enough to drop the value a few bucks. Not enough to drop it by half. They're not trying to shoot themselves in the foot. They also clearly plan to soak almost all of it up as soon as it hits the market. It's not lost shares.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"...

But it doesn't do anything."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,issuing something of value to yourself is exaclty issuing profit. fuck them all
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your approach to AMC is lumpish 

The company is projecting a large investor that will change the course of AMC and wants their employees to be compensated accordingly 

I'll still vote NO to all because I own shares and want GAINZ

AMC is up 145% in A MONTH and their market cap can be justified at 10X today from $6.99 billion to $69.9 billion.

Bro jump in or be poor"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean this play has been in the cards for close to a week if not longer. We knew a vote for dilution was coming it was talked about. Nothing changed in the DD
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Well they already had to do that right now with the stock count
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Sooo.... hold?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dear lord you're on fucking wallstreet***bets***, retard. This is a high-risk options (and futures) sub. If you don't want options, go to r/stocks."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Already there
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m here to read the extremely rare good DD and the more frequent funny jokes. Your post is so retarded I don’t even know where to start. “In order to shore up its valuation the company will issue new shares to depress the price then immediately snap them up.” Dude. What **the fuck** are you talking about. AMC has issued shares because they need money. They diluted shareholders but avoided bankruptcy. They’re going to buy shares back now? *they don’t have any money*

Also a share buyback isn’t the same as a reverse split. Stop writing start reading and learning."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hmmm I used to be an equity derivs and bonds salesperson at JPM and GS so I made lots of dimes on wall St. Sir, you’re fucking wrong. 😂 Overconfident idiots abound. Good luck out there, I’ll throw some change in your cup when you’ve bankrupted yourself."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have no idea how I could have gotten it so dead wrong. 

Guess I should stop skimming and start reading. Thanks for pointing out my mistake."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Math is raycissss! Get it right, or off to the camps you go!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Attractive prices bring in more investors, sure, but they're already owned by the top companies on the block. This is, from my eagle eyed perspective two moves in one, a short squeeze block and a stock buyback. I think they want to consolidate shares as quickly as possible."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Being over valued is almost as bad as being under valued. Investor scarcity is a real problem if you are a company trying to move capital under the ""innovation"" umbrella.  


Companies that move gas and oil do innovate, don't get me wrong, but they rarely need investors to pony up dough to move the company along. Same with pharma and most general auto manufacturers. They do what they've always done and the money just moves along at a steady pace."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bad move i believe, especially minority shareholder are likely their customers."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's like saying at least  'they won't lower your profits by half'

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You fail to understand,  


That's why I understand, You fail."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"My case is only to expect them to dodge the MOASS and to wedge the retails out a little harder. The stock is just going to get a little deeper. It'll eventually level but until it does you either go long or you play it for what it's worth in the short. I think my 4w Call for 15, with dilution will still stand up. If nothing it'll gain more value.   


Like I've said to others. Issuing stocks is not a loser bet, it's something companies do when they are totally winning. I think we're on the right track with $AMC, I just have doubts that unless we have massive deep fucking investment in the millions or even billions in the volume in the retail market, we will see the sort of MOASS like we wanted out of GME."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I've widened my account just to get into the AMC re-issue. I want to ride this thing all the way up.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,and buy!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,A share buyback always precedes a reverse split retard.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I swear to the fucking heavens if I read another retarded ass comment like this in my life it will always come from retarddit.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Key words. USED TO BE.  


Trust me. You used to be someone. Now you're not. I'm not a fucking last year chump nor am I a former used car salesman. I've been doing this for over 10 years and I know a pigs ear from the mud when I see it."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t see it the same way... I want AMC to succeed but if a company wants to do a stock buyback they don’t announce share dilution. They can just announce a stock buyback. 

It seems to me they don’t want to block a short squeeze, they want to be in a position to capitalize if a short squeeze happens. They want the chance to issue stock if the price balloons. It’s not a bad move but it isn’t good for current shareholders in the short/intermediate term."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not in their eyes. Minority share holders are actually mostly people who have IRA accounts or something similar. Pool accounts. They don't consider those ""shareholders"". They have money in the company but it's just retirement accounts and major companies moving blocks of money around in and out of the company based on quarterly revenue."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly. They fuck us and our social media footprint is massive and it would be devastating for them. They will organically rise and the shares are not being released. It is a cot to have that option on the table. Im holding.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's hedging both sides. Retail investors can't roll the stock into super prime prices that it's worth way above it's actual value... Shorts can't roll it way below it's actual value. In the meantime they just keep dumping shares until they can conveniently roll them all up as if they were on a carpet and just say ""poof"" I have more!  


It sounds dumb and whimsical but managing share price is very much a viable market strategy. Keeping investors from manipulating your overall volume too much is a very wise practice."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is also a viable strategy when companies move into new markets. When Walmart moved into e-commerce (hard e-commerce like amazon style) they actually rolled a lot of stock out and initiated a stock buy back. I had a buddy who should have held, but they sent him a letter with ""price"" and ""offer"" and he took the offer price.  


Stupid. It quadrupled in value in 4 months."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,They exactly want to prevent the squeeze. AMC is trying to not become another MEME stonk. It's a calculated play. AMC is a pretty strong brand on it's own. They don't need to be brought back into relevancy by blowout wall street hedging.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Understand what?

It doesn't *do* anything. It let's short positions close which completely obliterates any prospect of a squeeze i keep hearing about from AMC lunatics and...

Only leaves AMC with its fundamentals which... hoo boy. Are not good."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Poetic, sure, but doesn’t “sloppy seconds” suffice?  No need to start with the misogynistic name calling.."

&#x200B;

difference between buyback and reverse split

&#x200B;

buyback is when the company buy his own share and reduce float

reverse split is give you 2 5$ share for you 1 10$ share, it just multiply the float without changing the market cap (after that market actor react to the reverse split tho)

&#x200B;

edit : just woke up, reverse split is actually inverse, giving you 1 10$ share for your 2 5$ share"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Nope!!!!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Um. I quit and have another job in finance. Dude. Take the massive fucking L. I feel sorry for everyone reading the absolute putrid garbage you’re putting out there. Embarrassing for everyone involved. Bye.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This is embarrassing. The important question is did you feel like a badass while typing it out
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The difference is this is a long play. What you do is issue more shares, but your goal is to soak up a majority of it right away. 2/3 or more. Most of it isn't even on the table until they actually take their piece. They always get to take the first take. If you think the shares are issued just right off the bat that's also a mistake. 100% of the shares are absorbed before they are redistributed to the market. Employees always have the first option to take portions. This is not unfair, it's standard. Even Tina the counter girl who's been working 3 years, if she's earned corporate option can do it.  


Everyone in the corporate chain will flex the option to buy the shares they want. Whatever is left is released to the open market. The overall volume does increase... Doesn't mean the available volume actually does."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Overall this realistically lowers the cost per share, but it doesn't mean the stock loses true value. The idea is it's harder to funk the value of the company and it makes shorts almost worthless, since the volume being sunk into the market becomes impossible to avoid. Shorts can't say they borrowed shares that didn't exist because.. poof. NOW THEY EXIST. They cost a little less, more than your short, but they exist. Pay up pony boy! This is how companies like AMC actually Juice the shorts."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You fail to understand WHY they want to keep the hedges from gaining from a short and all of us from turning it into the next meme stock. That's why you fail.

You don't just get to stick a label on a stock and design it to your liking. They may not want to be your puppet in some big game of chess against hedge funds. In the case of GME, they were literally on the edge of destruction. GME was saved by WSB. AMC was not saved by WSB. AMC will be fine without us."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because you fail to understand the fundamentals of why companies move capital and capital gains. I get that in WSB this is all one big casino, but for one minute can you consider that issuing more stocks during a recession and a bear market might be a bad thing?  


What board of directors are considering moving their share point lower at this point, on opening weekend, during what might be the worst week on the stock market, expecting it to become profitable?

You are missing every single marker on a long check list of ""what to look for when I want to make money as a CEO and CFO"" and just following your dick like it's a divining rod.  


This isn't just about market speculation, This is how they keep themselves in business. They are playing both angles now. Both retail and hedge funds.  


You fail because you don't understand a fucking thing about how companies run their inner linings and you should really get back to those burgers before you burn them. This is a Wendy's sir."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm literally telling people that companies move stock this way to prevent marginalization, in this case, with the shorts coming in hot for them and the massive buy out from the chinese investors selling off + WSB it's safe to say that they're in a tight spot. What they need is a strong spot where they can soak up additional float, absorb the shorts, then also rebound on their take off weekend (this weekend and next week).  


They are literally holding off from becoming the the next $GME. They don't want to be a meme stock."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not telling you that you can't make money off of it, what I'm telling you is that there is a play involved and people should be aware of it. Introducing stock eliminates bad float, decimates short squeezes, and also bulks up share profit. In the long run it will end in a reverse stock split. In $AMC's case I can't see it going above 2:1.  


I'm not here telling you out of FUD. I'm trying to be level headed about how this is going to play out and how the boards and the majority shareholders are trying to game this."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It seems you are conflating two things here. AMC’s board has asked for the power to issue 500M shares, but have also asked for 35M shares for employees, which comes in a separate provision. The 500M class A shares do not get offered to employees first. 

The only way this is good for AMC in the long run is if they get this approved, the stock somehow moons and they sell a bunch of new stock in the market, diluting the value of every shareholder but raising a lot of capital for the company. Then going out and buying Cinemark or some other business, and/or flipping the movie theater business model on its head some other way. It’s easier to do stuff like that with a cash balance. As an investor, however, one would probably be better off buying the diluted shares after dilution then holding shares through this messy time. Unless of course you think this thing will moon then you can just sell at the top."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ummm... I’m confused by what you’re saying. Nothing in issuing new shares will force a short to pay up. 

The cost of the shares is lowered because each share individually does lose value. It materially represents a smaller share of the company. 

Shorts won’t stop saying they borrowed shares that didn’t exist just because new shares have been made available. If nothing else, once those shares hit the market they could be borrowed against to short the stock even more."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Calling me a failure or whatever doesn’t address any of the holes I poked in your comment.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay you didn't need to write a fucking essay to justify your SHIT investment.

If keeping the company stable EFFECTS YOUR PROSPECTS OF PROFITTING FROM YOUR INVESTMENT... THAT IS BAD FOR YOU.

Is that clear?

You literally don't have a counter argument because THERE IS NOT ONE."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it kind of does. If you don't have the time or the reasoning to figure out, through the thousands of comments I've left in this DD, you probably should stop putting money on wall st and keep it on main st."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Hm. Me like stock.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Kinda wish I went balls deep on Ford when it was under 5
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Leaps for sure on this horse
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Jan 2023 $10c's are cheap. That's my play.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,been holding ford and just bought some more! Super hype
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,In for 200 shares at 11.98 and 2 $15 strikes exp Jan 2023. Basically both been green since I bought a month ago. Nothing sexy but just essential slow upward gains. Have a feeling I’ll exercise the option when time comes esp if dividend comes back.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This stock is being manipulated for option calls.  I can't prove it but the way last week played out I'm sure of it.  Barely broke even on a 12.5c last week smh.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,People are gonna buy it though. Idk why people like Ford but they do.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, if you ignore the name choice the car Is actually extremly good. When I saw a car review for the first time I was extremly suprised. I love how the door opens"

2021-03-20 22:36:56,wallstreetbets,"A first-class ticket to the moon with Lordstown Motors [RIDE] 🚀🚀🚀 With all of the recent fake news around **PRE**\-orders and an SEC inquiry, I thought it would be nice to highlight some key items that are being glossed over due to the baseless short attack by Hindenberg this past week.


**12 Reasons to consider an investment in [Lordstown Motors](https://lordstownmotors.com/):**

**1.** The Endurance will be the first Pickup EV in the WORLD, with 57 beta models set to come out this month


**2.** Targeted for sale to fleet customers (This is unique compared to other EV offerings)


**3.** Marketing agreement with [Holman Enterprises](https://www.holmanenterprises.com/), one of the largest privately-owned dealership groups in the United States, established in the 1920s (Henry Ford turns in his grave as I type this)


**4.** Lordstown is the only EV company (aside from Tesla) with a huge state of the art production facility (6.2 million square feet)


**5.** Capabilities to produce an Endurance model every 6 minutes by 2022


**6.** Partnership with Camping World and Good Sam, the largest seller of Recreational Vehicles in the World with over 220 locations nationwide.  Also, see [Marcus Lemonis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Lemonis)


**7.** Lordstown is currently working on their second vehicle, an Electric Van set to release in 2022 - The earnings call mentions ""Electric World"" set to debut this year. ([Relevant Tweet](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1338707090903347200?s=20) from CEO of Camping World). EDIT: Also, see [Electric World job listings](https://www.google.com/search?q=electric+world+jobs&oq=electric+world+jobs&aqs=chrome..69i57.5831j0j7&client=ms-android-google&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8#fpstate=tlexp&htiq=electric%20world%20jobs&htitab=&htichips=organization_mid:/m/0c8kps&htischips=organization_mid;/m/0c8kps:Camping%20World) at Camping World.


**8.** Dealer approval for direct sales in the State of California, with [pending approval in Ohio](https://www.manufacturing.net/automotive/news/21283873/lordstown-motors-wants-ohio-to-ok-direct-sales)


**9.** Participation in upcoming [Baja Race](https://www.motortrend.com/news/lordstown-endurance-ev-baja-racing-san-felipe-250/)


**10.** On track to begin production in September 2021


**11.** Will use LG chem batteries (Same batteries in Tesla's Model 3 and Y)


**12.** Previous mentions of a battery pack in development for travel trailers that will eliminate the need for standalone generators - ([GREAT reference article](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131108_lordstown-electric-van-lg-chem-batteries-endurance-pickup))

&#x200B;

You would be blind to not see real potential here, with a target to sell to fleet customers, Lordstown Motors will have many future catalysts, and the best part is that it's an American company.

Now, Imagine how foolish you would feel to ignore the current dip.

The stock price was **$13.30** at market close on 3/19/21 and was just above **$30** on 2/11/21

**My Assessment/Prediction:**

This stock will launch directly to the moon and settle. - The purpose of the current baseless short attack is to push the stock price down so large investment firms can get in while it's low (maximum gains). Then they too will go to the moon with us.

# #RIDEORDIE

**TLDR:** RIDE is going to the moon and bears are actually bulls playing a different angle on their investment.

*I'm not a financial advisor, I just like the stock and company.*

EDIT2: Wow bunch of Hindenburg shills in WSB. Remember to time your cover properly 💎✋

EDIT3: Some wise words for HODLers from the prehistoric ape himself:

> Be Fearful When Others Are Greedy and Greedy When Others Are Fearful. - Warren Buffett"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,RIDE is now one of my largest positions. I doubled my stake last week.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've not been on this $RIDE long so I understood why some people might be weary about it, but currently I've been loving the potential of this company and holding through the lows. Positioned myself with a couple July 20 dollar calls at an unfortunate time last week but still hanging on to them and 25 shares around 14 dollars average. All those reasons you listed already have had me shocked this stock is so under speculated on, are people really buying into the Hindenburg unsubstantiated claims that much? I mean, they have an entire factory already with no cost to build it like every other EV start up, that alone is enough for me.

I'm an autist who loves technical analysis, and the 1 day interval on the MACD is just itching to blow up right now. The finger is on the trigger from a technical standpoint and the wobbly market the past few weeks is the only thing holding it back imo. I'm hoping some beta vehicles this month will be enough to light the fuse.

Edit: My first award ever, on a stock market comment no less. I guess it's finally time to quit my job and go full yolo into the market, thanks retards!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I am so stoked for this play. Every time I post about RIDE in daily discussion I'm downvoted to hell. Confirmation bias.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The amount of negative sentiment, its persistence, feels manufactured with intention.

Look, this company basically is a binary success-failure. You can go off opinion as Hindenburg used to justify most of their opinionated reported, or you can go off of facts and hope the dots contact to wealth.

What are the facts?

1) They have an agreement with Camping World for service station support and to build them an RV. Marcus Lemonis isn’t an idiot. In fact, I’d wager he’s smarter than most of us. I’m sure he’s done his due diligence. More than anyone of us. Easy money follows smart money.

2) The RV design will be used for an EV Van. Work truck and work van. Great accessible markets.

3) Betas are in production now. All you have to do is wait for the proof by the end of this month. Take your chance and wait, or buy in now and enjoy the catalyst.

4) They already secured a dealers license for the state of California. They will sell direct to consumer.

5) They are using proven battery tech from LG Chem. I don’t think LG Chem is a bunch of morons who put money into a sinking ship. A contract has to be made and money has to be guaranteed.

6) GM is on the board of $RIDE. Yes, they struck out with Nikola, but everyone seems to have forgotten how fast they ditched Nikola when the report came out. GM hasn’t budged. Easy money follows smart money.

6B) GM is a partner and investor in $RIDE. They were since day 1 when they handed them a present for a factory. Let’s not forget of the possible buyout once $RIDE gets all of its free money for government loans and grants.

7) They have officially entered into a race. Why would $RIDE set themselves up for disaster on a public stage if they are unsure of their product? Or if one didn’t exist?

8) People keep complaining about a lack of product. Shut the fuck up. It’s a pre revenue company, you dip shits. Product = revenue.

9) The brilliant analyst at MS, Adam “what the fuck is a hub motor” Jonas thought the hub motors were part of the wheel assembly and thought each truck needed 5 motors. They don’t. The hub motors are (gasp) part of the axle.

9B) The Endurance can run on a single hub motor. Consider the equivalent of losing one cylinder in an ICE vehicle. Endurance > ICE. Advantage for fleets.

10) $RIDE has employees. 500 employees and 200 contractors. A fraud company doesn’t hire employees to twist on their on thumbs. Notice how “former employees” were used in the Hindenburg report. Why not ask real employees? No names were given. Why not get actual eye witness accounts?

11) two government cash infusions are pending. One from the US and one from Ohio. The Ohio Secretary of State recently visited Lordstown Motors l. 2 + 2 folks.

12) the sheer conviction behind the negativity should be equally met with the sheer conviction of an investment. If you’re so sure that $RIDE is a fraud, put your money where your mouth is and go short. Buy puts or short the stock. Do it and post.

Positions: 4,100 shares. Anyone who wants confirmation I’ll send them a DM. I’ll want the same from you, especially if your short.

edit: spelling"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I consider myself a gambling man and I see a no brainer buy right now. The price is great for a low risk/high reward. Is there risk? Of course. I’m in about a $14/share cost and feeling good about it. I would however be nervous if I was at $20 or even $25+. I think the big thing people are looking at is the CEO not knowing how to talk on camera and the preorder nonsense. Both of those do not effect my thoughts on the product and the company. I’m a blue collar guy so I actually see how great this could become. A lot of the haters on RIDE are people who will never own a truck in their life. I hope Lordstown takes off just for fact that they are American made in small town Ohio. The world needs a solid EV truck. Good luck to everybody considering this one.

also account with 100 karma calling ppl shills rofl"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,All of you $RIDE bulls should just preorder 1 mil Endurance trucks each. There's no commitment or money required. All you do is sign some form. According to Hindenburg sometimes they even pay you to sign it. Then they can say they have at least 20 million preorders and stock will moon --> profit.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"My worry is that they haven't even gone through safety yet.  The beta models they are currently building are set to go for crash tests.  Aside from simulations, there's no proof that the design will pass.  If it doesn't this will delay everything. Considering they expect to be in production by September that doesn't leave long if they were to run into problems.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have you actually read the short report? They're using fake  numbers to make their claim of ""100,000"" preorders. Most of those companies don't exist and there has been no money exchanged. 

GM is so desperate to invest in EV right now they will give any asshole with a good pitch a billion dollars. NKLA is a great example. And for good reason. TSLA has disrupted the whole industry and GM is right to be worried. 

You seem to have a lot of faith in ""contracts made"" but getting a deal signed is not proof of a good product it's proof of good demand and a good sales team."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"True, I can't deny that the hopium does flow among the proponents of $RIDE. The timeline is tight and while I don't think it needs to go flawlessly for them to achieve their goals, the majority of the milestones do need to at least be arrived to without a hitch. However while a growing number of people on reddit have been talking it up, I think that's honestly been the only hype so far, and from a technical standpoint I don't think the potential is priced in already or that the market correctly values the timeline we are all hoping to see. 

While I agree it's scary to see people hyping it up as though everything for the next year will go right, but I think the market currently values $RIDE as though everything will go wrong. And I'm just here buying the fear because I think the middle ground between those two valuations will lead the stock up."

Holmen Enterprise

These are big names with big wallets. Do you think they “were paid $30 to $50 for their preorders”? Did COVID hit them that much that then needed $50,000?

Guess what, an idiot dressed in a shiny yellow hard hat bumbling like an idiot about his pre-order lies (yeah lies, because he PAID for them. Cut the crap about interest when you are paying for this stuff) is not going to magically solve the issues with building a truck with in-wheel motors (unsprung mass, cooling, protecting the motor...

Good luck with all the confusion, once you get past it and clear your head a little maybe this will make more sense."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Then why did you first mention them? What was the point?

Production problems? Are we in some utopian reality where “problems” don’t exist? Are production problems the sign of a scam?

Currently a microchip shortage is causing production disruption for all automakers. Are they all scams because they couldn’t foresee the demand? Are they imposters?

Tesla had “production problems” for its Model 3. Funny, no one doubts Tesla now. Those who didn’t doubt Tesla then are millionaires.

Edit: added word."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"What does institutional mean to you? 

So what if he's short? He did the research. People believe him. When he publishes a report, the stock goes down. Short volume goes up. Nothing surprising. 

If I have my own firm or fund does that make me ""institutional"" in your eyes? There's millions of small funds out there. They are not all ""institutions"" or market makers. Just private people trading and making money like you and me."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"GM backed... lol.

Best I can find, GM invested $25M cash in them. The rest of their investment was via loaning money for the factory. I think it is a safe assumption that GM has a security interest in all the plant and equipment and the moment RIDE fails GM takes back that equipment and probably, if available, gets back their cash.

In any case, $25M is a drop in the bucket for GM. I would not go around throwing around GM here as if it means anything.

By comparison the investment that GM was supposed to make in Nikola was over $2B.

Seriously, if you are talking up the GM angle, you clearly are a shill.

So if this is the one fact you want to spoon-feed, you are clearly not doing a very good job."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You don't think touting fake pre orders all over the country on live TV events, on CNBC, and multiple press releases is morally questionable behavior? I would not want to do business with you... Certainly makes me think twice before I give this company and this man my hard earned money.

 You do what you want man. It's your money. 

As far as production problems goes, they are not as big an issue for established companies like Tesla or Ford because they have REVENUE coming in. This company has literally $0 in revenue. If they can't get this car built, they risk insolvency and your investment will go to $0. 

And btw, when Tesla had production issues for the model 3, the stock price did go down quite a bit. So you're confirming a bear thesis with that statement. 

I don't care enough to continue this. You do what you want with your money. this is an obvious money pit of a company in my eyes, but maybe I'm wrong. Good luck."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"For people who have done their research, HR's *report* isn't just bad, it's absolute trash. Anyone who looks can see this much, regardless of their investment positions.

*Institutional* to me means a company that more or less commands an Earth-shaking amount of capital, and can torpedo a stock virtually at will, and I mean regardless of any fundamental valuation. Such investors often command a great deal of authority, and can afford media air time that most investors can only dream of.

I don't really mind if Anderson himself is short on a stock, or if people agree with him, but I think a more open discussion would be nice instead of just assuming the veracity of his extremely sketchy report without performing an independent investigation.

I like the stock, so I just loaded up a small position on the dip. To my fortune, I'd only been monitoring $RIDE long term before the 12th because I could tell it had been shorted to shit for several months, so I'm sitting *really* nice on my initial investment. Nathan did me a favor, bless his little black heart. Still, I think he crossed a line. I encourage you to look for yourself and maybe just observe. Think of it as a case study.

But in short, I too have a right to short the short seller, as it were. If he can slander a company and it's CEO, why should anyone treat him any differently? I did my homework and then some on him and Steve Burns alike, and I'm comfortable with my decisions."

Confirmation of bear thesis works only on the time interval you measure the company. Many bears would lick their wounds if they thought Tesla was going insolvent because of production issues.

And you seem to forget that Tesla had many production issues. From their first roadster on. You know, from before earning revenue. As in pre revenue.

The funny thing is, $RIDE is way far ahead of Tesla in the same stage of pre revenue. Enormous factory? Check

Large investors? Check

Secured supply channels? Check

Access to experienced workforce? Check

More money than needed? Check.

Partnerships with respectable distributors? Check

**Info -** 


Hims & Hers ($HIMS) is a telemedicine company which allows anybody across the continental United States to purchase medicine discreetly, safely, quickly, and inexpensively straight to your door. For prescription medicine, Hims & Hers employs hundreds of specialized doctors, which can prescribe medicine through call, text, or video chat. Hims & Hers offers a wide variety of products which continues to expand, such as:


* Skin Care
* Hair Loss and Care
* Sex products (ED, PE, Contraception)
* Covid Tests 
* Supplements
* Primary Care
* Mental Care


**Financials -** 


* Financially stable - over 90 Million in cash + short term investments, with 0 short/long term debt
* Gross Margin of  77% last Quarter, 74% for 2020 (54% in 2019)
* 2.6B Market Cap
* Negative (but improving) Cash Flow
* Q4 EPS  of -.07 (Beat by .09)
* Revenue of $148.8 MM for 2020, 80% yoy growth
* 2020 Q4 Revenue of $41.5 MM (Beat by $4.47 MM)
* Q1 2021 Revenue expects $48 - $50 MM
* $195 - $205 MM overall 2021 Revenue estimate
* Over 3 Million consultations 
* 91% Recurring Revenue


Simply put, Hims & Hers has consistent, growing revenue and gross margin growth, with the main problems being in the Cash Flow and Earnings per Share. However, both are improving significantly over time.

**Growth -**


Hims & Hers has many avenues to expand in, in every single part of their company. Because of how 91% of revenue is recurring, Hims & Hers is free to take many risks in expanding, as revenue will not be negatively affected as long as the subscription models are sustained. 


[Potential Medical Product Growth](https://imgur.com/a/S3lWXmr)

Hims & Hers' Revenue numbers are also almost only Sexual Health and Hair/Skin Care for now, as their recent additions of Primary and Mental Care have not gotten adoption yet. In Q2 of 2020 92% of Revenue was from Skin and Hair Care, as mainly recurring revenue. Once adoption of Hims & Hers Primary and Mental Care picks up, I can see the company's revenue increasing greatly, and the ecosystem created through Hims & Hers' other products will strengthen this growth.



[2020 Q2 Revenue %](https://imgur.com/a/WtX16oq)



The structure of Hims & Hers also a large reason Hims & Hers has grown so much in only two years, and why the company can continue to grow. Almost every single part of the Hims & Hers experience is proprietary and created in-house, as there were no outside options at the time. However, as these structure growths have already been completed, this means that these next few years are when they will be refined, increasing gross margins, cutting out unnecessary expenses, and allowing the company to escape the bloat of the American Healthcare system caused by individual medicine companies.  
[Hims & Hers structure](https://imgur.com/a/rjw0v0o)


[Sources](https://investors.forhims.com/why-invest/default.aspx)



Although Healthcare is already a Four Trillion Dollar industry, I believe that Hims & Hers has an opportunity to grow the industry as well. Many people across America simply do not receive the healthcare they need, whether due to costs, waiting time, distance, or other reasons, and Hims & Hers solves all of those problems. With appointments being online anyone across America and get diagnosed and receive a prescription within minutes, without needing to live near a hospital, and at a low cost.


**Competitors + Why Hims & Hers?**


I would say that Hims & Hers has a lot of overall competitors, but not for its niche and for many different reasons.
The biggest overall competitor would be $TDOC. As they are both in the Telehealth industry, they will inevitably clash, and of the two $TDOC is much larger. However, Hims & Hers offers direct sales of a large variety of medicine and health care products, which $TDOC does not. Because of this, I believe Hims & Hers will have a larger overall ecosystem in product offered, as well as capture the niche market requiring Skin Care, Hair Loss and Care, and Sex products, which $TDOC does not focus on. I also see Hims & Hers as having a much larger favorability with younger generations, particularly millennials and under, due to a few reasons:


* Branding- $HIMS is heavier on advertising, and their company image is more ""high status"" than $TDOC
* More importance/education on Skin Care, Sex products, and Hair Loss and Care
* Affordability - Hims & Hers has primary care consultations for $39, which is a nice, consistent price especially when compared to the American healthcare system
* Their Twitter account posts memes


Other competitors: Those random Telehealth apps nobody knows about, Amazon (more pricing power on medicine), CVS/Walgreens/RiteAid (Lol)


**Positions:**


20 x $15c 4/16


10 x $17.5c 5/21 


(will be rolling out calls when they get closer to expiry into long term)"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great call. Been increasingly liking HIMS too. Great marketing and brand reputation, an ass load of recurring revenue, and a focus on millennials that will age into their services. There’s plenty room for a company at just a 2.7B market cap to grab market share."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I have some shares and calls but GUUUHHHH what a piece of shit this stock has been.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Interesting idea of online healthcare. My small town once had 2 pharmacy's, but now has 0. I can see this being helpful for people who live in rural areas or who are shopping around for deals on prescription medicines."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure what to think. Covid is declining but I'm also thinking long term here. As my generation grows older(millennial), perhaps more people will use this in the future considering we're kind of the first gen of growing up into internet. Who knows, shit might come out like a BP monitor you plug into usb and stuff like that. We've already stopped a pretty big amount of in person shopping, even precovid. I could see telemedicine being a part of the future."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you look at its Instagram pages, HIMS has a larger following than than all of those names combined. It may not mean much but hey, online presence is important for an online focused business.

TDOC isn't even on IG lol. But I don't see TDOC as a competition to HIMS just yet because of how niche the latter's business model is. And HIMS is way more consumer focused than TDOC.

Since this is a consumer-focused, D2C, digitally native telehealth platform, you can tell how a brand is doing based on the number of followers on popular social media websites. Not the best yardstick but not the worst.

Let's be real, brand power is going to be an important moat for a company that has no real one like HIMS. So it's good to know that HIMS is relatively popular at least."

There's a time and place for the both of them and in the end, accessibility to decent healthcare has to be improved and telemedicine can help with that to an extent. I'm bullish about telehealth but never once did I ever think that it will replace direct consultations. It just won't work especially when we're dealing with mental health. No way that can be done remotely all the time, if not most of the time. 

But I think what telehealth offers is options. Options for people who are not getting the care they need due to the broken healthcare system. Options for better accessibility and cost savings. 

And for HIMS in particular, they're not really targeting customers with super complex issues with high age risk profiles (except maybe mental health). They're going for millennials with stigmatised issues like acne, ED, birth control, and hair loss. These issues aren't life threatening for the most part. And I say that because most of their customers (about 80%) are seeking treatment for their conditions for the first time using the platform. Which means that most of the time, they just never seek treatment for it. They dragged their feet around it when they should be getting the care they need due to various factors due to cost, accessibility and stigmatisation. So telehealth is offering them such options which is not a bad thing. 

Whatever that can be done online, can be done online. Not all health issues require direct consultations all the time. Like you said, you had to turn down quite a number of patients. Do you ever wonder what happens to them when they can't seek the treatment they need due to the inherent limitations of the current healthcare system? Don't you wish they have options at least? Can telehealth help with that in some way?"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's just a necessary evolution in the delivery of healthcare. Imagine if another pandemic hits and the lockdown prolongs. How long do you think they can stay away from telehealth? And with a new generation that grew up with an iPhone rather a teddy bear, demand for telehealth will only grow. 

And you're talking about 7 to 8 players that's trying to disrupt a multi trillion industry that's been outdated and inefficient in every way for so long. There's enough room for all the players to enjoy. There's no need for one particular player to dominate the whole thing to achieve multibagger returns.

Think bigger."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I disagree. Going to the doctors is such a shitty experience. Walk into an office immediately get asked to fill out forms that could have been autofilled prior to my visit. Wait another 30 minutes because no one knows how to run a schedule. Get asked to wait another 20 minutes in a room. See a doctor for 10 minutes before I'm shoved out the door, then asked to fill out more forms.

The entire healthcare industry will be disrupted this decade. It won't be this company but it will be others (likely Amazon lols)."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Which market are you talking about? Hair loss? ED? Primary care? 

You're talking about a company with a market cap of 2.74B and revenue of 148.8M as at FY2020, trying to disrupt a multi billion market that could go up to a trillion dollars worth of healthcare spending in the US alone. In its current business lines like hair loss and ED, yes the market is saturating but what about their recently launched business lines like anxiety, dermatology and primary care?

Anxiety - 14B
Dermatology - 44B
Primary care - 280B


Can you see where I'm going with this? The best part is that HIMS doesn't even need to dominate all those markets to be a 5x or 10x stock.

Altogether, it would be a 345B opportunity and HIMS only achieved 148.8M in sales. Just achieving 1% of that market opportunity is already 27x its existing revenue. 

And I'm not saying that every consultation will be done online in the future but that's the beautiful thing about the opportunity at hand, it doesn't need to."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is untrue.  Mid levels do not provide better care, and they utilize more resources and consult more, unnecessarily. 

You can not put chronic care on a flow chart.  There are so many people that try algorithms and kill certain organs or don’t understand the pathophysiology of diseases and the pharmacology of medications and throw shit stupidly and harm their patients.  

Please don’t pretend like these are facts when they are absolutely falsehoods pushed by midlevel organizations and lay business folk who try to push these models.  Mid levels try to push their studies, but all their studies are mid levels that are supervised.   Not only that but mid levels have their mistakes caught by their supervised attendings, thus don’t count as a mistake.

That’s just dumb to think a nurse practitioner (many online programs don’t even require any nursing experience and require 500 hours of shadowing before they can practice, along with 4-5 science courses in 2 years).  I spent an extra 4 years in Med school after my bachelors/masters, and I had over 10000 hours of practice in residency along with 5000 hours of clinical practice in Med school.  I take care of the most complex cases in the hospital before I can practice independently.   

You are trying to compare that to mid levels who some barely do any procedures in their 2 extra years of “classes” and 500 hours of clinical (some of them have to find their own sites, and some just shadow and do clerical work at these sites) after their bachelors before they practice.

Here are just some examples of studies:

Resident teams are economically more efficient than MLP teams and have higher patient satisfaction. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/26217425/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/26217425/)

Compared with dermatologists, PAs performed more skin biopsies per case of skin cancer diagnosed and diagnosed fewer melanomas in situ, suggesting that the diagnostic accuracy of PAs may be lower than that of dermatologists. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29710082￼](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29710082%EF%BF%BC)

Advanced practice clinicians are associated with more imaging services than PCPs for similar patients during E&M office visits. [https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1939374](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1939374)

Nonphysician clinicians were more likely to prescribe antibiotics than practicing physicians in outpatient settings, and resident physicians were less likely to prescribe antibiotics. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15922696](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15922696)

The quality of referrals to an academic medical center was higher for physicians than for NPs and PAs regarding the clarity of the referral question, understanding of pathophysiology, and adequate prereferral evaluation and documentation. [https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(13)00732-5/abstract](https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(13)00732-5/abstract)

Antibiotics were more frequently prescribed during visits involving NP/PA visits compared with physician-only visits, including overall visits (17% vs 12%, P < .0001) and acute respiratory infection visits (61% vs 54%, P < .001). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5047413/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5047413/)

NPs, relative to physicians, have taken an increasing role in prescribing psychotropic medications for Medicaid-insured youths. The quality of NP prescribing practices deserves further attention. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/29641238/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/29641238/)

NPs/PAs practicing in states with independent prescription authority were > 20 times more likely to overprescribe opioids than NPs/PAs in prescription-restricted states. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32333312/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32333312/)

Both 30-day mortality rate and mortality rate after complications (failure-to-rescue) were lower when anesthesiologists directed anesthesia care. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10861159/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10861159/)

Advanced practice clinicians and PCPs ordered imaging in 2.8% and 1.9% episodes of care, respectively. Advanced practice clinicians are associated with more imaging services than PCPs for similar patients during E&M office visits .While increased use of imaging appears modest for individual patients, this increase may have ramifications on care and overall costs at the population level. [https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1939374](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1939374)

APP visits had lower RVUs/visit (2.8 vs. 3.7) and lower patients/hour (1.1 vs. 2.2) compared to physician visits. Higher APP coverage (by 10%) at the ED‐day level was associated with lower patients/clinician hour by 0.12 (95% confidence interval \[CI\] = −0.15 to −0.10) and lower RVUs/clinician hour by 0.4 (95% CI = −0.5 to −0.3). Increasing APP staffing may not lower staffing costs. [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acem.14077](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acem.14077)

When caring for patients with DM, NPs were more likely to have consulted cardiologists (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.21–1.37), endocrinologists (OR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.48–1.82), and nephrologists (OR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.67–2.17) and more likely to have prescribed PIMs (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.01–1.12) [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.13662](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.13662)

Ambulatory visits between 2006 and 2011 involving NPs and PAs more frequently resulted in an antibiotic prescription compared with physician-only visits (17% for visits involving NPs and PAs vs 12% for physician-only visits; *P* < .0001) [https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/3/3/ofw168/2593319](https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/3/3/ofw168/2593319)

By contrast, the proportion of psychotropic medications prescribed by psychiatrists and by non-psychiatric physicians declined (56.9%-53.0% and 32.3%-31.8%, respectively) [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29641238/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29641238/)"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh man you really know nothing about healthcare huh 

Seeing idiotic posts like this in an industry I’m familiar with from someone who’s not really shows me that no matter how simple DD looks, you don’t know what you don’t know unless you actually study it 

Point number 6 is the funniest in this post, what idiot believes NPs (the preMed rejects who do a year of online school and nothing else) provide better care. The study had so many confounding factors and often times had supervising physicians 

If there’s one thing you were right about there, it’s that some patients may feel like they’re getting better care Bc the NP is just as confused as the patient is lmao"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are plenty of studies that indicate that NP and PA provide the same level of care with primary care and have comparable if not better outcomes.  I could provide a list as well, but it's not worth my time/no one will read anyhow - I'm sure if you are practicing, you are aware of them.  If the quality of care was extremely different, you would not see states (and medicare) pushing to increase access to these providers.  There is resistance from AMA and physicians as this encroaches into their turf and further decreases the need and pay for general practice.  **NP and PA cost half as much or less than a physician and provide a comparable level of primary care**.  Sorry if it hurts, but even if you don't believe this is true, this is the direction that healthcare is going, like it or not.  It's already started."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I work in healthcare, pretty familiar.  And there's plenty of studies that support what I said regarding lower level providers and quality of care.  Also, in most states, NPs don't have ""supervision"", they are licensed to practice independently with a consulting relationship with a physician if escalation of an issue is required."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think you read my comment - those studies are flawed because of how they gathered data - these are NP’s and PA’s that are supervised and if they make mistakes, the primary will change and modify and these mistakes are not counted in any data set.  Please read the data carefully.  Many mid levels throw these poor low quality studies in journals with low impact factors.  Some journals will publish anything as long as their authors PAY them.  Just like you are seeing in main stream media, the quality of evidence is poor as long as you pay.  The AANP spends a lot of money pushing propaganda and not actual health care.  

Why do you think nurse practitioners spend over 1/3 of their education on public policy and not actual medicine?  Why do you think many of them can’t find jobs after they graduate?  They have poor educations and this push is because the schools want more money and they accept anyone with a pulse.  They don’t give a crap about providing quality care to patients.

I’m practicing right now and I can easily tell the poor care.  If you are in the emergency room or taking care of a patient in the hospital, you see the poor care that many of these mid levels give and the ridiculous mediations they put their patients on.

The reason that CVS and Walgreens push mid level care is because they are cheap, not better.  They order a battery of tests and imaging which cost more for the patient and give unnecessary medications which cause more harm and side effects and refer patients unnecessarily to specialists.  The hidden cost for mid levels is more for the healthcare system than a physician, but for the company themselves, they incur less costs.

Ask regular nurses who work regularly with mid levels or ask actual good doctors.  The problem with mid levels is due to boomer ass doctors who let it get this way because they don’t care about their patients and want more money because of greed and they want to retire with more yachts."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol no reputable studies would show that.

I guess the clown NP who orders every test in the book for something a real doctor could diagnose quickly or gives every patient he or she sees antibiotics for a cold would see good patient satisfaction 

But at the end of the day there’s no way someone with as joke of training as NPs, literally the laughingstock of the healthcare industry, has any real evidence to back up such a  stupid claim LOL."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did read your comment, and I disagree with you.  As much as the AANP is pushing for NP roles to be expanded, the AMA is pushing it's agenda as well because it hurts them in the pocket book.  The reality of it is that, as much as physicians and AMA don't like the shift, it's happening and it's about time.  The AMA has long been the gatekeepers of medical care and the cost associated with this harms patients.  It's simply not true that NP and PAs who provide primary care are more expensive (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4946030/)  Medicare and other insurance companies employ huge actuarial teams and would not be promoting these providers if they did not provide economical care.  Fact of the matter is, even with insurance in the united states, even simple medical care is out of reach of many individuals. 

Sorry if you think that NP education is unsatisfactory, but it's not.  For primary care, most of what is encountered is routine and governed by either system wide policies, professional recommendations, best practices guidelines, medicare guidelines, etc.  Physicians practice within this framework as well.  I'm not trying to discount the education and skill of physicians, but unfortunately, for routine care and preventative care, that level is unnecessary.  Our current medical model blocks a lot of people from receiving the care they need, and like it or not, agree with it or not, it's changing because customers want to see it change.   

The current trends in primary care utilization also don't bode well for the current model.  Younger people increasingly don't have any relationship with a primary care provider, less than past generations when they were at the same ages.  We have a whole generation that is not receiving preventative services and does not have a medical history on file.  In addition, overall utilization is decreasing while expenses increasing for all groups.  This is unsustainable as an industry."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did you just read a single line in the abstract and post it?

1) The study is limited by the fact that some NPs bill Medicare for their services “incident to” a physician. Under incident to billing the care provided by an NP is billed under a physician's NPI when certain conditions are met, including an initial encounter between the physician and patient and the presence of a physician in the office when the service is performed

2) In addition to incident to billing, there are other reasons why services provided to beneficiaries by NPs may not be visible in Medicare administrative data. For example, NPs may not bill all or some of the services they provide under their own NPI number either due to supervision requirements within their organizations, employment arrangements, or state scope of practice requirements for diagnosing and prescribing.

-NP's are not billing for certain procedures or examinations because it is beyond their scope.  They bill these under their supervising physician which cause the weighted average cost to be higher.  Also more complicated and sicker patients that are more complicated are being by their supervising physician instead of NP's.

The higher bills are happening because NP's are not equipped to handle more difficult cases so all the more expensive bills are billed under physicians which push the weighted average up.

And again, many of these data points are nurse practioners that are being supervised, so the cost of these Nurse practioners includes the supervision of Physicians which is unlisted and they are not having independent practice in this study.  It does not tell you the performance, consult costs, medication and long term effects of management.

While I don't agree with the quality of healthcare and these policies, I agree that many of these companies are pushing towards more mid-level care because it is cheaper for their bottom line.  They don't care about the increased imaging, tests or medications ordered  (which I cited) because they make more money when they are ordered.

There are various hospitals and healthcare systems that minimize the use of mid levels because it hurts their overall bottom line because they collect the insurance and patients who have worse chronic management become more costly in the future to their healthcare system (Kaiser Permanente).  

CVS, Walgreens, etc. do not - they bill services to insurances and it benefits them to hire the cheapest labor they can and they push the cost to insurance and they don't care about long term cost."
2021-03-20 21:42:58,wallstreetbets,"What's Wrong With This Picture? - Precious Metals DD So I keep hearing that Silver is ""historically undervalued"" and I wanted to do some DD to see how rare it really is, and what the price should be realistically in comparison to the other metals.

Take a look at the numbers and judge for yourselves.

The big five precious metals are:

PLATINUM

Current Price **$1205/Ounce**

Total Ounces Ever Mined: 350 Million

Uses: 60% of total production goes to automotive industry. Current uses are for catalytic converters but as cars switch to EV, will be used for battery cells. Also used in jewelry.

GOLD

Current Price: **$1740/Ounce**

Total Ounces Ever Mined: 10 Billion or a cube 25m on each side.

Uses: TO FUCKING BALL OUT OF CONTROL

PALLADIUM

Current Price: **$2746/Ounce** (up 12% last month)

Total Ounces Ever Mined: 24 Million

Uses: 60% of total production goes to automotive industry.

RHODIUM

Current Price: **$29,000/Ounce** (WTF! up 200% YTD)

Total Ounces Ever Mined: 70 million

Uses: Most commonly used as an alloy agent with other metals, Also used in jewelry, electric contacts and catalytic converters. Very hard substance. But apparently can be replaced with platinum (if you use more platinum).

SILVER

Current Price **$26.25/Ounce**

Total Ounces Ever Mined: 49 Billion mined but only 27 billion remain.

In 2020, 978M ounces of Silver were produced globally, and the total demand was 963M ounces. But, only 215M ounces were for investment purposes. The remaining silver was used for commercial purposes (475M and and 96M just for solar), jewelry (187M), photography (30M) and silverware (54M). Crazy to think that many people are still buying real silverware (although I hear a lot is plated).

Almost half of the silver ever mined is now in a landfill. Also, it is not yet economically feasible to scavenge the landfills for salvageable silver based on the price (things aren't that blade runnery yet.)

Uses: The best conductor of electricity, used in all electronics and EVs. Silver is also used as an antibacterial agent. Also used as currency throughout history and as a fast way to move large amounts of wealth. The US Constitution explicitly mentions gold and silver as money.

So....

Why is the price of silver so low?

It occurs in the earth's crust at a ratio of 8 to 1 compared to gold yet it's only worth enough to feed a family of four at McDonalds? People have to literally dig this stuff out of the FUCKING GROUND.

*Something doesn't add up.*

The current price ratio is 65 ounces of silver for 1 ounce of gold. Throughout history, the ratio has remained closer to 16 to 1 which at this gold price would imply a silver price of $112.

This sounds a little better.

Bank manipulation is well known in this space, and the paper market for silver only functions to suppress the price. If trading was conducted in a responsible manner the silver price would be much higher. Yesterday alone, 280 million ounces were bought and sold. This equates to 28% of the yearly mine production. The big banks control the majority of the metals and have unlimited ammunition to short. This happens late at night, when there is no liquidity to push down the price. But the price has recently started to resist these dumps.

But the tides are turning, someone has been removing physical silver from the COMEX vaults and it is being drained at an alarming rate. This month, 26 million ounces of physical silver has been removed, which is almost four times the normal amount. It has been hypothesized that manufacturers are starting to source their metals from the COMEX directly. Additionally, the Perth Mint has been rumored to have run out of unallocated physical silver bars.

If there is even a tiny inkling of a bank run on silver, the price will shoot higher. And if you look at how undervalued silver is, both historically and when compared to other precious metals, the trade becomes a no brainer.

This is one of the last great trades.  They can't hold the ball under water forever.

I would like to see this turn into a transfer of wealth from the blood sucking banks into the hands of us, the people. Silver will always be the people's money and this may be one of our only hopes to preserve our wealth for future generations."

Gold should begin a bull run this year and silver should see 50-100$ end of year.

Can’t state the importance of BASEL III and the expired SLR exemption enough.  Precious metals will run for the remainder of the year while big banks comply with Basel III

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If my business model relied silver I wouldn't want to hype it up. The fewer people who buy, the lower the price stays, and the more profit I make. 

There are reasons why companies don't fully disclose their future business plans. If they did they'd have to compete with their competitors and entrepreneurs."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Silver goes up when gold rises. Violently.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Silver always follows the move of gold x2
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Silver isn't used much in flatware probably less than 1% of it. Those already sell far above the melt value in most cases. If you wanted to make this argument it would've been about photography and you're about 10 years late on that one. 

Silver has more patents than any other metal. The real argument for silver is it's been money for 4,000 years in a time where literally every currency in existence is being printed into oblivion. The worldwide silver mined last year equals about 750 million oz. So about 1/10 oz for every soul on earth and right now we have the opportunity to build a good size supply of it before it's much much harder to come by. If not for myself I'd save it for any possible future generations of my family, because they will grow up in a world where silver bullion in any real quantity may be extremely hard to come by. The USGS says the first element on the periodic table to go extinct will be silver."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The problem with that logic is that it’s used very very widely in small quantities. It’s in virtually all electronics, appliances, vehicles, solar, etc. it can be reduced, but not easily replaced. Think about it, if you could easily replace silver with copper, why not do it last year, or 10 years ago? The reality is that industrial use keeps rising in total, even as the amount per solar panel and other individual applications goes down."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,All I know is the only cure for a supply squeeze is higher prices
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah I didn't  know that. Definitely not a Rhodium expert.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Literally has silver in their name for fuck sake
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Refer to the 80’s. 

Yeah. 

This post is garbage."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You'd have to be a gazillionaire in the first place to do it. Do you think space mining is gonna mine silver at 26 dollars per oz? Maybe 2600$
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Same can be said about quantum computers and any password.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Hayabusa2 landed on an asteroid and brought back samples totaling 5.4 grams. It cost $150 million and took 6 years. So when gold hits $840 million an ounce this will be viable.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,and if they could just figure out that whole digital immortality thing....
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Will it though? If I know anything about humans it is that we are greedy and wasteful things.

And of the materials mined from an asteroid, how many of those materials would be returned to Earth vs how many will be kept/used in space?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You must be really young🤔
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Referring to a silver/gold ratio is comparing the price of the two precious metals over a long period of time. This takes lots of factors into consideration and can point to which metal is currently the better buy.

A human shit/gold ratio would imply there is a market for human fecal matter. If there is one I both apologize and would be very interested...better to sell than flush cash down the toilet."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Federal reserve was created this century. Threw everything out of whack. Before that, ratio was much closer to the real ratio as it is in the earth's crust."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,And yet my cake day is years ahead of yours. What bank do YOU work for?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought in 2010 and I'm finally up on my investment. Only took 10 years lol. Cash would have been worse though, especially if you look at inflation. And at least I didn't spend it on drugs. Win for me."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,">It is a good store of value.

That's what's so great about silver and gold. They are stores of value. They won't get you richer...but that means the reverse is true too...having them as an asset will keep you from being poor.

Yes, there are other investment opportunities which will generate more cashflow. Investing in silver/gold isn't about generating revenue. It's monetary insurance for when a currency fails/stocks plummet/inflation hedge/etc..."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You should buy a couple oz and try it!

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Happy Hawaiians post was more in depth.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It is the most blatant one I have ever seen.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Hunt Brothers situation ended because banks raised margin on them. VERY similar to what happened to GME with Robinhood. They changed the rules mid game because they were losing. This won't happen this time because thousands of apes are buying silver hand over fist.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,The Hunt Brothers went into debt to acquire silver. That was their folly.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Obviously you have no idea what you talking about. The elites changed the rules to finish the Hunt Brothers, as well as with GME on Robinhood, “you can only sell but not buy allowed” + they went on debt. I don’t understand the haters. Just read some history, the only money is silver and gold, and they have saved the system again and again throughout the history of humanity."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, intelligent people, whether they're well meaning or not, are buying silver like madmen. What I mean by intelligent people, is those who understand that the world is going to go through a severe economic crisis very soon, likely in conjunction with the ""end"" of the pandemic. 

This global economic crisis will be severe enough that there will need to be an overhaul of our current system. A  ""reset"" of sorts - and a great one, at that. This ""great reset"" could present us with an opportunity to create a more open and equitable system, or the majority of humanity could become state dependent debt slaves with who knows how many human rights stripped from us.

80 years ago, a single man convinced a nation to torture, experiment on, and slaughter 6,000,000 human beings. That's a number so large, it's impossible to even fathom and empathize with the individual lives that endured that.  Just pigs to a slaughterhouse, because they were Jews. This isn't an isolated incident. At the same time, a certain up and coming military industrial complex decided to test nuclear bombs on a couple large CIVILIAN CITIES.

People who seek and obtain, or maintain, vast sums of wealth and power DO treat people like livestock if given the opportunity. It's a fact of the world we live in, to deny it is ignorance. If we, as a collective, do not wake up and confront this fact of life, we will forever be slaves and swine. Don't be naïve."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Meme stocks and physical silver here as well!!! Great write up by the way!

I just keep buying more and more physical silver and plan to keep doing it even as prices rise. 

Eventually going to get 1000 shares of PSLV then request to convert my shares to physical silver 1000oz bar!

That way I will get it at exactly spot price."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"That wouldn't surprise me if a large chunk had been used, but simply not deteriorated. I wouldn't call it 'no longer exists', it's simply not in a usable state and would need to be refined again."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Look up what happened in 1930.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,They are already *always* replaced by a cheaper alternative when possible. The only reason gold and silver are used in electronics is because the increased efficiency of silver or the corrosion resistance of gold is absolutely necessary. In those applications they can't be replaced because they are the only option.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is amazing, I had no idea."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds like a very niche market
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Anything with electronics in it has a tiny amount of silver, even washing machines. That’s a long term benefit. If it were used more concentrated, it would be easier to recycle. It’s hard to recycle a washing machine to get $0.02 of silver."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not all the current silver demand has to due with industry. 

The USD is pushing some 50 years as a fiat currency (where the average is \~27 years). People are investing in sound money/hedging against inflation as well."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do you have any links to statistics?

I find that hard to imagine the majority has been used in modern tech and is now in landfills. They made coins out of silver for hundreds of years. It was just over 50 years ago that Canada and USA stopped using silver and some were still 92.5%. There is still tons of silver out there that could be easily recycled."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Silver interest is more than just about retail/industrial uses at the moment. Fiat currencies have a limited shelf life. (\~27 years being the average. The USD is the current global reserve currency and is pushing 50 years)
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This silver shit is totally bollox re cables. It and gold are only used if absolutely necessary... how fucking stupid would it be to have gold and silver cables all over the place.. copper cables are stolen and stripped so much could you imagine what would happen with gold and silver cables ..haha.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds like it but most of the producer i know go through closer to a quarter p per crop. And calloidal is a pretty big market. Ag users make their own from coins. But it's only like 200ppm so 99.9% water. That and silver nitrate combined make a decent pull.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"very very little if at all depending on manufacturers. It's far too expensive when there's so many affordable alternatives. Most cable companies use 90% of the distance between headends and serviced communities with fiber to nodes which convert light to RF and cascade to amplifiers that feed communities over Coaxial. I believe some parts of the amps and some the pads they use can have rare metals but feeding the entire nation that way would be impossible. If you're speaking of switches/relays in house, then definitely not unless it's crazy high end stuff but then again It's not too often I tear those apart and it's not often IT guys know what their equipment is fully made of unless they do their research. So you may be right in some aspects."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,How in the fuck is this credible
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The price of silver in relation to the current price of other precious metals and their rarity on earth is by definition:

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Where was it ever implied I wasn't mad?

This post is misleading, omits valuable context, denies history and argues that correlation means causation...

And I want to say 80% of the parent comments here **are frequent posters of WallStreetSilver**, which is a known subreddit for astroturfing and misinformation.

So yes, I am mad. Quite justifiably mad.

Is buying physical silver a hedge against the market collapse? Potentially. If the collapse is too big though, silver goes down with it. And this one is looking to be a biggun.

1930 saw silver *half* in value. And it wasn't even (potentially) inflated at that time like we see currently.

I just don't trust the current price surge and I don't attribute it to mines closing. Some 3/4 of all extracted silver is still extracted as a byproduct from other minerals.

Extraction of silver has increased in the last decade, not decreased as *multiple bias outlets would have you believe*.

We aren't running out of silver. The price will always form an equilibrium and it literally has legislation from the Federal Reserve to prevent it from be squeezed. 30 year old legislation."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Should have emailed Mrs Russell. She’s the one in charge anyway
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,GUH
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Best bet is to tweet @FTSERussell and ask for answers. They hold all the cards. Below is my tweet to them...

@FTSERussell Just curious as to what happened to @UWMlending preliminary inclusion to the Russell 1000 and 3000 index then not included. Concerned shareholder inquiring."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Been selling a CC on my shares. Was hoping to get it called away this week but now it looks like I'll just selling it on spikes and buying back on dips the next couple months.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,We are going longer then your wifes boyfriends dick.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you get a silver of hope? Are you telling me to buy silver. Ok. I’m in

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got another response, all they said was “we will attempt to correct their misunderstanding, but there is no guarantee anything will change”.  Pretty generic"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mh yeah. But if it's really completely unilateral, they can't do anything basically. And might just not be at fault. Comes at a very bad time though."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I genuinely thought it will hurt their bottom along rkt because won’t finance as much

Luckily I think I’m skeptical of what information I stumble upon, and what the sources are etc. I like science a lot and figuring out what’s reliable and trustworthy is essential.

I am having a ton of fun learning and earning though ;)"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Remember OP if you leave your GME “stock” with Robinhood it doesn’t actually exist. You may not be able to sell it if the price goes astronomical.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Thing is they will get rid of that pesky sell button when it happens. Get out now man.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Don’t apologize for shit. Do whatever tf u wanna do

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,All these apes yapping about RH and I’m just trying to find more info in the comments about covered calls. My 169 shares need some side action.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Just do a partial transfer (GME shares only) and it'll be done in 24-48 hours.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,On RH you're not influencing the stock price. Get out.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Everyone should be transferring out of RH right now,if you are a true diamond hands your not gonna sell anyway.

However transferring out of RH forces them to turn ur IOU stock into a real one. Fucken RH is a joke."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope your account is a cash account and not an RH Gold.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Guys don’t fucking post your position. Wtf is wrong with you all. It’s looks like you playing double game here. Is it so hard to not post your position. Bunch of pussys

So... Never?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sell a weekly call and make $6,000 pussy"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,No need to wait. You can transfer your RH securities to a different broker. It only takes a couple of days.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you start the transfer now you will still be able to do what you want with your shares until the moment Robinhood sends them over, you won’t miss out. I had the same fear but after talking to fidelity I jumped right on it. This is the way"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm sure they will figure out a way to fuck everyone over again.  If it were me, I'd jump off that ship yesterday.  Good luck."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Imagine thinking you'll get a piece of the pie from this mythical ""squeeze"" and still being on the 1 broker that already proved they'll fuck you sideways if it starts to get out of hand. You've had months now."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Anyone here having troubles withdrawing their money from RH? I tried today and they won't let me. So on top of their fuckery they're now holding my money hostage. I'm pissed and have sent them emails because their customer service is fucking awful. 

So my main concern is when my positions finalize transferring to Fidelity they close my RH account with my money still in it"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,🐐
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck dude, same boat. 

Did you do the switch to cash account steps on your RH? I honestly can’t keep up with what is shill shit and what isn’t at this point. 

I did the thing where you cancel instant deposit and gold and switch your account to cash. I don’t know if it matters or not. Not advice not anything just my 2 cents worth of typing."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"We all will.  Have Fidelity, GME in RH because I am stupid."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,When the squeeze happens RH will crash and you'll be fucked...
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Fellow cc seller. When is the best time do you find the best to sell a weekly? Friday prior? While it’s volatile? When the price is high?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m doing the same. I’ve got other accounts with Webull and TDameritrade but I’m thinking about closing them all and moving over to Fidelity......decisions decisions....but I definitely didn’t want to wait for the couple day transfer just in case something pops off for us apes.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Transfer to fid
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fk it. I'm transferring. It'll take days from them to cover so fk it. I highly doubt the ER tuesday will be the trigger for the squeeze.

I've held off from transferring since start of February thinking the squeeze will happen."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"i get it but it will be the squeeze you miss when they block you from selling off. 

RH, helping you Hodl since Jan 2021"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Transfer now ffs
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,The squeeze already happened tho?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel you here, im in RH currently, HUGE fuckin mistake as I'm waiting on them to buttfuck my ability to sell during the MOASS up ahead."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This moron is still holding on RH - NGMI
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I did a partial transfer of my GME to fidelity..did in batches..first batch came thru within 24hrs..hopefully next lot will be done my Monday..also opening Account took 10-12mins total online..managed to speak with an actual agent too ha.. ‘for what it’s worth’ buddy
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,When did you buy?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"just transfer the whole thing, doesnt take long"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn.  You are sitting pretty. Hold for the rest of us. We need that candle to hold the ones that are bullish about the stock.  I’m holding. Til 0 or to realistic heights. 3,000 plus"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Do a partial to fidelity and it will take a couple days max
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,They gave me a free share of apple I ain’t leavin
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You can still move with your positions man
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I initiated Wednesday to fidelity from RH. Just completed today. Best of luck friend
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks bud
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Ngl I would get out of robinhood even though the squeeze hasn’t happened yet. I wouldn’t be surprised if Robinhood finds a way to fuck over their users again
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gonna suck when RH ""goes down"" at the top of the squeeze"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Can't sell if it's locked up in a transfer to a new broker. Just sayin
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Is that gme??
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Looks like Fidelity is the way to go.. I have E*Trade, they’re pretty good to me tho."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,How many option call can you make... Cause I had to call under sndl and I went over my strike price and RH cancle my order can they do that?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,r/diamond_hands
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way 💎🙌
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You shouldn't post your position.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Welcome to Fidelity

 where you actually have a phone number you can call and talk to someone in person if you have a problem. How about that !"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,RH might have liquidity problems if the squeeze does happen. Earlier the better. Squeezes take weeks to develop. Just transfer now for your own good. A lot of shady shit being exposed with RH.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Why you post your position?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm staying until the squeeze is squoze.  In the actual squeeze it won't matter who your broker is.  The whole market will be in flames except GME. No broker will be happy about it.

And I know as soon as I hit that transfer button it will start.  If someone wants to pay me to sacrifice my 169 shares and start the squeeze tomorrow I'll do it.  🤣"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, to the 🌕🚀"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Transfer in kind.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I just started a transfer to Fidelity and I'm afraid I fucked up and will miss the squeeze.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks .Who your platform and you like them?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m sorry in advance for a dumb question but can one tell me how I go about switching from rh to fidelity? I dumb new ape who has his life savings in 98 % GME. Any help would be much appreciated 🤙🦍🚀
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good luck selling.. squeeze happens, hits Sell button, notification “I’m sorry we are unable to process this request at this time” GME returns to earth. u/fllwoman holds bag 💼"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Almost all brokerages did the same thing, nobody else has as good of a mobile app as RH"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,How will you close your account when they lock your ability to sell during the squeeze? lol
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol, squeeze? What squeeze? You're on robinhood, they'll lock you out from selling or force your sale early. You won't be here for the squeeze."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Just make sure you set your account to cash so that they have to actually buy your shares.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,youve been forgiven
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Take profits while you can Einsteins.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,We don’t look back.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"SAME

Release the tightness in your chest

I had no idea how much weight i was carrying on my shoulders before I switched from ally to Fidelity

Edit - why would someone downvote me for this? Really?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Mine too!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Mine did as well!!!!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Their the same day
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m thinking about transfer. But need an iOS app. The app seams not available anymore..? Any ideas why and if they are working on it?
Or is there an restriction for non american users?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"My transfer from RH to Fidelity got denied twice now, I just want out of RH man 🥲🥲🥲🥲 feel like my shares are being held hostage"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Although covered calls might be a gamble for quick gain, I buy shares as covered calls help hedgies a lot."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,What does chase charge per contract on options trades?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you think RH would block selling, you’re very naive."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Your*
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I like it at or below $500. But only because I can't buy more above that.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I do. Each week.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,When the price is increasing. I tend to sell to open on Mondays or Tuesdays.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bought the option on December 2, exercised it on January 15."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Am I a bag holder at $21 when I sell CCs each week on the IV?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"do you know if you can transfer all of your account/portfolio to Webull (only other account I got) and if so, is that a wise choice or is Webull also a corrupt shitbag?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol...I put in a transfer last weekend that still has not gone through. So not all have the same results as you
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Wtf mine says up to 14 days after the filing. Its been a week since i initiated it and the paper still hasn’t been filed
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Because there are shills in here. BUY THE DIP AND HODL. not financial advise crayon eater here.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just performed the transfer through the actual fidelity website, granted I’m using safari on an iPhone, but I only downloaded the fidelity app after the transfer went through."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,How much premium are u pocketing per week roughly ?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,How far up are you selling calls? I had 100 shares @$10 but sold about 40 on the run up past 300 2 weeks ago. Thinking to buy in and sell calls too but I can't decide what strike to pick weekly.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Cool. Learned something new. I need to sell covered calls.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You can sell the call at any price above your cost basis if you're fine with selling those shares at the strike price.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You need a minimum 100 shares to sell covered calls.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can sell as cash secured put on a stock with decent IV. Once you get assigned, you now own 100 shares of x stock. You can keep selling covered calls with your 100 shares as collateral until someone exercises. Look at some youtube videos and look into r/thetagang"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,My first attempt was denied. Id email RH for an explanation. Call Fidelity and see if they have any info. My issue was RH needed proof of my transfer that it was initiated by me
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't use Smartstreet.  It was way too busy for me.  For me, the simpler the better.  That's one thing I did love about RH.  I just use Schwab's regular portfolio page under Trades.  They also have my open orders listed on the right, along with any filled orders.  I've gotten used to it but I still keep RH's tabs open next to Schwab's on my pc just to follow the daily charts of the stocks I own."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Took me 48 hours to send 800 shares from RH to fidelity using a partial transfer of only that stock
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I just did it, took 10 minutes with a guide a guy made on Reddit. The actual transfer took about 24 hours."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Mine said that but then it transferred in about 24 hours (partial transfer of my GME only).
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"They said like a week for me, too 2 or 3 days"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"ok, well, they did it before. while they might not do it again out of fear of consequence i still would not trust them for clear reasons."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck yes
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Just started with calls on RH and have been seeing the same issues where my ITM calls get sold late or not at all
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have a few investment accounts sprinkled around and td and fidelity told me that they wouldn't have an absolute max on limit order sales if this shit goes above $1M, whereas Ally said they are definitely limited to $999,999.99 limit orders...."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I transferred out and i had no money in robinhood to pay for transfer and they charged me 240. They transferred 1 stock and 3 out of the money calls to my fidelity acc and i had to sell a stock to give robinhood the money for the rest of my stock to transfer. The only stock they transferred to fidelity was GME 😂😂😂
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I have been on other platforms and have found that TD is much better thsn the rest.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hope the SEC looks into people holding GME shares and seeing if RH has a ""special treatment"" because you hold GME you will get least priority."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Initiated mine on 17th, they said it would be done the 24th but was done this morning."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"They also restricted trading, but reversed the decision before RH did.  Personally I would avoid."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can just transfer. Not fin advice, but if you sell first, you’ll owe taxes on the gains. RH doesn’t seem to transfer fractional shares, even if the platform that you’re going to supports them. Also make sure you don’t have any crip-toe in your RH or it will screw it up. If you bought shares recently, won’t transfer before the transaction is settled."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It varies every week, depending on what the price of the stock is doing.  I'm thinking next weeks CC will be for about $4k.  For those that are interested, check out r/thetagang and read the wiki, watch some youtube videos, etc. to learn more about it."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same, super easy."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,They didn’t block selling the first time. They stopped buying.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Glad I’m not imagining it. Watch your bid/asks when things start going your way... I know price movement and volume can cause the gap between the two to increase. I haven’t been trading options long, but have never seen a bid ask go from $.10 to .01-2.90 before."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Seems like a lot of the transfers from the 17th completed on Saturday. My account says it was completed on Friday. Hmmmm🤔 wasn’t there a spike on Friday? Can’t just be a coincidence
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats entirely possible
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Let us know. I am planning to do the same move as well.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,So what's the strategy in OP's position?  At what price would he set his strike price to be able to sell the contract and still keep all his shares?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey bro I own 515 share can you tell me how to do that?  I am a newbie..
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,So I have over 100 shares but at $200 average. Should I be doing this?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm still learning this calls and covered calls...  What I'm understanding is you paid $21 per share.  If you sell say a $600 CC, and the buyer exercised it (whatever the current trading price is at the time he executes), you sell him your 100 shares for $600?each, plus he's already paid you for the contract.  But if they dont exercise, for whatever reason, you still have the shares, and you sell another contract the following week?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,At what strike? Have 100 shares as well but only even see it at 1k max around $300.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,So this is a complex topic the honesty would get better answers I r/options or theta gang but the short version is options have a delta value that is related to their chance of expiring out of the money and you pick a delta / premium that leaves you room to get paid even if you are wrong on direction.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"22/12000= 0.18% return every week. .18*52 weeks = 9.5% return for the year. That’s pretty decent just for holding aapl long term, and you can still sell those 100 shares if it goes up like crazy"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you not aware of what happened on Jan 27th during the last rocket of GME? Robinhood literally turned off the buy button mid trading day.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"DFV literally did the same thing, fool"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah RH really is a shitty platform when you compare the order execution to commission brokers on all levels. RH is just convenient because of the mobile app that's it. The lack of an options contract fee starts to lose its value when you really look into it.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Mine were finished today I believe so yes
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good point, I had wondered that too.  There was a ‘theoretical’ discussion that if RH was engaged in Shady shit (contrary to what they just told us), that if they had to actually purchase the shares then itd cause a spike when they did so. Hmmm 🤔"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s a hard question to ask and is complete up to your thesis on the underlying stock. This is your decision to make. If you’re theorizing the stock Won’t go above $350 next week and you’re 99% sure of it, then you could make what you consider a safe bet by selling a weekly $360 call and maximize your profitability. 

If you’re more along the lines of a 50/50 feeling it’ll actually moon and are worried about lost profit margin, you would maybe want to bump up your call strike price to $690 and even if it moons past $690, you’ll still collect mad profits and should still be happy about that."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Forgive my direct assumptions, are you on RH?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your average has no affect on the outcome of selling covered calls since it is literally a contract to sell your shares. It doesn’t matter if you paid $2 or $200. Your risks of reaching an ITM (in the money) expiration, and being forced to sell, are the same. Obviously you need to weigh out your profit/risk ratio on what strike price you want to choose to sell the covered call at."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's really no reason to exercise a call since it's usually cheaper just to buy the shares out right since you're also losing any extrinsic value by exercising a call.  

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7DkT-e50sg&t=6s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7DkT-e50sg&t=6s)"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"thats not ""has control of your money"" 

Its fucking marketmanipulation, and should be illegal that they did that. But he is making it seem like robinhood wont let you sell or wont give you your assets when you request them. I asked for proof"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Definitely. Not sure what the fee is, but if I’m trying to flip some contracts that represent $700 profit, it’s worth a few bucks to ensure the sale executes."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Slight technicality you call is at risk of the cost for the buyer to purchase and carry stock is higher than exercising the option. Typically this only happens when extrinsic value is low or if there is a dividend coming up. Also with GME all bets are off people may exercise at a loss to force a higher short position and increase the value of other shares they own. This is abnormal market activity and would only happen because WSB is in general full of unpredictable traders.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,How would someone set this up if holding $298 share price?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes I am ... I was gonna leave after the squeeze untill i saw this post. I already open 3 other account webull Fidentaly and e-trade but i hear everyone say Fidentaly so i was going to move my amc gme and nok and few other due to the transfer fees.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"But say the stock went up to $700 and he paid $4000 for the contract... he ""could"" execute and buy them for $600 each, when the share price is $700.  This guy who sold the CC, would get paid $600 per share that he initially paid $21 for?  Like I originally said, I'm still learning and just checking to see if my thoughts are correct.   I know it wouldnt be sensible to buy them if the share price was at say $620, because hes already invested $40 per, to buy the contract.  Basically, I'm just asking if or when the buyer executes, does this seller get paid $600 per share."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I've only done contracts on RH but I saw floating around. 65 per option contract
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes and no. It can be good OR bad if something moons. 
In the case of GME (extreme example) you sell a $600 covered call, Friday comes and it also happens to be the day it moons to $630. You have the obligation to sell your shares to the contract buyer at $600/share but you also still keep the premium you sold the contract for ($20/share?) so you actually almost hit it perfectly in the end. OR, it hits $1000 that day and you do miss out on maybe $400/share at that point. However you still get $600/share which is a major win still."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You could also hedge by using the premium to buy more shares in case it moons.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,The one exception is if their is a dividend and your close to the money. Then it would make sense to exercise
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"How are they losing money by exercising early? Say the call contract becomes itm, but you think that the underlying security is going to drop before the contract expires. The logical thing to do at this point is exercise the contract now and lock in profits, right?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know that’s how it seems. It’s a bit over my head tbh, but I’ve read of some arguments/situations where exercising early would be beneficial. But again, slightly over my head to fully get that angle. I think we’re talking very minimal benefits, but maybe if you’re exercising 100 contracts, maybe that adds up, Iduno."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Or there’s shenanigans going on in the pricing of options and the contracts are worth less than intrinsic and you suspect trading halts may destroy the value of the options you hold. (Exercised some GME calls early in January and a couple more a few weeks ago).
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well I just exercised my April 16 deep in the money calls. I’m a stupid ape helping the cause and holding. If the rocket takes off before your calls expire and you sold a call you will miss it, I imagine somebody lost a lot of money on the calls I bought. Just Buy and HOD. Not financial advice, I shit rainbow colors."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed GME is full of exceptions to the typical playbook. I was just trying to keep it simple is all. 

My rule of thumb for GME: nothing is surprising, and people are doing some wild shit with this so tread lightly."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Your question is a little confusing. You’re holding 100 shares at 298 average and want to sell a covered call?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well I can tell you that on RH buying and selling covered options (level 1 and 2 trading) is quite a bit more direct and easy. I would do this. Start paper trading shares and options on fidelity to get your feet wet before you transfer everything over, that way you’ll be ready. As for the how-to portion, my suggestion is just YouTube and Google it. There’s endless help and guides out there to help direct you step by step. Ultimately you need to understand fully how they work before you take on the how-to and start trading them."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't get me wrong, I'd happily accept sooner"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yis!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nope, what you do is sell the contract back to the market if you want to lock in your profits. When a contract is in the money, it has intrinsic value. Well an options contract also has extrinsic value. Which is the amount of time left on the contract, and the idea that the stock can still continue to move deeper in the money with the time left. When you exercise the contract, you are gaining the profit of the intrinsic value ONLY. You completely throw away the profits of extrinsic value. 


If you think the underlying is at it's deepest point in the money and want to capitalize, then just sell the contract back to the market, don't exercise it. 

Here's a great video for a beginners look into options that I watched. It was very informative and he makes it easy to understand. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJjRnKpwDyw"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're not losing money, but you're leaving money on the table. You can almost always sell the option for more than you would receive from exercising it early."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is most likely still premium left in price of the option, meaning it's value plus the strike price, is more than just buying the stock still.  In an efficient market there always some sort of time value left until the very end which means if you thought the equity would drop before expiration date, then your highest price is to sell the option with the added premium.  In almost all cases you'd be better off selling the option and buying the stock at market prices.  Then again if you thought the equity was going to drop, why exercise the option early?

Example from an option I own

$BA June 22 $180c @ $95.70 implies a break even at 
$$275.70.  Current price of the equity is $255.52

If I exercised, I'd be exchanging $95.70 in value for $75.52 in profit (assuming you closed the equity immediately).  

Obviously this delta becomes less over time and you could hold until expiration if you wanted to exercise.

There's only maybe two reasons I could think you'd exercise a call option early.  Dividends or very little relative relating time value."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The crazy thing is that all the ‘wild shit’ is perfectly reasonable when you research how the market works, unfortunately for me I was doing the deep research on the inner workings why all the ‘dumb stuff’ wasn’t dumb the day after it happened so I will the highly prepared for the next mother of all squeezes that comes in a decade or 2

Edit spelling"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The downside of covered calls is that you may miss out on potential gains. If you sell a call for GME at $25 and it jumps to 300, you are obligated to sell your shares at $25 instead of $300. Worst case is if the underlying stock drops a ton"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I'm understanding CC's correctly, your biggest risk comes from the contract finishing ITM?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I understand that, but if you bought gme at 50 and you are selling covered calls at 800 and someone exercises early then you made a shitload of money regardless"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah haha
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, you have to hold the shares to at least the expiry date and you risk missing out on upside if the stock moves above the strike price.

You are basically saying ""I will sell you my shares for $XXX, on or before YYY. If you don't buy them, you owe me $ZZ/share and I get to keep my shares""

.. where
$XXX = strike price
YYY = date
$ZZ = premium"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're right, but who would want to buy GME at 800 from you if the market price is cheaper at expiration?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm tracking, thanks for the clarification. Fidelity has a pretty comprehensive education section and I've been learning quite a bit. Seems silly to not take advantage of writing FDs during these crazy times I suppose."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"As dude said above it’s unlikely, but it could happen. Selling gme 800c is free money no matter which way you spin it."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's what OP was saying, and I concur.

I meannnnn .. if you think about  it .... you ""missed"" the run up ... so $200 seem pricey ... but you sell a covered call and now that $200 sp is $125 or less."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait, is there a zoom meeting I have to attend?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,voted hell no on their bonuses wtf
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Does everyone get a vote? I have 300 shares, have not received an email"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m not voting for any dilution because dilution is not the solution

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"3.26 million shares checking in.

I' (or rather, my proxy) am voting no to dilution because the company doesn't need the liquidity.  They weathered the storm and have money in the bank to see them through the the vaccination cycle.  Look at their cash on hand compared to operating expenses to see this.  The executive team has rushed to use the lifting of share price as an atm for quite some time now, but is no longer necessary to ensure the future of the company.  This short term infusion of capital not only harms per share valuation, but creates longer term problems for the company health.  Look at how $RYCEY diluted themselves into oblivion to the point that the only way they can ever raise capital again if through loans.  Or look how Viacom used Blockbuster as an atm machine to fund their purchase of Paramount for an example of how this ends up.  That's why Blockbuster doesn't exist anymore, not $NFLX or the artist formerly known as coinstar.  The only way this dilution makes sense if if they need the money to fund an acquisition (Dave and busters) or their plan is to drive the stock price down then initiate a share buyback program

Yes to executives because that's a formality.  Yes to audit, also a formality. No to executive compensation, they're paid fairly already and no to EIT because there's no rider that states the EIP shares are going to the frontline workers, which means it's going to be used as an executive piggy bank for bonuses."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought they are just voting on just increasing the limit for shares, but not actually issuing it yet. 

But if they do vote on issuing more shares, then it’s a giant fuck you to all the retail investors that bought AMC for the squeeze. They literally saved AMC from bankruptcy, if AMC screws over the retail investors, the retail investors can just screw them over and let them go bankrupt.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Speaking from experience, in public companies usually an individual (or a small group) owns the controlling number of shares. So while you are free to vote against the board's recommendation, it is extremely unlikely that it would be enough to change things."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Posted in response to an idiot that can't read. I have no position here and took 5-10 minutes to read the proxy/holder base and nothing else:

Proposal 1: They want to double the share count and increase their ability to issue insiders shares. That's why they are increasing the shelf. Class B was retired which gave them additional slack (100m shares) to issue more shares, but apparently that's not enough wiggle room. They are trying to make a poison pill, which you shouldn't want because that's mainly a benefit for mgmt.

Proposal 6: Insiders want to upsize their equity comp pool by 15m shares, even though about 8.5m remained, and they want to remove the expiration for the unallotted shares. THESE ARE NEW SHARES BEING CREATED, NOT REPURCHASED FROM THE FLOAT.

Executive comp: Despite nearly running the business into the ground, that piece of shit CEO managed to wrangle $20m from shareholders (likely undercounted due to the appreciation of the stock comp). $5m was a cash bonus as a ""special incentive"" to keep him interested. Guess what? That's corporate cronyism speak for ""we gave him a load of money because we don't' give a shit about stockholders so fuck you."" $17.5m in total to all executives, and the first tranche was paid in October BEFORE THE FUCKING FINANCING CLOSED. They were making liquidation payments to the top brass. That's some bullshit.

In conclusion, management paid themselves out by having the board rubber stamp an absurd comp package, they want to implement some sort of poison pill to keep these corrupt cunts in power, and for some reason, delusional retards like /u/jdrukis think it’s great because he is either 1) masochistic or 2) too fucking stupid to understand what's going on (probably #2). It's in shareholder best interest to get these fucking clowns out of the way, or at least provide shareholders an ability to root them out, but instead imbeciles like /u/jdrukis in the circle jerk cheer anything/everything insiders do because he made $14.50 in paper gains on the stock.

Just for added kicks, go look at the bag of bones this esteemed group nominated for the board. Old, overpaid white people that have been sitting on the board for too long. But ya I am sure giving them more shares and control is a good idea..."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Some of the sentiment and pure lack of common sense business economics is melting my brain.  Nobody in their right mind, after nearly being shorted and criminally naked shorted to bankruptcy, would intentionally dilute their business into oblivion and give hedgies exactly what they want. Adam Aron just gifted 500k shares to his sons.. think about that.. his own kids.  The same exact scenario played out with GME 10 days before it squeezed in January. 

The latest DD by some seriously smart(not me..I dumb ape) apes that have spent countless hours putting together comprehensive write ups as to the situation with AMC, and why it's primed like GME, to blast off.  There's more DD to be disseminated that puts the naked short share count at almost 300 million.  

The vote is forcing the share count.  It's forcing transparency,  along with the new DTCC rules which force the producing of collateral. They have to buy to close at some point which will rocket this thing.  This along with us apes holding,  not crying, is how we win.

I hold GME.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Guys vote NO, more shares lowers price so why should we do that?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know two things.

1. AMC CEO Adam Aron just bought more shares. 
2. Then Adam Aron gifted 250,000 shares to each of his sons.

 From the SEC Report: *""This transaction represents a gift from the Reporting Person of 250,000 AMC shares to each of his two adult sons""*

[https://sec.report/Document/0001411579-21-000025/](https://sec.report/Document/0001411579-21-000025/)

I'm going to guess he likes his kids, and he likes his bank account. He had to of thought the price now was a bargain even with this vote. Somethings going on here behind the scenes, looks like its going to end up good for current sharehodlers."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'll keep this short and sweet as most of us have short attention spans

THERE IS ALOT OF BULLSHIT MANIPULATION GOING ON RIGHT NOW SO LET ME CLARIFY.... WENSDAY THE FIRST OF THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IS SCHEDULED TO DROP INTO AMC STOCK SO THEY NEED YOU TO SELL NOW MORE THAN EVER. 
**There are no new shares being created** The vote is to raise the float percentage so if they decide to create new shares in the future they can, but they aren't and we would know that a month before it happened because it would take a SEC filing!! Stop letting Hedge Funds Manipulate you when you're about to make alot of money.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I sold all my shares but still got the option to proxy. I voted in favor of the apes. Fuck the execs that want big bonuses for the fuck all work they did.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"well for y'all smooth 🧠like a balloon.
if you want to go to the moon, vote no to 50m addition.

if you want to be bag holders with a diploma, vote yes."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I think they know that the voting result is going to be a big NO. Because if it comes out YES the share price is going to go down so fucking fast that they wont make any money on the new share.. If NO comes out in news the share price will skyrocket because of the share counting.. So they are counting on shareholders to vote NO..

The kicker AMC may have ran faster than GME by an average of 1 min 22 sec.


In lamens terms. The dip was shown off of AMC right before GME.

It may not be the case now, it may be the case....

All I know is, I've been trying to say this shit for the last 8 weeks but my karma was to low....

I'm knew and found a way lol.

Its my karma birthday today."

WTF is wrong with people that they can't listen to differing opinion's and not freak the fuck out. The world is not flat... we are crayon eaters and Apes...fucking retards...no one should be asking US ANYTHING ANYWAY! You want to know vote shit...next time ask my wife's BF.

You think the ceo cfo and fidelity all bought 100s of thousands of shares cuz they were ready to dilute? They want MOON AMC2000"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m in at $13.33 should I bail or are there going to be tendies?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Shares.  This is not news! We have known about the vote for weeks.  Shorts are pushing hard to create fear.  This is NOT dilution. Yes it’s creates the opportunity down the road but these are not hitting the market upon the vote.  It’s basically an insurance policy if they ever need to raise cash at a later date.  Don’t be fooled.  HODL strong!

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been holding AMC since Jan and my avg is $16.50.  I voted no to issue new shares due to dilution.  It may not hit $16.50 again, but I'm writing $17 covered calls so I'm gonna make some 🍌 regardless of what happens.  If my calls get exercised then I'm not in the red either

Edit: corrected for covered calls"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve never seen a company with top execs that are more selfish in my life.  They are going to pay themselves out a bonus with the money that you guys put into their stock? They know the end of the company is near and that’s why they are doing this. Get out now.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is there an amc share holder that isn’t literally retarded? 

Deluding the already insanely deluded share price is going to cause it to tank and then no more squeeze, if it were even possible with the insane amount of shares out already.

And no the answer is not that I work for a hedgefund and my regular hours are Sunday night at 7pm for some reason you drooling asshole."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not that complicated monkas, if you own AMC or GME shares, just HOLD!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't this passing cause a share count to occur which would then kick off the squeeze? Seems like a win/win to me apes get squeeze first and AMC boards get their extra shares to insure company rule.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"What if the free shares from Robinhood are actually naked/synthetic shares?

When you sign up to Robinhood or refer a friend, RH gives you a free share. Some 🦍 have received shares of GME and AMC in the past. Now what if those “free” shares were actually the naked/synthetic shares? What if their goal was to have new RH investors sell those shares to drop the stock price because they knew it was getting shorted.

We can’t ever confirm this, but it does make you think. We already know about the Failure to Deliver for both stocks. We know how RH doesn’t actually own the shares you buy on their app. (Also get out of Robinhood now!) I wouldn’t put these free stock shenanigans past them.

But what do I know, I’m just an ape that likes the stock and snorts crayons.🤷🏽‍♂️"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"So... for anyone wanting to know the NEXT conspiracy is, it’s this.

With all the GME stuff going on and RH being super shady, they (Hedgies) have been able to distinguish the apes from themselves and MAJOR institutions.

With the AMC stonk they STILL haven’t been able to figure this out for the fact of so many of us jumping RH’s ship. With this so called “Vote” in parallel to the AMOUNT of shares sheet, this will give them their answer they long for since ol’ buddy ol’ pal RH isn’t there to share the intel. Just my 2 cents on the possible next scheme this could possibly unfold into."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is there a dedicated AMC thread all sudden? Did I miss something?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why would Adam Aron dilute the shares he just purchased, ask yourself that before you decide to become a bear. I’m leaning towards this being a reason to account for existing shares."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Movie theaters are not disappearing. Covid will in fact slow down any explosion of streaming blockbusters at home because people are sick of staying home. Saying streaming will destroy or shrink theaters is like saying kitchens will close all restaurants. Human nature is to go out and have fun. People just won’t buy blockbusters at home and if they do they will have big movie nights by inviting 50-100 people over (like big boxing matches on PPV).  Bailout for AMC didn’t expect a fast return on payment either given covid. It was a longterm play. AMC ain’t going anywhere. But ask a financial advisor before investing any money in any stocks!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit they want to issue more shares than total exist right now. Over double their outstanding shares!

Holding all else equal issuing that number of shares would cut the stock price in half. 

Obv that’s just theoretical math who knows if they’ll actually issue them and how the market responds but to me this is them raising a ton of capital by taking advantage of a stock price they see as waaaay too high"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I voted ""no"" (across 4 accounts... Yeesh) or abstain.

I think they are trying to create a short squeeze by tempting shorters, and then plan on selling into squeezes. That said they may also just be using the market like an ATM. If they also authorized share buybacks where they sell if it's $20+ and buy back at $15- it'd make a lot of sense and help swing a profit simply trading their own equity.

I think it's funny a subreddit for gambling turned into an investing club. Congrats. You guys are owners now. You care what your investment does. Maybe get them to add VRcades finally."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm selling monday if it doesn't tank premarket and buying GME. The management this week has proven they are wall street scumbags. GME never added a single share nor did they vote themselves huge bonuses. You do you but thats where i am at.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,In any case it’s some time until the meeting and until then nothing has changed. So no need to panic now.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The movie theater industry is primed to reopen as soon as society returns to a normal pace. Will amc deliver a new covid friendly experience; it’s up to them. 

Stock wise under 15, 5y ATH 33, sure seems ready to reclaim ground, and would have already if the bad pr of ceo bonus didn’t happen. 

GameStop and AMC could really win over crowds by offering competitive wages with healthcare as their retail / entertainment / hospitality employees are constantly interacting with people. They both suffered from low wage employee moral over the years. 

The gaming industry riding right between new console releases and multiple gaming franchise anniversaries has the storefront “ready for work” as well."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Why wouldn’t wsb allow AMC comments before this? This is a campaign to spread lies.  The share vote has been known for weeks. This won’t be dilution.  It’s shares in the back pocket if they ever need it.  Diamond hands people.  They want you to think this is immediate dilution.  It is not.  Don’t be fooled.  Be strong.  This thread is so suspect.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"lots and lots of misinformation by the hedge funds, shorts, and put holders. they are desperate to create new paper hands so they don't get destroyed. AMC 15 this week."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m curious, I feel like even having this as a vote is going to scare people away. Isn’t AMC just shooting themselves in the foot by doing this?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m gonna leave a comment here, doubt it’ll get noticed.

I voted yes to everything, it was the boards recommendation and Daddy Aron knows that his company has been heavily shorted for over a year now and is clearly on board with us. He WOULD NOT issue more shares to dilute the share price and give HF’s more ammo to short. He’s voting for the ability to create more as needed in case of a potential acquisition such as Netflix or Amazon buying out AMC theaters. If the board recommends you vote yes, vote yes. We will all get our tendies. The only thing you have to do is buy and HODL. I’ve never had more conviction in my life that we will squeeze and that idiot who keeps giving AMC A .01 cent price target will shit his pants when it does. Amen brothers, have a good weekend 🦍"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cash raise may not be liquidity issues, may be in part for a buyout.  Alamo draft house just declared bankruptcy two weeks ago and is a huge chain down in Texas with large revenue stream pre covid primarily from alcohol and food sales. They have a good reputation as being one of the few places worth going to see an actual movie in theaters down here in Texas. Post covid I think it would make sense to see consolidation in theater space and AMC seems the likely candidate to take over on a fire sale and could look to expand the Alamo brand/concept beyond Texas. 

Disclosure. Not a current shareholder but watching intently to get back in."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok so this is really odd, there was a conspiracy going around about 45 million shares being bought and sold after the bell going around Twitter, I say that this is just the closing prints from the nyse auctions and is a high number because of the quad witching, I go on to say I do believe there is fuckery going on but not with this... then get blocked by at least 5 AMC pushing accounts.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"My average is $12.2...is there gonna be a panic so I should set a stop loss, get out then get back in long?  Should I make it simply and buy the dip? Should I just close my eyes and hide?

I need to find my magic 8-ball so I know what to do"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"So I think the market is going to assume the measures pass.  So Monday the market will start pricing that in.   After hours it is trading at 13.58, which is 6 dollars away from it's 52 week high.  That high was achieved during the first GME run up.

This run up was not as enthusiastic as the first.  14.50s may have been the high water mark and leaves the stock overweight.  Another reason for a sell off.

I think the share price will fall below 10 this week.  I think the motions will pass.  But this isn't a bad thing.

I think AMC is going to survive.  I think that money goes to pivoting the business as well as bonuses.  I think people will focus on the bonuses part and drive the price down.

My approach has been ride the thing until I think the high has been hit, then ride it down and eventually rebuy lower than when I first bought it.

Not financial advice, I'm retarded."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I vote in favour of management’s recommendation.

The vote has been known for a few weeks but voting only began yesterday. I believe the stock price by the end of the week will reflect how people think the vote will go.

In other words if you think people think the vote will be successful get out now, but if you think people think the vote will fail double down (though if there’s no dilution think about how amc can stay solvent). Remember, the stock market is a measure of sentiment - the vote doesn’t need to be complete for the stock to move, nor do shares need to be diluted now for future dilution effects to affect the stock price now."

They will do well this year, they own so many theaters across the globe (not just the US).  People have been angry at home and looking for things to do (just look at kids in Florida).  On that note.  They want the opportunity to issue more shares in case of the pandemic so they don’t go bankrupt.  I can’t tell you to go one way or the other because I honestly haven’t decided either.  But that’s what the vote is for."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"So I sold all my shares a couple weeks ago but still got an email to vote. If I vote, does it count?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"it's not the ones that vote;  it's the one counting the votes that matters.   Dilusion WILL pass,  good luck bag holders."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Sold AMC and bought GME last week.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly a lot of people here need to check their house for lead paint. 500 million shares will make AMC a penny stock. AMC was struggling pre covid. The CEO is paying himself 21 million dollars while diluting the shareholders. GME struggled through covid without adding a single new share. This stock is going to tank hard when these shares hit the market and short sellers will wait until its .05 a share before covering.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,What does it mean voting?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is it legal what they did to the stock last Friday??, if not ! What kind of trading system we have . SEC should rebuild confidence in this fuckery."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"imagine rallying around a dying business, saving it from bankruptcy, being screwed by multiple share dilutions, and still preferring AMC to GME

have fun when this thing tanks to 1 buck a share."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,what are the odds of a dilution passing?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is this earnings report supposed to mean anything significant? I don’t think it’s anything to get hopes up over. Not trying to be negative but just realistic.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,0.69 is not a meme
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,[My AMC Prediction](https://www.factionfinancial.com/prediction/b98b88be-8c6e-4cda-a2cc-0dd80bf40f1c) It has to go up.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fucking shils down voting, thanks bro"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,lmao AMC $4 EoW
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"stock is gonna drop so hard on Monday lol. Management wants to screw shareholders over, massive sell off incoming 🤣 go ahead and dilute it."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Diluting will be good for the company long term but bad short. Figure out your strategy and play accordingly
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,GME BETTER THAN AMC
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just sell shares and buy back after dilution if u like the company (u get more for same $ and squeeze is off the table anyways with amc givin out 500mil shares)...otherwise just transfer to gme, if ur in it for a squeeze, thats what id do (and did)"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh hell ya big bonuses for the top and double the float? Still in massive debt with literally no fundamental business changes? Been on a downward path since 2016? These 9/17 $0.50 puts gonna print hell ya.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,What stocks should I invest in right meow?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,No thank you
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,So how far does it drop on Monday?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The writing is on the wall. Get out of AMC, if you haven’t already. All you retards that bought amc because it was a cheaper share you are going to get burned so hard when that share dilution goes through. You see GameStop proposing exec pay outs and share dilutions?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone who has amc over GME is a goof and you’ll all learn very soon why
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dumping on Monday. If I'm going to be left holding a bag, it won't be AMC."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I voted yes for dilution
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Held at 5.50 but after this I think I'm out. Not a bot not a shill fuck the hedges but I'm out fuck you amc
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell amc while you still can
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I am really worried AMC will tank this week and I really need it to hit 16 in the next two weeks or so.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Friendly reminder that amc was never a smart play.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve revised my position on AMC: 17 tops.  I was on board for 20-40.  Hard correction coming.  It’s coming back to 7.50.  Get your tendies and gtfo.  You can rebuy again.  Because this WILL happen again.  And again.  And gain.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Doesn't AMC = ""Apes Must Consider?"""
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"What's happening with AMC ? Sorry, haven't read enough for it"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"So when is AMC gonna squeeze, you're taking so long to do that folks, why don't you just quit GME and put all your efforts into this stock?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC's theaters are trash and run down as fuck. new blockbuster. sell while u can
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is there a thread when voting is open till May lolz? The z was definitely needed for the cringe
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,SHILLS selling FUDs.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Since the voting is already occurring, does this mean all shares have been recalled? Has the squeeze been squoze? Or are there players that still need to get their shares and will vote in person on May 4?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Any yall ever actually been to an AMC theater? They're overpriced and suck big balls. Cinemark is where it's at. Like fuckin 8 bucks big ass fully reclining seats and incredible AV quality.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets," I have 2 opposing thoughts. I paperhanded AMC for profit last week because I had a 15.5 put, but still have 250 shares not as much as most of you, but these are my thoughts on the meeting and im torn.

1: Amc had a real chance of a short squeeze, but didnt have the beta or the longevity of game stop, movie theaters are an outdated tech and if you look at the world we live in things are changing faster then they have before. Studios can now cut out the middleman (theaters) take all the profit by launching a streaming service and charging per movie release. Does this mean theaters are going away? No but less and less of them will become the norm, just like malls are dissappearing as well except in the most populated or wealthy areas. Also Uncle Bruce for all the hate he got from everyone last week, and all the other shit streamers like the biggest Dbag of all The God Pill paying 200 dollars to tell Bruce how he borrowed 10k from his sister and paperhanded GME to be the only one to make 7 figures on it.
IMO The God Pill is nothing more than than that kid who had the code to Contra and wouldnt tell it to you but really got it from his big brother.

2: This is pure gut thinking on this point. Interesting date for the meeting, May The 4th, what does that represent? Only the most successful movie franchise ever STAR WARS. Who now owns Star Wars? DISNEY. Who made killer money on thier new streaming service this year? DISNEY. Who owns the right to all the Marvel Movies? DISNEY. Who stands to gain from buying one of the largest theather chains in the country? DISNEY! Sure Netflix and Amazon were rumored, but they dont own the rights to the biggest summer movie franchises year after year totalling billions in ticket sales. Who does? DISNEY. 🎤⬇️💎🙌💎🦍"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"AMC raising capital. Monday SP will fall to adjust accordingly. 

Bank on GME doing the same at which point price will cut to corresponding levels."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Wanda Group has almost 60% voting rights. AMC is effectively foreign-owned. You think they're going to bet on you guys to maintain the price? They're going to sweep money off the table at every opportunity. They've already done it multiple times.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The creation of new shares causes a SHARE COUNT! Read what at it says comprehension is key. They will set the shares aside, they will not dilute. THIS WILL CAUSE A SHARE COUNT! That is what we all want and need!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you own shares on more than one app, do you get to vote more than once?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm Voting yes, I Didn't have any money to buy more shares when I was HODL back in February when it was 5.50 a share. I didn't sell then, and I'm not selling now. So since I'm not selling, fucking give me as many shares as I can stomach for $0.01 YES.  I WANT MORE SHARES, I WANT IT CHEAPER.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Look from an email from your broker with a link to vote.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. You get to vote your 300 shares
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC is voting which can cause a recall and reveal synthetic shares. We’re mooning baby
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,When I see agendas like this it’s clear the execs are focused on profit extraction not profit generation
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,when will the results of the vote be out?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You may want to vote yes on the new accountants. It seems the execs are pretty reckless with their money.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"🙋‍♀️question, does this mean in order to vote they have to recall all shares first, and *then* decide to issue more shares, like force the shorts to cover first and then ask everyone still on if they think issuing shares is still a good thing?"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"AMC makes the best movies don't we folks? Everyone keeps talking about how great they are, and why wouldn't they OK? We have record jobs, there's more ticket checkers than ever before, and they're actually allowed to do their jobs. If you break in line, or buy your ticket illegally we'll escort you out. You know they only allow them in so they'll buy the nachos, can you believe that folks? But not us, together we're going to make AMC strong again, together we'll make AMC great again."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,They are trying to fuck us up after we saved their asses with them getting these bonuses on top of that
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Might be here
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Dont you mean a Disney + VIP membership?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC A-List was an insane value before the pandemic. I plan of renewing my subscription once some of the big budget movies come out.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I voted same way basically. It sounded like dilution so I was thinking that's no good and also no to compensation.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You claim to own 1% of the company?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,What about proposal 6?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,How is it a “fuck you”? They’re raising more money and getting more investors. That’s they’re job. Their job isn’t to appease you at the expense of the company. Their job is to save the company.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or they can do a split, and screw with the shorts that way."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Vote No on all of it
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,yes can someone explain
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,There are no sides. We’re all apes fighting on two different fronts

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well that ain't gonna work, because you guys get really emotional about everything, you'll start arguing about shit, and nothing will get done."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You should have received an email from your broker
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because issuing new shares would allow hedgies to cover their short bets, in which case we won’t like the stonk anymore. The fundamentals would then be more dependent on AMC rather than what the hedgies have done. I want shares that say “FUCK YOU” not “amc”, personally."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"We are voting ""against"" on all counts."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah WSB only lets AMC shitposts make it to the front page. Or if it’s positive about AMC it’s piggybacking a GME shoutout. It’s a shame. I can understand their desperation to keep GME people loyal but constantly shitting on AMC?  They’re as bad as the media. Spinning the narrative for their own gain. LAME!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Amc is a dying business man, that’s the difference. And now they‘re abusing your support to get themselves paid like this and basically slap you in the face. Really hope it turns out well for you apes but I doubt it 😕"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Your vote doesn’t matter. The board only brings up a vote item if the board already has the votes.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Can I have a link to an article on the Melvin suits? I'm interested in reading more and wouldn't mind having a pre-screened source.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,May 3 for votes to be returned.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, no. But like with most voting in America, your vote will likely mean nothing and the choice will be made by a large corporation."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep bailing on Monday when I heard about this yesterday. Amc is actually retarded. CEO bonuses for just staying in business???? Lol that's literally the base description of a CEO job even if unprecedented challenges arise.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Moving the conversation here /u/jdrukis so people can witness how fucking stupid you are.

Stay on topic this time. How is this good for shareholders? What is a 'licensed fs professional'? Have you ever read a proxy statement before? Where in my comment history have I told someone to trade or not trade AMC?"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are correct, ignore the shills. It’s ok to own $AMC but the amount of straight up wrong info is exhausting."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because i want more at my average of $6.45.

But that doesnt mean I'm voting yes, and i haven't even gotten an email."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shit wait a second, it's 500m not 50m? That kinda changes it a bit. Maybe we should just buy some AMC gift cards for our friends and family???"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Because its gonna make my puts ITM
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because it gives the company cash to make acquisitions, make pivots, and protect against debt.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Right there with you took All my GME gains near the the top back in January and dove in AMC in the mid 5’s a little while later. Looking good from over here. Also hopped back in GME when it was in the 50’s. Rinse and repeat. Tendie land.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a weird tipping scale where FUD goes from being effective to being clearly engineered which then translates into hold and buy flag for whales and institutions. The internet is a fickle mistress.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm more annoyed that regular full time workers at AMC have been out of work for almost an entire year while the execs are taking in bonuses with no revenue. The execs are the same type of slime that the hedgepigs are and they need to burn
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,yes
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop saying yeet.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,*diluting.  Pretty sure you meant diluting.  The irony of you using the term deluding (imposing a misbelief on n somebody) instead of what you actually meant is pretty interesting though.  Cheers!

It actually specifies on more than 1 occasion that a takeover is not on the cards. I suppose legally they wouldn’t be able to say if they were but they also seem to double down in the document saying they are not aware of any takeover attempts."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I like Tendies.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Shareholder vote to double the float. Board of directors doesn't need consent so it doesn't matter how people vote. On May 4 directors will have ability to issue 500 million new shares. This will dilute equity. If I knew whether this will cause the stock to go up or down I would be on a yacht already.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Don’t listen to these morons. Voting for share dilution and share recount. Vote no on dilution and yes on recount to fuck the shorts. Nothing has changed with AMC
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"A true retard, you have until may 3rd to vote, why wouldn't you wait for some DD"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Retards here may bash you for it but it’s the smart move
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cramer says market manipulation, lol."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This is how corporate America feigns democratic processes.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Paperhands
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m wondering if we might see a slight gamma lift Tuesday-Wednesday because of last week’s Option gamma? ... Aside from this, i also plan on taking my profits this week."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Join us on the dark side GE EM REEE. They won't ever take the squeeze away from you.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,So is everyone. Lol $5/share is optimistic
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Shadyyyyy rockel paper hands ape👋🏽🧻🦧
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Here for monkey ass.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,At this point buying AMC at $14 a share is one way ticket to bankruptcy.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Right?  It’s all shills.  It’s dumb thinking amc would go bankrupt after they nixed that shit.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Disney, remember this post in may."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If Cramer says to dump a stock, short that shit becasue Boomers will listen.  Do the opposite if he says buy.

He's just a tool to manipulate the market for the HFs or his parent company.  Gotta fidure out which, look at the trends, and see which companies his parent comanies have purchased after he has made a hard sell/buy claim.  We need to do the DD and see if they are targeting certain funds to fuck them over or help them.  Or if it's all just for their own personal gain, along with his own."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Until you are proven correct, you are viewed as a FUD shill. That's how this works."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm in a similar conundrum. Conflicted between people saying this is no big deal and the price will maintain/improve; and then others who are saying we'd be bagholders if we stick around. I'm going to just set a trailing stop order at a price that I'm comfortable with in case there is a crash so that I can swoop in and buy the dip afterward (in theory). Not financial advice/I'm a moron.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,All depends on the immediate reaction at market open or even premarket tomorrow. Could open low on the news. Could get a bump from those trying to force the squeeze prior to May
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Anything that was going to happen is already priced in.  This isn’t new news. Shit came out the beginning of March.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,So buy some puts then...
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,get rekt
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,The value basically halves.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Voting is for May. Plenty of time for a run up
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Extra hummus? Hold the tomato?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Who said you being given 10 bananas?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're talking about a split, this is an offering"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"What you are describing is a banana split. This isn't that. They aren't giving you any more bananas. You will still have your 10 bananas, but now they have flooded the market with 500 million bananas so that your bananas aren't worth much. It may ultimately save the company in the long term, but short term will drop stock prices for years I imagine."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"A split is different from an offering. They're not giving you any bananas. They're just now saying ""there's a whole new forest of 🍌 available to eat."" Therefore your 🍌 you have been hanging onto is now less valuable because there's more available"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Who's got tha bananas 🍌AMC HOOLDIN OUT NANAS ON ME IM FURIOUS!!!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t have to worry about a hawk. I’m an ape, I could take it on easily."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wrong. 

It’s EXACTLY what they should do. You guys are fucking idiots. 

GME will follow suit. Mark my words."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean it's smart management, they basically used this year to get a massive cash injection that they desperately need"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wrong: the proposal to create new shares causes a share count, NOT the ability to create it. This means that voting yes has no use, vote no."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I get that, but with the ability to issue more shares could they deal with the hedge funds directly under the table so amc and the executives realise any profits rather than the shareholders"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Sort chat by best”.  And you’ll see
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,anything with an 'm' in the middle.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Both
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ll happily take those shares 🤑
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Most ppl vote no bc of dilution. It’s not a split it’s the ability to offer more shares
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You own less of the company, but the company benefited from it, so it's good in a way for the company, but for a short period usually, the price of the share goes down, and after you need more buyers to raise the price, cause there are more shares in circulation"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,the share price is 6x pre covid after all the dilutions. and their debt has a 10%+ interest. amc is no gme play. im just a smooth brain ape. 🦍🍌
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,They are doubling the size of the float. Of course it's going to crush the price of the stock.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It won’t go back to GME buy the dips
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you really think if this was overshorted they wouldnt just wait until the outstanding shares FUCKING DOUBLE? the fees arent shit right now and thats a get out of jail free card
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol and yet half of the 1 billion shares are still outstanding. You gonna need a fuck ton of volume
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's the pure size that is extremely concerning. 

Putting up 20% or 50% of the current outstanding shares on layaway incase of a bad storm? I get. 

DOUBLING the potential outstanding as a safety net? Doesn't sound like it's in interest of short term investors."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"They were hemorrhaging money pre covid, almost went bankrupt during covid, and haven't really changed anything yet. They have enough money to last around early next year. There is no way they're going to not lose money this year still. All they did this year is barely escape bankruptcy with no way of making money. 

They diluted their stock already and are trying to get the option to dilute it some more. They don't have to go bankrupt but the writing seems to be on the wall that the price is going to go down in short term and rise long term if they get their shit together.  

I do have puts for 4/30 7$ and 5/21 7.5$ for fill disclosure. But I had also bought 8000 shares when they were 2.67 and sold at 11$ because I believed it's over valued. 

If you look at this very clear as day vote it is not a good sign for amc retail shareholders."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Doesn't matter, as long as you were a shareholder of record by March 11"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe so
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s does your post have to do with the voting? Just shilling GME and creating FUD for AMC... not adding any relevant content to this thread.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Quit shilling GME, God damn... some of you guys are as bad as the hedge funds. 
Most of us with AMC have GME too, you can have more than one stock."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the stock but I like GME stock a little more now.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I was lucky enough to buy at 193 and saw it jumped to 227 within 2 hours and still holding hit.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It's in the water dude and some people are too far gone.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope your wife’s boyfriend gives you the clap
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Does Melvin pay you a bonus for every down vote? cause you're working overtime to get them! Shares aren't being diluted. You're a shill.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Go to the amc stock sub Reddit you will actually get answers
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,you about to get rekt
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You're fucked big time
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Issuing more shares at some point (from thin air). This is dilution and means your shares are less valuable
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,No
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,🤦‍♂️
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Going to the movie theaters isn't going to die, that's like saying because Spotify and other music streaming services exist that people won't want to go to concerts anymore. People enjoy the experience of going to theaters and will for a long time."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Eat shit Greg
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depends on the shareholders voting.

Who benefits from dilution?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Their earnings happened a while ago
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,The fact there is even a vote about issuing new shares almost guarantees it will crater on Monday.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I disagrees. The CEO has made it clear how much he hates short sellers. I highly doubt he will give them what they want. I think this has more to do with a share recount
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Major markets for their theaters (all of Los Angeles) are opening Monday. And this ""dilution"" which everyone seems to be very confused about wouldn't even go in effect until may IF it does even happen which it won't."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Doubling the number of shares for a stock whose price is techniacally people betting on the shortage of sales.. That thing goes so fast down to 1$ nobody will be able to make money out of new shares... I think AMC is not that dumm... They are doing this just to get the share count pass through.. They trust us to vote NO
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,And yet GMEtards complain when other people post in their thread. Hypocrite.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You clearly don't understand what's happening. It's about a share count.  EVERYONE IS VOTING NO.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Good luck Shorty.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Invest"" lmao"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,More like which FDs should I yolo in?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,He *is* a cat
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,squeeze to $20
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You clearly don't know what you're talking about. Did you even read anything or are you just spitting out words that you read from some other retard?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"They will soon

Big dilution coming Tuesday"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not both?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,How about both?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I own both
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop this bullshit. You're not better than our enemies
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,suck a dick
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol your account is brand new and you literally only talk about how shit amc is ....
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,lol tell that to people who got in last April for $3/share.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Ride the waves...
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don’t fall for this dudes FUD, just HODL like a GOOD APE!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,If Disney buys them out your fucked
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Be careful the gme tards are downvoting anything with amc in it
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This.  You should totally give up your pursuit of a Lambo with GME and get on this one year bus pass ride over at AMC.  Bus pass gang gang!!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,">why don't you just quit GME and put all your efforts into this stock

..u got dat wrong"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Its coming! Right after they double the outstanding shares again ;) AMC giving shorts the easy way out they prob want that share money for themselves not shareholders
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I used to live close to the last Blockbuster. It's still kicking.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Stay home then boomer.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"51 day old account. Probably Didn’t know what a Shill, FUD, the NYSE, Ticker, or what anything else ment 52 days ago 😂"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"They hated him, for he spoke the truth."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Nope
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,False they have a less than 10% stake. Try again.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,More bad info.  Shorty???
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Every thread is sorted by new.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Each share is one vote.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,No
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"No lol. They are doing the dilute until it dies tactic. Milk it for all it has got!

 Vote against!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree on the bonus but if Disney bought them out would you vote for that?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha holy shit this is retarded. 

No. They are issuing more shares in a capital raise. Share price will go down to reflect new shares issued. 

Pretty simple you Neanderthals."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep exposing the smoke and mirror shares sending this bad boy to the moon.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I cant wait til that doesnt happen and the next conspiracy starts
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Try again, I had 3 options.  Worst case is you abstain.  It also serves as a message."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds like a pretty good way to have an election
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"For our actions to actually benefit AMC we need to actually hold. Not for weeks, not for months, but for years. Past the potential squeeze, and into the foreseeable future where they can actually point at their stock value and say with a straight face that that price is the value of the company. As long as we're involved that's not true and anything they attempt to approach saying otherwise will laugh them out of the room. We're not real value, we're playing a game that has their name attached to it. If you think AMC actually like our meddling, no, they do not.

But fuck them, I like the stock."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,No
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t turn in my old shares for shiny new shares. Not sure, if that’s what you are asking."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Funny you mentioned Disney. I shared an idea with a buddy of mine that AMC should make a deal with Disney to exclusively show all their products. TV shows, movies classic cinema etc. Rent a theater for your daughter's10th birthday and show her favorite Disney movie to her and her friends. How about binge watching The Mandalorian on the big screen on Saturday afternoon? Must be a market if the price is right."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Disney plus is raising it's prices....

***Disney Plus***\*, the online streaming service from The Walt\* ***Disney*** *Co., is increasing* ***its*** *monthly subscription by $1 per month to $7.99 starting on March 26, 2021*"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd say no to 2.. Why is Gary Locke on the board? He's my former governor. What does he know about running a movie theater business?

Honestly, looking at a 5yr chart of the stock. It's time to replace the CEO and the board."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"A quick peek at his post history suggest that yes, he actually does.

Nice theater, u/NrdRage."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hmm?  Your math is off. 2.26 million times 14 (ish) is 31.6 million, which is less than 1/2 of 1%. I don't feel like logging into my managed asset portfolios to find out and get the exact number.  Which doesn't even put it in my top 25 holdings.

As to your later post, i periodically delete stale comments and posts.  I stopped having to put a picture of every position ages ago.  Think the last one I showed was 12 mln on gme.  Not that it matters

Edit: I see I fat fingered a 3 instead of a 2 in an earlier post.  But even with that typo, it's not nearly 1% with you basing your numbers off that typo.  I also bought in nowhere near 14. I started scaling in in the low 2's."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,They would be on the hook for a dividend too.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Inaccurate. I use RH, bought my shares outright, and have received the email to vote."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"They are voting on whether or not to issue 500 million new shares.

Either way, it's crashing hard on Monday."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok I'll try.... clear your mind. Now picture a dark green, roughly 8'x5'x5' wheeled refuse container... often referred to as a dumpster, lid open and on fire. Now imagine that dumpster being propelled at considerable speed off a sheer cliff, traces of dirt and debris trailing behind it.

Hope this helped."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,We have until may 3rd just in case anyone is wondering
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I'M RECLAIMING MY TIME
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Wrong. Movie theaters WERE a dying business pre-pandemic because of home streaming. Now people are sick of being stuck at home watching movies. I’m not sure people will ever take things like movies/concerts for granted ever again. If they do it will be a long time.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The ceo himself has been adamant about how much he hates short sellers. You really think he would just issue a vote for share recount and dilution to help them?? 

And lmao movies arent dead and never will be. Wanna talk about a dying business let’s meet at a GameStop. Coming from someone who has a little bit of both"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"As Trump would say, “Wrong”. 

Btw go look at this dudes post history, idk if he does anything other than shit on AMC lol kinda weird tbh, even goes into the AMC subreddit and talks??"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Liar
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not true in the slightest. 

Of course they don’t propose something that is unlikely to pass, but there are plenty of proposals that fail."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Well it will be a lot more transparent than usual.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,😂
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"None of them care about their ""missions"" or ""innovation."" Elon likes to pretend he's a founder taking founder risk on one side, and collecting billions of stock grants on the other (funny how the people comparing AMZN to TSLA always seem to miss this part). 

Cathie Wood created the ultimate upside vehicle to jam fucked floats in faux-innovation companies with open flow gates to maximize her mark-to-market AUM tally to increase her monthly, cash paid fee take (around $30m a month now). It's not designed to unwind, and she's not incentivized to give a shit about how it unwinds."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not making that call. Stupid shit like this gets jammed through all the time without notice (yay passive investing!). This is just particularly greedy and of note because there is a lot of idiots, like /u/jdrukis talking about things that they don't understand."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Hop on the banana stand.  There **always** money in the banana stand
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I think you missed the part about no immediate share issue and the purpose for the shares. But hey, reading must be hard. Check out the Jan board statement too. 

Beep reminds me of the guy beside me at the blackjack table who isn’t doing so great with his hand so he starts trying to tell me what to do with mine. Doesn’t everyone want someone like beep trying to run your trades for you 😂"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Dying business. 😂
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,take a look at our government and you might see a trend. Old white guys have been running things into the ground for some time (point of disclosure-I am white and old)
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,nah not really
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"so ultimately what does this mean for the squeeze? obviously there is going to be paper hands tomorrow so it'll probably go down, at least on opening I imagine, and feel completely free to berate me as I know am a retarded ape but if I paper handed early to buy back on the dip does it affect anything on the short?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You only get more shares if you buy them.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah no
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Where is this misinformation coming from? I’ve seen multiple post about getting more shares if dilution occurs this morning.  Please don’t read bullshit and then talk out ass. It makes these threads needlessly confusing.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Excuse me? The Exec officers already benefitted from us. They should have paid off the debt instead of themselves 1st. Sounds screwy to me
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,yes thx
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I got a message/invite from Fidelity and I only held from 3/8 to 3/19. 15 shares.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,But did you get the Worcestershire sauce on ya chips guvna?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,when did you buy the shares? after march 11? then you don't get a vote
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m trying to get the word out to as many as possible!  It need to go viral
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,They having a vote to see if they should. Even that isn't until 4th may.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I see, I wouldn’t see another possible reason for needing the ability to issue more shares but I’m still bullish that if this vote were to go through as yes, shares WOULD not be issued. Rather it could be strategically used if the situation changed and an acquisition was on the table. All I can say is if you like the stock, buy and hodl. Everyone here is in this together, whether it’s GME or AMC 😎"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Indeed thank you for the insight

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah yes the 🐻 in his natural habitat

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,So they can keep paying million dollar bonus’ until they go under because no one wants to pay 20+ dollars to watch a movie in a shitty cinema?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way 🦍🦍🦍
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry your right,

Never my intention to bash AMC. 

Hope it prints for you guys. I really do."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro I had both, I decided to increase my stake in GME because I personally feel it's going to print more than AMC. It's not an attack on AMC from me, in fact I hope AMC goes into the outer limits of the solar system and everyone gets their tendies"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Good job.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Wrong stock bro
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,And you are an idiot. The vote is to dilute shares by 500 million shares. Or is this a made up conspiracy?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Movie theaters will still be here but its doubtful if AMC will be.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"movie theaters not going to die. Since covid, AMC furloughed over 26k workers, pay their own BoD millions of bonus, dilute your share worth, over $5billion debt with high-interest rate. 🦍🍌

Edit: for smooth brain ape comparing AMC to GME. papa Cohen increases his stake in GME, while the fat ass Adam is looting the sinking ship."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,the company
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This information has literally been available since before their last earnings call.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Will open at 14.50 just watch
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets, Bingo bongo!!!!!!!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This the same CEO that gave himself and the execs bonus last year with no revenue while his employees were out of work because of pandemic? Yeah I totally trust they guy...
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Ape no fight ape🦍🦍
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t think you understand what “everyone” means.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,!Remind me in 1 week
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yolo with margin....
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm curious and maybe you know but how do you short squeeze a company thats about to have a billion outstanding shares?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"So you think that this vote is to just trigger a recount? AMC execs can dilute the shares regardless of the vote and from their point of view (big fat payouts etc) it is the logical thing to do. Correct me if I’m wrong though, honestly open to hear your opinion"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You know there’s a difference between retarded and ironically retarded
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the way.

It works well cause I can usually buy AMC with whatever is leftover from GME purchases. Here is hoping they both moon soon!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ll take “cringe status updates I may have posted to MySpace when I was 12 for 1000, Alex”"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah ngl I don’t have any shares of AMC and I don’t intend to buy in the future, but to write this play off as dumb when early investors saw 10x gains on shares is just such a bad take"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ve based it on EW.  We’re gonna see one last surge to 17.  Then a huge drop.  Just my opinion obv.  I have a zillion calls on this, but I’ll be mostly out by 17."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Disney is smart. They aren't  going to pay for the company when the share price has been inflated by retail investors while at the same time AMC has already diluted almost 80% since last fall. There is no logical argument to believing they would YOLO and ignore the financials like a retail investor.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,That would be awesome if Disney buys amc.  I have stock in both companies. 😁
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,well GME will fall 90% before AMC falls 80%
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Is that the one in Oregon? Or was there one up in Alaska?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice self portrait **YOU FUCKING DUMSPTER CLOWN**.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,But let’s say I have shares on 2 apps - wouldn’t I get two emails?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Um yes? I totally did... Pretty sure you vote your shares. 1 share, 1 vote"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Disney is shifting its focus from theme parks to streaming, so it's unlikely for it to want to have more real estate liability.  Even if it does want to have theater presence, it's easier to build one up slowly than inheriting all of AMC's debt and rental obligations.  Disney can just buy up some old movie theaters and renovate them."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,If Disney bought them out then it would probably be at a much lower valuation. Disney isn't like the current group of AMC shareholders and will actually care about the companies financials.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Right? Am I the only one that realises all those shares are going to actually bring the price down? Not up?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s what we are voting on for proposal 1. Those 500 million shares will not be in the float immediately. We are just granting them the authority to do so whenever the company needs use; such as in case of a company takeover (owning a majority of the available shares) HOWEVER, we don’t know what the company thinks is best to do if granted such authority. So i’m leaning towards a No. Just my 2 cents"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re both right. There are multiple proposals, 6 total. One is the issuing of more shares, another is an audit which would cause hedgies to buy back their shorts."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Of course expect nothing less of the reddit cuck admins, but glooks for the mods looking out for us."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,🤦‍♀️
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Something someone was saying is that a company can ask institutions to recall loaned shares that would force shorts to cover if the institutions did so. Didnt know if this was what they were doing or not
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude so far there are only 3 of us noticing this, i keep getting downvoted for even suggesting it, thanks for lettimg me know i am not the only one who sees this."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Raising prices is usually a good sign for the company in terms of streaming. Netflix has proven that no matter how many times they increase the price, people keep staying."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats the same model netflix used. Look into it
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I reviewed his post history and there’s nothing there proving he owns anything
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn you hella rich. Congrats
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,wow what do you do with amounts of $$ like that? Do you live a relatively normal life or do you adventure often and do crazy things?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Class A shares are common stock, i.e. the stuff you probably own."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would it crash if there's a vote against diluting shares?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,IMPOSTER SPOTTED
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,So we hold.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Just wait til GME does a capital raise in the same way...
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same boat, no email. What kind of criminal shit is this"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got one for apha. Same boat, idiot and RH. 

Fidelity mobile UI sucks so bad though =/"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok i wish you apes good luck man, really do. Just me personally, 0 trust in that staff."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,GME has a vision bro while amc staff is old and incapable to bring change. Wish you good luck with amc but I have 0 trust in that staff
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,no one is better than Elon in collecting billions of green and space tendies from the govs.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm still balls deep in the banana stand (well with my 10 shares). I'm just trying to contribute. 🤑
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I never said the shares would be immediately issued. They are trying to implement a poison pill and so they are looking to upsize the shelf. Not once did I say they would be immediately issued. 

Nor have I said what you or anyone else should do with regards to trading. It's not my money; I opined on insiders and the proxy.

You remind me of the post, ""Idiocy and the Art of Getting Lost"" on Notes From Disgraceland. He is describing you: https://notesfromdisgraceland.wordpress.com

Now answer the fucking questions. How is this good for shareholders? What is a 'licensed fs professional'? Have you ever read a proxy statement before? Where in my comment history have I told someone to trade or not trade AMC?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Y’all are hypocrites, it’s laughable. Keep saying all people are the same but in the very same sentence you name white as a negative property. It’s pathetic how you ppl don’t see the contradiction in that"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah boy in a mostly white country, try again. Look at countries where people have different skin and there you see old politicians with that kind of skin do the same shit, be it black Hispanic Chinese or whatever. You racists need to stop focus on skin color"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Aight let me judge Black and Hispanic people based on their skin, too ^^ let’s see how loud ppl like you gonna cry. Calling out „white“ as a negative property is racist"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I think the pissed off ppl on Friday are all doubling down
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The squeeze would depend on buying and holding shares, amc holders would need to buy up all those shares."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, or if u have them already"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Then bail
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got my robinhood email late Saturday night. Robinhood users are shareholders, the CFD shit was made up bullshit."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"My email says may 3rd, 5pm eastern."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Capital.com trades CFD’s. These are legal in the U.K but illegal in the U.S apparently. 

CFD’s allow you to buy the value of a stock without owning the underlying asset. Meaning if the stock goes up or down you make/lose money but dividends, share holder votes etc you don’t have a say.

Don’t panic like I did when I realised last week haha, I heard the horror stories of RH and assumed the worst. You’ll still benefit from the squeeze if you’re holding shares with Capital"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Im sorry, but the news alone is going to cause it to tank."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao I change my mind, go ahead and buy a thousand more shares at open. Make sure to set a limit buy in premarket so you get a greeeaaat price. Good luck!!!!!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You think? Is the vote binding? Why would any shareholder vote yes for that?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok Bill Gross
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,cool story.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This isn't GME. This isn't you getting in at pre-popped GME levels on your way to glory. GME has a leg to stand on in terms of fundamentals, although pretty shaky. This was a pure momentum/ meme play that has fallen out of favor. I sincerely hope people realize that before they hold bags for years."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish you luck i really do.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,My balls aren't that big.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because on huge run ups like this, you do capital raises when you can issue stock at their highs to get more money. 

Why would anyone wait for it to get cut in half to get half the money with the same number of shares?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean numbers say otherwise but OK
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"> What do u think he's selling?

It's an expression >.>

> Do you think AMC has no debt and no problems?

Show me a listed company that doesn't and I'll show you accounting fraud."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,How does the company benefit from dilution?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,LOL what???????? those 2 things are completely unrelated. They were forced to shut down for 52 weeks because of the pandemic. He had NOTHING to do with workers being unemployed. Bonuses are good for the growth a company and they are usually paid out after meeting certain goals.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you don't trust the guy, and think he's just after money, then take the fact that after the news about the vote was public, he bought more shares, and even gifted 250,000 shares to each of his sons. 

If he's greedy, then something is happening soon that will drive up the price, and right now its a bargain."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol nothing will happen in one week, the meeting isn’t until May 4th..."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're like... actually retarded, aren't you?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,that's when you buy the dip and HODL
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I think it has potential (maybe) for one surge. But more likely it will just go squiggly sideways (13-15) for a few weeks then settle down to like 11-12. I’m selling ATM calls and making bank. (Literally 20% profit this month so far).
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If your priority is not losing money go buy treasury bonds or cd's.  I'm trying to make money.  I own both GME and AMC, but I think GME has a much higher upside.  I'd be thrilled if AMC hits $20 with 450 million shares out there."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,No. There are two of us.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, more shares will absolutely dilute the squeeze but *will* it force a recall? 

If yes, it might be worth it. That’s why we have a discussion thread, ya?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I got mine from RH.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Could happen. We shall see.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes and if Disney cornered the market on both theaters and streaming, cutting out the middleman, their profits go through the roof on the next spiderman, or starwars or little mermaid, a place for familys on both sides at home and in person, theme park attendance are down so movies will draw mad people as they open. Amc reopening weekend after covid 917 million, what would that do for disney if all those ticket sales were thiers? I know it may sound crazy but its an outside the box thought."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Not everyone posts their positions man
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is fully my opinion and NOT FACT. Take this with a grain of salt and do your own DD. 

Paper hands gonna sell because the ""writing is on the wall"" that AMC is gonna fall. AMC is not worth 14$ and is purely at that price because the sentiment of the squeeze. I think we all knew even if the squeeze sqoze the price was gonna fall regardless, it was just a matter of when. They haven't changed anything of their model and only escaped bankruptcy. Their first move being this is very very bearish for short term but bullish for long term. 

I'm bearish, I have puts already. Saying that for full disclosure. I bought puts a week ago. 7$ 4/30 and 7.5 5/21. I'm actually gonna double down and drop 6.5 grand more on the 7.5 5/21 puts. 

Also I bought 8000 Shares of amc at 2.67 and sold around 11$.  

Good luck to everyone. I hope everyone makes profit but it simply isn't logical."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Or sell. Lock in what profits you can save and buy back near the bottom?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Daddy cohen aint a dumbass like the boomer yall got in charge
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,They wont
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It would lock us in at 200 a share for a strong floor y’all gonna get stuck in the 10’s lmao
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,They should! Im not in GME.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,And we could argue AMC also has a vision. Just a worthless convo if I’m being honest
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,The Movie business has seen many ups and downs throughout its history.  Its not going away.  Make no mistake the studios make a lot more money from theater releases than streaming.  We might not see innovation but it's a service that won't just simply go away.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I never said it was good for shareholders. I said it’s not going to affect shareholders until 2022 earliest. Read bro. 

Yeah proxy statements and board notes are a regular component of DD. FS stands for Financial Services - specifically long positions. Reading between the lines is where we make money in the market. When hedgies tell people to stop paying attention, we take specific note. But my AMC stance is a hobby not profession. You clearly don’t like the stock so it’s a mystery why you care about it. 

But I suppose your expertise is far too above 50% profit. Hates money, tells you what not to do with yours lol."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Look at what is happening now in congress with republicans doing backhands to try and supress the right to vote of minorities and tell me there hasn't been a history of white privledge and abuse in this government by the majority which is white male and old (especially senate)
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,ur the one crying bud lmao
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, was thinking that would be a possibility too that damn wall Friday was something else and guaranteed had people foaming at the mouth."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah I just went through all the data and read stuff I think I'm getting it a bit, basically for the squeeze to happen it has to be all for one, one for all situation. So a bit of a gamble but as long as people don't paper hands, which I think there is going to be less of them now it'll work. We're not going to see GME level but they have to cover tomorrow so they're going to want to scare people, is that basically what's happening?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s not a split. It’s a new issuance.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"No. That's only when the company splits and you receive more , while the share price decreases to reflect that split. That wouldn't  be dilution as you maintain the same percentage of equity. AMC is simply adding more shares to those alloted, diluting anyone owning the stock. You don't  get any more in this case, your shares are just technically worth less. Anyone who was holding at the beginning of the year until now has already been diluted in their equity ownership to around 20%, while receiving no additional shares. 

To be fair, this companies financials have nothing to do with it's surge in value. It's financials have and will continue to tank as they continue to dilute. But folks who just love the stonk  will likely ignore these clear red flags and keep buying it."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,They are not going to compensate existing share holders.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd say #1 is honestly pretty close. It isn't what they're telling shareholders but even the dumbest companies will try to polish a turd.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because he gifted it to his kids, I think you are retarded"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Most of the shareholders are institutional (i.e. those evil hedge funds) and will vote to keep the company alive for long term growth over the next 5 years. AMC is not out of the water completely and still has debt to pay down. Selling more shares is a great way to do that, especially while their shares are so popular."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Check out this guys comments 100% negative. Hope they pay you well
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"What numbers? The Pre-covid decline in movie goers, or the tired of quarantine movie goers that will dwindle back to nothing?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,they get an influx of cash. this allows them to pay off their debt. AMC has a shitload of debt. Their earnings can’t keep up with payments and turn a profit.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"From one ape to another. Y'all can do whatever you want. I have deep expertise in human behavior and game theory, and something doesn't add up to me. I think you guys should proceed with caution.

Edit: my first award.. thanks!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"""I never said it was good for shareholders.""""

You imply as much your original post that started this: ""#5 is also good because it means they are putting 35M shares in the hands of the employees, taking them off the market."" You are implying the float will be decreased by proposal #5, benefitting shareholders and insiders alike, which is false.

""FS stands for Financial Services - specifically long positions.""

Licensed FS professional isn't a thing, and no where to my knowledge does RIA licensing offer distinction between longs and shorts.

""Reading between the lines is where we make money in the market. When hedgies tell people to stop paying attention, we take specific note. But my AMC stance is a hobby not profession. You clearly don’t like the stock so it’s a mystery why you care about it.""

And there you go again on your idiotic tangent, getting lost deeper into the woods with non-sequiturs. You and the QAnon people are the same breed of stupid. Don't confuse ""the hedgies"" with the voices in your head. Believe it or not, most hedge funds don't have positions here and also love to see Melvin get stuffed in a fucking box."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wtf, really?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Class A shares are what you are trading. AMC's stock is common stock
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Alsooooooo....Freetrade is just as easy to sign up to in the U.K. as capital is. They do not trade in CFD’s and you own actual stock. My plan on payday this month is to buy the shares I currently have on Capital on FreeTrade and then sell on Capital...don’t shun me for saying the S-word, CFD’s have no impact on a stocks valuation, buying/selling does not increase or decrease the price, that’s why everyone is so annoyed at RobbingHood, they’ve been buying many shares without impacting the stock price. 

Inbox me if you want a referral, I didn’t gets no free share because I signed up direct without a referral link :(

No to more shares. No to exec bonuses. They want more money actually make a better company. Not a better price stock company."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If your company is in the gutter, the last thing you need is exec talent leaving for greener fields. It does make some sense, but often the guys getting the bonuses are the same brick heads that sent the company to the gutter."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hold on, let me get some crayons."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC is issuing shares every month? Source?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry I thought its like a split
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,So why didnt everyone sell when they released news of an offering? I'm confused
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This tells me you don’t know much about stocks and the fundamentals of the market. GME has a market cap of 14 billion right now. This will go a lot higher because we have Ryan Cohen as the leader and this is going to be valued as an e commerce company rather than brick and mortar retailer. Watch the earnings report and conference call coming up on Tuesday where he will talk about the future of the company. Ryan Cohen founded chewy which is worth 34 billion right now, has less revenue than GME, it’s in a smaller market (pet food is smaller than gaming), chewy is losing money, but e commerce companies get valued differently than brick and mortar which is why GME is drastically undervalued. There’s just too many synthetic shares which is suppressing its real value. Watch this vid. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=I0WXg5T3cBE&t=410s. GME will be worth $500-$1000 without a squeeze. Because of the extremely low float and high short interest, this will go in the 6 or 7 figures with squeeze and then around $500-$1000 post squeeze. Send me a dm if you have any questions"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,HELP A DINGO GOT MY BABY! STRUTH! ITSA SHARK IN THE WATER! Why don’t you drink some water and settle down there crocodile dumbdee.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think they just create new shares out of nothing and sell them.

I might be wrong though. If there have been companies that have compensated in the past that would be interesting."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Diamond hands. Nothing would happen anyway till may. Hopefully all will be done by then. Because if it isn't and they go ahead then I'm out
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jesus christ are you truly retarded? Like, how dumb can a person be? How the fuck can someone first think that GME is worth more than APPL, Disney, Netflix or MSFT and then even say that GME will go to the 7 figure per stock at the squeeze? Like, do you have a disability problem or something? (No offense, just curious). WTF"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,When GME hits $500 it will be worth around 35 billion.  Apple is worth more than 2 trillion at $120 which would be 57x more valuable than GME when GME hits $500. You need to do research on valuations and market cap.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats been known for ahile chief. Dont know where you were
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,so shares more ? price go down?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,F
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,They want shares ready for when the squeeze happens.  They're greedy just like the rest of us.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,After the CEO gave himself a fat old bonus I got rid of my AMC for good. I sense fuckery and I don’t see it playing out well for YOLO’rs.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,lol fuck AMC fucking dogshit company w dogshit CEO
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If your intention getting in was to force a squeeze, There is only one way and it’s the GME way baby 💎🙌 Is and has always been the only play for a squeeze"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,So what happens if nobody buys your stock
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Oof maybe my 10.5p will printtt
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like a good time to liquidate and move the funds into GME. It’s for your future, you’ll thank me later. I promise."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank God I sold above $14. Happy Monday everybody!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dafuq, they're diluting it even more? When they went from $2 to $20 and they diluted their shares by 40+ mil, I got that. That makes sense. Company saved, a lot of debt paid. But now I'm hearing the CEO got double his salary for doing what? Wasn't he just a talking head yelling at HBO Max for streaming new movies. Now they're talking about adding **500 million** new shares? Aron -> 🤑. With management like this, they ded. We drilling back to $5."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Voted No across everything and Selling ASAP
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,dumpin my amc monday $gme go brrr
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I really hope to see more of ape brothers come (back?) to GME. If you’re in for a squeeze, it’s the only way it potentially will happen. It’s hard enough but with combined ape power, it’s getting more and more real 💎🙌"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,If they do this I’m out.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn. AMC execs rubbin their hands every week asking themselves “hmm...whats another way we can screw over our loyal stockholders”
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC has always been the shill brother of GME
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"AMC was never the stonk, only a distraction from GME... to the moon!!🚀"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,They did say they were talking about issuing more shares weeks ago...
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,They are about to kill the price
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wooow, let’s take guesses for Monday’s AMC price?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,RIP everyones calls?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Am I the only one with any sense to say it? It's clear their only motivation here is to get as many bonuses to their executives as possible.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This makes my Puts on AMC happy. Only have a few so nothing to get excited about.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are reading correctly , I think they are ungrateful because is their value is thanks to autist , apes and retarded guys .."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If enough idiots sell now, that might actually trigger the squeeze. So everyone do what they want."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"#5 only matters if the employees actually use the ESP... which will help the stock if they use it, but hard to say if it will do much to help long term.   It's a net positive however.   #1 is the gigantic dongus they are going to fuck shareholders with.   They can, at any point, dilute the shares by nearly 50%.  They can literally issue them at a moon price and buy them back on the crash... effectively shorting themselves.   It's fucking brilliant for the rich, and fucking evil to every retail investor."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not a shill or spreading fud but wtf is the ceo and board thinking? They are either in on all this HF fuckery or trying to fatten the pig before the slaughter (jump ship). 

Those fuckers are diluting current shareholders and giving the shorts more ammo by issuing more shares. 

If GME board/ceo did that I guarantee there would have been a major revolt. You don’t pull this kind of shit during a squeeze."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh man, yeah the first stock split is why I opted for GME instead of AMC."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought AMC 6/19 $9 puts on friday 🤣 I remember Wsb talking about share dilution in AMC like two weeks ago.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty glad I sold my amc once there was profit.

I invested that into gme"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Puts on amc at this point
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"TLDR;   GET OUT NOW, this about to bomb."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Get out and move into GME Monday yall.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,The solution to pollution is dilution?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"So many ways to reap the squeeze, but they chose to fuck the shareholders that saved them. We've got a traitor here."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,share dilution
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This has turned into a shill forum. Why so much FUD when no one really knows what is going to happen. Just vote what you think is in the best interest of you and that’s it.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dillution is never good, when you increase the available float the price of the asset decreases..the big kicker will be to see what the offering price is at.  If it’s below current value (which it will be) the stock will tank and it will require much more buying pressure to increase price..the dillution will probably put this in the $2-5 range...this is not financial advice, my wife’s boyfriend did the DD for me."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean... didn’t the ceo get a fat bonus, prolly suckin hedgie cock for an offering. Ditch amc and go to the one and only true squeezeeeeee $GME"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Buying puts Monday. This is the way.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Talk about the shills....damn gme shills...why don't we hear about the $458 bag holders in gme?? U can't throw that bag holders crap around...kinda like throwing rocks in a glass house...and btw, I hold both stocks...just stop with the bs scare tactics...still a month and a half away, and a vote"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,We literally get to vote on this. There will be no dilution quit being fucking morons
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not having all the proof to say this but... the executives are possibly trying to figure out a way to get the executives more bonuses. Oh and possibly executives taking advantage of ""squeeze type"" investors... idk"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"So... for anyone wanting to know the NEXT conspiracy is, it’s this.

With all the GME stuff going on and RH being super shady, they (Hedgies) have been able to distinguish the apes from themselves and MAJOR institutions.

With the AMC stonk they STILL haven’t been able to figure this out for the fact of so many of us jumping RH’s ship. With this so called “Vote” in parallel to the AMOUNT of shares sheet, this will give them their answer they long for since ol’ buddy ol’ pal RH isn’t there to share the intel. Just my 2 cents on the possible next scheme this could possibly unfold into."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you're a shareholder, your voice can be heard. There are pros and cons here. It's worth a professional conversation."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holdl, to the moon...."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Flood the market all you want. I bought in because I wanted to save AMC. I hold GME because I like the stock 🦍🤝💎🤝🦍
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,These clowns charge us 15 bucks for fuckin popcorn u think they give a fuck bout us
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Amc bout to be a penny stock pre soon
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,So basically share prices about to drop massively...
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Incoming fuckery. Yikes
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yikes
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"To be honest... This might be good cose we may concentrate one one stonk, gameStonk"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Sus thread with a lot of amc FUD 🤔
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is it me or are there a lot of hedgies in here?
Just Hodl It. AMC"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"~~Jeesh, it's like they're shorting themselves now.~~

~~Look, the company is in a shit place, there is a very good reason they were being shorted into the dirt. They've seen a chance to raise money which doesn't involve taking on loans, which is good for the company in the long run. They're doing this out of survival, but also given the executive pay controversies I think there is a certain degree of carelessness there too. This capital being raised may be a Phoenix from the flames moment if they can time a 'business model revolution' with the re-opening of the post-COVID world but I'd say it's unlikely.~~

~~I can't say that I'm surprised, the damage COVID has done to them has been extreme, but it's a sour taste all the same.~~

~~Full disclosure I don't have any AMC shares anymore, I made a modest profit on the run up to $14 and sold.~~

~~Once these new shares are out and the price tanks, it might actually be a good long play, depends on how they plan on transforming the business going forward. Not all hope is lost but if you were hoping for a short squeeze you may be waiting a while.~~

~~Edit: I'm not that experienced with takeovers, would a low share price make them a more palatable acquisition to the likes of Amazon etc.? Could they be trying to make themselves an easier sell?~~

Edit: Looks like these are just authorised shares, they won't hit the public float so shouldn't affect the share price. Expect a drop when people misunderstand this and sell, may be a good buy opportunity."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If more shares are released by the company, your stake in the company does not change.  The company will issue you more shares in order to keep you even.  This is done to devalue the stock in order to get more people to invest.  For example, when PPG did the stock split back in 2015, they cut the price of the stock in half but they made sure all of the current shareholders at the time kept their full stake, so they issued them the amount of shares they currently had.  For example, I had 10 shares, which equated to about $1K.  After the split, I had 20 shares which equated to the same.

It's just a move to get more people to invest...this move will not devalue your current stake in the company."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Being a company in the middle of a squeeze has to suck. We are fighting hedgies and hopefully us and AMC come out on the other side. I got a question if we didnt wait for these little dips to peck at shares and all bought more at threshold if that would make a difference, in other words, squeeze harder when the juice starts to come if we could get this juice?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,If it dips back in the 5-10 range I’m buying as much as I can. It’s a value play so I’ll keep buying in and averaging down. There’s a good chance it will dip in the short term but at some point this shit will moon. Diamond hands can’t lose.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Hodl 💎🖐🏾🚀🌝
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you hold shares, you should be able to apply for the rights to your proportion of these additional shares OR sell the rights to them in the market if there is a sufficient premium.    


Issuing new shares is a way that companies can raise capital from the market rather than ramping up costly debt.  


Remember many firms go out of business coming out of recessions/depressions because there is not enough cashflow."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh fuck, not E&Y... the fact that they are working with them makes this feel like a corrupt business starter pack."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It sucks BUT I will say it drives me nuts to watch companies buy back shares in good times and get bailed out in bad times. I like seeing them raise capital in challenging times and I understand it’s a meme stock and price is inflated but this is capitalism, it should cut both ways if people and funds believe in the underlying business then there would be buyers."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,can someone inform me on Bruce's background and why we take him as credible? like whats the obsession?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,They will be OTC soon if they keep that up
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Bunch of babby's first dilution ITT. lol
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"**left the same comment on another thread

I voted yes to everything, it was the boards recommendation and Daddy Aron knows that his company has been heavily shorted for over a year now and is clearly on board with us. He WOULD NOT issue more shares to dilute the share price and give HF’s more ammo to short. He’s voting for the ability to create more as needed in case of a potential acquisition such as Netflix or Amazon buying out AMC theaters. If the board recommends you vote yes, vote yes. We will all get our tendies. The only thing you have to do is buy and HODL. I’ve never had more conviction in my life that we will squeeze and that idiot who keeps giving AMC A .01 cent price target will shit his pants when it does. Amen brothers, have a good weekend 🦍"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"When you are part of a company, you need to attend company meetings. Did you buy into a company and not realize that you need to go to meetings?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Increasing the share reserve for the EIP could be a complete nothingburger, especially since they've indicated they're revising the replenishment/evergreen provision. Could simply be that they're cutting back the evergreen and want to authorize a large pool now. It also doesn't mean they're going to issue any of these shares any time soon, let alone all of them."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty clear its from stockholders.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s understandable for AMC to do this during Q4 and early Q1 when AMC had liquidity issues. But the fact that they’re doing this now might imply they’ll keep going back to the honey pot for years to come.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I honestly think it’s because they expect a squeeze and need to dilute the market once everyone sells to prevent a take over
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"So if they have a shareholder meeting I believe the shares are recalled and shorts would be fucked? If so, this will squeeze before May 4 and then drop like a rock?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just an FYI to everyone, that info is incorrect 👆. You can check both the DEF14A and the 8-K, these are shares on the public market, they are not internal shares. Out of the new 500 million shares, only 20 million will be set aside for employees. It is not a guarantee that they will immediately issue them, but it is providing them the ability to do it, and given that they have done this twice in the last two quarters, it’s highly likely. It will result in dilution if enacted."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you have a link to the sec filing?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Doesn't the share price automatically go down as soon as more shares are created out of thin air?

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"> They are simply approving the ability to issue new shares if needed to help maintain corporate control.

That's what they always say lol"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, you are not correct. Not everything that happens in companies is due to hedge funds. This is just good, old fashion insiders raping shareholders by trying to approve an absurdly large share comp package for themselves. If you look at insider activity, you'll notice most tend to dump for U$D after getting awarded, so it will depress the stock price by adding more sellers from asshats that did way too little for way too much. They are creating the shares for them to sell."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"So if they actually make this happen, let the hedgies have them take the profits and go to GME? They don't deserve monke, monke help monke, monke no fight monke, monke together strong 🦍🍌"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"They've been diluting for six months. Just google ""AMC outstanding shares"""
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,They've already diluted. This is them going for the dilute button again.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would sell if it’s $14 on Monday. If they dilute the shares again, enjoy a drop and then a long flat ride before something happens again. You will have time then to jump back on the ship when it’s lower."

Things to consider:

Why  would someone who has shares on AMC claim they'll publicly dump it asap   because of this news? Would inducing panic a good idea before that person dumps his shares? Why is this news being spread around like crazy like the CEO's bonus?"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't understand of what the odds are for a dilution. It sounds a bit unsettling.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Definitely. They still have liquidity issues so it’s needed for that for now anyway. But the major issue I have with it is the large bonuses and pay raises they keep giving to executives from these actions

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, not always. If the companies fundamentals support a higher price it usually holds ground. But in this case the price is propped up by supply. So yeah, maybe in 2022 the price may dip from whatever it is then, likely $25 to $20. Still nothing to do with a squeeze."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well not really. Look at SNDL for instance that just is like, yeah we’re immediately releasing more shares to generate more capital for acquisitions."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,For real AMC's business model for their normal theaters is shit. The prices are way too high for concessions for dirt cheap food. Maybe if they took the atlanta falcons approach to their concessions they could sell more and actually end up profiting more. The only theaters I see being successful moving forward are the ones with the premium imax theater experience (power reclining chairs and such).  People can grab 70 inch TVs for so cheap now most don't see the difference.

The big theater next to our nearly dead mall still has the Harley Quinn poster on the outside.  The fucking Harley Quinn movie was the apex of early 2020 US movie theater culture.

Of course you have to wear a fucking mask because Americans are too stupid to fully recognize just how idiotic the whole mask thing actually is.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,If we're talking competitive landscape GME has a much harder fight ahead of them.  AMC's competition is receding.  Better for AMD to make sure they have the capital to outlast some others.  GME needs to innovate to gain market share.  AMC needs to exist and it looks like they are positioning themselves to do so.

Things to consider:

Why  would someone who has shares of AMC claim they'll publicly dump it asap  because of this news? Would inducing panic a good idea before that person dumps his shares? Why is this news being spread around like crazy like the CEO's bonus?"

Where it states that common class a stock will be issued and available for sale in public offerings and may dilute earnings per share, equity and voting rights. There is no direct mention of the shares being used for internal members in a pre-ordained way, though they have the right to sell the common stock in a private deal. The EIP is being “raised” to 35 million, and it is currently at 10 million already, so they will be adding an additional 20 million to the EIP"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right, bankruptcy basically provides the business an opportunity to restructure its debt.  But the issue for AMC would be that bankruptcy would trigger default on all their leases and it's not entirely likely that landlords would be inclined to agree to a new structure when they have the opportunity ity to court, say, Dave and Busters or something in better financial health to occupy those spaces instead.  They're obviously special purpose facilities but I know from secondhand knowledge that landlords have been extremely nervous about AMC since long before the pandemic.  This company has been a pain in the ass for commercial property owners.

I was speaking with the general manager of a Simon Property Group mall in my area and he was complaining about this very issue like 5 years ago.  He wanted the theater out, and he wanted to replace it with an indoor driving range."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,What do you expect from apes?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,if dilution gets passed the stock price will absolutely drop though. Just keep that in mind. I hate it myself cause I dont want GME to follow it down but theyve been somewhat diverged from each other too
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This news is old though.  Fidelity provided an update about the shareholder meeting yesterday.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Only in your mind. If i was cohen i would just cash out my shares and retire. Why stress trying to turn around a dead mall retail shop when you could just be a billionaire beach bum?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hes 100% correct. The odds of GME not raising capital through a stock offering are close to 0.

You keep quoting revenue, but the bottom line is what keeps the doors open. And company turnarounds are exceedingly expensive.

Cohen isnt magical either. Gaming is a tough industry. This isnt Chewy. GME has a weak brand for the current gen of kiddos. Zoomers get their games direct now.

AMC is fucked. It's a crappy chain with many outdated theaters. It was dying even before Covid."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Apple got that way mainly through stock splits not through dilution. 

 Apple's stock has split five times since the company went public. The stock split on a 4-for-1 basis on August 28, 2020, a 7-for-1 basis on June 9, 2014, and split on a 2-for-1 basis on February 28, 2005, June 21, 2000, and June 16, 1987.

This is an aggragated 224:1 split. 

Dilution is like a split except instead of giving everyone two shares for their one, you give them nothing else and just sell that additional share to somebody else.

Apple issues some new shares for employee incentives, but nothing on the scale of AMC."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The previous three offerings were taken as positive news as they were done in small amounts and were good opportunities to raise capital. 

1) December 28 offering: 40 million shares, priced dropped from 2.63 to 1.99 over the next 5 days. It’s a small offering with a small stock price, so I doubt it had any real effect

2) December 31 offering: Roughly 10 million shares, price went from 2.17 to 2.09 next 5 days. Same thing, low amount of shares and low stock price, barely an impact to positive or negative 

3) Between January 25-28 they offered an additional 110 million shares. This completed on the 28th, the day after AMC hit its high of $20 during the short squeeze, also the same day all brokerages shut down trading. This one you can’t tell how it affected it, even though it was a larger amount. Sure the price went from $20 a share to $8 a share in 5 days, but that also could be because of the brokerage shutdown. It’s unclear. 

4) Between January 28th and March 11th, charts show that the outstanding shares rose from 339 million to 450 million. I can’t find any published articles etc that show a share offering, so they may not have publicly announced it and it’ll be recorded in their Q1 earnings. Wanda group did sell their class a back, so it may have been from them, but there is no specified date of this additional 110 million share increases that I can find. I would have to dig through sec filings to try to find it probably. During that month long time frame, the price started at 11.98, hit a high of 17, hit a low of 8.08, and finished at 10.16. 

So with small offerings there isn’t necessarily always a big impact on the price. With this new approval for 500 million new shares, it doesn’t mean they will dump them all at once, they could do this slow implementation where they drop them 50 million at a time slowly over the year, which wouldn’t have major impacts on the price."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes it is
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"EIP comes from existing shares. Mention of not immediately adding any shares and just keeping the option available to help their anti-takeover efforts. When you have an anti-takeover measure you don’t put the very shares you want to use on the market for the takeover to happen lol. Also note their mention of not having any noticeable dilution occur and that they do want to have the option to create more shares if they need to (instead of immediately).

If your holding until 2022 then maybe this will be an issue. If your holding for a squeeze, your weeks away not a year away. May’s meeting is great for us because it assures us they won’t just put shares out there (hence why they are voting to gauge opinion) and requires a share audit.

And ironically, that ""most work"" isn't even a lot of work... it's just leaps and bounds more than its competitors (which Chewy has since dwarfed).

So no they are not being held to prevent a takeover. I’m just reading it directly from the filings and coming to a conclusion off of that. There is no statements concluding that these shares will all be held off market, and given their history of diluting the shares consistently over the last few quarters for capital raising, its not far fetched to come to the conclusion that it is their intention to do so. Whether it’s all at once or in 3 or 4 batches over the year to sustain their cash flow, who knows."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It will affect the price massively, but not because the price is being adjusted manually because of a split, but instead the value is dropping because there is an influx of supply. It is not an options adjustment event because the underlying value of the shares were changed, as opposed to a stock split where the underlying is not changed. In a stock split, the total value of the shares is not actually affected, just split to be realized in a smaller amount. When a new stock offering occurs, the value of the existing shares are not adjusted, they just become worth less than they were previously because now the market is flooded with more float. If every single person saw it as a bullish sign and bought all the new shares instantly then the price would not change, but simply because there is now more supply than there is immediate demand for them, the existing shares lower in value comparatively. So the options strike price will still say the same “$16” or “$20” or whatever it was before the offering, but the stock itself will just see a really bad red day and be down 30-50%. *all figurative numbers"

-Proposes giving 35m shares to executives  

WOW, SOME GOOD INVESTING OPPORTUNITY.

I absolutely believe that a **good** e-commerce company that is centralised around gaming, gaming products and gaming culture (I.e. e-sports) is absolutely potentially worth 1000s in the *future*. Even if they are just good at gaming products in the e-commerce space they will absolutely destroy the competition. When Newegg essentially let its customers down repeatedly, 95% of PC builders warn everyone to **not buy your parts from newegg because of poor customer service**. People buy from Amazon, because they **have** to. People love microcenters because of the **low prices**. People use Best Buy to get price matches against MicroCenter.

What makes Chewy a $40bn company? Dog food? Cat food? ... lizard food? No, dipshit. It is damned impenetrable **customer loyalty**. What makes them loyal? They offer unrivaled customer service in that market sector.

I think Ryan Cohen put his money where his mouth is. He's bought some 9m shares of GME. He needs to buy more, too. He's performing a hostile takeover of Gamestop and its transformation will be once in a decade worthy.

Netflix went from lending DVDs via the post... to a completely virtualised digital giant. The fact RC tweeted a blockbuster with a poo emoji should give you a clue that Gamestop has *zero* intention of dying and being a poor company.

Bearish estimates are already placing it around a $30bn company in the next 5 years.

Let’s be frank, no other awards matter nearly as much. 

They are missing out on a massive market. They already produce major movies that could be blockbuster level films if not for a lack of brick and mortar platform to distribute them. 

Again I don’t see an acquisition in the cards but it wouldn’t be a bad move. Amazon should have just made the offer last year."

Also, if you don't have a position in AMC... why do you care if I'm telling people to get out?

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well you really need to get educated on the subject before you comment. 

Amazon didn’t film or produce Manchester. They bought the distribution rights to the movie in the US long after it was completed and premiered at festivals. They had no hand in the creative process. 

And they absolutely did lose on money, more specifically on the cut they had to pay to the theaters to screen it there. They did all of that to get Oscar nominations and the prestige that comes from publicity around them.  That was their very expensive campaign to build the brand for their movies."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s fine we just see it differently. I see it as they don’t care about the takeover part and they are just doing this for cash so they have nothing holding them back. If you think it’s just being held as a backup in case of a takeover attempt and then they will dump them in, fine. I guess we will see in May what happens.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're a stupid fucking cunt who can't even argue about something you supposedly already researched. No links, no excerpts, no justification. Just deflection. I took 5 minutes to look at the proxy, and guess what? I was right:

Proposal 1: They want to double the share count and increase their ability to issue insiders shares. That's why they are increasing the shelf. Class B was retired which gave them additional slack (100m shares) to issue more shares, but apparently that's not enough wiggle room. They are trying to make a poison pill, which you shouldn't want because that's mainly a benefit for mgmt.

Proposal 6: Insiders want to upsize their equity comp pool by 15m shares, even though about 8.5m remained, and they want to remove the expiration for the unallotted shares. THESE ARE NEW SHARES BEING CREATED, NOT REPURCHASED FROM THE FLOAT.

Executive comp: Despite nearly running the business into the ground, that piece of shit CEO managed to wrangle $20m from shareholders (likely undercounted due to the appreciation of the stock comp). $5m was a cash bonus as a ""special incentive"" to keep him interested. Guess what? That's corporate cronyism speak for ""we gave him a load of money because we don't' give a shit about stockholders so fuck you."" $17.5m in total to all executives, and the first tranche was paid in October BEFORE THE FUCKING FINANCING CLOSED. They were making liquidation payments to the top brass. That's some bullshit...but I am sure your retarded self knew that already right?

In conclusion, management paid themselves out by having the board rubber stamp an absurd comp package, they want to implement some sort of poison pill to keep these corrupt cunts in power, and for some reason you love it because your are either masochistic or too fucking stupid to understand what's going on (probably the latter). It's in shareholder best interest to get these fucking clowns out of the way, or at least provide shareholders an ability to root them out, but instead imbeciles like you in the circle jerk cheer anything/everything insiders do because you made money on the stock.

Just for added kicks, go look at the bag of bones this esteemed group nominated for the board. Old, overpaid white people that have been sitting on the board for too long. But ya I am sure giving them more shares and control is a good idea..."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If they do the 100m raise. It would dilute their stock less than 1 percent. The whales going long would love that. Because Games balance sheet would look even better actually increasing company value. They aren't doing a 10-20 million share offering. Only 500k. And if the price doubles then half that many shares. 250k at 400 dollars a share. 

Only retards would think gme following through with their 100 million dollar offering would be a negative especially if it helps with the e commerce transition. There is a very real chance doing it would actually increase the stocks value."

Also a reminder, he was basically proven right after being bashed and ridiculed for years in the financial press. He won/settled all the lawsuits related to his claims of naked short selling. They probably settled so no information on how bad it really is would be publicly disclosed. 

The problem is bigger than anyone can imagine.

Yes, he went off the deep end later on but it’s probably from knowing he was right while everyone was calling him nuts for years. The dude is smart."

I think your problem is that this doesn't make sense to you. It doesn't make sense to any of us. That doesn't mean it isn't or couldn't continue happening."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This isn't my investment account, retard, so your ""seniority"" means jack shit.

You want to know how a stock that was $4/share for most of 2020 suddenly shot up to ~$350/share at the beginning of this year following a campaign of fast-talking infomercials with cat pictures targeting you stupid fucks?  You seriously need to have that explained to you?

That's **exactly** why you're not cut out for any of this.  I'm bored of your bullshit.  Bye."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You want the last word, or nah?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s gold that the HFs are paying people 6 figures a year to try and analyze this sub and we just post all of the analytics for free on here for everyone to see

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,No professional trading firm is losing money on GME anymore. In fact they’re making a killing in it at the expense of retail. People forget that they make money no matter which way the security goes. If my broker hadn’t locked the security down to single leg options only I’d be making a killing right now. Iron Butterflies and butterfly’s would be an awesome strategy. Particularly when the volume is so high that there is absolutely zero downside 🤣. Options sellers love GME
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Um. Are you fucking retarded? I have to assume you've been following since December, when it started trading sideways except for the meme bullshit. Right?"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,The government needs money to pay for things right now. That's why they're looking at taxing the rich. Getting a revenue stream from a cannabis tax sounds like a good idea IMO.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Iceland and Greece have already said they're gonna be open this summer to vaccinated/previously infected people so there's gonna be at least *some* international travel going on (but that may not change your overall theory)
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Feel like there’s an opportunity to be had soon with the cruise lines short. Everyone FOMO’d them as a reopening play. They are still a long way out from passengers on ships. I think running back up towards pre-corona levels when we don’t even have a date for $$ coming in the door is premature.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,$AAL to the moon. Travel is back and no one gives a crap about the virus anymore at this point. The vaccine and airlines recieved major funding from the last stimulus package. Traveling is hot and its jail break season. Folks will be traveling no matter what.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"American Airlines is my number 1 most sound pick for 2021 to 2024 n maybe forever.  
the value right now is so good."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Would not turn my nose up at dollar cost averaging AAL at all. very wise move imo.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Some moronic thoughts from someone who just got the Moderna vaccine and who truly, truly hates American Airlines. 

1) US vaccine progress has gone from absolute shit to insanely good. We're on track to have everyone eligible in May. 

2) Higher production plus J&J makes Astra moot here. Like honestly, I could have cared less which one I got but I wouldn't have opted for Astra, not that it's been okayed here anyway. 

3) I'm basically a mini economic stimulus just waiting to blow money two weeks after I get my second dose. So is everyone I know. Where do I want to go? I don't care. Anywhere. Preferably anywhere warm. How will I get there? By being stuck in a small aluminum tube. 

4) Airlines are lucky. American is really lucky they got a bailout. I don't think there's a chance they would be around without one. Does that mean I like the stock? No, no I don't. But that's my bias coming in. Anyone ever gotten their flight canceled, then rebooked, then travel half way through their flight to then be told only half your flight was booked? Anyone ever been dumped at DFW due to the airlines fault and told your SOL? I'm not suggesting that can only happen with AA or that just because I've had dozens of bad experiences with AA that you can't have a good one. But I am suggesting that I think the airline is garbage. From their policies down to their customer service. In short, I'm a cheap ass. I'd fly on the wing if it was cheaper. But I'd pay more to fly any other airline, and that says a lot. 

&#x200B;

So I'm not buying AA. But I wouldn't bet against it because the rate of vaccinations here has gone from near zero to stadium fulls of people getting jabbed in the arm. And the minute it's safe to do so I'm flying. And although I will try my hardest not to fly AA, others won't care. 

  
Necessary disclosures: I have shares in Azul. I don't give financial advice. I like eating crayons. That does not mean I recommend other people eat crayons."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,The case against the Astrazenca vaccine is purely political. The numbers you quoted for blood clot deaths are not out of line with normal numbers in the population without taking the vaccine.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Before you go broke I would walk into a hub for AAL right now. Packed. People don’t even care if they’ll die from covid because they’ve come to the conclusion they’re going to die anyway. 

Your retardation = 100%"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I was just in an airport I must say I’m extremely bullish on airlines holy shit it was insane in there
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"He’ll bleed for summer, but his logic checks out once the holidays are over, will probably fall off a cliff after New Years."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,What Expiration?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Especially at strike price $24 😂
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree and quite the opposite for my theory. Vaccination passports are a thing that may stay and most other countries will follow - especially tourism dependant ones. The bet here requires the projection to be somewhat true (Oct/nov) or slower to work out.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,And retarded plays are what we’re here for
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,They might be even further down the road than airlines imo
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Travelling sorta requires having a place to travel to
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Short airlines during September 2001 lost a family member of mine 200k. Don’t underestimate the will of the consumer, regardless of risk."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"A lot of the vaccine stocks tend to move at or around funding. Also size makes a difference. For Novovax they have a limited portfolio so this year was huge for them. For the major players like J&J or Pfizer they already have large portfolios so a successful clinical trial won't move the needle as much. I bought Pfizer before their vaccine was approved and last I checked I'm about flat on it. Suffice to say, I'm not sure a company like Astra will have the expected moves if they get rejected more. Although some of those issues seem to be dwindling."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Thoughts on Southwest calls?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Political or not, higher than average or not, public perception is what matters since it is the public that will be taking the vaccine"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I take my percentage of retardation as a compliment.  
Their hubs being packed now only further strengthen this play with expiry in august since the spring break and these packed hubs you Americans keep talking about will yield nothing but ~~2nd~~ 3rd wave of contractions to the disease. You need to realise that you’ve only made 12% immune so far so liberally opening up and acting like nothing else matters will backlash in 2-3 weeks as we’ve seen play out through the entirety of 2020"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ll take my chances on this one
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,They are quite overvalued. AAL and UAL in particular.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,People are dumb and will take that trip to Vegas even if it literally kills them and Grandma
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I got AAPL LEAPS sitting at -40%... so I feel that.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,67% against catching it but 100% effective in preventing death. This is the number that gets dicks hard.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Absolutely
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Domestic travel. The USA has 16 states fully open without mask. The rest of the States are lifting restrictions and easily opening up. There is Spring Break, Easter, Memorial Day, then the summer months. Also with the push of Joe Biden advertising herd immunity by May and the amount of money they put in airlines and the vaccine. There is no way it's going down drastically. Rip the puts, I am out on this one."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a bit different imo. Travel restrictions and vaccination passport is a thing. Less business travel equally is.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The only young people I've read about that have died from coronavirus were labeled ""healthy"" but were clearly obese. The word healthy doesn't have a set definition by media standards.

&#x200B;

I'm very likely pulling out of my airlines this upcoming week. I've already had an 80% return since the coronavirus low and there is absolutely no way the stock price should have recovered already."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It wouldn't be for me but in terms of the company LUV has always had strong balance sheets. If there had been no bail out I think LUV would still be around. I don't think that for AA. I don't own any shares of LUV nor do I have any intention on buying them but it's one I would consider as a long term hold. Airlines are a tough industry all in all. As the saying goes, the best way to become a millionaire is to spend a billion dollars buying an airline."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree to a point but the politics side of this stinks. I think if it passes in America, some petty politics in the EU shouldn't matter"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Well the vaccines have efficacy at even one dose. I’m too stupid to read those studies but a guy talked about it on the news. All I know is if Europe was open I would be on an airplane there right now. They need to get their shit together.

Let’s adapt that to if you want to turn 1000$ into 100$ invest in an airline. They’ll pull it out of their butt and probably end up cash flow positive for the year in grand fashion."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,We’ve had what 5 mutations or smt deemed worrisome prior to vaccination
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Like on the second part. Don’t agree on the first. While the older population do account for most deaths and especially with underlying illness I’ve seen plenty of reports on healthy (being obese is not healthy btw) folks dying or having severe issues post contraction
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’d rather not get into politics on this sub. The Astra will get approved by FDA but my reasoning why it won’t change projection is listed above.  
The J&J vaccine may be getting traction but it has lost the ultra conservatives already with the fetal cells that _may_ come from abortion (I know this ain’t in the final shot). Add the usual antivaxxers, Bill Gates microchips etc. Getting to 70-85% isn’t going to be easy"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are right, I forgot what sub we were on.

 Do you think the anti vax movement in the states will be enough to derail the rollout? It seems to be going quite well so far.

I consider America a slightly more extreme version of the UK in these sort of regards and there is a lot of noise in the UK about negative effects of the vaccines but so far the uptake has been phenomenal (allbeit mainly older more compliant people)"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Interesting points all around.  As for me, I am bullish on AAL for a bit longer."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I think that even with perfect supply as is now the projection for 70% by October/November is overestimated. It requires that all things align and so far Murphy has not yet disappointed
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,If you ever try to fake it pls make sure you record the action
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m not banking on them going bankrupt. I’m banking that people face reality between now and august and the price dips below $24 a share

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ll leave that to one of these other geniuses
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I really hope you make cash on this deal. I lost my ass on an aal put that closed last Friday. I managed to lose both a put and call 1 week apart. No airlines 4 me!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks! Better luck next time
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like I got in at denial... 😂 fuk
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, smart money is on both, like I said. I only included RKT because it was relevant to this DD. However, I don’t think you refuted anything I said. As for my account, not sure how you could call it sketchy or new

If you look in the past 24 hours, there are plenty of RKT holders posting talking badly about UWM. 

Here is what most people don’t understand; when one goes up, the other is more likely to increase as well."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would a company breaking revenue records be worthless? LOL
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,At 8.80 and a .40c dividend this is a free 4.5% return. It’s not a sexy move or for r/wsb but it’s a guaranteed solid return. The more this stock dips the better the returns become as well on that dividend so I see the move from the long term viewpoint. This is an r/investing play
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great perspective. It’s usually the smarter moves (obviously) that have the lower returns, but low risk as well (again, obviously). Dividend hunting is a good way to slowly build that pool up. Did you get in the RKT dividend as well?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This thread smells of shills. Is that you I smell Melvin?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Where do you put the remaining profit while you wait
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Not really... Retail doesn't account for that much of total shares held. Any data from what a few people here might post means almost nothing
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Example: if I put 10k into a stock and it triples, I pull my 10k back out and leave the house money until growth stalls. The 10k I pull out I immediately put into another opportunity I've already done research on."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree but Ms. Goldstein testified as such. I put thoughts in her camp for now, since she was an insider. But, you do make a compelling argument and I appreciate the chat!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, this is what I've been doing since I got into GME at 37 back in January. I put in 25k at 37 a share, and took my 25k out (actually took 50k since it was so high) and invested it in other things. Then when it came crashing down, while disappointed, I still kept a 100% gain. At this point, from buying dips and selling spikes, I've managed to turn that 25k into about 110k. (I made a couple of rough trades and ended up taking a 90k loss in between, but am netting about 95k profit at this point)

There's lots of strategies out there, but this is one I use consistently, and it's a great way to ""bank"" profit, while still staying in if things continue to rise etc"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Any pointers on finding good stocks?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I suppose any amount of data no matter how small can be useful. I'd be interested to know what exactly they'd be able to derive from these posts, seeing as they are really a low amount of shares compared to what the big players would work with. And they have no information about when or if they've sold their shares. But I guess only the hedge funds would know that, and they certainly won't share that information."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do you realize how many PS5s, xbox one xs, and nintendo switches sold at the end of last year? Gamestop still sells consoles, that's something you can't buy a digital copy of. I think their earnings are gonna blow away the q3 numbers, and q3 was almost positive. The estimated earnings are out and it's looking like an upward trend"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"How do taxes factor in? If you take out initial investment, say $10,000, isn’t that taxed down to $6500 ish?  Would you need to take out approximately $16,000 to cover taxes?  I’m confused how this works"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,o7
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"no one says they are losing.  your data allows them to create other streams of bets against what your cards are.  you have one set of cards, your shares, and quantity.  they will have many other means to outplay you.  idk if its sound advice.  I dont think you are 'ending on top' in that scenario."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Correct but the fact that earnings aren’t supposed to be good could drive investor sentiment. GME  obviously doesn’t trade on fundamentals so earnings really don’t mean shit. I’m just thinking about the situation from a social perspective. The possibility of a negative earnings statement could drive some investors to sell of before they are put out. That’s where I’m coming from with how I’m thinking about this.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Taking out more means paying more in taxes. And it's taxed at income tax rate, not a flat 35% as far as I'm aware. It just means putting more aside if you are nearing the end of the year. But since it's the beginning of the year, I would just keep a mental tab of it. As a reminder, any realized losses will LESSEN your tax burden as well. So if you make 100k when you get out, then lose 50k when you make another set of trades, you're only taxed on the net of 50k."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Short term is taxed at 35% so you'd want to sit 35% of your total investment plus profits aside if you are smart.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fair point. After writing my last comment I realized that usually, when something seems obvious (earnings won't move GME) the complete opposite happens lol. Guess we shall see"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I yes, but beware of the wash-sale rule!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Short term is taxed at your normal income rate. %35 would be if you already made over ~200k
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is correct. Your investment income factors into your total income for how you are taxed so you might kick yourself into a new bracket if you're successful, but yes, it's NOT a flat 35%"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly. I don’t get buying options. Only 3 kind of people buy options and win. The rich, the lucky and the brilliant.  Most people, including me, are too stupid to win. So I just buy shares"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The best time to buy is right after a big dump.  When the shorts try to flash crash you can get the best prices.

My goal = Maximizing number of shares held."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Especially those calls OTM, like the 800s, as if they wouldn't use every penny they earn by selling these calls to assure, that price never reaches these levels. It's just throwing them money into their accounts."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah absolutely. What a mistake that was lol shares or shares, nothing else. 

Side note, all these articles and news reports of shorts making “X amount”, yeah well it’s probably a leveraged amount that they took on debt for and haven’t actually cashed out anything. It’s not straight up 10M or whatever. Its 10M so far. Could easily be lost and then down into neg"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol. It's a gamble. A bet you could say... 
But in all honesty, if you can say IV crush, you know the deal..."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought at 100 and sold at 270 for myself and bought at 40 for my son's custodial account and sold at 250 for him. Im actually glad I did. I trusted my gut feeling and it paid off
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You could buy 100 GME and then immediately put a month out 200% strike call which would give you almost 15% of your GME investment back. 

You then have a month to exit for less than you sold for. 

You could also start by selling a weekly ATM put. 

Just flat buying 100 GME is fine, but if you wait a week you could get over 25% of your GME investment back into your hands. Think of how much more GME you can buy with that extra money."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"great post! selling covered calls and iron condors where a mint for me last week, the iron condors where kinda nerve wracking because of all the hype around the stock, personally I dont see this insane pop that everyone keeps talking about, maybe we see 300, but personally I think we see 40-100"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME is $199

Strike price is $200

What could possibly go wrong 🤧"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,No one would sell the shares as an option if they didn't make money somehow.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,If u dont have the money for a itm option dont buy it gme options are jacked RIDICULOUS no point in touching it unless u have money to get future options
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,have xxx shares but god damn it i still can’t resist blowing money on weeklies
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Even better it gives people and whomever sold that covered call a reason to drive the stock price down rather than let it moon.. example see UWMC last week.. this wasn't institution's driving the price down it was retail investors with covered costs hoping they didn't lose their shares
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn’t know we turned into r/stocks
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Quadruple witching day tho!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,So buying ITM options a month out is a bad play? Been going back and forth on continuing to flip options or buy shares
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Good points thanks
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s a little more complicated than this. Your assumption is taking the calls to expiration where the only value is intrinsic. If the stock blows up before the expiration your premium will also go up and still have extrinsic value. Especially if you hold options that are >30 DTE. I look at closing my options before 30 days because theta is a bitch. 

You can also have your premium spike up if there is a catalyst that causes IV to go up making the options a more favorable choice. 

Note, the above can work against you as well as for you. You can hold too long and have theta eat premium or IV crush among other things. Options are a great way of getting leverage."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I stand to be wrinkled
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy the shares and sell the expensive calls yourself so that you can buy more shares.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"But next Friday Mars, Saturn and your anus perfectly align causing a little known interplanetary squeeze so that means gonna be some triangles somebody adds to a chart"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Good luck
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Except writing calls caps your upside and could cause you to totally miss the squeeze by wanting to collect some premium. If you’re in this to make a 20% gain and go back to collecting dividends in your passive investing strategy then that is fine. Though I think the vast majority of GME investors on this sub have at least *some* belief in a squeeze and shouldn’t be completely writing it off.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"friggin TDAM requires you to go thru actual broker - like actual person (on-line support, or by phone) to place CC's; and it takes forever to get someone, well at least last week; then if you want to modify the order - anything - price, strike etc - u need to have someone, again, do it for you - only thing u can do is cancel... (they had this for BB as well until week before last i think)...."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ya I was wondering that myself. Mind u I'm a retarded and don't know about options to much besides basics.

But if I made a 800c option expiring 2 weeks from now and say it never  squeezes wouldn't I just be making pure profit from people paying the premium?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude this won't even be remembered 6 months from now with this world's attention span these days.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha thanks for telling me “it’s a little more complicated than this.” Um. I know. The day more than 3 people on this sub learn how to take profits by selling options before expiration we’ll move on to lessons about Vega and theta. 

And either way, people don’t understand that you get a lot less leverage buying high IV options. Again, you use options for convexity and if you pay over 300% ivol your payoff profile prior to expiration isn’t that convex."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,its only unlimited loss if you're really stupid and if you're on RH they won't allow it
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Exercising 3 $200 call options would cost $60000
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,no triangle post is ever going to come close to the salmon analysis
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,What'd you just say about Myanus?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,30% is still insanely high for short interest. Volkswagen had about 20% SI when it had it's squeeze
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"There’s lots of DD suggesting well over 100% of the float is owned by institutions and the same applies for retail as well. There’s also a lot of analysis that suggests SI% is greatly understated due to naked, synthetic and ETF shorts. Short volume has also consistently been over 50% of total volume each day that makes it impossible for them to have covered and reduced SI. So if SI was high in January and is impossible to have dropped in any meaningful way since then that means it must still be quite high if not higher."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not wanting to pay taxes on a huge cap gain ( if you have it) is a potential road to a massive tax write off. I fully agree with you if you are talking about a huge cap gain in aapl, Wmt, Jpm etc. that’s not going to evaporate. A huge cap gain in GME?  Roll the dice Ape"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would, but I have 2 shares."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Just buy & hold! I’m in Nevada and this y is a way more exciting than a casino

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Unless you have been holding gme for months under $20 a share. You are making bank off idiots
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Agree. If you think this is going to $1000 you should most definitely not write covered calls.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes if it closes below 800$ you keep all the premium. There is NO such thing as free money no matter how much that is said on this site. Still risks involved
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,">""If GME start's mooning and gets to the point where hedge funds are dumping otherwise unrelated stock to cover margin calls that's where...""

This is already happening -100%. No doubt. Many tickers are being shorted to initiate selloff, drop price cause panic to accelerate selloff and further drop in price and the hedgies cover at low prices. This is happening everyday on numerous stocks, 3am to 6am almost each day. Huge drops."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for sharing this info. I read the Wiki's you shared but I don't think it is the same as the GME situation at all. LTCM was bailed out by the NY bank, not the fed. And the aftermath section even states that many people were against them interfering due to possibly allowing for funds taking on increased risk in the hopes of a bailout. All your examples were also a result of negative market forces crashing and dropping. How do you bailout someone cuz the prices went up?! Also, Citadel is not too big to fail. They said so during the hearing last week. I think there would be a negative impact on the broader market that would be temporary.  Apes and the other long hedgefunds would immediately buy back in to the market and help the market."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Understandable. I guess I was just more or less looking for an argument against buying deep ITM options on dips as opposed to shares and whether or not there is a negative effect in doing so. I can’t afford to exercise but have been selling them. I’d buy shares instead if someone can provide an explanation for why it is a better play.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct

In GME's case, for reasons I can explain if you're interested, buying/selling calls and puts has an amplified effect on the price of the underlying as well."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I do ridiculous amounts of stonks
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes this is in fact WSB
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"i mean, options were meant to be for hedging. Selling calls or buying puts while holding a long position in order to protect yourself against downside.

&#x200B;

Of course now they are being used increasingly for leverage and with FDs which puts us in the realm of gambling."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"What is the probability of it going your way? And all for $1,200 in 5 minutes. You use Nope?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You know about premiums right?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t disagree. There are very limited circumstances I’d consider buying high IV options, and generally it’s stupid. With gme it’s especially stupid because the IV is already so damn high like you said and the possibility of IV crush is very real. 

I wanted to build on your response because several people are citing it and drawing wrong conclusions from it. There is money to be made on gme options, but it’s very different than buying them before the stocks IV spiked."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"theres nothing wrong with buying high IV options so long as they are priced appropriately. There is a reason the IV is high after all, and so that factors into the expected returns of the option. What makes GME options less attractive is the large spread MMs are putting on GME options due to the risk of falling behind on the hedge during highly volatile periods (halts), and the large demand for calls driving the price up beyond its implied greeks."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"My bad, I now realize that only naked calls have this kind of risk associated."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't feel so bad I lost $200 on Friday on my OTM call!

This isn’t investment advice. I have no idea what I’m doing."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Would never touch two weeks covered calls. I sold a covered call at $260 strike price on Wednesday last week expiring Friday for slightly under 1k. As we all know the price did come close to $260 and I made a rack in 2 days.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you’re theta gang or in it *solely* for the long run and don’t at all believe in a squeeze then sure. Otherwise, you would totally miss the rocket if it takes off while you just collect some premium on your puts."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Think or swim, and you can try to use technical analysis for day trade swing trading. None of it is a guarantee - for example buying at open vs after what you judge of a sell off / peak could be right or wrong. You may also choose to ride it out of your decision seems initially wrong. In most days SPY doesn’t jump around over 1% so the gains / losses are more modest and you may not see a huge % quickly.


You can use TOS and a cash account to day trade without worrying about the PDT rule. It just means you have to wait until next business day for your sameday buy/sell to settle."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fair. There’s definitely money to be made trading GME options! I do! Just too many people here buying and getting crushed by iv and theta.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"1) Numerous sources, such as official SI FINRA ( the industry standard and only gold standard source ) data, Ortex Data and other specialists in using Machine Learning to estimate SI all clearly show short interest is down and and declining. It is the overwhelming consensus among experts that short interest is declining and the chances of any significant (large price movement) short squeeze is low and decreasing. The short interest still being high enough to cause any significant short is something only apes and the misinformed still believe. I just re-checked todays Ortex data for you - 

Days to cover (how long it would take for ALL shorters to cover - assuming they ALL need to in the same day, which is the perfect case for bulls) : 0.24 . Less than a couple of hours for all shorters to cover!!

Cost to Borrow :1.19% - This is incredibly low compared to interest rates on GME short borrows of over 30% in January. (From memory I think the rate was even north of 50% at the peak, but I'd need to double check that) 

Seriously, and this is the last time I'm going to bother having this same argument with people who don't know what they are talking about, the short squeeze metrics all prove your argument to be obviously false. I'm here for serious and reasoned debate, and not with sheep, and if I'm a shill then I'm afraid your definitely a sheep. "" Both of these pieces of information have been talked to death on this sub for the past forever. ""
This is exactly the problem - show me a verifiable trusted source that is readily available and verifiable (not some dumb arse ape dd on WSB ) that shows short interest has NOT declined the past two months and I'll be happy to look at it. I won't hold my breath - but I'll remain open minded.
I have already provided my sources, FINRA, expert quant firms such as but not limited to this guy :

https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1372235603476090880
and my Ortex data which costs 50$ a month, is updated intraday, which is far superior to free and inaccurate websites that are sometimes several days or weeks out of date. I've included todays Ortex data on SI for you below:

Finally, I'm not going to go into it here, because it's a waste of time and of little credibility, but the idea that $GME being shorted or not through ETF's and that will have a significant difference to anything short squeeze or price action is just nonsense cooked up on WSB that people repeat without actually understanding it. I suggest that you look into that yourself - but if needed I'll discuss why when I have time. Good luck with your play , but don't bother with the usual FUD comments next time. I have shown my facts and logic, so please show me your thinking and evidence.

PS: I don't mind looking at the ETF dd/argument at all, but please be specific and refer me to a specific dd or article - it's too hard to address vague rumors and theories in general."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,BET YOU CAN'T EAT JUST ONE!!!!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro you know he's taking a ban instead
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME is such a tiny portion of my portfolio as to be irrelevant, and my cost basis is far below $200. Your comment was making me rethink my strategy with my AMZN stock, in which I have such a tiny cost basis as to be irrelevant.  Since the stock has been moving relatively sideways for months, I want to create an income stream using covered calls, and I just haven’t done it. Your comment made me rethink it. I wouldn’t sell it anyway on a significant drop, and if a covered call option gets exercised, I’ll be ok with my 27,000% gains. What I haven’t figured out is the best “time to expiry” to use in order to optimize cash flow. Sorry you were annoyed by my response to your comment."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,So you do weekly CC’s?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Selling covered calls on Monday for that Friday?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Please explain more I'd love to see a DD on this strategy I'm looking to do this with another stock
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can sell a CC on Monday, buy it back on Tuesday and probably come out with over 50% profit

There's no reason to hold the CCs to expiration. You can even then use the profit to buy FDs or something"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice... but this was only based off the hypothetical vacuum scenario that there are no other factors other than 10% gain every 5 minutes for 6 and a half hours. Obviously if enough buy orders are executed the moment trading resumes then it can move more than 10% and vice versa with sell orders.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,the data is there you just have to look ;)
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The simple answer is, liquidity for GameStop's stock was drying up, partially due to apegang buying up all of the shares and just holding them.

The more people willing to buy and sell a stock, the more liquid it is, the less susceptible to manipulation it is (and also the lower the implied volatility), and the less volatile it is.

Because market makers need to remain delta neutral, if I place a order for a lot of options at the bid or ask, market makers have to inverse me.

For example, with the amount of volume that happened during the recent ""GME flash crash,"" if you tried that same thing on SPY or BRK.B or something, you'd have a much more minimal effect, despite having comparable prices. More people are willing to buy and sell at the lower price and so the price moves less.

---

You could see the effects of this Friday. Despite being a super talked about stock with hundreds of thousands of mentions worldwide, the bid-ask spread (the difference between what someone is willing to pay for a stock and what someone is willing to sell for) was **$0.50** at its peak, when before it was <$0.01."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bought 800c when I saw option purchases looking like shorts were in trouble, sold them at 7x. Did the same with RKT right after the dividend was announced, mad 40x on those. Selling options based on sentiment is viable compared to stocks but you need to be selling to the people who fomo and jump on the bandwagon instead of doing that yourself."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah...I do get that, but buying a ton of shares of GME does seem to fall into that risk category IMO. 

But then again I'm STILL buying them at $200, so maybe that's just me feeling the ""risk""  :P"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ouch, I was thinking it would be exercised at $64 and that was it, not forced into 100x $600. So many moving parts."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,To understand them you need at the very least a basic grip on it
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,A Difference there is between know and understand -Yoda
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Alright bro
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Miss all the shots you don't take
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, because I am not a pussy and also it is never happening."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Would you say, as far as insane bets go, they’re *toeing* the line?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Whats a shill?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,The beta is -2 for the month and -8 for the week. Best explanation for this is shorting way over the float.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The exchange reported data is the best you're gonna get. It's around 26% (remember the 2 week delay), which is a decrease from the ~40% after the short squeeze back in January.

(Note data about it having been 76% back then is just wrong because Morningstar incorrectly reports GME's float.)

Is GME's SI high? Yeah I suppose. But this makes sense given its current price. It's definitely not the over 100% shorted that we saw pre-February."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you can’t see the similarities, that’s on you. Tesla was heavily shorted, yet had massive retail support. Despite the shorts’ best efforts, as retail and institutions continued to buy, the shorts were squeezed out over months and months and the price just kept climbing.....beyond what most consider fair value. 

GameStop is in a similar spot. It has a massive fan base that covers the entire planet. That’s first and foremost. Institutional support is also strong. We can see that millions upon millions of shares are still being sold short. And the shorts are using all of their tricks to keep the price from exploding. If they had covered and closed their positions, they wouldn’t be fighting so hard to control the price. 

This price ‘can easily’ shoot up into the thousands because the conditions are right for it to happen - loaded call options all the way up the chain, massive short interest still, and catalysts upcoming that can trigger a gamma squeeze, which could then trigger a short squeeze. If the price breaks 400 after earnings, it can shoot up much higher from MMs buying shares to cover calls. And breaking the 800 mark would send it flying into the thousands."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Very easily. All it takes is a catalyst to send it flying and then the loaded option chain to then cause MMs to send it even higher as they’re forced to buy millions of shares to cover those calls. The chain reaction can VERY EASILY push the price into the thousands.

Edit: Explain to me how you determined where the short interest is at? Because it’s not easy to do. I can’t wait to hear your method."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,And now it’s $200. The old stalemate.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"No I wasn’t annoyed my dude, I was afraid you thought I was promoting covered calls on GME, which I’m not. 😉👍🏻"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, this was the first covered call I sold since this GME train started I’ve been too scared. Like I said, I sold mine on mid day Wednesday and it expired Friday. I’ll likely do something similar this week. Wanna see how things look at the start of the week before committing to a price. I’m still long on GME but a chance at making a quick rack while things were down or treading water this week seemed worth it to me."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It depends on what's going on, what news is out, whether I think its going to take off. Sometimes it jumps up and I can sell a 400 for 16 2 days before expiry lol. This week I sold for next Friday on this Friday, though I may buy back on Monday, probably keep 300 premium if it dips at any point....because next week will be wild"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Basically I listen to my inner paper hands, if I see a rise on the day that tempts me to sell, as in one I don't see being sustained, I will sell a call. This isn't necessary if you're gong to just collect off of decay or expiry but it definitely enhances it.  Heck off of a mild upswing on GME the options leap by hundreds because of the volatility.

So price swing up, I sell CC for a few hundred more
Price do bear trap options take a dump, buy next call lower to cover first (netting say $400)
Now have poor man covered call and hey, it's swinging up again, look at volume, draw with crayon.... sell covered call (if higher than first pair leave a space if you aren't done playing) 

You're probably wondering why I don't just buy the call back. Well that was born out of necessity, I didn't have enough money to day trade, so that was my workaround  but I realized it is better to do it this way anyway. Once I've bought the call to cover I could just let everything expire, I've got my profits, but there's still a whole week of action. 
So the next day I have a few PMCC and I've got my stock and my day can play out a few ways. It's the next day so I can get rid of this mess of calls. 

If hedgies take a swing I can buy back the sold calls for a net gain, leaving me with a free pair of calls I can do with as I please.

If the price shoots up I'll sell off the cover of one PMCC turning it back into a covered call, if it retreats I'll buy the call back. If it shoots up again I'll do it to the next. 

I am very bullish on GME so my strategy has kind of been built around trying to limit my chances of being assigned during an unexpected moonshot while also being able to get options premiums in a low value account. I don't follow my own advice though, that guy is a retard



 If you find other stocks with such crazy high options premium lmk."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shares outstanding on Brk.a is 640k. 70m on GME. 

So the equivalent price would be \~$3,500 on GME to = Brk.a. 

Meaningless really -- but just some perspective and food for thought."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It certainly is but not for the long haul.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"This also means that if you're willing to go on the wild ride and know what you're doing, you can make a lot of money off of GME. Hedge funds and people who have a firm grasp on the fundamentals of options trading (not just using options as lotto tickets) can and have made a lot of money off of the GME hype, regardless of any short squeeze potential.

Heck, even if you just sell covered calls at $800, you can make a shitload of money every day the stock just grinds to the right or just stays rangebound within the $100-$300 range."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You lose it
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"But wouldn't that be buying before the IV rise? The previous poster was saying you could buy the 800c when GME was at 100 and sell it when it was up to 300 got a profit. And while I can't say that it wouldn't have worked, I was pointing out there were something like 9 days of theta decay that would have hit that move really hard. 

If you did it in a day trade or before the jump then yes, you'd make money in it. Within a single day theta probably won't hit you so hard as to counteract that much price movement unless it's expiring that day."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe, but calculus isn't exactly easy for everyone and a deep understanding of the black scholes equation really doesn't help you much. What that equation does is calculate ""the greeks"". So, if you learn the greeks (just Google ""the greeks options"") you don't need to even know that formula at all."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Really just go on youtube, there are a million youtube videos on options. 

The very basics you need to learn is what a call and what a put is, understand buying and selling the contracts, and of course what an option contract even is. 

I'm retarded but if you don't understand from youtube or just need help you can DM me"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't think I've used calc once for options. What do you use it for?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,How come?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Well I was a bit in the clouds. Thought I was replying to the person saying they would buy a bag of chips and only eat one and save the rest for later. So many unrealized upvotes...
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,See this is what I'm worried about. Everyone seems so sure that the hedges and bears absolutely doubled down on their short positions and I'm just like... What if they didn't and there just is no possiblity for the MOASS we're all waiting for...?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"> It has a massive fan base that covers the entire planet.

I've never heard of a Gamestop fanboy in my entire life. I think Tesla is overvalued too but they launched their electric roadster into space a few years back while Gamestop is a middle man for selling video games and video game content. 

The conditions were good for a short squeeze on the first run up when short interest was ~120% and its a damn shame Robinhood capped the spike. But short interest is much lower now and the price is already overvalued. It's your money though best of luck."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Like any website that has the March data: https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/gme.htm

I know you're gonna say ""oh they're hiding it through Etfs / whatever"" but how many short shares are they really able to hide? Sounds pretty tin foil hat to me to believe the short interest is anywhere near where it was in January.

The price sat at $40 for like two weeks you don't think the shorts were able to shift their positions to not be at such high risk?

They were nearly bankrupt in january and the Robinhood shit bailed them out. They re-positioned. Everyone buying GME and options are being sucked into a trap right now. No catalyst is out there. No whale / HF is mooning this thing. Retail interest is down to the 80,000 apes on the WSB GME threads.

A big catalyst could raise the price but the MOASS is off the table. Plain and simple"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for sharing your experience. What about extending out to a less likely strike price? Even if it gets exercised at say $400, you’re still sitting pretty. You won’t get as much premium, but you’re more likely to take the premium and keep your stock."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish I owned 100 shares so I could sell covered calls. I could have at $40 point. But I'm retarded. And now I can't.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks a ton!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean the underlying principles. I think anyone trading them successfully likely has an intuitive understanding of calc concepts, even if they can't define derivatives and integrals."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's a pretty fundamental part of how options are typically are priced. I'm not saying you have to be a math guru, just that you have to know a bit of it to truly understand options"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The MOASS was in January in my view. A 2k% increase dwarfed even the VW short squeeze.

Not to say there's not money to be made in GME right now, but it's all in options and you have to know what you are doing to take advantage of it.

Either that or if you have 100+ shares you can sell covered calls using the shares as collateral. It's extremely worth it right now. Lmk if you don't know and want to know how.

There's market fuckery, but ironically ths only reason it's possible is because of everyone just holding their shares."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"GameStop became a worldwide symbol for fighting against a rigged system. It united people from all walks of life from country to country. It’s morphed into something more than just a speculative stock pick. People genuinely want to see it succeed, more than any other stock in their port. Once the new leadership team shows the world it’s plans and then executes them, we’ll see the price much higher than it is now. Not counting gamma or short squeezes. $800-$1200/share by 2023."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think it makes perfect sense too. Do a $400 strike that same week and make around $350-$400 in premium but with far less risk? That way, incase it explodes in that two day stretch you’re still capturing that whole run up to whatever the strike price you chose."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You don't even need to understand that much. You can easily learn everything you need to know about options while not understanding calc
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro just because the formula used to calculate options pricing is based on calc and DEs doesn't mean you need to know how to solve a PDE to understand the greeks. You can explain the greeks to someone who's never gone past high school and they could understand that fully without gaining knowledge on calculus.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s my plan. Thanks and good luck!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"they teach calc in high school

point is though you can have a basic idea at something, but the greeks aren't lotto numbers and to actually understand options and their effects as a whole as something other than lotto tickets, you need the basic concept down"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,They are appealing the decision they said they have the five percent
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"So much cry babys down in those uwmc thread ahah
. Inclusion or not that's whatever.. you guys really tought the inclusion would kick this to 20$ territory? I mean i do believe  it was good news but in the end.. you can just hold this for some weeks/months and end up with a nice profits.. and im not even taking in consideration the dividend payout! If you sell above your cost on monday thats fine.. But if you dont need the money right now, with an average of 8-9 I wouldnt do it..

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,They're probably just annoyed the CEO is holding like 90-94% of the stock which is the very reason the stock didn't get included.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Same. We'll not 180 but like eh 80% up and held off from selling.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,But it made it more valuable to retail investors which then brought in more retail cause this would have moved up even in the little volume added by the institutions that would have started to add positions into uwmc... It moves with the slightest volume... Now that volume will be negative
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If the owner sell shares it’s a bad sign, if they buy it’s a good sign, and if they hold 90% somehow that’s a bad sign? Seems like there’s no way to win for the owner even though holding 90% of your shares and not selling any at a $10 peak should be inspiring confidence especially when you get a nice dividend for nothing."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for posting!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Was your entire reason for getting into UWMC based on the inclusion? From my understanding the company is still very profitable, valued on the low end for $10 per share while sitting at $8.9 right now, and the owner is holding a majority of the shares not selling. When they show that insiders are selling that’s a sign that maybe they know something. If they buy, people assume something good will happen. So how is holding on to your shares a bad thing for investors to see from the owner? That seems like more reason to have confidence. There is a 10% upside based on the forecast for the end of 2021. I’m in from 8.50 and will be buying the dip if it comes and collecting that sweet dividend."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck you. RKT gang has been here longer than GME gang. I would know, I've been in both far longer than most on WSB. Don't make accusations without a shred of research."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Comparing RKT to silver or some shit company like SNDL is hilarious. You should consider reading more outside of GME threads, it would do you some good."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Sure that's not 18.6% of the float?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I'm reading it right your options expire on the 17th of September of this year at a break even of 6.23.

That would add significant risk, but in exchange you get significantly more potential upside. On the face of it that's a fine play...

Now I'm not too big on super in-depth DD, as I just don't have time/energy for it, so once I'm satisfied that a stock is a good buy, I tend to use technical analysis to make predictions...

Looking at ITUB chart and the current uptrend, a great scenario for you is you break even around late April, early May and go up from there... leaving you a 4 month cushion after that... Generally I think you'll be fine and make good money off the play...

BUT... banks are generally slow movers... Added to that we have a lot retracing on this stock... So there is significant risk...

Can't say more than that tbh..."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Having said that I am planning to sell at not far from your break even price so... I don't know that ITUB will necessarily go back to it 2020 highs any time soon. I'm just confident it'll go back to 6+ soon...

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Forreal. That's how I look at it. Especially if you're working. Just bonus money.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I can get down with this easy. Most of it comes from not setting a target, a limit, or a stop loss after a spike to make sure I don't lose profit but can safely ride out a further gain in volatility.

I also just have been irrational. I was in on RKT with calls before the pop 2 weeks ago. Would up riding 2000% gains down to just a little over 100%. I did cash out some on the way up at around 600%. Most of my other plays hit around the 50-100% range, but I illogically tried to ride those higher before sharp corrections, ultimately ending up expiring worthless from reasoning about it with the idea that I may as well wait it out to see if I hit positive again instead of just getting out while I can still recover part of the premium paid.

Lots of harsh but good lessons"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's easy to see losses on options from holding too long. Once you take those initial gains you can play a little faster and looser if you want because you already made your initial investment back, or close to it. If I'm going to be holding for a few months I'll also buy deep in the money options to protect from downside movement. Shorter term stuff I'll be OK with otm positions. It's all just how you want to play your positions, but taking some gains early is never a bad idea."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Oof.  My chart looks similar but the numbers are 30% as high
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Loss porn at its finest right there. Just sayin. 💎🙌
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,How
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro you gotta learn to take profit. Do it in stages. If you have 100 shares at $10 set the limit order GTC and sell 10 @ 20, 10 @ 30, 10 @ 50, 10 @ 100, 25 @ 200, 25 @ 400, or something like that. 

When charts go parabolic like that they always fall back, it doesn't last long. So basically, if it goes parabolic like GME, get out while it's up. If it has a fairly steady increase like RIOT over the last few months, let it ride until it stalls then get out."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also, what were your positions for that spike, and what are they now?"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,He got to that number by not selling when the stock surged. You’re a Monday morning quarterback who doesn’t have the capital to even attempt the play that he did and you’re trying to act like you’re above human emotion. Silly really.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks. They were options so I had to sell them and think I netted 50k... which I reinvested in gme lol

If there's two numbers to remember about the wheel, 50k and 1500.  50k makes 1500 bucks at 3%."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You don’t lose - you get the 10% increase in stock value AND the premium.

You don’t get any increase above 10% but that’s not your play. 

You lose if the stock falls below your cost price taking into account any premium you have made. 

Ideally you want stocks that go up 1-5% a quarter and you collect premiums and the stock increases."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The further OTM the risker it is, the closer to the money the less risky your position is as you get a bigger premium but less upside.  You can just keep selling close to the money and letting your shares get called away, buy back if need be or use a different stock"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol what interesting math you have.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,So sit on your ass and do nothing. Why are you being so ignorant and obtuse? Are you pissed because you haven't seen a green day since your angsty ass saw them live in concert?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Weeklies and depending on the day, action, etc, I'll buy to close around 60-80%. I rarely leave a position open at expiration. I almost always have positions open over the weekend though.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,">  trying to fight covid is like trying to put out a Californian wild fire

funny comparison, the wildfires would be 1000x worse with loss of life and property if not for California's massive firefighting force (tons of planes, helicopters, dozers, etc). A few years back my mom's neighborhood was within 50ft (the flame wall was on property lines of every house in the neighborhood) of being incinerated by a fire that changed direction with the wind after it was thought passed but the quick work of the fire dept dozing firebreaks and spraying foam on all the buildings saved the entire area plus gave time for everyone to safely evacuate. The fact that these fires only destroy the small amount of structures that they do is ENTIRELY due to the control efforts on them when they break out, much like covid you can't really get perfect but that doesn't mean that the effort to make it better is a waste. Like in so many cases perfect is the enemy of good, and I'll never understand the people who say that our efforts which are saving millions aren't worth it because hundreds of thousands are still dying."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"New York has 247x the population density of Mississippi, similarly to all the other highest per-capita death and infection states in the US, a disease spread will ALWAYS be amplified by people living closer together, which makes the efforts to contain it that much more important.  The fact that these states that didn't lock down are doing MILES worse when they're so spread out you damned near have to be TRYING to catch covid just speaks of how horribly they handled things.  If the crybaby's ""rebelling"" against the CDC had just locked down we could have been done with this shit last year but here we are a year later still going strong.  Apparently staying inside and not eating out at restaurants to save lives is too much to ask some spoiled brats though."

A $500 sale might be wonderful but consoles are very low margin. Like less than 10% profit per console. It’s the model that you sell the consoles as low as you can and make more money off accessories and games.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Depends on what you have higher conviction in. There's a lot of ARKs and they all track different things. ARKK has the highest TSLA concentration. I have both but a larger concentration in Tesla itself. To me it's like investing in AMZN or GOOGL before they became the superpowers they are now.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,They don’t have the battery supply chain currently to scale. Tesla is running away in that department. Lots of work for OEMs to catch up.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I own a Model X & a Model S.

I don't have any major issues with the build quality.

Where I *really* have issues is with service.  It is a royal pain in the ass.

The first problem is that you can only book service through the app.  You can't call anyone.  You can't email.  Just go to the app.....

For booked appointments, I sent messages through the app with no responses....

I *can* be convenient for basic things as mobile service will come by; however, even that can be problematic.   For example, I needed a key fob programmed and scheduled.  Date was set for ~3 days.  3 days later, NO ONE shows.  

I then go into the app and see that my appointment was rebook to 7 days later *AND* it was set to in-person because they wanted to look at some other things....  No clarification.

Hell, if you want to work on your car yourself, good f'ing luck as well.  My X needed the 12V battery replaced.  So I inquired for cost of battery so I could replace.  No response.  Called the parts number.  Voicemail.  Left message / phone #.  No call back.  Called a different service center.  Same thing.  

Radio fucking silence.  

A competitor doesn't need to come out with the *BEST* battery / tech.  They need to come out with a basic car that meets the needs of the masses.  (which includes access to parts, service, etc.)

If someone does that, Tesla is a in world of hurt."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Show me that Tesla is actually going to make a 4680 battery
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Says the man who’d give anything to go back in time a year and buy some Tesla  stock
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,No it’s not priced in. Look at the models of the bullish analysts on the Street and they don’t have this volume in their assumptions.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea that’s the huge question mark. What does the world look like if cars drive themselves. If you could buy a taxi that could do 100,000 miles a year and you didn’t have to pay a driver, how much would it be worth to you? Maybe long term car purchases shift from mostly B2C to more B2B (Tesla “taxi” fleet operators)

All assumes they actually crack the autonomous driving nut which is a massive unknown."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"The world needs tech leaders like Elon, since the world lost Steve. You cant just price the product based on its abstract quantitative values, theres also the qualitative emotive factor. The stock price reflects all that.

They already are. The pilot plant is already in the top ten battery factories"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Their models are based on fundamentals and Tesla is not based in fundamentals. The Street doesn't understand TSLA. The bullish analysts are clickbait artists.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,They haven’t made any of those batteries yet
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok let’s get into specifics. Goldman’s 2021 price target is $780, a little above where Tesla is trading now. They have Tesla at 15mm deliveries in... 2040 and then discount back from there. Tesla’s goal is 20mm deliveries in 2030. 

So, clearly Tesla’s ambitions are not priced into Goldman’s model, and if Tesla does achieve their production goals there is obvious upside. 

Whether you believe Tesla will get to 20mm in 2030 is a separate issue, but it’s not priced in."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You guys arnt loling me here, youre loling what the market thinks tesla is worth. The ticket price doesnt lie"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You also need to price in the fact you are buying elon musk. If steve was still alive today, apple stock would be double. godlike ceo has a multiplier effect on the price, simply because we bloody love him, and cant get enough of him. They are celebrities like brad pitt."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Funny that Tesla shut down their official forums on March 16th with the rollout of their new engage site
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude I am sorry but they have... they literally have them in cars rn
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, let's get into specifics. Goldman's price target is based on fundamentals and the future of their industries. Tesla is not. Goldman doesn't understand TSLA. 

If Goldman's price target was based on ideas like Elon renaming him role into a ""technoking"" I would believe there was some merit in it. At least they would be considering things that stand to meaningfully affect the price."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Perhaps it's different in the US. You would never get a car loan (outside of leasing) where I live without putting down collateral.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Very useful, thanks.  Done a read of the DTCC filing and summarised implementation timeline [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8xhu8/gme_amc_dd_what_we_know_so_far/grnrp2d?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Could be anything up to 130 days from March 18, though my pick is 70.  

The proposed change will shift default risk down the chain, to where it originates. Potentially that will either 

* stop default-risky positions being allowed to develop (good) or 
* simply legitimise more Robinhood-esque ""oh we must stop one side of this trade because we're being margin-called, and now you know that's a real thing"" (bad). 

Hopefully it's a genuine control mechanism and not a cynical ploy.  But even a cynical ploy will help, because it will help expose the ways that apes are being butt-fucked."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for this, very useful.  Per OP's point 4: according to the filing, the SEC has 60 days from filing to **not** object, after which (and if there are no calls for further info), the NSCC gives itself 10 days to implement the change.  

If there are issues raised, another 60 day initial period may be used.  Or instead, the SEC can notify **in writing** that it doesn't object, and authorise an earlier implementation, in which case the original 60 days may not all be used.

In any case, the NSCC will announce the effective date on its website:   

>NSCC would implement the proposed changes no later than 10 Business Days after the later of the no objection to the advance notice and approval of the related proposed rule change by the Commission. NSCC would announce the effective date of the proposed changes by Important Notice posted to its website."

Itm options rn, and OTM is just giving cash to contract writers to short GME out. The GME play is buy stocks and hold. No one can take your solid stocks from you. Options can always expire useless if you don’t have the cash to back up a call."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,And you a gentleman-ape.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"1) It has clearly squoze, in January and also a combined gamma and smaller short squeeze two weeks ago. 
2) The reason the stock has held up on low volume is simply hedge funds on rival sides trying to make their various long and short plays, sell covered calls and other option plays and so on. 

Numerous sources, such as official SI FINRA ( the industry standard and only gold standard source ) data, Ortex Data and other specialists in using Machine Learning to estimate SI all clearly show short interest is down and and declining. It is the overwhelming consensus among experts that short interest is declining and the chances of any significant (large price movement) short squeeze is low and decreasing. The short interest still being high enough to cause any significant short is something only apes and the misinformed still believe. I just re-checked todays Ortex data for you -

Days to cover (how long it would take for ALL shorters to cover - assuming they ALL need to in the same day, which is the perfect case for bulls) : 0.24 . Less than a couple of hours for all shorters to cover!!

Cost to Borrow :1.19% - This is incredibly low compared to interest rates on GME short borrows of over 30% in January. (From memory I think the rate was even north of 50% at the peak, but I'd need to double check that)

I have already provided my sources, FINRA, expert quant firms such as but not limited to this guy :

https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1372235603476090880 and my Ortex data which costs 50$ a month, is updated intraday, which is far superior to free and inaccurate websites that are sometimes several days or weeks out of date. I've included todays Ortex data on SI for you below:

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Whales hold options. Ape hold bananas. Got it.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,What does that mean exactly “called back the shares”?  I’ve not seen that happen. What is the purpose?  If anything they are likely to issue more shares via a capital raise. That will be interesting to see will be priced at a huge disco to current share price at moment in sure.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Ironically the DTCC rule change was done because WSB almost bankrupt RH. That’s the real kick in ass here. WSB acting in a coordinated and huge fashion created an astronomical deposit they couldn’t meet. If they went under and into SIPC receivership it would have been and absolute disaster for WSB and markets. That is also a reason why they are rushing to go public. If they were a public company they would have much easier access to capital to meet that requirement
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Nothing to do with Hedgies!! WSB caused it!!!

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,TL;DR pls
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I think this is possible as long you have enough collateral according to the rules of the broker.. I think a retail investor would be able to naked short this way.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"They usually will call back shares when they restructure the board. I think its about needing the share holders permission to change things up. Because it is believed that the stock is shorted more than whats available to trade, calling back the shares will force the hedges to cover any fake shares and the stock will raise exponentially in theory."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,tl;dr - learning.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not sure that’s true. A glimmer of truth for sure. When a long holder lends their shares they LOSE the right to vote their proxies. So long holders that care about voting will surely want to call them back. Most often there are enough replacement shares to be borrowed to return to the long so they can vote. Also it becomes a cost benefit analysis. If the vote is something which is likely to pass or not controversial AND the fees from lending shares is lucrative the long won’t care to recall their loans. So your partly right. Stockholder will need to ensure they have their shares to borrow. The company itself does not recall shares. The vote MAY result in the recall of shares. Now, and here is where it gets interesting...., a typical broker dealer oftentimes does NOT have enough shares available to allow all of their clients to vote the proxy. Because they are lending them. What happens in real life is that because the vast majority of inidividual investors DONT vote their proxies, the few that do are allowed to because there is so much non participation. HOWEVER, and here is where it gets interesting, IF every individual investor VOTES their proxy the broker will be forced to recall the loans or borrow shares they can vote. It all gets very in the weeds of the financial plumbing but I have seen many times where the transfer agent will not allow the amount of shares requested to be voted because the BD didn’t have enough shares. Hope this helps. Oh yeah! And here’s another example of financial trickery. HFs surprise surprise used to routinely borrow vast amounts of stock and ask their PB to vote them a certain way. Always been illegal obviously but used to happen often. Not so much now"

Apple did have a bad weekend with Brazil lawsuit and hurry patent thing. 

But I think you will reach your strike price, but wether you’ll be breakend is a differnet thing. 3 month away and bearly 5% OTM, your  premium was probably a lot. And theta will eat that out.  

AAPL will need to do 10%-15% for you to break even from my rough calculation"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, lump me in with everyone that’s ever said we’re in a bubble. That’s intellectually honest.

I don’t feel compelled to make the case to you either. You’re emotionally invested in this and I get it. People don’t like to hear that the longest bull market ever might be over and they won’t be able double their money overnight. 

I’m sure you’ll keep doing whatever is you’re doing and I hope that works out for you. The guy asked a question and I answered it with my opinion. Get mad."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It was really good. Made me miss going into a blockbuster as a kid to rent movies and games. It really made me want to go shop at GameStop to get that feeling.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity, and forget about some cool mobile interface, cuz they are severely lacking in that department.  But they are very well backed/leveraged and trades are upfront and honest.

Check for yourself as to what institutions actually own stocks of GM... You will be amazed as to what brokers you thought actually backed your purchases with real viable stocks instead of trying to take advantage of people."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"From external income? Why bother with all these calls and initial stock purchase then? Everyone, regardless of if they want a glorious squeeze or want an ignominious death for the stock, thinks the stock will crash - By committing to reinvesting your calls and holding you're not strategizing, you're literally throwing money into the trash. Just buy later."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Foreign trade commission? I bought a single share of RNECF and its a mark of shame now because it will be another -$50 to sell the fucking thing

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't know anything about all that; I just like the stock. 

Think I'll buy more next week."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea it was a canadian stock, which I have bought others before. But the thing is, on their website, it shows you the commission fee before purchasing. on the active trader, this did not show at all. They claim I saw it or clicked something, but I NEVER saw ANYTHING about $50 commission fee. I would have NEVER bought it. I literally bought 2 shares at $4.35 each. Why the FUCK would I spend $50 to buy $8 worth of stock?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It showed like $8.70 for me. second, they say I ""clicked ok to a warning"" which I didn't. last, if it's that easy to accidently ""acknowledge a fee"", then they need to change their system. On their website it's very obvious, on their active trader it was not.

I'm sure the SEC or FTC or whoever deals with exchanges would agree."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,just got the notfication about that.. wondering if i transfer to fidelity if it completes before the movie starts..smh
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah, you're just a troll. And looking at your post history confirms it: You had 130k, 45 days ago after the drop to 50 bucks. If you held it'd be back to 500k by now. You cashed out, and now you're, what... karma farming? Hedging your bets?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel your pain friend, I was taking a piss at work and just quickly bought a single share of this japanese company because I had heard something about an acquisition and I had like $13 lying around after buying a bunch of AMC... next break I took a look and was -$50 which was bizarre since I only had $13 available to trade and was using a cash account... so stupid. It really should warn you when there is a fat commission"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably not. Contact them anyway.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds like you might have a 401k or just a really shitty IRA. If you’re forced to choose from a list of funds for an IRA then you must be with a shitty company. IRAs are self directed accounts and you should be able to buy anything you want in them (with some exceptions).
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,What broker are you using?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Not if you rollover your 401k to Fidelity after changing jobs 😎
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have outlined my plan, and I have explained what happened each step of way. 

You are entitled to your assumptions.

Not much more to say."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It's Capital Group American Funds. It's a 401k rollover but it also says IRA on it. I think it's a mutual fund where I don't have an option to pick my own stocks instead of just general fund options
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s not entirely true. If you’ve had the Roth for at least 5 years then any early distributions will be hit with just the 10% penalty, no taxes at all. If you had the Roth for less than 5 years, then you get hit with both tax + penalty."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Brokerages are not required to withhold. They’re required to **offer** withholding, but it is not mandatory that the client withhold at all, because they can just pay the taxes they owe when they go to file."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Except you just admitted you have no idea about your plan, and are just ignoring the fact that it is strictly worse than others."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, that would be the case. You can move it to somewhere else like Vanguard which offers funds as well as the option to buy your own stocks in your IRA."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Your mom
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"""If you want to withdraw earnings: You must satisfy two requirements for a qualified distribution to avoid both taxes and the 10% early withdrawal penalty. First, you must have held a Roth IRA account for at least five years, a clock that starts ticking at the beginning of the year of your first contribution. Second, you must be at least 59½, disabled, dead (the distribution is taken by heirs) or using up to $10,000 toward a first-home purchase.""

Got this from Nerdwallet and Schwab says the same...it looks like you gotta satisfy both criteria.

Edit: also contributions can be withdrawn anytime, tax and penalty free.

Edit edit: found my solution, 72t."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re right. It has been a long time since I set my SEP IRA up and began withdrawals with automatic withholding. I remembered it as mandatory. They are required to report withdrawals.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"There seems to have been a misunderstanding. I don't know anything about the statement ""Everyone... thinks the stock will crash""

I do not think the stock will crash. I believe that $200 is a fair and reasonable value for GME at the moment, and I believe it is going to be worth even more that in the future. I consider anything under $200 to be a serious discount.

I don't even agree with the concept that *most* people (let alone ""everyone"") believes the stock will ""crash""

It is my right to hold any belief about the future performance of any stock, and it is my right to invest in whatever I please. I am not giving financial advice, I am simply sharing my opinions.

I've posted my positions, and I have made it very clear that I remain bullish on the stock. 

Why don't you share with us your positions (presumably you're holding puts if you so firmly belive the stock will decrease in value?)"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nope, I own 15 stock, because I believe in the squeeze. And a squeeze, fundamentally, increases the price AND THEN LOWERS IT. Meanwhile ATM puts going out to a year cost $100, so I don't have to believe the stock is increasing long term, I just have to believe it's decreasing <$100 and that it's not worth locking up my money for that long.

You either don't understand how a squeeze works, or don't believe this is a squeeze, and either way you're throwing money into the garbage... unless you're a lying troll, which your post history indicates."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actually, unless you file a 72t (just found out from the guy who commented). You have to take equal distributions (using 3 ways to calculate the amount) for at least 5 years. Great news for me!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"A lot of assumptions there, my projectionist friend.

Good luck with your strategy (I do not fully understand it); I'm gonna stick with mine. Since it's my money and all. 😃"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe if you don't understand how the market works, don't throw your money away."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's very sweet of you to be so concerned about what other people do with their money.

The piracy thing is why I dont buy AMC, its not why I don't buy GME. You have a much harder time pirating onlines games and that's a fact. plus RBLX is free, it has no piracy needed issues, just parents that dont have money or are Armish or some such shit."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I played Roblox when I was a kid lol. I no longer do. When I have kids, I'd much rather see them playing something normal like Minecraft."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME sells minecraft mech and cards... they sell every card.  
My own daughter and her friends jumped from Minecraft to Roblox.  
They play every game that trends but they always go back to Roblox, it just seems like the centrist hive for kids, the moderates love using Roblox (RBLX) and yes even Minecraft (Microsoft) as a cheap babysitter. It's a thing n if the user base is making games n some of them are quite imaginative n at then very least allow for kids to play dumbed down versions of games they ether A can't afford or B can't play.  
I see it all the time, they got horror game rip offs of game every youtuber is playing now days. its kiddy crack, it even teaches them the stock market in a way, it too has a trading house/floor. My kid trades pets for pets that cost real world dosh.   
Then flips them for more pets in order to collect more real world valued pets.

They have like 0% of the server market, which is a lot of money.

Combine that with Intel's roadmap doesn't really compete till 2024 at the best (still stuck on 14nm, TSMC is working on 5nm which next zen probably will be on), and you have some serious possibility of growing. The gpu market share is finally competitive for gaming, and they have extremely powerful compute GPUs for a long time.

Also zen 5 supposedly is going to feature a 96 core part, which will support dual sockets. 
Compare that to the 28 core part that intel has.

You throw your phone, and you pin her to the sofa, then the ground. You both roll about, wrestling, like lion cubs. Kissing, lightly biting. Sometime later, you both stop, breathing hard. She grabs an open bottle of red wine, and you pass it back and forth. Eventually she says, “I want to do that more.”

But you’ve already found your phone again to check Futures. Still red. “Uh huh,” you say, distracted. She stares at you for a long moment, but you don’t realize it. Silently, she gets up and goes to bed, and you don’t say a word because you don’t notice.

She hasn’t left you yet, but she will soon.

In January, the DC circuit Court of appeals upheld a lower decision that the DAPL permit/easement is invalid. Its invalid because the agency didn't conduct an environmental impact statement (eis) as required by the Nation Environmental Protection Act (cross cutting statute). With no permit/easement, the pipeline is illegally encroaching on federal land. 

Critically, this ruling did NOT shut down the pipeline, in part because it came in late January. The court granted a 2 month extension to give the Biden admin time to decide how they want to handle it. In dicta, the court hinted that the agency's own rules might obligate the gov to temporarily shut down the pipeline to conduct the EIS. Similarly, the court hinted that the tribes protesting DAPL would likely be able to seek judicial relief under the APA. The tribes already have a pending case seeking an injunction.

Biden shutdown the Keystone Pipeline just because he wanted to, let alone having a court ruling saying DAPL is currently not operating with a legal permit. Kamala Harris has previously supported shutting DAPL down. The gov has been preparing the EIS since last summer (when lower court first ruled), but it isn't expected to be completed until 2022. 

The Biden admin has until 04/09 to issue their decision. I think the pipeline will be temporarily shutdown at the very least until EIS is completed. 

When the lower court shut it down last year, ET stock price instantly dropped the day the news came out (July 6th). My yolo play is to buy 04/16 $8p. There is a decent volume because of monthly opex and they are pretty cheap! If the pipeline gets shut down on 04/09, the price should drop from $8 to $5-$7 within a couple days.

Edit TLDR: DAPL has a good chance of being shutdown 04/09 which will tank $ET stock price. Buying 04/16 $8p 

This article gives a pretty good breakdown of the legal issue. https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/dakota-access-pipeline-loses-appeal-fueling-shutdown-pressure

Steinbeck -> Grapes of Wrath: Family wanders around looking for work for 700 pages, some chick breast feeds an old guy, book ends. Critics love it.

What you should actually read: East of Eden: The human state of suffering with sense of purpose, love, etc. Actually speaks to something real. Plus there is a dominatrix which you folks should relate too.

&#x200B;

Dostoevsky -> Crime and Punishment: Some dude kills some people and then lays on a couch for 400 pages, feels bad and turns himself in. Critics love it (ok, it's actually a work of genius like everything else he wrote, but still).

What you should read instead:

The Brothers Karamazov: everything you will ever need to know about the human condition.

The Idiot: One of the greatest ending in literature. Truly the Six Feet Under of books.

Fun fact: Dostoevsky was a gambling addict.

Here’s what I tell her—-owning 100 shares of a stock is like owning a house & selling covered calls is like renting a room in that house.  I tell her that every 100 shares is another room in that house to rent. I tell her that if she can wrap her brain around renting rooms in a house, she can wrap her brain around selling covered calls. I explain to her that sometimes you have to evict renters & that’s the same as buying back your call option when things look dicey. Am I giving my mom good advice?

NAS: CBD (Companhia Brasileira de Distribuicao)

Currently trade at $5.13, it was trading between 17 and 26 range.
 
Everyone who is asking why price dropped so hard,

They split.
So they can get read incentives and loans more effectively. 

Now they operate as a regular supermarket like Walmart and their wholesale like Sam’s club independently. 

The good thing is, both are strong and they did not do an IPO, so the stocks were not diluted.

Its basically on a discount of 60% at the moment by a projected cash flow, and it’s $12.55 per share at the moment.

TSLA - 4/30 620c @$90 - Post earnings, ARK loving it, ME loving it, I think it can hit break even of 710 and even 750 by 4/30

CLVS - 3/26 7.50c @$1.20 - Skyrocketed Friday 50% because of phase 3 cancer approval for ovarian cancer. This is huge, I know too many people dying of fucking cancer and anything we can do to slow/stop/cure is big not just for the stock but for life!

PLTR - 5/21 20c @$6 - It's been all over the place, earnings May 4th, another ARK darling, I think it can get back up above 30-35.

All my 3/19 gme calls were ITM so now I'm just sitting on 350 shares I own outright so the earnings call and future for that will be sweet too!

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can buy multiple stocks at your age, for $100 a pop and get rich buy holding till price is reached. You can invest 50% of your portfolio in dividend stocks/etfs and beat inflation. Your timeline is 30+ years. Risking all on a stock is a 100% gamble, risking 10% of your portfolio to say Tesla at it's bottom and adding to a winner is better than yolo's"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Is that something your aching position? Motivated reasoning is usually incredibly sound.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,That would mean it’s ***not*** easy to keep losing money in this market riitard
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,The two are not mutually exclusive.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude we had $3 gas and people driving wayýyyy less fuel efficient cars in the mid 2000s. I think we'll be fine if gas prices recover to pre pandemic levels.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro I lived in the Chicago suburbs when gas was $5/gallon.  People kept moving there.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Wtf you talking about

You have so many options; you need to explore and sitting at home is not gonna help you at all, you have to take action"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don’t set lofty goals. I was in your position for about 3 years - combined with heavy drug use.

Stop putting money into the market. Find a job you can tolerate that gets you out of the house on weekdays. Start offering to help with chores. Ask to find a therapist if you don’t have one. Your parents’ suffering will go down a lot and you can help a bit with money while you save to get out of there. 

Despite what most people on reddit will tell you, it is possible to survive on your own on minimum wage with some savings.

Just do anything to help your parents and yourself, and they will stop blaming you and start rooting for you."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do something. Trade course? College entry course? Finish high school? Get a job? Anything to get yourself moving. Doesn’t have to be the “right” direction. Good luck man, don’t despair, just push forward until you find the path you are meant to be on."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would you post on Facebook
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You should only be posting on Facebook for births deaths and weddings
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s those ‘friends’ you don’t hear from for years who just show up to disagree with you- WTAF. I rarely go near it and as for Twitter it’s so toxic. I’m a Reddit convert - it’s just so funny

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,that's what I'm starting to think
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed. Like this was trading between the $4-$15 range pretty much all year. For insiders to dump in the $30 range should be a warning sign for the apes.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Absolutely goddam right! You don’t need any of that in your head.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You keep doing you and reassure her whenever you think she might be down, but it does seem like the initial comment stemmed from insecurity. Good luck and calls on $GAINS and $JACKD"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Everyone keeps bitching about various trading platforms, while Etrade let's me do whatever the fuck I want, when I want, and has great fills. 

There's a reason it's rated so highly."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow nice speaking man!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Relative to the float and the % of investors in the US there are no people around the world. It's less than 1% outside the US. The Bloomberg terminals are not $25K/mo lie machines built and sold so advanced traders lose their money due to made up data LOL These are just facts you want to desperately ignore.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well let's just say it wouldn't be the first lie told about GME over the last few months, even last year.

I'm willing to bet that's bullshit.  I'm willing to bet that 200 is a steal for a share regardless of squeeze or not.  I'm willing to bet that the extreme shorting of ETFs isn't a coincidence.  I'm willing to bet that if the squeeze was squoze, there wouldn't be such an effort to discourage my investment.  

I've got what I'm willing to lose on the line, and all the time in the world.  I call bullshit on these so called facts, so let's see what happens!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,ok sure. enjoy!

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Of course, I just don't think it's happening enough here to make any difference to anything. Also, it's illegal and very few hedge funds would risk doing it knowing the SEC is watching this stock like a hawk watches it's prey. I can't see how it's worth bankrupting the fund and going to jail for a one-stock play. Why not just short through other safer and legal means?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,How could you read this comment?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Tag his username as a spoiler. Although it'd have to be a permatag for 3/4 of Reddit
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You motherfucker. Maybe I really am autistic.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao, the SEC is fucking worthless. We all know how this works. The hedge funds would just take the slap on the wrist and pay out the fine, which would be less than the tax savings if they were able to bankrupt GameStop."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,You just summarized my entire existence...
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right, and I suppose the billions of dollars in losses due to shorting GME that they are legally obliged to report to the SEC and their investors are also fraud. Sure buddy it's all one big conspiracy like in the movies. It's massive jail time for these kind of crimes, especially given all the retail investors that lost millions. Not to mention all the other hedgefunds that would sue for losses if they could prove others were short selling and it contributed to an illegal squeeze. If you knew what you were talking about you would know that it's not just a 'slap on the wrist' lol, it was before the House Financial Services Committee, and Gabe Plotkin testified that his firm never held 'naked shorts'. That's big jail time right there for that lie and Melvin Capital would never be allowed to operate in the financial markets under that name and management again, no way that is worth the risk. If they wanted to short it they would/could do so in many other legal ways, I think your a bit naive to be honest and think that everybody in the hedge fund business acts like some kind of financial cowboy from the ""Wolf of WallStreet"" , sorry dude the real world is far more boring."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck, you beat me to it. This was the very first to pop into my head whilst reading this 🤣"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Good for you. Now go ahead and sell like a good boy
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah, makes sense. Next few weeks are super risky here with the HF manipulation. Just go long though, will be a nice way to end the summer when this is at $45 :-)"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I like how they don’t go far enough back to previous console cycles and show what those earning look like lol

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,omg what an autist..... thanks for explaining it to me!
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol perfect! You’ll get the hang of it man. Best way to learn is to throw a hundred bucks (or whatever you usually might use for  weekend of poker) and play around. Just remember you don’t need to hold forever! Shares are way different than trading options
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I acknowledge my headline is a bit misleading :p

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mate, cash out, cool down for a week or two, but have some capital left over to play with. Yolo is fine if you did your research and have some more or less justified hypothesis, but what you are doing is revenge trading and it's never a good idea."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It sounds like Citadel is destroying humanity. 47% of all volume? 99% of all traded volume in 3000 listed options? What the hell? No wonder why society is collapsing... you have one hedge fund screwing over humanity.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Breaking up any company that abuses humanity DOES SQUAT! Seriously, why do people think that it will change anything? It's like pretending that  if you had a group of serial killers and if you broke them up in to individual serial killers it would stop them from killing."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"You do realize it will do squat? The billionaires that still manipulate society to make their billions will still exist. What happens when they make another company that continues to do the same thing? Until the rich are taxed to such a degree so that they have to pay back the money they have stolen from society things will continue to get worse for society overall. Billionaires don't get their billions by working hard or creating vast opportunities for humanity, they get it by screwing over society through manipulation."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"They always bail out the rich and pretend that it will fix the economy and the rich always use that money to get richer rather than help the economy. The working class does all the work and the rich get all the benefit. If there was a problem with some ""too big to fail"" they should simply give money to the people starting with the poorest first. Essentially the government rewards the richest and punishes the poorest as if the poor are the ones that cause these problems. They literally reward the people that cause all the problems in society."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, lets say the government breaks them up... you think they will just take their trillions and go live in their mansions and leave society alone? Or do you think they will just create another hedge fund and continue doing the same shit?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Citadel makes 99% of all options trades... this is great deal and it is the heart of this discussion. Citadel can increase IV in any stock because they control 47% of the volume. Increased IV means options getting more expensive. A market maker providing 99% of options trading would be doing this manipulation everyday to make sure people buy expensive options that decay fast.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,">Based on their own testimony the problem is lack of regulation, we follow an honor system and expect everyone to do the right thing.

Banking is heavily regulated, and the level of collusion between bankers and government is insane. Regulations have done nothing to help anything here because the government wants whatever the bankers want.

Did you not think, when reading this testimony, that the bankers would say whatever is in their own best interest? Increasing regulation is handing them more power directly.

At least we can agree."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"So trading clearing houses have buy-side orders put up collateral (usually a small percentage as defaults are *almost* non-existent) to cover any defaults (so they can deliver to their customers/users the security) without the customer getting shafted, essentially. AND THE SELLER. AND THE SELLER.

Ignoring sell-side defaults/non-delivery - margin accounts (of which, say, every robin hood unless you file a request *is* because of instant deposits, even if you can't ""trade on margin"" - instant deposits *are* margin - just interest free - until they clear) - the broker is obligated to pay the seller, regardless of outcome. period. They have to go after the user who placed the order to recover the cash if say, the instant deposit bounced. If you make a $2k instant deposit and buy GME stock, robinhood doesn't have that cash, so they still have to put up collateral and honor it ....... even if  your instant deposit bounces and they don't get the cash.

So imagine you placed an order for $1k of GME via instant deposit, and you have $10 in your checking account, it won't clear, but robinhood has to honor that order and pay the seller and hold the stock..... even if they don't give it to you because your cash didn't clear.... in that aspect, it's a mechanism to make sure the broker can fund the trade they executed.... 

if they have the cash on hand (from you) they pretty much send it same day, the collat is just a nominal handshake to help get rid of any one-off errors or bad entries or whatever and clear that up (hence why it's such a low percentage!) - in the case of masses going instant deposit (using margin without realizing it) then suddenly the clearing agencies are going to go WTF? Do you even have the cash? put up more now!

Maybe this would help - https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/136272/why-would-collateral-be-required-to-make-a-stock-purchase

Most importantly: ""There is a two day window between when a stock transaction executed and it is actually settled. So if we were to agree this instant that I will sell you x shares of y stock for z price the transaction would be executed. However the settlement, where the shares and money actually change hands, takes a couple more days to complete. The collateral is meant to make sure that the money is there when the settlement occurs.""

So the broker puts up their money, to say ""we'll deliver the clients money in the process"" while delivering the clients money.

As well: ""Likewise, settlement of trades between brokerages and other institutions are facilitated by clearing houses. Clearing houses require collateral from the institutions for the same reason. For every buy made by a customer there should be some money to pay for it in the customer's account. The brokerage should be able to withdraw money from customer accounts and deliver it to the clearing house before settlement. But should isn't good enough: a guarantee is needed. The collateral provides that guarantee.""

Essentially, the broker is using their cash to guarantee that the customers cash will come through (however that method is)"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you.  Essentially the issue boils down to a lag in mechanics then, where the money going from user to broker takes time to proess, and the CH wants RH today until the user>broker money comes through.

So your view is that there were mass deposits punted into a risky security at once which caused a liquidity issue as RH didnt have cash on hand to cover the bill for a few days?"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,">So your view is that there were mass deposits punted into a risky security at once which caused a liquidity issue as RH didnt have cash on hand to cover the bill for a few days?

Quite frankly, that's what many other brokers said actually happened - and what they (RH) said to congress too - and by the *letter of the law* it makes sense.

I'm not saying nothing shady happened, i'm saying it's actually just legitimately explainable.

https://twitter.com/YahooFinance/status/1354840317879595014

Video of webull CEO explaining what and how it happened and why webull (and other brokers) had to do it

Basically, the larger firms that had bigger balance sheets and higher margins (charged commissions, had other revenue, etc) had less restrictions. RH has only very low/very few revenue streams, so they're at much higher risk of doing things like this.

Like how ameritrade only restricted some types of options trades, but didn't restrict stocks - they had a much better financial position to cover/raise collat than RH did."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,">And yes, you stupid cunt, you can 3x your salary in software and data science after 3 years.








I guess whatever career you're in doesn't require much reading comprehension because I never said that you can't, you moron. I said ""almost nobody does"", which is true. Anyway, the point I have made in all of my comments is that ON AVERAGE software and data science jobs are nowhere near in salary to the AVERAGE IB job salaries after 3 years. 






Your inability to understand the difference between outliers and averages tells me you would be a terrible data scientist. This is high school stats.










>Why do you think developers switch jobs so early in their career? Its because companies don't want to give them 40% raises a year, they switch into a role that is 3x you complete fucking moron, or they go to a startup that has higher long term potential.












It extremely rare for people to switch jobs and make 3x their previous salary. This is next level delusion. And, it's pretty easy to prove. Googling for software developer/data analyst salaries with 3 years of experience and filtering for high-paying employers shows salaries nowhere near $250-$450K. 







Anyway, that's beside the point because, again, you are too dense to understand what an outlier is. I hope you realize that you can switch jobs to increase your salary in any field. If that's your argument for coding jobs being higher then that makes no sense since it would apply to any other job. And since IB has a much higher average salary they would still be higher. This is elementary school math that you can't seem to grasp. If you increase a and a+1 by the same percent (via switching switching jobs) then a+1 will always be bigger.











By the way, why'd you delete your last comment? Strange. If I'm a ""complete fucking moron"" then you should be able to string together a reply to me that you don't instantly remove out of embarrassment. Then again, by now it's obvious you aren't the brightest."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's pretty easy to google average associate salaries for bulge bracket banks. I never said they were 800k. 




Also 22 +3 is 25. Not sure why you think they're 20 years old lol.





But then again it's clear you don't ever understand what the word ""average"" means since you tried to argue that outlier coders can make more than the average banker. No shit, they're the outliers. So, I shouldn't expect much from you."

Why 25 cents and above? Because that's 54 weeks x 25 cents $13.5 per year in premiums if I sell at min 25 cents a week or 50% return worse case. My true Average is much much lower that 27.12 because I obtain those shares from selling puts collecting $2 to $4 per share in premiums over one month spam."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are a few things to clear up about people who don't understand Nokia's stock price. First, I'll say that I am long on Nokia and I continue to build my position by buying more at this discounted price because it is definitely way undervalued. Secondly, it's not necessarily about the 5 billion float. Apple has a 17 Billion float and billions more shares outstanding and it's price moves up and down often. Ericsson (which is Nokia's competition) has 3 billion in float and their price has moved up to $13+ from $6. The key about a float is volume, NOT just volume though... it must be ""BUYING VOLUME"" and it must greatly outweigh selling volume. I've seen stocks move with billions of float and not much volume because most of the volume was BUYING VOLUME. 
Thirdly, even if there are only 5 million shares of Nokia being shorted it's still enough to weigh down on the price. For example, if the volume is only 30 million in a day and 5 million of that is being shorted then the algorithm triggers the price to be negatively affected because that's a great percentage of shorting compared to its volume. 
Lastly, I'll say that I do believe the price will move to 5 and higher between now and end of April so if you're building position then now seems to be the best time to add to that position. Nokia's CEO is doing great! He's executing the growth plan and he's only been there since August of 2020."

I know you’ve only been on reddit a year but the public consensus was tesla was a trash car company making electric cars nobody wanted, WSB was divided until it hit $350 last year. The people buying puts eventually died. I think non gamers do not understand the Asian market of esports and the growing esports market in the USA. I could be wrong but I have money on being right."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Here’s hoping. I was doing 15-20 minutes on max resistance before I got Covid. I’m going hard on ab stuff too so I can have a full blown six pack soon

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Further down the thread he claims he was only making a joke... should have asked him to tell me the bid ask spread on GME calls to see if he knew his shit or not.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Mods talked about it but I guess they care more about catering to the apes now...
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m actually glad we didn’t have one - can you imagine in feb through to March when lamestock got hot and we were all destroyed? You know that’s all they would have had
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahaha they deleted the inversing FUD jackass. That was one of the stupidest shit I’ve read on here. Also lmao at him for thinking you lost money because you’re talking down on GME. Just because you’re bag holding doesn’t mean everyone is. I’d say most of the people here before the influx made off like bandits during the initials run up.

But we did give them a lot of new pro memberships, and they did get into the spotlight which is worth probably a lot in terms of revenues.  I think they'll give hopeful guidance and talk about their pivot to digital.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Love you for that. But seriously. A year ago I was afraid to even comment because you guys shat on anyone who didn’t know what they were talking about. It’s just frustrating to think we are now in the minority.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, true.  It would be expensive to go private right now.

I think the point of going private would just be to eliminate the stock drama and volatility.  They have a complicated turnaround and having to report to investors seems like a further complicating factor"

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah people could have been a little more accommodating but at least it made people learn before saying something and getting themselves in less trouble. Now they are so ok with not doing options they can’t even blow up their accounts and leave. They’re like gremlins now.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"So true.  I lurked here for so long.  It was intimidating as hell and I took Derivatives in school, lol.  But everybody here used to know so much, I didn't want to chime in with stupid stuff and get roasted.  I learned a lot from the OG's."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"But we shit on everyone for any reason we can come up with, lol. For example, just the other day I was shitting on u/TimForBroke for being bald and I don't even know if he's bald or not!"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Okay yeah I see your point. Maybe once the share price comes crashing down. I could have seen them going private before any of this price action.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh my! That's quite the accident! I'd be surprised they didn't take her to the vet, but that's how we got my childhood dog.

It's a great cautionary tale for anyone new (so I respect him sharing it) and a ""lol loss porn"" for many others.There's no different ""world"" where anyone else lives where matters are different. **He** had the profit, **he** risked it and **he lost it**.Most importantly, when he said ""house money"" he does not mean it is 200k that belongs to his household/family, he meant it was ""house money"" as in ""the casino's money"". He was up by 220k.

Seems he's down 35k of his own money and has 5k left and is planning to try and turn it around.

As to him having the money to put in 40k; I know this is a harsh thing to say, but he isn't responsible or at fault in the slightest if you don't have money. What he does with his cash doesn't affect you (or me), so I don't understand what good lashing out at him would ever do.

Good luck in turning a profit for you, me and other poor apes. We get nothing from hating eachother."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,The second company I invested in was Nikola. So relatable.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,">the world thinks WW3 is about to start that’s just one small part of it, but not the main reasons for the crash it’s a lot deeper and more at play.

What could be bigger then a world war? Im seriously curious, I lack imagination to come up with a worse scenario."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Check his post history if you haven’t already. 

Be advised."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ya, 100%. If he’s making that kind of money at 33, it’s a well established business.

And this guy does not seem coherent enough to have built it himself from the ground up. Unless his mental decline has started recently."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds like an owner whose company I want to be invested in. Fella gets it done.
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I got fucked on cc during the last squeeze. Learned my lesson.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Try CPE, CDEV and PBF"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not just try and trade stocks in a less volatile setting? Most people making money aren't making intraday trades. There's a good book called money masters of our time by john train. This guy interviews all the greatest investors of that era (it was written in like the 90's or early 00's I think).You can take their strategies and try to adapt them to an inefficient market where the big dogs can't play cause they have too much $$$.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep I do. Even for a stock like gamestop you can guess where people, either retail as the big whales, place their orders, stop losses etc. which causes movement. Technical analysis is nothing else but doing this with some additional tools."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Just watching at the moment but debating getting in. I’ve had a low level inside scoop on some of the inner goings on of the company for the past few years. They really made some boneheaded decisions but seem to be cleaning up their act recently. Wondering if they’ll get back up to $30 in a year or two lol

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your argument is that ""some proof could theoretically exist in one of the thousands of Google listing, on some place on the Internet, and this constitutes solid, worthwhile proof.""

2) I am sitting beside my excalibur dehydrator which I purchased for making meals for backpacking and bike touring.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I guess this is twitch where I have to literally put a /Sarcasm tag on my blatantly, obviously sarcastic comments.

Or maybe I live in a world so toxic that people don't immediately laugh and want to smoke pot with me when I tell them ""I bet you purchase pre-manufactured freeze dried backpacking meals instead of making your own.""

That's something a TV writer would come up with as a trope.

Its all good mate, its just sad we think we're being aggro to each other by default."

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Trends come and go though so while White Claw and Truly are killing it right now it doesn't necessarily mean that this will be the case in a couple of years. In a few years these hard seltzers will be like Zima was by the late 90s and people will move onto something else. So even in MolsonCoors isn't winning in seltzer it's not necessarily a long term problem as long as they stay on top of new trends.

But this is probably a super long term play."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"In most market corrections booze stocks tend to hold up reasonably well because they tend to be relatively recession proof. People often drink more booze in a bad economy so selling booze tends to be a good business in general.

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,So you think Canadian operators have no upside?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Last paragraph is where I think the upside would come from... Momentum from a sympathy trade... People see weed news, they put money in the weed stocks they know... Rising tide lifts all boats kinda thing until people digest

I can see Candian operators go up on a SAFE Banking passage just cause people are dumb as shit

But once US operators get uplisted, I see huge downside in Candian companies"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,I am bullish on tlry but love to hear the bear case. Is there any event that would make you change your mind on the Canadian companies?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Everyday that Candian operators are kept out of the US market, is another day the US operators become more entrenched and gobble up more market share and figure out the winning formula

It would change the calculus if US fully legalized asap because that would mean they can start catching up... This seems doubtful... And not only do they need to catch up, they need to 3x their numbers to justify current valuations as compared to US operators"
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,Why are you bullish in Tilray?
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"I do like the potential expansion in the European medical market. Most medical cannabis would be reimbursed by the health insurances. Also, I do like the expertise that the tlry Alpha
will bring to the table. The only thing that scares me for Europe is a far right win which is really seem likely at the moment and it’s implication on the market. The balance sheet is heading to the right direction. 
Lastly tlry has a good brand recognition for the retail

03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not go to the theater, watch the NCAA tournament instead (like everyone else), and buy puts."
03/21/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here's the thing though. They tried blocking buys. It didn't work. It made things worse, because it confirmed the thesis and they never truly covered in earnest. Not even when it dropped all the way back to to $50. That's when we knew they were REALLY screwed. So more of us held. More of us bought more. The more aggressive and obvious they are about trying to stop it WITHOUT covering, the more clear it is how screwed they are. Bankrupting $GME is off the table now. These short positions have to get covered by somebody.

We now know that the time to face the music was when Cohen bought in. That's what screwed them. We just made it worse. Think about that. If the situation was too unrecoverable to take the hit all the way back then, how serious is it now? More than 140% seems likely. This could easily be trillions. If they keep delaying more people realize we're right and pile on and it gets worse. If they block buys again, it gets worse. They need to rip this band-aid off ASAP, even if one of Wall Street's limbs comes off with it."
