2021-06-24 19:48:52,wallstreetbets,"Why don‚Äôt you roll them forward, pending which options you may receive a credit from theta decay, unless you no longer want to be a shareholder"
2021-06-24 19:42:57,wallstreetbets,What was the price of the Tesla shares when you originally bought them and when did you buy them? If the shares are exercise you just end up selling the shares. The premium is already count as a gain and if you buy them back it is counted as a loss. I would buy them back before they get executed if you want to keep the shares and hold them for long term capital gains.
2021-06-24 19:32:03,wallstreetbets,We‚Äôre is the loss from? Did you pay more than $640 per share?
2021-06-24 19:57:47,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure there is no loss to offset anything - that just sucks for you. More of an opportunity loss.
2021-06-24 19:23:22,wallstreetbets,Set fire to the shares?

2021-06-24 19:27:55,wallstreetbets,"I thought you still earn the premium on covered call when it get exercised, so they'll tax you on that capital gain? You can occur a loss on covered call?"
2021-06-24 19:32:35,wallstreetbets,Depends if you wanna keep you shares lol. If you buy them back then they were never really a covered call and makes 0 diff
2021-06-24 19:35:46,wallstreetbets,"I thought when your option expires and you loose your premium, it is a write off for that premium or am I wrong? Also, if you sell your option at a loss, I would think that is a tax reduction. I could be wrong."
2021-06-24 19:51:14,wallstreetbets,If he bought his stock when Tesla was higher than 640 he will take a loss when he sells it.
2021-06-24 19:48:07,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre wrong
2021-06-24 19:48:28,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs when buying calls and they expire out of the money. He‚Äôs selling calls. So the premium is a profit for him. His loss is that he has to sell the stock at 640 even though it‚Äôs currently worth 680
2021-06-24 19:50:54,wallstreetbets,IC.  OK. Thanks.

There's a lot to be optimistic about with BB,  and  I plan on taking another position if and when it drops below 10 again.  But in the short -to-medium term there's no reason to think BB is going to moon unless everyone starts piling into it.  Long-term,  once they've realized the sale of their patent portfolio and they start seeing significant recurring revenue from licensing,  it's got big potential."

CLF bought MT's US business. Both have iron ore mines. In case of inflation they don't become takers of inflation like others. CLF is also popular here. Who knows, maybe one day more retards will understand its potential

Bought X for the volatility. Need to keep things exciting. BHP (typo in earlier post) is a pure commodities play. Hope this helps and good luck."

2021-06-24 17:24:49,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm surprised it hasn‚Äôt caught sympathy from the NVDA run. The share buy back didn‚Äôt seem to push much either. We had a small run from the Google news. IMO it‚Äôs gonna break out anytime. Todays infrastructure news focusing on internet and the banks staying strong can‚Äôt hurt.

2021-06-24 17:28:18,wallstreetbets,The shares buy back program is delayed to unknown date ; I saw that in an article when I was searching for news about AMD
2021-06-24 16:35:08,wallstreetbets,It depends on what long term is ; isn't it Intel that has exploded its R&D investments to get back against AMD ? It could take a while before Intel really goes up again. I could be wrong..
2021-06-24 17:03:34,wallstreetbets,"Haha, yeah I have always hated Intel, my first cpu was AMD Athlon then I switched to Intel for awhile and it did not seem that great. Plus AMD makes the chips in Taiwan not China"
2021-06-24 17:33:13,wallstreetbets,I would suspect the news of it would help. There was also news of the Xilinx merger last week maybe getting approved by the EU. It seems that tech is strong overall and it baffles me that AMD isn‚Äôt breaking out. I chart it every day several times thinking it gonna pop‚Ä¶ then it doesn‚Äôt.

(Xanax heavily impares your judgement, memory, you don't care about consequences). anyways by December of last year I put my last 2k into gme calls and it squeezed a month later. I reached fucking a 100k drastic life changing money. I couldn't sell due to restrictions by Robin hood so I watched it plummet to about 20k till when I could sell. This accelerated my drug abuse to point where I was acting extremely risky and vile. embarrassed myself and lost almost all my friends, and ones still left don't trust me with money. ended up going to rehab for two months and I'm still sober. sadly I don't remember how but I managed to trade it all away. probably revenge trading to get my 100k back. anyways today I reached my breaking point. I was supposed to move out with my friends at the end of next month, but they told me a week ago I needed to have $5k by then because they knew I gambled all my money away and I only had $1k. now today its down to $250. so fucking depressed and idk what to do next. anyone who reads this thanks for listening to me bitch"

One thing that frequently puts me off joining WSB bandwagons is that by the time a new play or DD hits the front page, the media has already picked it up and therefore the train has already massively left the station. Piling into a stonk which has already increased by several dozen dollars or percentage points in the previous 24 hours or 5 days never seems like the best idea. Sorting by /new isn't really effective seeing as you have to sort through the inordinate amount of quality shitposting this sub is famous for.

That being said, is there a subreddit to discuss, for want of a better phrase, ""upstart"" WSB style plays? Stonks to get in on which aren't already half way to the moon by the time you see the threads popping up here?"

2021-06-24 16:31:43,wallstreetbets,"So I was doing research to see which stocks actually have short squeeze potential. A couple of them do, but it‚Äôs not guaranteed. 

WKHS has the highest potential currently with 40.21% SI-113.38m float- 123.26m outstanding. 

CLOV comes in second with 36.60% SI- 112.78m 

AMC It‚Äôs SI is only 13% 498.6m float- 501.78 outstanding

What I‚Äôm getting at here is Short Squeezes aren‚Äôt something that happens often. In fact they are incredibly rare. Be careful you FOMO into any of these because a squeeze is incredibly rare and if it seems like a candidate for a squeeze it isn‚Äôt guaranteed to happen."

2021-06-24 19:25:21,wallstreetbets,Fannie Mae was in a SCOTUS case that did not resolve in a manner that was financially favorable to them.
2021-06-24 19:29:39,wallstreetbets,"They were private companies. Then the Great Recession hit and they were basically taken over by the government. Fannie stock went from around $60 to 60 cents in a year. The stock was still publicly traded, but the US government controlled the companies. 

Then a libertarian Trump appointee tried to spin them off into truly private companies again, but couldn't get the Trump administration to approve of his plans. Then Biden took over and wanted to replace that guy. The Supreme Court ruled that Biden was free to get rid of him and put in someone else. That new person probably won't take them private. 

So if you owned stock in them thinking that they'd stop being under government control soon and would moon, you saw your shares tank right after the Supreme Court decision."

2021-06-24 17:15:49,wallstreetbets,"If there were nothing to worry about with RIG it wouldn't be trading single digits.

It's like I'm short gamma with this thing. The more it goes up, the more of I I try to buy. Tried to work around $4.60 a few hundred at the close, didn't get it, that probably means it'll be up another quarter tomorrow. I did pick up some last week in the 3-handle.

It's my YOLO, long more than 10k shares."
2021-06-24 19:04:33,wallstreetbets,"In the 3s is a good place for RIG. Right now it's not even at its High of the year wich was just under 5.  They have alot of excess capacity,  thats not being used. And pipelines are killing the offshore business.  Wich has a much higher cost to extract.  Oil hitting 100 is not enough, there also needs to be more demand than onshore sites can keep up with before RIFlG will take off.  Bought in at 4.84 because I was sure in February that oil would hit 100 this year. Sold offafter a couple months of watching it dwindle down. Still holding a 3.50 and 4.50 Leap."
2021-06-24 15:57:46,wallstreetbets,Gonna be a long investment. People still don't want to get back to work and production is low. So at least 6 months till oil goes up.

2021-06-24 16:58:56,wallstreetbets,"Ok so first off the -20 was due to an error. You would know that if you knew anything about oil. Second maybe, just maybe it was so low because we shut down so many stores, factories, and ships ü§°. So supply and demand, no more demand but you keep making more. Third it will take 6 more months before we used up the storage and need to start pumping more. Hunts why it is still cheap."
2021-06-24 17:04:58,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it didn't go to negetive 20 due to a math error, that's how supply works when you are caught with a useless product in the futures market; you have to give it away for free hence the -20...they were paying to get it off their hands because of cost of storage..."
2021-06-24 17:13:07,wallstreetbets,"Hey dummy, the oil was still being sold and used. It just cost $20 more than what you sell it for to store. The cost of storage and shipping is never included in the price. 

Ill make it simple. You make toilet paper. It costs you $100 to store 1M rolls. Each roll sells for $1. So the price per roll is $1. Suddenly 99% of demand stops. So you sell it for $1 for 1000 rolls. The price per roll didn't become negative, your busnesses just no longer profits. YOU ARE STILL SELLING ROLLS. I honestly can not belive i have to explain this."
2021-06-24 17:17:07,wallstreetbets,"It is if there is a huge back log of oil, like what happened when everything shut down. Then you are sitting on millions of barrels of oil that you need to pay for storage.

Keep in mind also that there are firms that trade in oil futures as well, unlike your silly little toilet paper analogy which didn't include toilet paper futures because if it did then you'd have a significant amount of the market having to pay for storage of useless toilet paper rolls, therfore In an extreme circumstance cause toilet paper rolls to go negetive as well lol"
2021-06-24 17:20:06,wallstreetbets,The producers are contractually obligated to sell it to the ones under contract. So production price is always positive as the produce as needed. The ones getting it are required under contract to take it. It becomes their problem. They tried to give it away however they are NOT producers and do not make up the price.

The truth is that this company is going to be a great long play giving the potential pipeline and the recently news of emerging revenue sources. Thanks(?) to the hedge funds who are shorting this stock for keeping it at the bargain bin price.

I am happy to say that I haven't sold a share since the start and have been steadily picking some more on every dip. Got a good feeling this will be the source of my possible early retirement."
2021-06-24 19:08:29,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve been accumulating for last 18 months in 3 investment accounts. Short interest has been between 73 million and 55 million shares and many more (likely same or higher number of naked shorts unreported). This is what has kept the share price depressed, but in fact has created a tightly wound spring. With a pipeline that is unparalleled across the whole biotech industry, the thing that differentiates this company from Others is the unbelievable potential this company has for future revenue and earnings. Across segments for pain (5 to 10 billion annual potential), oncology (10 to 15 billion annual revenue), monoclonal antibody ( 5 to 10 billion annual revenue), Drug + antibody conjugated (5 to 10 billion), novel delivery systems (3 to 5 billion) and therapeutics + diagnostics (3 to 5 billion) there is potential for 30 to 50 billion in annual revenue. With a 10x multiplier on revenue this company has a forward looking valuation of over $300 Billion. That would be a gain of 150x over current SP. The math is Easy. This will be over 10x by 2022 (over $100 sp) and another 10x to 15x ($1,000 to $1,500 sp) by 2023. These gains will be based on fundamapentals, revenue, earnings and pipeline.

Wow. Good job."
2021-06-24 16:17:14,wallstreetbets,"My experience: I recently transferred from Webull to TDAmeritrade. 

Webull customer service disappointed me. TD A covered the $75 transfer fee without any hassle.

The long story why: webull uses Apex Clearing (also Webull gets paid by Citadel, if you have any feelings about Citadel.)

Edit:My bad, Citadel also has hands in TD Ameritrade. I‚Äôm not sure where they don‚Äôt.

Apex was sending me snail mail paper reports on every single activity and charging me $2-$5 for each separate transactions to mail me.

The reason is they claimed my email address of which I signed up for the Webull account wasn‚Äôt correct.

However, I get all sorts of emails from Webull just fine. Since the very start. Cuz I have to do the click the link to verify my account thingy and the link was sent to my email.

After going round and round for several days, because finger pointing:

Apex says they do not deal with end users like us. 

Webull insists it‚Äôs all on Apex‚Äôs end and that it‚Äôs my fault for the Apex having the wrong/invalid email address.

Webull finally tells me to check my profile to make sure the email is correct. And it is, I never changed it at any point. 

Apex sends me an email saying they have received updates account information of [MyEmail@Address] to [MyEmail@Address]

It‚Äôs the same, unchanged address!!

The $2-$5 fees racked up still stand though, neither will waive the fee, again pointing fingers at each other. And at me.

The ‚Äúat me‚Äù part was salted slap because they, both Webull AND Apex had the same correct email address the whole time.

This whole process involved A LOT of canned responses, and repeated ‚Äútake it up with the other company.‚Äù

Anyways, that‚Äôs my story and cautionary tale"

2021-06-24 16:23:34,wallstreetbets,"I love how clueless the people who circlejerk themselves about how bad Robinhood is. 

Literally 90% of brokerages charge PFOF... 97% charge PFOF on options. 

Even better, it's either WeBull or Etoro that you're only trading with other users... So, literally, you're investing in a dark pool where your buy/sell orders will never hit an open exchange.

Process depends on how much net worth you have. I would call the brokerage you are transferring to for questions."
2021-06-24 16:27:16,wallstreetbets,">But, hey, switch to Fedelity! They're TOTALLY on your side (after they cash in 9m gamestop shares at it's peak).

Sounds like a great active manager managing the mutual fund.

I don't see anything wrong with this. If I were to invest in active funds (not a fan), then I expect the fund managers to be sane enough to sell at the peak. This is a sign of a great fund manager (or at least you know the fund manager isn't completely delusional).

But ya, most people are clueless about everything. It's okay. They also have some ridiculous hopes and dreams that make no mathematical sense."
2021-06-24 16:31:04,wallstreetbets,"I agree. Fedelity was doing exactly what a brokerage/bank/investing firm would normally do.

However, the sentiment at the time was more similar to ""fuck the status quo, this is a revolution."" Whereupon Fedelity went ""Yeah... No.""

But you want something to think about while you're chewing your bubble gum? They're basically the only brokerage that sold at the top... When you open an account with them, and you're showing them your cash on hand and your securities you have, and all the good shit they can definitely keep a much better track of when they themselves are managing it...

Don't you think they're going to use that against you, too?"

2021-06-24 15:46:58,wallstreetbets,PSFE is really undervalued at these levels. I never thought I would get to buy PSFE at these levels. In since the SPAC days.

2021-06-24 16:03:42,wallstreetbets,"interesting, might be worth a shot. was tracking this one a while back and then forgot about it."
2021-06-24 17:11:37,wallstreetbets,I saw someone talking about some DD on here this morning and I anticipated seeing more hype for this on here. I bought 25 $12 calls that expire August 20. Let's go autists!!
2021-06-24 15:45:06,wallstreetbets,In for some calls.
2021-06-24 18:55:07,wallstreetbets,Why such a short options position?

2021-06-24 15:36:53,wallstreetbets,I like it. So you thinning the positives will push it up relatively quickly based on your calls? I assumed it was more long term play based on the DD

2021-06-24 15:46:36,wallstreetbets,I love PSFE but the first chart is some brain damaged level retarded shit. The reason there was a rise in HF‚Äôs with PSFE positions is because it just went public recently. Y‚Äôall mfs never cease to amaze.
2021-06-24 16:29:25,wallstreetbets,Not bothering with this solely because of the dozens of  rewards within an hour. My pump and dump senses are tingling

2021-06-24 16:26:04,wallstreetbets,Haha it's so true.  People want double digit % gains everday versus hitting a 2-3x bagger over the course of a year.

2021-06-24 19:33:49,wallstreetbets,I'm in at about 12.10 was planning on making it a longer term investment though.
2021-06-24 18:56:58,wallstreetbets,Sorry I'm not too smart at warrants. What do you mean?
2021-06-24 19:30:50,wallstreetbets,Warrants are like long calls but no expiration until they are called back. They involve leverage and typical move 50-100% above the common shares. So a bit more risk vs. reward.
2021-06-24 16:34:47,wallstreetbets,You mad man!
2021-06-24 19:00:36,wallstreetbets,Big competitors like PayPal and Square are rapidly expanding into PaySafe's sectors.

2021-06-24 17:17:07,wallstreetbets,Same...that's why I only bought some $12 calls this morning when I saw it being mentioned out of nowhere.
2021-06-24 18:43:31,wallstreetbets,It became a stock.
2021-06-24 19:34:57,wallstreetbets,"Same, bought to be a long term hold, like years, but if the apes catch on‚Ä¶."
2021-06-24 16:05:21,wallstreetbets,For sure. I‚Äôm all about PSFE and it‚Äôs gonna rocket eventually. I was just stunned by how retarded one has to be to build a graph like that and think it makes sense
2021-06-24 19:38:00,wallstreetbets,I'll probably sell some shares if it goes up and buy some more when it goes down..

2021-06-24 15:28:58,wallstreetbets,Agree. Best part is that it cannot be posted yet on WSB because it doesn‚Äôt trade options....YET!!! Supposedly application submitted to CBOE. So when this does list options and get recognized by WSB in addition to short squeeze potential gamma squeeze. Early days here. Not many people know this one. Not financial advice just a good educated bet.
2021-06-24 15:45:13,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, that's why I loaded up, once the options come into play, it will start the squeeze, this bounce was based on the Google pushing back the cookies privacy to late 2023, if the Reddit wsb board picks it up, it can easily be the next GME with such a small float"

I do feel this stock is going to do great in the long term from here through next summer for sure! But expect a dip in the stock after summer is over, obviously.

2021-06-24 15:42:52,wallstreetbets,"Given that cats are more popular than dogs in America, it‚Äôs fair to assume that the majority of Chewy‚Äôs revenue comes from cats. So you are really invested in a cat food company. Sounds like someone is a closeted cat person.

2021-06-24 16:39:38,wallstreetbets,Hard to predict because it is an ETF with some diverse holdings. Majority of the ETF is infrastructure companies and materials so honestly I see a sizeable gain that will go steady.

2021-06-24 14:20:53,wallstreetbets,"Consider looking at VSTO. Similarly FBI background checks show increasing gun sells, however, unlike Ruger it is less impacted by negative legislation as quickly because they only sell ammo (and other outdoor/hunting brands). Less volitile lately so likely cheaper options.

Not to mention that the current gun and ammo frenzy won't last forever. VSTO has been acquiring competitor ammo producers during the boom to prepare for the eventual bust.

Not financial advice and plz do your own research."

2021-06-24 14:56:08,wallstreetbets,As soon as I got guns I became more conservative lmao
2021-06-24 14:51:14,wallstreetbets,"Nothing lasts forever, but so long as the gun buying boom continues what is most certain of all is two things:

1) Everyone who owns a firearm needs ammo. 
2) Restrictive ammo legislation, although more effective gun control, is significantly more unpopular and is no where near within the US.

And a bonus 3rd since I can't count, VSTO has consolidated into becoming the US civilian majority ammo producer. So long as people own firarms they'll have consistent revenue. The upcoming change would be the margin of that should the buying boom tapper off in the near future. (Did I mention they raised ammo prices with inflation and the anmo shortage is still just as bad as before? People are accepting the higher prices)"
2021-06-24 15:53:43,wallstreetbets,There will always be gun nuts buying ammo in this country.
2021-06-24 15:58:08,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, but the key difference is the rate. Higher rate = higher margins b/c scarcity = markup."

2021-06-24 14:31:29,wallstreetbets,I'm guessing you haven't even looked at the financials. But go right ahead and buy a company that has been losing money for years and has more debt than assets.
2021-06-24 13:58:17,wallstreetbets,Are you sure
2021-06-24 15:20:20,wallstreetbets,"This stonk looks like total garbage and I can‚Äôt really tell what hotels it actually owns.

2021-06-24 14:45:55,wallstreetbets,That's what I was wondering too. Seems like they're not gonna be able to turn it around if they're loaded down with bad debt.

Although sometime you get crap, most of the time it comes through, for the price you simply can not beat it. It succeeded in China, I don't see how it will fail in the US.

Sure WISH got screwed last year because of the Fort Detrick Virus and they couldn't fulfill some of the orders, but that is over now and factories are back to full force.

2021-06-24 17:07:56,wallstreetbets,The trick is to not keep watching. Then you can go through life thinking it was good. I tapped out somewhere in season 5. I heard they weren't based on the books anymore and I figured that was a good time to stop.

2021-06-24 15:29:08,wallstreetbets,"I think decent chance we see a run back up to $900 in the coming weeks.

The increase in price is likely mainly due to shareholder rotation. Shareholders who needed to diversify or thought the price was high have been selling and are likely for the most part done with their selling now. You might have catalysts like the positivity associated with the S Plaid (especially that new motor was a surprise that no one was expecting) but shareholder rotation is likely the main explanation.

As long as Tesla can continue to perform and they put out nice numbers for Q2 reaffirming the story, I think we can get back up there in short order.

As to people thinking it is overvalued, there are plenty who think this stock is perhaps the best stock you can buy today to ensure future returns. No point trying to time this as, like you have seen this past week, completely unexpected the stock shot up. Probably Michael Burry is someplace screaming."
2021-06-24 15:42:52,wallstreetbets,"I have 800c expiring 16/7.. I am hopeful, so should you be."
2021-06-24 13:32:35,wallstreetbets,"Sell some of them and worry less. You‚Äôre probably up a lot. That‚Äôs your $ now. It‚Äôs faded a bit today along with other tech, banks & industrials seem to be gaining off infrastructure news, but no one knows where it‚Äôs headed. Put some profits in your pocket and chill."

2021-06-24 13:44:27,wallstreetbets,"My portfolio is 100% TSLA.  I watch the stock everyday and I‚Äôm always reading about the company.  I can‚Äôt ever figure out why we are having these big surges.  There are times where we have lots of positive news and the stock moves sideways or drops.  I personally don‚Äôt plan to sell, as I think the stock will continue to go up."
2021-06-24 19:13:51,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôd love to see a run up to 750-800 and consolidate then rip again.
2021-06-24 19:44:57,wallstreetbets,700+ tomorrow!!

2021-06-24 19:47:41,wallstreetbets,"I was hesitant on going $700+ with the slight downturn at the end of the day, but AH was surprising with a hint of green! With good CPI numbers tomorrow hopefully it‚Äôll break past 700, and we might see it touch a little higher before I‚Äôd guess it would consolidate around $705 or so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è but then again, TSLA makes me wet sooooo"
2021-06-24 14:57:21,wallstreetbets,Do you think the market will react badly with the news or could it already be priced in from people being nervous leading up to it?
2021-06-24 19:50:00,wallstreetbets,"I didn't want to take a HUGE risk so I bought two 690c 6/25 for around $4.50... ($900)

I'll watch it closely, if it doesn't shoot up in the first hour, I'll try to sell them to limit risk."
2021-06-24 15:55:34,wallstreetbets,"Hard to say, expectations are def there but actual s could be worse or better. Just take some gains if you‚Äôre worried"

2021-06-24 14:37:42,wallstreetbets,"there's currently 3.7million calls on 1.4bil share float. If those calls go ITM, whoever sold those calls will all be short.

So minimum, 25% short. Potentially a lot more since we know they're shorting to keep price down.

&#x200B;

also, 20k shares available for shorting, out of 1.4billion? wtf?"
2021-06-24 14:42:52,wallstreetbets,"Right but how accurate is that short data? Seems unrealistic especially for a whole number like 20,000. Also when do the calls expire? If they expire worthless then there‚Äôs no pressure on the stock"

2021-06-24 16:00:01,wallstreetbets,What brings me amusement is that the TWO stocks everyone initially called a distraction from AMC and GME are the only two that have made significant moves so far... CLOV and WISH. BLOCK THE NOISE AND HOLD TIGHT. Ignore the shills.

2021-06-24 16:32:04,wallstreetbets,"Your account is 3 months old, pot calling the kettle black much? At face value WISH is a meme sure, but if you actually read into some of the excellent analysis you could understand more about its long term prospects. I have full belief in a $20 price target for the mid term, and this is based off various different professional analyses (lmk if you want a link to the main one). Sure there is a lot of meme frenzy on here it has to contend with, but just as with GME initially, there is actually a case for it being a good value stock. Out of all the popular ‚Äòmeme‚Äô stocks on this subreddit, this is the only one i truly believe has potential. All the volume flowing in from meme spastics is just a bonus"

>If you want to know how real the boom in home furnishings sales is and how much America is spending to make their homes nicer, all you have to do is ask La-Z-Boy.  
By one measurement that the company uses, ‚Äúwritten same-store sales‚Äù for the entire Galleries network doubled, increasing 100% for the quarter. For the year, those sales were up 31%.

  
Their CEO noted the following in the earnings call (also covered at Forbes) -  


>For the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter, record sales led to all-time record profits driven by increased production capacity, excellent performance by our company-owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores, and continued growth and profitability at Joybird.  
Fiscal 2022 is off to a great start with continued robust written order rates and a record backlog, setting us up well for a strong year of shipments ahead."

2021-06-24 15:43:00,wallstreetbets,Why do you think it'll go down once it hits $44? I think $50 is the next target it will likely hit by January to March
2021-06-24 15:55:38,wallstreetbets,"Mainly because $45 is where it‚Äôs always stalled out this year. They had more potential before the CEO retired and insiders started selling. At this point they‚Äôve already posted any record sales they were going to post, if they can keep it up that‚Äôs great and they may be a good long term hold. But it‚Äôll take another year and some surprise for them push past $45 imo."

Look at the biggest names on this sub and who made money and they all followed fundamentals. The only standout is they picked relatively obscure stocks.

GME, CLF(new price targets having been raised to an average of 29 a share), zim by some guy hollering about transport/shipping companies. All were and might still be great plays.

And end thing, this isn't about apes strong together bullshit. 

Here is where I get downvoted. I bought into GME at 22. Sold at 52. Then bought again at 44, and sold 180. And am currently waiting to see the new bottom is before buying some more to sell at a peak.

No one here cares about you other than you. You sell when you are happy with profit. Don't fucking hold forever.

Best investment for steel in the US Id say CLF and NUE maybe STLD.

X has issues with management and is a pretty small company. They also have to buy iron to make steel and iron is expensive as hell now. CLF has iron mines so they just use their own iron.

Idk about MLM"

2021-06-24 15:27:54,wallstreetbets,"honestly? while the attitudes of most here look down, do some research and find some decent companies that pay dividends.

I like MSFT and ARCC. microsoft is a good go to, but ares capital corp has higher dividend yield. Downside was during pandemic the stock value took a hit like 3-5 bucks down a share on a 19 dollar share. BUT, the dividend didnt change, so yield actually increased. so i still made money off of it.

So look for a company that has dividends, that isnt going anywhere any time soon. and hop in"

2021-06-24 14:38:45,wallstreetbets,"What do you think about Jim Cramer continuing to talk about Clov & Russell? I know CLOV‚Äôs filing as an ‚Äúemerging company‚Äù may allow them to join Russell, so maybe Cramer knows something.

Orrr, the conspiracy theory, Cramer got everyone‚Äôs hopes up, so if CLOV doesn‚Äôt make Russell, the stock price will drops.

Thanks to you and u/actually-yo-momma for the insightful discussion!"
2021-06-24 14:48:57,wallstreetbets,I think Cramer is a paid actor so I don‚Äôt take anything he says (even if it‚Äôs positive for clov) seriously.
2021-06-24 15:08:23,wallstreetbets,"He‚Äôs definitely paid! What would be his incentive here? He is giving his tons of followers an actually great play, CLOV, so if they pile in, that would help us.

Maybe he owns CLOV too?"

I'll show myself out."
2021-06-24 12:59:51,wallstreetbets,Agreed! I got in a bit later. Started buying in the $16 range and have kept adding on the dips. It's a volatile stock so great for short plays but the long term value is there. I have a DD stickied in my profile for any who are curious about TIGR. My conservative PT is $40+ in 6-12 months.

2021-06-24 13:39:11,wallstreetbets,"Entered above $30 after I discovered it. Kept averaging down adding in larger and larger quantities for maybe 3-4 months, never lost my faith even when it touched $13. My current avg. price is now below $18. 

For me this is not a short term play. My EOY PT is $70. You will see $40 before end of summer.

TIGR is following FUTU with 1-2 years lag. It's valuation will do the same. 

One of the most overlooked stocks."

thats not a lot... I best it costs more than 800 million to build a coal mine...

2021-06-24 12:30:44,wallstreetbets,A dying industry. Green energy is growing solar panels have been continuously increasing consumption of silver 20% growth annually. And every electric car use 2 ounces. Not to mention all the copper that's going to be needed.
2021-06-24 14:48:25,wallstreetbets,Peak coal consumption was in 2013. And then there's this.https://www.npr.org/2021/05/11/995849954/renewable-energy-capacity-jumped-45-worldwide-in-2020-iea-sees-new-normal. If you're going to invest in mining silver and copper will be hot. bc the green agenda will burning though both and add some physical silver just to add a bit to the consumption numbers which was 8% in a pandemic.
2021-06-24 12:47:47,wallstreetbets,"Completely incorrect and that mindset is exactly the reason BTU is such a bargain, coal has several years in front of it and is a necessity for steel production, the fact that the coal price is surging shows that it is far from a dead industry, apart from the industrial need there are over 250 coal power stns in USA alone and 1000s more worldwide"
2021-06-24 12:36:39,wallstreetbets,"Silver is already trading at a high, Coal is still a vital ingredient for industry and a must have for steel production which has been over looked exactly because many have the same mindset that you have - coal will eventually be retired but not for several years yet"
2021-06-24 15:00:21,wallstreetbets,"Actually I like the RNG producers but not until Biden figures out whether or not he‚Äôs going to give the refiners a reprieve on the Renewable Fuel Standard.  Most of those guys are not yet public but some IPOs are coming this fall.  

I don‚Äôt disagree on metals and mining but I am afraid that could be a bumpy road.  Lots of speculation on EV supply chain.  So long as the government is mandating renewables in transportation, RNG production is a sure bet and in time, RINs will be applied to bio-gas so that power generators can get credit.  Power companies are already trading unregulated RNG futures.  Coal will mean revert hard as the price rises and more plants contract gas.  God bless anyone that dabbles into coal without thoroughly understanding that dynamic or working the trade desk for a power company."
2021-06-24 12:50:31,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre right.  I don‚Äôt work in the power industry.

Look at the generation capacity of coal vs. gas since 2011.  Or follow your thesis and go long bunker fuel oil too!

If coal wasn‚Äôt economical at 30% lower prices and plants switched to gas, it sure as fuck isn‚Äôt economical now with hundreds of coal plants closed domestically since we last saw those prices.  Coke production for steel is a rounding error in terms of coal use for power - plus they are two different types of coal.  Oh and that‚Äôs without even mentioning how much natural gas production has increased over the same time span.

Thanks for bringing this to my attention.  I‚Äôm literally going to buy puts based on this retarded DD."
2021-06-24 12:46:48,wallstreetbets,No it's not even close it's high was just over $50 a ounce in 1979. Try to buy a car at half the 1979 price. We wouldn't be having this conversation without silver. And the biggest consumer of coal is China and they don't buy it from American companies and they're reducing consumption. And steel will be decreasing in use bc automobiles will have to get lighter. Aluminum and composites will replace steel partly bc eco concerns and partly bc declining iron ore reserves.
2021-06-24 15:10:07,wallstreetbets,Silver symbols HL AG copper its scco and vale. The juniors I'd avoid or use the etf silj and explorers are a joke most are payroll generators. Coal has only gotten a bump bc China cut off the Australian coal. It's likely one of the reasons they went after crypto miners.
2021-06-24 13:03:27,wallstreetbets,I'm writing puts so I'll happily take that money
2021-06-24 12:59:39,wallstreetbets,"Dear me, check your facts, that is total nonsense - you are aware that there is more going on in the world than EV cars

Steel is used in construction, industry, ship building, home appliances etc etc - steel is one of the few materials that can be recycled over and over again without loss of property

Peabody sells to over 25 countries including China, and on the contrary China's consumption is so high that imported coal prices are at a 5 year high"
2021-06-24 13:09:59,wallstreetbets,Cheers!   Remind me October 15
2021-06-24 13:10:04,wallstreetbets,I'm from Saint Louis my wife's former boss was married to a Peabody as in the family that started Peabody coal. and I've spent my life in coal country and ran a scrap recycling company for twenty years. And every year cars and trucks have less steel in them and more composites and aluminum. The Ford trucks the beds are aluminum. But I have no idea what I'm talking about.

if you don't like the idea, don't invest - the stock is currently $8.40 i think it will be going up from here"
2021-06-24 13:25:35,wallstreetbets,On average a car has 460 pounds of aluminum in it and by 2026 it will 500 pounds. And on average 300 pounds of plastic. And between 18 and 49 pounds of copper hybrids twice as much and electrics it 4x. And about 2100 pounds of steel. And coals peak consumption was in 2013.

Hey /u/Siphen_, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit."
2021-06-24 12:23:00,wallstreetbets,Will never get back my 5 minutes of reading this.
2021-06-24 12:53:46,wallstreetbets,How do posts like this make it to the hot list.
2021-06-24 14:01:25,wallstreetbets,Thank-you Captain Obvious for adding nothing of value to this sub‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
2021-06-24 14:12:06,wallstreetbets,"If you ever were in doubt about the level of retardation on WSB, this post will reaffirm it."
2021-06-24 12:23:08,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm a keep it honest with you, no one gives a fuck about citadel. They just happened to take an L being on the other end of a gme trade. We are not at war with them or other hedge funds. We are just here to make money."
2021-06-24 13:00:09,wallstreetbets,"The part about making cash on other stocks isn't wrong.  Look at how many no name stocks shoot up 20-80% over a day or two, then go right back to where they were a couple days later.  I liken it to roaming blackouts, but in this case it's roaming stock pump n dumps."
2021-06-24 13:40:09,wallstreetbets,What a ü§°. First my employer citadel plays both sides. As in it doesn‚Äôt matter which way the stocks goes we pay enough $$& to get there first before you and all other ü§° on there to take the position.
2021-06-24 13:08:58,wallstreetbets,How are posts like this not happening frequently?
2021-06-24 14:12:00,wallstreetbets,"I've read your post history, it's rather inconsequential. Here I thought I would have seen how to do it right, silly me."
2021-06-24 14:13:50,wallstreetbets,"I find the morons on this sub tend to get startled by truthful information. Your correct, your post completely reaffirms the level of retardation on WSB."
2021-06-24 13:55:59,wallstreetbets,"Actually, Citadel made huge profits this YTD overall.

Market makers make tens of billions from the surge of retail trading.

And Citadel (hedge fund) took both sides of trade for GME. It made money there too.

A lot of my peers working at trading funds have traded both sides with many having biased on longs for some time. So I have no idea what OP is smoking.

All the while we make billions for the 'rich' like the CEOs of these meme stocks.

&#x200B;

Also, GME at this point is essentially a pyramid scheme. All the publicly available data disproves whatever 'theory' is out there. But again ""all public data is wrong!"" is a thing. After all, if you reject everything and only accept your fanfiction, then of course your beliefs must work out! Just make your friends/family members buy in and price will go up! I feel bad for the families who will lose fortunes over this stupid stock long term.

And don't forget, it's constantly ""by X date this will happen"" but a day before the X date, suddenly everyone says ""but don't expect anything"" and then update the date again to the near future. Seriously something.

I bet institutions are laughing with bank having shorted GME at $320+.

These cultists talking about 'margin fees!' don't understand GME margin fees are 0.6% A YEAR. Institutions like Citadel even if they shorted the entire company (cause market cap is so small) can stay solvent forever (quite literally). But shhh, that's ""fake news"" according to these fanfiction cultists."
2021-06-24 14:11:16,wallstreetbets,"I find this to be an interesting comment. Several times now a few entities have tried to raise awareness of this stock to this SUB, often receiving short sighted comments just like this one. if this SUB is here to share investment opportunities, and (I quote) to ‚Äúmake money‚Äù, then why didn‚Äôt you take note, pay attention, research, and buy into SRNE a month or two ago when efforts were made to raise awareness here, and the SP was much lower? ($6.93 on 5/26, & $6.14 on 5/13). A measly $20k investment wold have yielded $$12.5k in short order, or 63% return. Seems to me elements in this group are more interested in crushing opportunities instead of becoming aware of them (ignorance), and in the process doing a disservice to the group in general."
2021-06-24 12:29:08,wallstreetbets,When did that change. So much for toppling the dominoes. Guess eventually we all become what we hate.
2021-06-24 12:30:08,wallstreetbets,"Weird when I search reddit, there seems to be lots of fucks given about citadel, you must be in the minority."
2021-06-24 14:22:29,wallstreetbets,"Your employer is a piece of garbage who leads attacks on companies that provide life saving medicine to people. Honestly people like you are trash of the highest order. No respect for life, just slaves to the almighty dollar. Good luck getting the stains off your soul when you die. Loser."
2021-06-24 14:13:42,wallstreetbets,"This is a casino, not a community college sir‚Ä¶.."
2021-06-24 16:20:36,wallstreetbets,"Citadel essentially provides plumbing for Wall Street, so the more stuff going through the plumbing, the better. Doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs Porta Potty sludge or melted gold.

It‚Äôs all the same to them.

You want to lower their revenue? Stuff money under the couch or in a passive index fund and don‚Äôt actively trade stocks or options."
2021-06-24 14:07:31,wallstreetbets,Completely agree that GME is a pyramid scheme. I find it disgusting that all I see are calls to buy and hold. If anyone actually gave a shit about retail investors they would start leading attacks on the supply train. Full disclosure I own no shares in any meme stocks. This posts was done to raise awareness to how HF's are using manipulation of other stocks to keep spare liquidity in the face of meme squeezes.
2021-06-24 14:12:29,wallstreetbets,"This EXACTY.  Yes, this has now moved into Pyramid scheme territory."
2021-06-24 14:18:23,wallstreetbets,"dude, there is 100 new plays being suggested everyday. this is a sub of 10m members. I'm sure someone jumped on your play and made a handsome return."
2021-06-24 15:10:00,wallstreetbets,That's never what this sub was about
2021-06-24 14:25:48,wallstreetbets,HAHA! Fair point!
2021-06-24 16:23:03,wallstreetbets,"Wall Street in general hates index funds.

But it's aight. Index funds are for boomers anyway.

Keep actively trading while believing you are making Citadel suffer by giving Citadel more cash.

Anyways, this is WSB so the obligatory SPY 400P EOY."
2021-06-24 16:33:52,wallstreetbets,That is why I have a Fidelity account. Trades placed with fidelity never touch them.
2021-06-24 17:16:42,wallstreetbets,very good comments; and while SRNE isn't a meme they might run it (perhaps starting tol); and the option-writing crowd might regret not simply being long.
2021-06-24 14:55:02,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm sure they did, so you agree, you don‚Äôt speak for the majority of investors here then.. The point, and I apologize for not being clearer, is when multiple negative and disparaging comments are made on posts that are meant to benefit a group it weakens and negatively impacts the OP‚Äôs intent. It‚Äôs perplexing to me why there continues to be so many verbal attacks towards honest efforts to raise awareness on solid companies.... Peace and happy hunting."
2021-06-24 15:14:57,wallstreetbets,Very true but this sub was never just about gme and AMC but some how that changed too. Hey the sub adapts as it evolves its OK.

2021-06-24 14:53:45,wallstreetbets,Over 31% now!
2021-06-24 15:31:32,wallstreetbets,"Mostly accurate but couple caveats

1) ITM options as of today will be delta hedged already. EX: 11c calls will have some shares hedged already since it‚Äôs in the money. If we get over 15 then yes MM will have to buy more shares. So don‚Äôt expect 7M shares worth to be bought

2) CLOV went to $28 last time and shorts did not cover at all. They can wait it out by just paying interest and are not ‚Äúforced‚Äù to cover. All shorts have different capital portfolios so it‚Äôs impossible to tell when they ‚Äúhave‚Äù to cover"

**TLDR: Key offshore basins are ramping up, and the supply/demand picture is getting very strong.**

Guyana-Suriname: 

* Guyana-Suriname Basin, which is estimated to hold crude oil resources of up to 33 billion barrels, is in the midst of a massive drilling boom [https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Guyanas-Oil-Boom-Keeps-Getting-Hotter.html](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Guyanas-Oil-Boom-Keeps-Getting-Hotter.html)

Oil Supply / Demand

* Supply: Growing calls for $100 / barrel oil from GS, BAML, and Continental Resources Chairman Harold Hamm [https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/Fracking-Pioneer-Hamm-100-Oil-Sure-Is-Possible.html](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/Fracking-Pioneer-Hamm-100-Oil-Sure-Is-Possible.html)

**If you believe these trends will continue, $RIG will be the ultimate winner and the stock will outperform nearly every other energy company.** I purchased $RIG OTM August call options and once other positions in my portfolio hit long-term capital gains, I'm buying even more $RIG stock.

Predictions of our dependence on oil coming to an end soon are massively out of whack.  That phone or PC you are reading this on?  Built with oil products.  Pretty much every container used to hold food you buy at the store?  Made with oil products.  The electrical wiring powering the building or shelter you live/work/sleep in?  Insulated by oil products.

Oil is not going away, its just going to get more expensive.  A LOT more expensive.  That is the only stick with enough power that will force humans away from oil consumption.  Not oil spills, not dying due to climate change, pollution, no sir--- stinging the pocketbook/wallet is whats going to do it.  And its going to be very painful, not pleasant.  Its going WAY up before its coming down."

2021-06-24 12:17:51,wallstreetbets,Hope you have a plan to pay back the borrowed cash.
2021-06-24 12:35:54,wallstreetbets,"Should have sold a csp at the 120 strike , at least you'd have a chance of making a few dollars... This is going tits up for sure,  at least in the short to medium term.  The only upside I see on your play is at least you didn't buy calls like a retard."

2021-06-24 17:33:14,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs going to be Green days mostly for next couple of weeks for TSLA
2021-06-24 12:34:14,wallstreetbets,Lol he's only got 16 shares
2021-06-24 15:14:08,wallstreetbets,"He didnt buy options, he bought Stocks, They cant go to Zero."
2021-06-24 12:08:51,wallstreetbets,the r/wallstreetbets creed
2021-06-24 15:05:36,wallstreetbets,look at it now. it isnt. and dont say yesterday it did the same thing because yesterday the growth just decreased but kept going up. today it peaked and started down. OP bought at 694 and the price has been going down since noon. even if the stock rallies and breaks 700 its still a boneheaded move to buy at a peak
2021-06-24 12:36:16,wallstreetbets,"oh you were referring to the option cuz he can't, my bad

its still not his money and still 12k so stupid"
2021-06-24 17:27:30,wallstreetbets,"Not true little buddy. A stock can fall to zero, however, it's unlikely Tesla will.."
2021-06-24 15:09:10,wallstreetbets,"it always peak in morning and slows down by end of day.every single stock. also, its almost end of quarter, sales reports coming up in a week or so, earnings coming up in less than month, its more speculative time for TSLA."
2021-06-24 15:58:17,wallstreetbets,a good sign is when the growth rate slows down. the growth rate didnt slow down the price straight up went into decline. youre right about morning peaks but i dont think the price will last or continue to go up meaning OP fucked himself unless earnings are record breakers
2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm drunk at 10:30 am and decided to do some DD on Ford $F I googled Ford and found a lot of great things and stuff. Even some YouTube videos of people who can‚Äôt drive their mustangs and slam into crowds. Of course there is a bunch of lifted trucks and what not. 

So basically to not keep this short to reach the minimum DD requirement for this group there‚Äôs one where a guy drifts his brand new mustang into a light pole and scares a crowd. It‚Äôs great. I‚Äôm drinking and laughed way too hard at these videos. 

Anyway my point is that Ford drivers are probably the worst ‚Äústreet racing‚Äù group I know of and if there wasn‚Äôt Ford who else would slam cars into walls as consistently as mustang drivers. I found a whole basically sub-culture of YouTube clips specifically focused on shitty mustang drivers.

Now with their electric line and money they are sinking into their EV line imagine how quickly these mustang guys can slam into people and other objects. If we invest in Ford there will be many electric mustang videos getting wrecked and I‚Äôm looking forward to it. So I drunkenly sank monies into $F. Now I‚Äôm going to go piss off my neighbors and mow my yard drinking coors light.

Oh also they have a company called spin that‚Äôs making an electric scooter or something and I‚Äôm looking forward to buying one and putting a beer holder on it. My wife‚Äôs boyfriend will get a ton of entertainment out of it while I work. End of sort of DD idk. Whatever. I googled, it counts. I‚Äôm assuming I‚Äôll have to edit spelling at some point.

Edit: TBD"

2021-06-24 11:48:57,wallstreetbets,So buy calls on a company that makes firefighting equipment because these shitty drivers in EV Mustangs are sure to start some battery fires.  Anyone remember the exploding Ford Pinto?  Same here but they‚Äôll sell way more mustangs.

At some point over the next 3 weeks I think the whales that hold these calls will try to force a gamma squeeze. Only looking at the calls with significant open interest you get the below:

Calls for July 16, 2021

|Strike Price|Open Interest|
:--|:--|
|$12.50|30,943|
|$15.00|51,184|
|$20.00|44,363|
|$22.50|31,522|
|$25.00|19,118|
|$30.00|18,384|
|$45.00|20,188|


As for this week. There's a good amount of open interest at $13 and $13.50. It will probably be a fight to close above these strikes this Friday."

2021-06-24 15:26:54,wallstreetbets,"Read the Zerohedge article and watched the options video.  If this closes above $15 before next Wednesday, a move to $30+ is pretty much a lock.

2021-06-24 11:28:40,wallstreetbets,And I bought more stocks at 12.76.
2021-06-24 16:09:58,wallstreetbets,after hours is getting close
2021-06-24 13:53:00,wallstreetbets,This. Shares is definitely the way here.
2021-06-24 11:55:12,wallstreetbets,"Wish is defiantly a good stock. And we are in a dip today, so I would say now is a good entry point!"
2021-06-24 11:49:20,wallstreetbets,If it doesn't recover today. I think they'll try to beat it down below 12.50 to get those calls to expire worthless tomorrow. Hard say its swinging a good amount. Safe route would be to dollar cost average in.
2021-06-24 16:12:11,wallstreetbets,And then get them called away when stocks hit $20 on its way to $40. Covered calls is a slow way to make money on what is a HYPE TO THE TITS STOCK
2021-06-24 11:45:09,wallstreetbets,"I thought so at first, but I looked at other popular memestocks & non-memestocks. I couldn't find one with quite the same setup/level of open interest with the exception of AMC. But even AMC doesn't have this clean looking of a possible ramp. 


Retail FOMO plays are for sure part of this, but I think there's more to it."
2021-06-24 16:39:38,wallstreetbets,"That's actually a pretty good strategy, might start looking into that."
2021-06-24 19:19:00,wallstreetbets,"Could you explain a bit what that means? I'm new to this, what are OTM weeklies and what does it mean to sell them ""against"" your 07/16?"
2021-06-24 13:21:25,wallstreetbets,"Open interest is just the number of active contracts that haven't been closed, exercised/assigned or expired. Correct on volume its just the number of trades."
2021-06-24 12:04:59,wallstreetbets,Smart move. They aren‚Äôt going to let the 13s or the 13.5s print.
2021-06-24 16:13:39,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre 100% right.
2021-06-24 12:15:02,wallstreetbets,Calls were cheap. It's probably just retail
2021-06-24 11:45:58,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs literally just fomo.
2021-06-24 14:15:24,wallstreetbets,"It's because we only used to have monthly options And they didn't add the weeklys until recently.  

When the squeeze to 15 hit someone sold a bunch of covered calls and collected those premiums in large amounts.. biggest bang for your buck was in those price points.."
2021-06-24 14:54:25,wallstreetbets,Going up!!!
2021-06-24 15:03:51,wallstreetbets,Cheap and last I checked they didn‚Äôt have a high gamma ratio either. So buying them doesn‚Äôt equate to much backup buying. Even ITM calls.
2021-06-24 15:03:43,wallstreetbets,Man. I figured they would keep us at or about 13. If not that around the 13.30 level we have been struggling with. I would love to see 14s ITM. ‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è

2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$LMT Admit One üéü to the üåô Starlink is one of the most anticipated IPO‚Äôs of this decade. 

Guess who their competitor is?

Lockheed Martin ticker: $LMT in collaboration with Omnispace will be a direct competitor to Starlink in the Space Internet gold rush.

Lockheed consistently beats EPS estimates almost every single quarter for the past few years. 

The current P/E Ratio is 15.23 ‚Ä¶.

This makes LMT EXTREMELY UNDERVALUED. 

Reasons why I think the price action sucks: 

1. The company is about 26 years old in its current iteration. This means the boomers who worked for them in the 90‚Äôs are collecting their pensions with stock options and immediately selling every day cause their eyes are glued to CNBC jerking off to Melissa Lee and feeding into the inflation FUD. 

2. They pay a good dividend. The higher the stock price the higher the payment from Lockheed to shareholders. 

3. The market seems to shove LMT into the ‚Äúindustrials‚Äù category. They should legit be labeled as a tech company with all that laser mounted on a navy ship or warplane, Apollo craft building, Starlink competing animal that it is. 


Pos: $LMT $390 calls exp July 9th / 69 shares @ $355 average cost"

You've all seen the DD. Even with just the Amazon deal, it seems like it's almost a no-brainer that this stock should be solid at least long term. 

So, in all seriousness, what makes this stock bad? I understand that it doesn't want to go up lately, so I might be answering my own question right there, but it should eventually go up."

2021-06-24 11:23:33,wallstreetbets,"Look, trying to gauge the market sentiment of a stock on this forum is like asking a Jack Russel terrier which pork bone they prefer on a rack of ribs.

Whichever is closest to their face is your answer. 

The CLNE play started months ago, and it didn't have anything to do with any sort of squeeze. It became clear over time that there was a unique opportunity with the June 18 options, and that became a catalyst that ended up getting a lot of traction here. The push for $13 by June 18 failed because the terrier had a couple other bones closer to their snout, and when it did, a lot of people who expected it to moon jumped out of the trade.

Right now, it's in post meme recovery, and trying to find its footing. Don't worry about WSB being on board or not. It's a solid company with amazing outlook going forward. It will likely find equilibrium in the coming month, and I fully expect it to see $15 by the end of the year at the latest. 

Long term, $30 is reasonable, and with good execution, in five years this could be a hundred dollar stock. Hang in there - it's probably better if the ape army sits this one out from here on. That will allow the company to grow organically.

2021-06-24 11:38:24,wallstreetbets,This is the answer we‚Äôre looking for.
2021-06-24 11:33:20,wallstreetbets,"That's a pretty apt metaphor. I realize that WSB doesn't like stocks that aren't 10%+ that day, so I was probably barking up the wrong tree with this post but I was honestly curious. It's just funny to see companies like SNDL, who I feel is a MUCH worse company, get treated nicer around here than CLNE. But I'm long with ya, don't plan on selling until $30+ in several years and I'm okay with that. A little bit of short term confirmation in the form of a upward movement wouldn't be frowned upon though!"
2021-06-24 12:07:17,wallstreetbets,"I get it, it's tough watching this stay flat or slowly bleed while other tickers are going batshit. Lots of missed opportunities there. I mean, this **is** a casino after-all."

2021-06-24 12:39:27,wallstreetbets,"They basically break even every quarter because they've been reinvesting profits in building out infrastructure. Amazon played this strategy too - barely miss profitability for as long as you can to avoid paying out the nose in taxes. It's nota bug, it's a feature, yada yada.

The company is better positioned in the space than anyone else, by a long shot, and they have the infrastructure in place to produce and store more than double what they're doing now, with more coming online.

Major partnerships with shipping and oil companies, not to mention Amazon holding warrants to buy $500 of stock at $13.49...it's only a matter of time before the profits start flowing in, and when they do it's going to be a flood, not a trickle.

Edit: Lol $500 million from Amazon, not $500..."
2021-06-24 11:20:49,wallstreetbets,You bring up an interesting point...
2021-06-24 11:09:54,wallstreetbets,Good luck I‚Äôm stretched thin but I bought 1 share today at 13.30 to help with the bag holders. Maybe buy one share of clne to help my bag holding hands? Lol
2021-06-24 11:21:52,wallstreetbets,"The P&D is already over though, and it lasted a total of...... 1 fuckin day. Now that that is over with, it can actually have reality push the price up rather than hype.

2021-06-24 11:10:55,wallstreetbets,Unless you can drive off the energy you bike with the peloton (which is dumb just bike to your location) two completely different markets but energy is much needed today
2021-06-24 11:40:44,wallstreetbets,"I hear ya, but we're less than a week from the failed push for $13. It's still shaking out people who were never going to be in it long term anyway. Give it a little time to stabilize and we'll be good."
2021-06-24 11:55:50,wallstreetbets,"You certainly aren't wrong, but neither do PLUG, RUN, or several other green energy tickers that are valued 3-5x what CLNE is valued at. And those companies have solid competition! I don't see anyone else competing with CLNE in the RNG space."

2021-06-24 12:04:16,wallstreetbets,"I do not know much about the stock to be fair. Intuitions are clearly wanting to see more from CLNE(maybe a lower buy in), retail investors have not been able to budge the price, and just because other stocks are overvalued does not mean CLNE should be too. Wait it out or move on is all that can be done."
2021-06-24 11:23:17,wallstreetbets,"Over the past month, CLNE has gone up something like 35% when PTON is up 20% so even this is wrong."

2021-06-24 11:25:45,wallstreetbets,CLNE had a single pop last month due to Reddit and has since remained flat. Peloton has organic growth. Choose artificial or choose organic. I‚Äôll choose organic ;) Do better analysis‚Ä¶your comment is wildly flawed.
2021-06-24 11:22:40,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm aware. I own two. People won‚Äôt mind and will pay a fee. They‚Äôre up 13% this week even with that story. Non issue.
2021-06-24 11:39:26,wallstreetbets,"No, I definitely agree that I would choose organic growth over artificial but I don't see how my comment is wildly flawed in any way. You literally said, ""if the goal is to make money PTON is better"". But within the timeframe that I gave, CLNE would have made you more money even if it was from an artificial bump from WSB. If the goal is to make money, and nothing else, then you would prefer to go with whatever made the most money. 

Now, if you decide to look at a different timeframe, then I can see how my comment is wildly flawed :)"
2021-06-24 11:25:50,wallstreetbets,"You may not mind.  They lost my business.  Others as well I‚Äôm sure.

Customer trust is important. Peloton just dragged their through the dirt."
2021-06-24 11:43:57,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. Picking a comparable time frame between two variables for comparison is fundamental to delivering an accurate analysis. You chose a timeframe where CLNE had redditor bumping it‚Ä¶.aka flawed. 

Choose another time frame and your conclusion is different. ALL TIME clne loses money, ALL TIME peloton is 5x. Enjoy your day."
2021-06-24 11:26:37,wallstreetbets,Nah a fix is coming. It‚Äôs a non issue. Bummer you left the peloton family.
2021-06-24 11:48:18,wallstreetbets,"Okay now I feel like I'm arguing with a straight up PTON shill with that type of comment. ""All time CLNE loses money and PTON is 5x?"" Honestly wtf, so you're saying all the stock does it go up when uh..... you know charts exist, right? As if PTON didn't HALF from Dec 2020 to May 2021? Cmon man. Yes PTON is having a good run and will probably continue to, but you get on me for a ""flawed comment"" and then drop some absolute garbage comment like that."

2021-06-24 11:39:35,wallstreetbets,They emailed everyone and have a phone number you can call if you have issues getting the fee waived. And customers are happy. Which explains why they were up 8% 2 days ago and another 5% today.

2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Russell Reconstitution 2021 There has been some chatter about this once a year event on the sub but I wanted to further shed some light on it and what you can expect. 

Other indexes tend to balance on a quarterly basis to better align with the markets direction, bringing in new securities and relinquishing those that have not performed as expected. 

The Russell family of indexes does this on the last Friday of June every year, and is traditionally one of the highest volume days across the entire market. 

Last year, there were roughly 1.6 billion shares exchanged on that day for the securities being added to the index, close to $56,000,000,000 in value. 

The trade this year is to be executed at market close on Friday June 25th, bringing the new securities into the index and removing those who did not make the cut.

[2021 Russell Index Inclusions](https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/ru3000_additions_20210618.pdf)

Among the additions are a few popular tickers I‚Äôve seen around WSB

All inclusions and exclusions are now final 



[announcement ](https://research.ftserussell.com/products/index-notices/home/getnotice/?id=2599440)


I think this unique period of time represents an opportunity to play on some of those being added with relatively low IV. Buying at this scale and the addition could put some of these on the radar and provide some momentum moving forward into the next few weeks.

Feel free to weigh in, correct where needed, etc. 

Pick your poison, but I‚Äôve heard stocks only go up.

Good luck!"

$GEVO - Hydrocarbons with zero emissions, blah, blah, not like you guys actually give a fuck about the company; Clean energy, enough said. 

Anyways, take a look at the moving averages for the (10) mark, (20), (30), (50), (100), and (200) they‚Äôre EXTREMELY STRONG. Couple that with a neutral RSI, and solid momentum. 

Our first resistance to break is around $8.80, once we break that we go to $10.40, seems easy enough, then breaking past that, $14-$18. 

$12 is the short-term PT, 2-4 weeks likely. GEVO is getting added to the Russell 3000 on June 28th. 

Taking a look at the chart, we‚Äôre seeing a coiling pattern start to firm up. It looks like an upside breakout is bound to happen very soon. 

Can‚Äôt fucking share Imgur links anymore, so fuck it, I‚Äôll explain the chart. Peep the 1D chart, look for the $15 mark; from there, you can see how it starts coiling downward until it hits like $4.50, then slowly starts pushing up again and then we start slightly coiling now. This is a very bullish sign for an upward breakout. 

See you nerds there, or maybe I won‚Äôt, regardless, just sharing my findings and information and DO NOT FORGET. I haven‚Äôt missed yet. 

Positions: 10c 7/16"

It has strong RSI support and a 3 year cup and handle that's rounding. Short term target is 11.50 and depending on how much attention this gets, it could run to the 20's in the next few months. 

Some things of note: institutions have been accumulating more than selling and their average price is in the high 8's. Cathy Wood also has a substantial position at a higher price.

Of course, do your own DD but this looks like a good opportunity. Just bought some Jan '22 calls this morning.

2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$TAL & $EDU - BIG Opportunity for AST Stocks I've been following this industry closely the past few months and yesterday I came across [this article by Titan Invest](https://www.titanvest.com/research/2021/06/23/edu-holding-through-the-upcoming-catalyst-EDU) explaining their rationale behind holding $EDU through the recent massive drop from \~$20 to \~$8 today (and $TAL from \~$90 to \~$25 today). It inspired me to share my hypothesis with you all, which their article articulates well...

**The \~TLDR\~ of my hypothesis is that the sell off in After School Tutoring (AST) stocks like $EDU and $TAL is overblown and there is solid upside for a bounce back once China's new AST regulations are announced in the coming weeks. China is considering new regulations on the After School Tutoring industry in an attempt to stimulate population growth.** 

**Here's a summary of China's thought process:**

* Education is so ingrained in Chinese culture that everyone pays a lot of money to best prepare their kids for the college entrance exam, but it's expensive as hell.
* China's birth rate dropped for 4 consecutive years from 2016-2020 and they fear the slow down in will lead to an aging population that hurts their economy.
* To encourage more births, China has increased the cap on the number of children each family can have from 2 to 3, BUT they worry families may still not have more children because it will be expensive to pay for tuition and all of the AST expenses which are a cultural norm.
* So the plan to combat this concern is to regulate the AST industry by limiting when these companies can provide services, how they charge, etc. --> which may effectively kill off smaller competitors and lead to increased consolidation in the industry.
* There have been many rumors from unknown sources circulating with details of the regulations, however severe official sources have come out refuting their accuracy. Regardless, its caused the recent massive drop in stock prices for companies like $EDU and $TAL.

**So here's the opportunity I see for AST stocks.**

* Buy the leading AST stocks at current support lines before the regulations are announced making a bet that the sell-off has been overblown.
* Ride the bounce up to fair valuations and then either flip or hold.

Below are the 6mo charts to show recent price moves compared to where they were at just back in February.

Edit 2: relevant, if anyone would like an example of the level of abuse that can occur in these systems, go look at Brittney Spear's testimony about her program. Someone with a large fan base and platform who genuinely cared for her wellbeing, and full government oversight in a legal program, and they broke that poor girl. Or go look at what happens with the police. Now go look at the ""rumors"" about any church or religious group and tell me you dont think it's worth a discussion

Milk contains opioid receptor agonists, that's why 'warm milk' used to be used to help people sleep.  Mild, but so is the caffeine in most caffeinated beverages.

Drinking tea or coffee is against the rules, but it isn‚Äôt because of the ‚Äúdrug‚Äù that is caffeine. It has something to do with dark, dirty, or fermented liquids, but the point was to stay away from anything that put you in an altered or intoxicated state of mind. We can all agree that caffeine doesn‚Äôt do that to most people and as such, all the Mormons I know dink more sodas and energy drinks than they do water. Hell, in Utah there are drive through soda shops on every street corner. They look like a coffeeshop  but sell nothing but cookies, Mountain Dew, and Red Bull slushees lol. So if ops point is he is gonna do the drug caffeine‚Ä¶ so what? He is allowed. He just should not have coffee or tea. And honestly, if his point is drink coffee and to defy his faith he shouldn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs disrespectful to himself and his family, and there really isn‚Äôt any reason to other than to look cool on Reddit where no one knows who you are or really cares."

2021-06-24 17:19:13,wallstreetbets,Mormons are weird.
2021-06-24 17:20:28,wallstreetbets,"Here's why Mormons can't drink coffee, using only Mormon sources.

Joseph was money-digging for silver, and met Emma Hale while boarding at her parents. Her parents didn't approve because he was a money-digger, which was folk magic claiming you could find treasure by diving rods and such. He then went on to marry her. 
https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/new-era/2004/10/when-emma-met-joseph?lang=eng  
https://www.deseret.com/platform/amp/2016/2/2/20581554/the-courtship-and-marriage-of-joseph-smith-and-emma-hale

He then found the Golden Plates, which was 'translated' using seer stones, a common part of folk magic back in the day, specifically a couple of clear stones set in a frame like eyeglasses, and another stone that he would put into a hat along with his face to 'translate'. Additionally, the Book of Mormon refers to him as a seer in 2 Nephi 3:6, 7. This 'translation' is what formed the Book of Mormon, and founded Mormonism.   https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2015/10/joseph-the-seer?lang=eng

Three years later, people were calling for bans on alcohol, coffee as a replacement, and no meat. People would get together with Joseph at a school and they'd spit tobacco on the floor, which pissed off Emma because she had to clean it.  So then he then prayed and God told him no more tobacco, alcohol and coffee too. Eat less meat too apparently. Fun side note, they still used wine for sacraments almost a hundred years later. https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/topics/word-of-wisdom-dc-89?lang=eng

And that's why Mormons can't drink coffee. Totally because God said not too, and not because Joseph's wife complained to him and he used his 'church' as a ploy to get them to knock it off."

Before I get a bunch of hate, just go look into why the Mormon church is pure evil. You‚Äôre not allowed to leave or you risk alienation from everyone you‚Äôve ever known.

All while acting like I'm getting increasingly uncomfortable with my inability to offer any hospitality.

I maintain my method is better than the other two I have witnessed. One of my friends and I were cleaning a deer, and they knocked on his front door. For context, neither of us had a shirt on, and we were absolutely covered in blood, and holding butchers knives. He looked over his shoulder when he opened the door, and yells ""Guys, let the goat go! I just found us a couple of virgins!"" They left quickly.

The other method I saw was my then GF, going straight into her D&D character who was a Priest of Gigneski. She went on a rant about half the gods in the Pantheon, and they went away thoroughly confused.

Edit: GF was hilarious to watch as, I watched her fall into character as she saw who was at the door, and she is super goth, so they *really* did not know what to do with this Morticia Addams lookalike ranting about multiple Gods they have never heard of."

**Having multiple wives _is_ taught to be a sin in the church. You would be instantly excommunicated and shunned if your church caught you practicing polygamy.**


>	In 1904, LDS President Joseph F. Smith issued the ‚ÄúSecond Manifesto,‚Äù declaring that any church member continuing to practice polygamy would be excommunicated. Smith carried through on the threat by excommunicating two members of the church‚Äôs Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.

And LDS Prophet Gordon B Hinckley:

>‚ÄúThis church has nothing whatever to do with those practicing polygamy. They are not members of this church. ... If any of our members are found to be practicing plural marriage, they are excommunicated, the most serious penalty the church can impose. Not only are those so involved in direct violation of the civil law, they are in violation of the law of this church.""

i would argue that sugar is more addicting than caffeine. while there are coffee addicts, and some jokingly talk about it openly, it's way more mild than more well known substances (crack, tobacco, etc). 

I definitely think Sugar is one of the most evil things to ever hit the legal market in such high quantities.

2021-06-24 18:55:37,wallstreetbets,"Great question. This particular piece of dogma stems from a scripture in the Mormons text ‚Äúdoctrine & covenants‚Äù written in the 1800‚Äôs which states ‚Äúno hot drink‚Äù to my mind - written in America the 1800s it‚Äôs clearly a reference to bourbon and whiskey however -  perhaps bc modern Mormons don‚Äôt drink alcohol at all and thus don‚Äôt realize that whisky is a ‚Äúhot‚Äù drink - they have interpreted that line of scripture to mean coffee and tea. Of course the original meaning has long been lost as has much of the original intent of many similar passages. Searching for a scientific basis to justify this perceived rule against coffee and tea - many Mormons in the latter part of last century thought the intent behind the rule must be a caution against caffeine - a harmful substance found in many hot drinks. Mind you this is all the result of speculation from the congregation, nothing definitive has ever been offered by church leadership as far as I‚Äôm aware. So as these things tend to happen, the modern interpretation of a passage I‚Äôm still Convinced was originally about whiskey now has grow to include Pepsi and Coca Cola bc of their caffeine content.

2021-06-24 10:44:47,wallstreetbets,Great man! I was on the swim team in high school with a Morman dude he definitely had some good morals about him. But he definitely had some blind spots too because he was raised into it. It‚Äôs good you took time away from the church to see if it really is a fit for you
2021-06-24 11:31:19,wallstreetbets,I couldn‚Äôt find the part allowing herbal tea though.

2021-06-24 12:24:20,wallstreetbets,Then you‚Äôve basically already had plenty of caffeine. Wonder why the church doesn‚Äôt consider chocolate similar to the other substances.

If you go back and look at their history the headmaster‚Äôs have always conveniently had revelations about practices that were once considered sinful, no longer being so. My favorite is their stance on being black.

1. As much as we like to say so here, investing in stock isn‚Äôt really gambling.  It‚Äôs a portfolio.  And the Church suggests you diverse your portfolio and be smart with your money.  The Church also owns tons of land and other assets.

2. Nobody, and I mean nobody, in the higher up and executive areas of the Church are living in luxury.  This is coming from someone who knows many people who work for the church including at higher positions."

2021-06-24 12:30:37,wallstreetbets,"It's just an obedience thing. Early Mormons said ""no hot drinks"" and one prophet even said this meant no hot soup. Later it was clarified to be tea (but not herbal tea, that's ok) and coffee (even if the coffee is iced it's not ok). Growing up my Mormon family believed it to be the caffeine, there's actually a significant number of Mormons who continue to follow that rule."
2021-06-24 11:58:55,wallstreetbets,Good question. My reasoning is that it‚Äôs pretty addictive and the church tends to try to steer its members away from addictive substances. I‚Äôm not certain though
2021-06-24 16:12:50,wallstreetbets,"Former Mormon here. 25 years. You see this a lot,. especially specifically in Utah - if no coffee is the rule, than avoiding anything with caffeine must be even godlier, so let's do that. The rules are no coffee and no black tea, with no reason given other than that they are unhealthy and are to be avoided. As Mormons have rules against drugs, alcohol, Coffee, premarital sex, and a lot of other fun things, you'll find they have one last vice that isn't on the no no list - sugar. It's a dessert paradise. Highest consumption per Capita of ice cream in the usa. And yes, tons of soda."

- Taught that you and your spouse both have to be married in the temple and stay ‚Äútrue to the religion‚Äù for the rest of your lives to be together forever 
- Taught that tattoos, coffee, tea, double ear piercings, tank tops are not okay 
- Go on a ‚ÄúMormon trek‚Äù where they dress up like pioneers and go out and push handcarts for a week 
- Wear special underwear that they are told to *never* remove or adjust for clothing that shows them (exceptions include sex, shower, swimming, and extreme working out) 
- Don‚Äôt have ANY females in top leadership. The top females still have to report directly to 15 men. 
- Don‚Äôt have ANY local female ward leadership. Men are the only ones allowed to be bishops and leaders of wards.
- Men are the only ones allowed to oversee finances, even at local levels.
- One Sunday a month they do a ‚Äútestimony meeting‚Äù where people get up and rehearse how they KNOW the church is true. 
- Told to read scriptures, pray daily, go to church weekly, and go to the temple often or else they will ‚Äúfall away‚Äù (more like realize they are being brainwashed constantly) 
- HAVE TO PAY 10% OF ALL THEIR INCOME in order to be allowed in temples. Which btw, you‚Äôre told to be with your family forever you have to be sealed in the temple and be worthy of a recommend.

It's really weird and this belief of never touching alcohol influences the alcohol laws in the state such as no alcohol other than low alcohol content beer can be sold anywhere other than liquor stores. Another odd fact is that the reason they don't drink coffee and tea is because traditionally the church forbid drinking any hot beverages

Former mormon and current medical professional here. Mormonism is completely and unwaveringly a cult. Problem is when you say the word, any active mormon gets their feathers ruffled and won‚Äôt listen. Because who is dumb enough to admit they‚Äôre in a cult? Nobody calls their friends and says ‚ÄúHey man!! I joined a cult!! It‚Äôs so cool!!‚Äù Everyone thinks they‚Äôre smart enough to avoid cult behaviors. Just like everyone else who‚Äôs ever been in a cult. They didn‚Äôt know it. Until they left. If they were allowed to leave/escape. 

Good luck to any mormons still active and reading this. Please read up on the BITE model. Take Nephi‚Äôs challenge. Read it. Pray about it to know the truth of it. 

And then take the missionary approach. If you still don‚Äôt feel the BITE model is true... read it again. Pray again. Rinse and repeat until your mind is opened into the truth."

2021-06-24 12:14:25,wallstreetbets,"Personally, I think it's okay to participate in a system that propagates abuse (as a non abuser) because let's face it, its woven into almost everything from religion to law enforcement to politics. However. I believe if you choose to participate in one of these systems you need to be one of the biggest if not the biggest voice advocating for victims of your own system. 

As far as the LDS goes, i dont think that's something you're willing to, and i dont think they'd continue to allow you to practice with them if you chose to focus on exposing sexual abuse in the church (: 

So again, as a lawyer, more power to you, i hope you help get as close to justice as possible for as many victims as possible. 

But I think you're in a unique position to specifically call out the church, and help its victims, but like law enforcement, politicians, and other religious individuals, I genuinely dont believe you have the conviction to risk your status within your group. 

And I think that is sad, on the outside of the system we can yell and shout all we want about how shit needs to change but it has come from inside the system itself, and for religion I honestly think that's even less likely than political and law enforcement reform. 

Like the guy before you who made a very wide statement about bishops putting people and girls into uncomfortable situations and questioning them about personal and sexual issues, did you really deny that? Bishops do it, pastors do it, school therapists do it, law enforcement does it, its abusive and gross and just one example, but like if you care about the victims of sexual abuse why not turn that into a genuine conversation inside of just denying something that most certainly does happen? Not saying its exclusive to the LDS or that they're the biggest issue, but fucking come on, really? 
""Bishops absolutely do not uncomfortably question children about their sex lives."" Is that really the hill you want to die on?"

- Don‚Äôt have to be married in the temple, it‚Äôs highly encouraged though if you believe in the doctrine that marriage is eternal.

The piercing thing is weird, tattoos have a sound doctrine behind them of ‚Äútreat your body like a temple‚Äù. Tank tops are fine? I wear them when I‚Äôm out on the beach or doing whatever. 

- Trek is fun, you pretend to be a pioneer for a few days. I dunno what‚Äôs weird about that. 

- The Garments and how to wear them are between the individual and God, i dunno what‚Äôs so weird about them. People normalize hijabs and religious wear for other faiths, but no no ours is *too* weird. 

- I don‚Äôt see the issue with this. We follow the way things have been done for centuries as disciples of Christ. We don‚Äôt look down on women or say they‚Äôre incapable or anything. Every marriage and leadership position is considered equal partnership towards the churches goal. 

- Plenty of local leadership, just bc they aren‚Äôt a bishop doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt a leader. 

- It‚Äôs a calling, don‚Äôt see why you‚Äôre trying to make it seem like a bad thing. 

- typically it‚Äôs not rehearsed, you‚Äôd know if you went to one. 

- I mean yeah, when you‚Äôre not actively engaged in a religion or whatever you‚Äôre interested in, you have a tendency to fall off. Whatever isn‚Äôt practiced is lost.

Pretty soon he's buying himself a G650 and YOLOing GME with your money. 

If they get big enough, they make another bunch of rich assholes at the top and use them to try and fleece you harder, while you continue to ask to be fleeced. Hell, what really makes it a cult, is that you ENJOY it. You enjoy getting fucked over so much, that you try and recruit all your friends. You shove it down their throats, either on the sidewalk, at the grocery store or even through legislation. Even if the voters told you they wanted something else.

40 years later, you realize that you could have moved your wife's boyfriend out of your house and into his own with all the tithe you paid.

OH! Also while taking your money, they pretty much told you that you are an evil shitbag for taking any pleasure in life and enjoying your time on earth, so you feel like you're a failure.

>so their cash flow is nuts.

It is.

>The Mormon church builds multi-million dollar churches out of specifically sourced marble and lumber and gold and they do it with all cash.

There are generally two types of buildings: Temples, which get the highest quality treatment, and Chapels, which get the high durability choices.  Temples don't do Sunday services and are generally Adults and some teens on the side.  Chapels do Sunday services, and non-services every other night of the week (excluding Mondays, because family time).  And people of all ages and commitments come.  Temples don't need to worry about goldfish getting crunched into the carpet or kids throwing up from eating too many goldfish.  Hence the nice/durable split.

Chapels are still mostly multi-millions to build ($2MM is multi right?), which from a commercial real estate perspective is par.  The Temples are multi-multi million dollars, like $70 for Phila. But the number of temples is in the low-low hundreds and the number of chapels is in the thousands.

And don't forget maintenance. Keeping thousands of buildings warm and carpet cleaning barfed up goldfish isn't cheap. And mowing the lawn, and paying for internet.

>They have adherents all over the place with 2 years of supplies for their family +extra,

They've walked that back quite a bit. What good is a year of cracked wheat if you don't know how to use it? In the 21st century getting out of debt has been a bigger focus given to individual members.

>and sometimes they respond to natural disasters faster than the national guard.

They (no kidding) have trucks full of supplies stationed strategically around the US so they can roll right as a hurricane is coming ashore, or right after a tornado hits. 

In addition to food welfare distribution sites for families in need. If you are generally a responsible person and need some short term help your local congregational leaders will hook you up. If you are irresponsible they will hook you up for as long as it would take to teach you to be responsible (wether or not it works). These ""Bishop's Storehouses"" basically function a lot like super markets. 

They also will hook you up with therapists if what you really need is therapy (and you don't have to use the therapists they provide access to in most cases). And twelve step counseling groups focused on Church teachings (but if you need a less affiliated 12 step group please go where you need, it's your journey).

And these are all paid for by member donations.

The church still acts like bishops have and are selected using divine inspiration, but the truth is bishops sometimes assault and regularly ask way more detailed questions with minors than should ever happen. Members trust their bishops more than just about anyone on the face of the planet because they believe they were divinely called and have God's backing and the church wants it to remain that way. When a bishop hears of any wrongdoing that happens within the church they have the bishop call their team of lawyers. These are no practices that a healthy and good organization would make standard procedure and policy."

2021-06-24 13:19:04,wallstreetbets,"As a current LDS member(haven‚Äôt gone in 15 months due to coronavirus though), I agree with this.

I was born into Lutheranism, went to catholic school, dated a Muslim girl and learned a lot about their religion, studied religion in college; I‚Äôve been around the block a few times. 

To propose that God is omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient but then say he was only present at this one point in history in this single location is beyond hypocritical. It‚Äôs like saying I can teleport to anywhere in the world but I like staying in Jupiter, Florida‚Ä¶it would not be possible.

Also absolutism completely details religions across the board: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm right and if you don‚Äôt believe that then you are going to hell‚Äù‚Ä¶this is definitely not the way.

God being omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient; I assume he would realize people are different. I‚Äôm doing so, I believe he would create religions for people to follow based on their preferences. I also believe he would include the ideas of atheism and agnosticism in this because those are just as valid as praying to a creator. Belief is exactly that, a belief in what you think is right. It‚Äôs just like believing TSLA 750C by EOW is possible‚Ä¶if you believe it is possible you will act on it. Ultimately, I choose to believe in the God that values all people and believes all people can get into heaven regardless of their religious choices(for those who are unaware, a principle in the Mormon church is that anyone can get to heaven regardless of your religion or background. It just has to do with being a good person. There are principles they teach to help guide people on the path they believe is correct but it‚Äôs more of a speed limit type suggestion than an absolute law because again ANYONE CAN GET INTO HEAVEN). 

To summarize, God is all powerful and can do anything. Absolutely he made all religions(atheism and agnosticism included) to give people hope and belief, but also to provide guiding principles on how to be a good person. At the end of they day, just be a good person and all will be fine."

2021-06-24 19:37:29,wallstreetbets,"Your church told you that you are doing it to get closer to god. ‚ÄúGive us it. We don‚Äôt need it, but you need to give it. To us. For your own good. We promise‚Äù

Also, if you knew how you were being manipulated, you wouldn‚Äôt be allowing yourself to be manipulated.

Go read ‚Äúcombating cult mind control‚Äù be Steven Hassan, and if you look at it objectively, I guarantee you‚Äôll find cult mind control techniques very familiar. 

If your church discourages you from consuming information from ‚Äúnon-approved‚Äù or ‚Äúnon-faithful‚Äù sources, then alarm bells should be ringing. If they are not, you‚Äôre in deep. No one is too smart to be taken in, especially if they were born into it.

I would say a lot of people agree with me when they would call this abuse. I'm not saying it's standard practice that kids are getting molested (but that certainly does happen).

Edit: I grew up in the church and I have NEVER seen a kid go into an interview with the bishop with their parents. Not once. I know they are allowed, but it is not standard practice."

The second bit wasn't to try to justify the point I made but just to provide an example for the point that it's often also used to refer to a religion that is not very mainstream. 

first definition
 >1: a religion regarded as unorthodox or spurious (see SPURIOUS sense 2)
also : its body of adherents

Second definition isn't as big for the argument but would explain why christianity is sometimes referred to as a cult of christ 

>2a: great devotion to a person, idea, object, movement, or work (such as a film or book)
criticizing how the media promotes the cult of celebrity
especially : such devotion regarded as a literary or intellectual fad
b: the object of such devotion
c: a usually small group of people characterized by such devotion
the singer's cult of fans
The film has a cult following.

The third definition shows my point well.

>3: a system of religious beliefs and ritual
also : its body of adherents
the cult of Apollo

as does the fourth 

>4: formal religious veneration : WORSHIP

I think 1, 3, and 4 do a good job of showing that any religious system of beliefs would fall into the definition of cults. 

We can look at the oxford dictionary as well.

first definition looks a lot like number 2 above
>cult (of something) a way of life, an attitude, an idea, etc. that has become very popular

Second definition is much like the first above
>a small group of people who have extreme religious beliefs and who are not part of any established religion

third definition fits in well with 1, 3, and 4 above
>a system of religious beliefs and practices

Point has never, and will never change.  In my comment, I'm saying that religious rules are only for the followers.   All religious rules. For followers of all religions.  Because they are all equally bullshit.  I know you want to delineate between LDS and other religions, but that kind of logic is like saying a 3 dollar bill is different from a 4 dollar bill.  True, but not really.  Because they are both not ""real""."

If I were an Israelite thousands of years ago, I would have to sacrifice the unblemished first-born of my sheep; the equivalent for me is to tithe my income."
2021-06-24 15:17:02,wallstreetbets,"That's the go-to talking point on Reddit, yes. In all actuality, the temple doesn't even slightly cross my mind when I pay my tithing every month.

In all reality, I have felt my prayers be answered and I've had more peace in my life when I've paid my tithing. I can only tell you what I have experienced and felt."
2021-06-24 19:47:10,wallstreetbets,"Look, I assume you're coming at this sincerely and with good intent. I try to assume that of everyone, even if it's really annoying sometimes. So believe me when I say that I appreciate that you're concerned and are doing what you think is best, based on your experiences and knowledge. I hope you understand that what I'm about to say is also sincere, and I'm doing my best with the knowledge and experiences I've had in life.

My personal faith has helped me through hard times. It's given me structure when I needed it. The Church I belong to provides a different type of structure, but one that had supported me throughout my life. It's given me opportunities to develop leadership, diligence, public speaking, other soft skills, and education. It's taught me to live prudently. It brings peace and happiness into my life, and the lives of countless family members and friends around me. I have experienced immense good through my religion.

This isn't a matter of what I've been told, this is a matter of what I've felt and experienced. This is a matter of how it impacts my life and my wife's, not what my parents, in-laws, friends, or Church leaders would think about me. This isn't about not having a way out or complete inexperience with anti-Mormon materials (I've read more than you probably assume). This is about the warmth, peace, comfort, and joy that I've experience through striving to come unto Jesus Christ.

We are also talking about beliefs‚Ä¶you believe that Mormonism is a cult, I believe it is the true word of God. It doesn‚Äôt mean either of us are wrong, just that the other doesn‚Äôt believe the same things we do. 

So‚Ä¶they(Mormon church) doesn‚Äôt have their hooks in me; I believe because I want to believe. Same thing with aliens, big foot and the Lochness monster. 

If you were to look objectively at all religions(and researchers did, they conducted a study that correlated religious principles to happiness) then you would find that the Mormon religion actually has one of the highest rates of happiness of any religion(atheism included). https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3671693/

There could be a mcdonalds next door hiring for double the money you're getting unemployed, but why would you sacrifice 40 hours every week of actual work, when you have an indefinite stream of free money flowing in doing absolutely nothing? Very few people that are taking advantage of this free money are ever going to even peek at a job application regardless of the starting pay."

2021-06-24 10:56:18,wallstreetbets,"(I don't know who you are, so don't take this personally) 

I think worker morale is at an all time low, after seeing how ""essential workers"" were treated by society during the pandemic as both necessary and replaceable. There's a widespread feeling that everyone is getting fucked over by someone else (retail traders and citadel, employees and employers, people and the healthcare system), and it takes time to rebuild that trust. 

There's also a cultural difference as many business owners (and those willing to keep working) downplay the effects/existence of COVID, while those who stayed at home believed the opposite. It really segmented the population into two halves. 

As a straightforward example of population segmentation, women workers in male dominated fields is kind of the same.  It's not only the pay that motivates them to work, but other accomodations that take care of their needs. 

I imagine people want job security, time with their families, and a workplace that doesn't ignore COVID."
2021-06-24 10:54:15,wallstreetbets,I think it's people are trying to shift from field work to office/work from home jobs. I work in the TI department doing fire installations low voltage for buildings and pay is around the the same to start (25-30 for programmers) and have already had a few either quit and found office jobs or have transferred from field work to working from home becoming estimaters or engineering instead within the same company. I think many got used to being at home or seeing the possibilities from doing so and are in search of those jobs. We also have problems hiring field techs when everyone is submitting resumes for admin/PM/estimating office work. I work in the office and see this shift this current year.

But, I've seen over the years how companies treat employees and it has only gotten worse with the constant push to impress stock holders.  Best thing is to own your private buisness and then you can set your own rules.  I don't think companies have a lot of room to complain when they cannot get employees to work for them because wages have been shorted and benefits neutered.  I've seen this in several facilities I've visted over the last 5 years and it's clearly obvious the disconnect between levels in a buisnesses operation and compensation."

I have a buddy I used to work with making $20/hr, his job often has 2 week shutdown every year where they can file unemployment during that time, they were able to get the boosted benefits for that time, and seeing the numbers, and his living expenses, he could easily live off those benefits indefinitely. How many people can do the same at that pay range or even higher? Is $20/hr dogshit pay to you?"
2021-06-24 19:17:03,wallstreetbets,And what if ui is higher than their wage
2021-06-24 19:23:43,wallstreetbets,Just find them for less in a different area? Then you don‚Äôt have to force businesses open with too many workers available
2021-06-24 14:23:50,wallstreetbets,"Anecdote andy over here. I just go from the reporting that (depending cost of living) companies that understood the current job market started paying 12-16 dollars per hour are getting applications in truckloads, so clearly people are looking for a job.

And that is negotiating power moron. If the employee doesnt have to take up 9 dollar hour job or they starve that means they can say no, which will force the employers to compete with each other to increase pay."
2021-06-24 19:22:47,wallstreetbets,Then be like 99% of companies that manage to pay enough to attract workers.
2021-06-24 14:48:06,wallstreetbets,"The anecdote is a side note, not meant to be taken as a main argument. Obviously everyone's situation is different, but hes definitely not the only one, if at that pay rate you're making barely more than the UI, then clearly $16/hr is not enough by your standards, and every penny less an hour will have larger and larger groups easily surviving on the exorbitant handouts in the boosted UI. I'd bet the ""truckloads"" of apps you're referring to are in states removing those benefits or attributing them to unrelated cases to push their political agenda, because as I said, you are absolutely better off financially staying on UI if it still has no end date on the boost and the job is only paying 16."
2021-06-24 19:24:46,wallstreetbets,And all of them will pay the wage of the freeloader. Do you see the problem yet
2021-06-24 14:54:32,wallstreetbets,"It makes zero sense to ride out UI and then hard fall into same shit job you had. If you can use the time to look for better paying job then it makes most sense to apply to them. Which is what i think is happening. Of course the reporting is to push agenda, as is the reporting of ""shortages"" which have zero context, but people are applying to these jobs and people are not accepting the minimum paid no benefits no full time jobs which are just shit."
2021-06-24 19:27:35,wallstreetbets,"They dont. Some companies pay slightly higher wage and get applicants and some dont and get fucked. If your business cannot survive slight increase in operating expense on portion of your expense that is wages, its just shit business on life support. In that scenario there could be million things that could happen that immediately would make them unprofitable."
2021-06-24 15:11:30,wallstreetbets,"It absolutely does make sense to ride it out, they are given clear times frames months in advance which is plenty time for job searching, and even then the deadline is going to be either reduced extra benefits, so still boosted UI just not as much, or a job search requirement, which you fulfill by just then starting to job search.

The difference in that media coverage is you dont need anyone to tell you that handing out free money with no current expiration will deter people from looking for a job, but in order to convince people that a vast majority are willingly giving up that free money to spend 40 hours a week actually working, you really have to sell that kind of propaganda, which MSM is well versed in."
2021-06-24 19:36:00,wallstreetbets,"Wage of the freeloader meant unemployment, which is taxed from all. Im thinking bigger picture"
2021-06-24 19:40:45,wallstreetbets,"If you think taxes are theft then i want to see the society where military is private, you build your own roads, state doesnt use their global influence to maintain global economic superiority and laws dont protect those business from getting monopoliced. Then i will agree with the business whining about unemployment payments.

Maybe businesses should pick themselfs up from bootstraps and stop whining and adapt."

2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Did my first bit of simple DD on Paysafe (PSFE) The case for Paysafe (PSFE)

Paysafe is a fintech company with tons of promise, especially if you believe in the future of iGaming.

## Missed earnings but many positives

Paysafe stock fell 13% after an underwhelming Q1 earnings report driven by an EPS miss of $0.02, only a 5% growth in revenue, and a loss of nearly $50M but there were many positives that were drowned out by these numbers. Most notably for me are their strong free cash flow numbers. Free cash flow for Q1‚Äô21 came in at a nice $108M representing a 22% increase over Q1‚Äô20. This signals to me that they are losing money only because of non-cash expenses which will be reduced in the future thanks to them paying down loads of debt through funds raised during the SPAC deal.

More positives overlooked in their earnings include eCash volume and revenue up 60%, partnerships with coinbase and other ""internet money"" exchanges, and an active M&A pipeline.

## The SPAC stench will wear off

In it‚Äôs short life, the stock is down 27% the last six months following the SPAC merger with Foley Transimene Acquisition corp. Yes, the earnings miss played a role in this but the company also still has the stench of the SPAC associated with it however, this isn‚Äôt your average SPAC company. Paysafe is already a well-established company. They are the global leader in iGaming which includes everything from sports betting to lottery. They processed a $27.7B worth of transaction in Q1‚Äô21, which is no chump change. They also offer eCash solutions for those who prefer to complete transactions in cash and digital wallet solutions for those who don‚Äôt. I think investors who may be wary of jumping into the stock because of its SPAC association will one day realize that this isn‚Äôt just another SPAC, but a well-established company with room to grow.

## Institutional ownership

According to whalewisdom.com institutional ownership in PSFE is at the time of writing 412M shares of a total of 723.71M shares outstanding representing about 57% institutional ownership, led by Blackstone group with 160.8M shares. Why is this significant? Because institutions like Blackstone analyze companies and their stocks for a living and they have people much smarter than myself and most of us reading this to do so. You can be certain that if they are buying up so many shares of a company, they are bullish and expecting high returns for their efforts.

It‚Äôs not just institutions that are bullish on PSFE either, analysts are consistently giving price targets well above the current price of $11.25 including:

* Michael Del Grosso (Compass Point) ‚Äì $19 price target
* Timothy Chiodo (Credit Suisse) ‚Äì $17 price target
* Darrin Peller (Wolfe Research) ‚Äì $19 price target
* Daniel Perlin (RBC) ‚Äì $19 price target

## Growth through U.S iGaming

It‚Äôs clear that the company is currently being bogged down by their latest conservative growth numbers so for this stock to break out, it will need a catalyst. That catalyst will be the legalization of online gambling that will almost certainly sweep through the U.S. Paysafe is currently live in 15 states leaving 35 more states to go. With the promise of those sweet sweet tax dollars, I believe most states will eventually cave in and Paysafe will be there to offer them the picks and shovels required to make it a reality.

2021-06-24 11:12:28,wallstreetbets,In for 1200 shares around 13.50. This ones been painful to watch the past few months but there‚Äôs a lot of potential. With daily short volume often in the 40-60% range there‚Äôs some reason to believe the price is being tactically pinned down as more and more institutions have revealed large positions. The stagnant YoY overall revenue growth last quarter was disappointing but clouded the fact that their ecash/digital wallet segment revenues grew 60% YoY with a 29% gain in free cash flows. Doesn‚Äôt hurt being backed by someone whose generated $100 billion in shareholder value of the course of their career either. Patience.

2021-06-24 11:58:58,wallstreetbets,">Paysafe is a fintech company with tons of promise, especially if you believe in the future of iGaming

Not quite. Paysafe is a merchant services provider. The industry often mistaken for Fintech, but in reality it's more of a commodity banking product (electronic payment processing) driven by price. Paysafe's direct competitors include companies like FIS/Worldpay, FISERV, and Global Payments (the big 3). 15 years of race to the bottom have severally compressed profit margins and increased attrition YOY. This is why you're seeing so much M&A in the space. Once iGaming is legalized, Paysafe will be competing for this business against the Big 3. They'll surely win some accounts, but chances are the Big 3 will dominate the space because they can offer better pricing and technology. 



>Paysafe stock fell 13% after an underwhelming Q1 earnings report driven by an EPS miss of $0.02, only a 5% growth in revenue, and a loss of nearly $50M

That loss is substantial. And it's due to the fact that they board ""high risk"" merchant accounts"". Think of them as a subprime lender.

>It‚Äôs clear that the company is currently being bogged down by their latest conservative growth numbers so for this stock to break out, it will need a catalyst. That catalyst will be the legalization of online gambling that will almost certainly sweep through the U.S. Paysafe is currently live in 15 states leaving 35 more states to go. With the promise of those sweet sweet tax dollars, I believe most states will eventually cave in and Paysafe will be there to offer them the picks and shovels required to make it a reality

This won't be the boon you're thinking because once it's legal, all of their competitors will be boarding these types of accounts and have pockets deep enough to ""buy the market"" with low processing rates, rates that Paysafe can't afford to match."
2021-06-24 13:49:14,wallstreetbets,I think this is a wait and see right now. A Fintech company with P/E over 90x growing revenues at 5% when everyone is zooming along doesn't really sound attractive tbh.
2021-06-24 14:41:11,wallstreetbets,"I liked $PSFE, but got out of it at a loss because I was bag holding for far too long and I think the reason it never popped off is because although fundamentals are gold standard, they've hit their peak and revenue growth YoY will be stagnant. Slow revenue growth is a big no-no for a high growth Fintech. You'd have to long this play and even then, it won't be ape-satisfying returns. Good luck!"

Square is a payfac that boarded low risk accounts, and has still somehow found a way to lose money every year by selling one of the most profitable financial products around. Square's market cap relative to earnings (relative to it's competitors) makes it a bubble on the verge of collapse.

Paysafe has been around a long time and for most of it's existence has specialized in boarding high risk merchant accounts. While these accounts do produce large profit margins, they also produce huge losses. The majority of their book is Free Trial Nutraceutical, a VERY boom/bust vertical. As of my knowledge, they don't have their own technology. I believe they still white label NMIs gateway. They've also been mismanaged for at least a decade. I've met some of the CEOs they've had... Complete idiots. There's a reason the stock is falling. They're probably taking on water from their high risk accounts and don't have the cash to cover."

They are already established with 75% of US iGaming operators so when a state legalizes they have first mover advantage. 

The minor EPS miss was due to one-time quarterly costs having to due with paying down $1.2 Billion in debt and merger transaction costs, without which they would have reported positive EPS and beat all analysts estimates."

2021-06-24 15:21:55,wallstreetbets,"Sandman, not sure your assessment on Paysafe is reasonable:

Under Blackstone's management, their revenue grew 28% CAGR pre-covid and 18% CAGR including the Covid year, which is on par with PayPal.  Recent low quarterly growth report had to do with strategic exiting of high-risk Asia markets, without which they said they'd have reported growth in the high teens.  Their new Board of Directors, along with Bill Foley as Chairman, suggests this will continue to be a very positive turn around story.

They only produced losses last ER because they had millions in one-time expenses associated with paying down $1.2 Billion in debt and merger transaction costs.  Without those non-recurring expenses, they'd have reported over $40 million in profit and beat analysts' EPS estimates.  Because of these and other strategic moves, EBITDA and EPS will show big improvements going forward.

Never heard anything about the nutraceutical thing.  That seems like a different company, or just made up.  Curious to learn though if you have proof.  Paysafe owns the second largest digital wallet globally and currently dominates the iGaming sector globally."
2021-06-24 14:31:34,wallstreetbets,All that to say that you're ..... Optimistic....for the future?
2021-06-24 15:37:24,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, reread your post and convinced you haven't looked at this company in a long time:

You say, ""They're probably taking on water from their high risk accounts and don't have the cash to cover.""

Response: Their customer cash is accounted for in separate accounts and they reported over $362 million in free cash flow.  In fact, last quarter alone they generated $108 million which is a 28% yoy increase.

You say, ""As of my knowledge, they don't have their own technology""

Response: Their MOAT is in their unique platforms which allow them to successfully enter spaces that other fintechs can't or won't.  For example: Paysafecard enables those without bank accounts or credit cards (the 1.7 billion ‚Äúunbanked‚Äù) to engage in online commerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.

Another aspect of their MOAT is their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise which offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are slow to enter. CEO Philip McHugh: ‚ÄúWhen we talk about a deep and a wide moat, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it‚Äôs hard to copy.‚Ä¶We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It‚Äôs a real strength of ours. We‚Äôve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we‚Äôve upgraded the team, we‚Äôve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.‚Äù"
2021-06-24 11:54:10,wallstreetbets,One question for ya: you seem knowledgeable about payment processors. You gonna buy Stripe IPO?
2021-06-24 11:50:26,wallstreetbets,"Lol at suggesting square will collapse. You realize that they would be acquired by MC or V if they fell enough, right?"

2021-06-24 18:56:11,wallstreetbets,This.
2021-06-24 19:06:26,wallstreetbets,Reasonable take
2021-06-24 15:49:40,wallstreetbets,Big crisis coming? Feels like the Fed will make sure the markets get juiced up for as long as they can (maybe a few more years).
2021-06-24 11:35:45,wallstreetbets,In my mind it's actually a hedge against that.  People are going to drink/smoke/gamble no matter what is going on in the world.
2021-06-24 12:40:08,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the answer! And I definitely agree with your take, You are right that plenty of profits to gain even if partially supported, I do worry about sudden changes due to election cycles and political back peddling due to ‚Äúfiascos‚Äù ( start the bingo board on which sport has a match fixing event first). But it‚Äôs probably a safe long term bet overall.

How growth will be impacted as different states open up to it versus reject it will be interesting as well. (I.e a small population state versus a larger one legalizing it)."
2021-06-24 11:00:07,wallstreetbets,Green is good.

2021-06-24 14:58:30,wallstreetbets,"Stripe should be very appealing. I‚Äôm guessing though the greedy venture capitalists price it at like 100x at IPO, so by the time public gets it 5yrs of earnings are already baked in"
2021-06-24 12:04:11,wallstreetbets,"The card brands don't acquire processors, only other processors do. They would most likely be bought by one of the Big 3 just for the MIDs, then given a viking funeral."

2021-06-24 17:33:39,wallstreetbets,"Maybe there will be a dip and not constant growth but gambling is addictive and having 24/7 access to get your fix is a good business model. 

Its a vice and the convenience is good. But yes, you need to be patient and lay off the crayons to put your money in this."

2021-06-24 18:44:56,wallstreetbets,"Not particularly. I'm at a different company in the same industry, but we don't board the high risk shit they do. I did spend a brief stint at the executive level over there (total circus), I was also an executive at First Data/FISERV. 14 years of industry experience and I currently earn $200/hr consulting to investment firms about the payments space for 3 different consulting firms. It's an extremely complex industry. But, again, feel free to disregard my advice. It's your money. Have fun."
2021-06-24 13:54:09,wallstreetbets,"Right now that's the way it's looking. But it's been that way for a long time. In this industry, you build processors/acquirers with selling out as an endgame, because perpetually servicing these MIDs over a long term is a losing proposition."
2021-06-24 14:40:55,wallstreetbets,"CC processing is how you get in the door, the real money is selling those merchants on payroll services, gift card, loyalty, smb capital, etc."

2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"FIGS Is Gonna Take Us To Tendietown, I Can Feel It In My Plums   **OVERVIEW:**

**FIGS Inc** (NYSE: **FIGS**) is an healthcare apparel company from California. They sell a variety of scrubs (medical wear) and other products for health care professionals. It was created in 2013 by Heather Hasson and Trina Spear.

**HISTORY:**

Hasson had the business idea when she realized that, unlike companies such as Lululemon, Under Armor, and Nike, that make clothes for athletes, there were no companies making fitted uniforms for health care professionals like doctors and nurses

Spear worked on Wall Street during this time and was able to help Hasson develop an idea of how to run the business idea. They were able to raise $2 million around this time to help get the business off the ground, and another $3 mil in 2014 and 2015. Campfire ‚Äì the same capital fund that backed Lululemon ‚Äì led the Series A in FIGS, thus bringing around an extra $5 million.

**FUNDAMENTALS n SHIT:**

Steadily increasing revenue qoq, EBITDA increased, assets have more than doubled in the past 2 quarters. Free cash flow increased 15 times. blah blah blah wrinkle brain numbers + words + no rocket emojis for my fellow autists.

**SMOOTH BRAIN INFO:**

Are you bored yet? Sick of hearing about the future of FIGS and just want to hear about how awesome this fuckin‚Äô company is? I‚Äôm balls deep into it, commons and calls. I believe in this company. I mean, just google the CEOs. Seriously. Do it. Heather Hasson. Trina Spear. These ladies are badass, they know what they‚Äôre fucking doing. So many wrinkles in the brain, I‚Äôd follow them to the depths of hell.

These CEOs have the world by the FIGS. And as [u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/user/DeepFuckingValue) is my witness, I‚Äôll stand by them to the stars.

If Daddy Elon and Mama Cathie have taught me anything, it‚Äôs that this ape needs to diamond hand and sail off into the stratosphere with Auntie Heather and Auntie Trinaüë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏èüßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è

Let this stock fly, my beloved Aunties. Get me out of my wifes boyfriends basement suite. My FIGS are with you and they're going to the moon.  
 

Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, do your own DD. Brain smoother than my wifes boyfriends balls. I have commons and calls, and will go LONG on this stonk and have no intention of selling anytime soon. Position posted below:

Double Disclaimer: I couldn't find a fig emoji, so please accept these grapes instead üçáüçáüçáüçá

2021-06-24 12:40:48,wallstreetbets,2000@8.35. Sold a little to diversify my portfolio. Lol not really I bought 20 draft kings and my portfolio is still 97% uwmc! I said I would hold for years. But seems like we‚Äôre getting more attention my the week.
2021-06-24 11:03:25,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm buying some now because your so convinced!!
2021-06-24 09:52:01,wallstreetbets,"So question, what the advantage of buying a call when the price is already above it? I thought calls were to bet the price rising to a certain price."

What does this mean in lamens?"
2021-06-24 10:18:50,wallstreetbets,"Yep, not worried about the shares in the slightest. If it drops to 6 that‚Äôs where my next paycheck (minus rent and utilities, never go full retard) is going"

2021-06-24 09:58:20,wallstreetbets,I think the options are the other part of his portfolio. But I'm not sure.
2021-06-24 09:57:38,wallstreetbets,How is that not everything?
2021-06-24 11:28:36,wallstreetbets,"Oh god that‚Äôs terrifying. Is that what this place is?

DYOR! Tho I hope you‚Äôd come to a similar conclusion :)"
2021-06-24 09:53:38,wallstreetbets,His call is in the money. Basically betting that stock will stay above $9 and rolling in the gains
2021-06-24 09:56:25,wallstreetbets,"I think I bought it in the mid 8s. But the basic advantage of ITMs (in the money) or NTMs (near the money) is lower risk at the cost of lower reward. As long as it stays above 9 those will be good

Technically calls are just saying ‚ÄúI bet the price will rise \*significantly towards this price\* and extra cool if it meets this price‚Äù and the strike price is simply a determining factor in contract premiums and potential (and potency) of gains. 

Like I have some august 12c but would be perfectly happy if it reached 11.5 by then"

2021-06-24 11:41:29,wallstreetbets,"It means they wanted to buy shares right at the open of trading. You can put a MOO order, it'll give you whatever price the stock opens at."
2021-06-24 12:42:25,wallstreetbets,If it drops to 6 its time to take out a 2nd mortgage with UWMC and go all in.
2021-06-24 10:08:21,wallstreetbets,Confident of inclusion??
2021-06-24 10:02:49,wallstreetbets,Yep!
2021-06-24 10:45:08,wallstreetbets,"He still has kidneys... One of them would raise between $8k and $40k.

In all seriousness though, I assumed the options were included in the portfolio diversity value as it's the same stock."
2021-06-24 15:08:20,wallstreetbets,That IS what this place is.
2021-06-24 09:54:02,wallstreetbets,Good stuff
2021-06-24 10:27:48,wallstreetbets,Whatcha think about the mid july $10 C?
2021-06-24 12:03:02,wallstreetbets,"Can you help explain this a little more?  I just started dipping my toes into options, so earlier this month I bought two August 12.50c for UWMC.  The concept I'm struggling with is why OTM calls have a higher reward than ITM if the stock reaches the OTM strike before expiration.  Because these still just represent contracts that someone is going to eventually excercise, right?  So why, if the stock reaches $13 let's say, would a previously OTM contract for $12 be worth more than a $9 contract that was always ITM?

\>Like I have some august 12c but would be perfectly happy if it reached 11.5 by then

Is this because you still anticipate being able to profitably sell the contract as long as its far enough before expiration and theta hasn't eaten everything away?"
2021-06-24 11:13:28,wallstreetbets,But so he could make more right by calls with a higher strike price? But way more risk
2021-06-24 15:10:08,wallstreetbets,Well played.  I was wondering what UWMC had for meme potential.
2021-06-24 10:09:40,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt think so, I know so!

But tbh not expecting a TON from that. With such a  small float could see some nice movement tho. I‚Äôm happy with slow and steady, not worried about the shares in the slightest, but wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it blows up too

2021-06-24 12:03:06,wallstreetbets,"Oh shit, I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve been wasting 500 more July 20c on some stupid fluid filters. I just found the ultimate margin"
2021-06-24 15:41:43,wallstreetbets,">He still has kidneys... One of them would raise between $8k and $40k.

If I still have a lot of cocaine in my kidneys can I get a premium?"
2021-06-24 12:10:39,wallstreetbets,Not worth more but gains more and is cheaper
2021-06-24 11:18:51,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs more complicated than that.  Call profitability is more like a wave.  As a strike price moves father ITM or OTM, it will begin to approach the asymptote of its intrinsic value (OTM = $0.01, ITM = share price - strike).

So there‚Äôs a window that‚Äôs the sweet spot. ITM calls will be more resistant to share price fluctuation due to intrinsic value.  OTM calls will increase/decrease more significantly for a given share price movement."
2021-06-24 10:12:24,wallstreetbets,Damn! Alright! I‚Äôm in! LFG!!
2021-06-24 12:14:14,wallstreetbets,I see now.  So the % gains are way higher because the OTM call was so much cheaper to begin with.

**Whether waiting for a crash to invest is a better investment strategy than staying invested?**

**Analysis**

For this, let‚Äôs take someone who started investing approximately 3 decades back (1993 to be exact). I created multiple investment scenarios as follows to understand the difference in returns if you

a.¬†Invested at the exact right time when markets were lowest that particular year

b.¬†Was extremely unlucky and just invested at the peak every year

c.¬†Did not care about timing the market and invested at a random date every year

d.¬†Just hoarded his cash and waited for a market crash to invest \[1\] ¬†

For analysis simplicity, let‚Äôs assume that you were on a conservative side, never picked individual stocks, and always made your investments to S&P500 \[2\]. For investment amount, consider that you started with investing $10K in 1993 and increased your investments by 5% for every subsequent year. So, you made a total investment of $623K over the last 29 years. ¬†

**Results**

The analysis did throw up some interesting results. There‚Äôs a lot to unpack here and let‚Äôs break it down by each segment.

The most important insight is that **it‚Äôs virtually impossible to lose money over the long term in the market \[3\]**. Even if you were the unluckiest person and invested exactly at the very top each year, you will still end up having a 263% return on your invested amount.

At the opposite end of the spectrum, if you were somehow the luckiest person and invested only at the lowest point every year, you would have made a cool 100% more than someone who invested only at the top. Given both the hypothetical scenarios are extreme cases, let‚Äôs consider some more realistic scenarios. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

If you did not care about timing the market and invested a fixed amount each month/year, you would still make a shade over 300% on your investments.

Out of all the above scenarios, you would have made the most amount of money (a whopping 391% return) if you invested only during major crashes. In this type of investing, you would not invest in the stock market and keeps accumulating your cash position waiting for a crash.

While this seems like a good idea, in theory, it‚Äôs extremely difficult to execute properly in real life. The main limitations to investing during a crash strategy are

a. The current returns are calculated by investing at the very bottom of the crashes. It‚Äôs very difficult to identify the bottom of the crash while a crash is happening. You can end up investing midway through the crash and given that you are investing a significant chunk of capital you saved up, it can end up wiping out your portfolio.

b.¬†Identifying a crash itself is very hard

https://preview.redd.it/ocz775l9k5771.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=171f31da53107b2847e9fe1229492c903313c62b

As we can see from the above chart, the years that we consider were great for the market in hindsight still had significant drops within the same year. So even when the market is down 10%, it becomes extremely difficult to know whether it‚Äôs going into a deeper crash or whether it‚Äôs going to bounce back up.

**Conclusion**

While the analysis did prove that waiting for the crash is theoretically the best strategy returns-wise, practically it‚Äôs very difficult to execute it.

For e.g., even if you predicted the 2020 Coronavirus crash correctly, where would be your entry point? The market was down 15% by Mar 6th, another 10% by Mar 13th, and then another 10% by March 20th for a total of 35%. If you did not get in at the absolute bottom, you would have lost a considerable sum of your investment without actually getting any benefits from the previous run-up. ¬†¬†

It is extremely enticing to be the guy who called the crash correctly and even if you are right, only getting in at the absolute bottom would only give you the best returns. Adding to this, in the last 20 years, 70% of the best days in the market happened within 14 days of the worst ones \[4\]. If you miss just any of those days waiting for an entry point, your returns would be substantially lower than someone who just stayed invested.

If you think you are in the select few who have the skills to identify a crash and the temperament to see the crash through to invest at the very bottom, you will make an absolute killing in the market! For the rest of us, continuous investment regardless of the market trends seems to be the better choice.

Even if you didn‚Äôt time the bottom of the crash perfectly you would still benefit from investing at 10, 20 or 30% lower price point than otherwise.

Or, using rules based investments. Stick a lump sum in when the market has dropped 50% off its 5 year high (or whatever).

The time in the market thing makes approaches such as this totally fair game, as time in the market saying is drawing exclusively from historical data. It doesn't matter what trend you come up with from historical data, if it beats this, it's a better way to invest.

I tend to hedge that kind of investment so  if the market falls shortly thereafter, it doesn‚Äôt take 2-5 years to get back to even.  The market always goes up because it‚Äôs not the same market. It‚Äôs reconstituted every 90 days or so with the strongest stocks, and the weaklings are kicked out of the indexes. Borders books is gone, Amazon is strong!"

2021-06-24 16:07:52,wallstreetbets,"Itd be interesting to see the variance of these options too, including that of the ""buy after crash"" accounting for uncertainty of knowing when a crash is. I suppose that would depend on your algorithm for identifying a crash though...

2021-06-24 16:31:37,wallstreetbets,"My main issue with time in the market mantra is that you got a bunch of 20 years olds (typically) fully invested and counting on 40 year time horizon. Really? Can you really endure a REAL bear market that may last 5-10 years without sweating/panic-selling? So you telling me you can weather a bear market without a down payment for a house, or losing job, or medical issue‚Ä¶.. life goes around and assuming you are in for 40 years is a wild assumption. Everybody is in for long term until market crashes and life happens and you need the money‚Ä¶.."

2021-06-24 16:52:49,wallstreetbets,"I thought the idea was to average down. Markets crash all the time but a crash below your cost basis is a huge buy signal if you have any faith in it.

Hope do big crashes affect things like options pricing etc?

I wonder how the stats would look for someone trying to short the peaks and buy the crashes. Probably a bigger spread but by how much. Would they still profit even with the worst timing."
2021-06-24 17:06:35,wallstreetbets,"I think the crash is done if I can see 5 days green

2021-06-24 17:25:52,wallstreetbets,"I think the best strategy here is to try to set yourself up to make sure you have extra cash available for when things crash.

That way you follow a default invest on regular intervals and invest extra when things crash."

2021-06-24 16:39:08,wallstreetbets,My Chinese client got really offended when I told him we should sell the house since market is Hot.  Dude never sells.  Owns like 4000 shares of Tesla and stuff.  Bought all name brands during peak Covid crash.  Dude never sells.  Literally
2021-06-24 09:26:51,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm curious to this answer
2021-06-24 10:36:13,wallstreetbets,"I mean he would have have been right only twice in those 15 years, assuming you include corona flash crash.

How many times did he 'predict' it? Depends on how you count, I mean: I predict an imminent crash within the next year or so - if you ask me daily, will each time I answer count, or does the whole period (1 year) count as 1 prediction?"
2021-06-24 09:42:00,wallstreetbets,Link to that sub please! I‚Äôm guessing he got hot headed after 2009 and has called more incorrect than correct

2021-06-24 11:55:07,wallstreetbets,"can you send me link to this sub, please."
2021-06-24 16:57:47,wallstreetbets,"this would be interesting

I believe a crash is coming this year"
2021-06-24 14:00:55,wallstreetbets,"This, WHEN you try to pull your money out counts more than the timing on getting in.

If you bought in 1927 and tried to get out in 1930...you lost 90%. 

If you got in in 27 and waited 30yrs you broke even."
2021-06-24 19:04:40,wallstreetbets,"I mean that is literally the whole point of the post, to show how buy and hold works with SPY.

The people who lose the most money on the stock market are definitely the panic sellers - remember, be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when other are fearful.

If you start investing basically before you are 35-40 years old, is virtually impossible to lose money bar a whole-world collapse event (WWIII etc) or something that literally destroys capitalism simply because you would eventually recover it. Sure, you may invest now at 30 and the market collapses and loses 50% on the next year. You would be in the shit for maybe 10-15 years. But, eventually, it is 100% guaranteed that you would get more money than you originally invested and much more, although it may take 30 years for the latter, etc.

The problem is being close to retirement when a market crash is ocurring, that‚Äôs why the golden rule is is to shift to Bonds the older you get, e.g. a 60 year old should probably have a 60/40% in bonds/stocks or even more in bonds in case a market crash happens and it wipes out most of his stock gains. 

A young person should have 100% in stocks, no discussion.

PS: also, the ‚Äúif you had to take money‚Äù clause that you mentioned doesn‚Äôt make sense, because ALL money invested should be money that you don‚Äôt need. You never ever ver invest money that you need - hence, you would never ‚Äúhave the need‚Äù to take it out, especially at the bottom of a crash."
2021-06-24 16:25:25,wallstreetbets,"There's another huge problem with this.  DCA works when you have an income stream to invest.  It's a fine strategy for a passive investor.

What it doesn't tell you is what to do when for whatever reason you have to invest a large amount of cash.  Say you just sold a house, came into inheritance, a large gift, etc.  Then it gets more tricky.

Finally, large amounts of passive investing via ETF's are already distorting the market.  It creates a lot of inefficiencies and correlation between shitty stocks with good ones.  AKA the market is pretty fucking dumb as a whole and an above average intelligence active investor should 100% be able to beat passive strategies.  Moreover, you can't ""time"" the bottom or top exactly but there are a multitude of reliable ways to tell that the market is grossly over-valued or under-valued.  CAPE ratios for example tell us that the market as a whole is absurd.  Now is NOT the time to dump into passive strategies.  If you're going to be in you should be in individual stocks, or at the very least defensive sectors."
2021-06-24 10:38:38,wallstreetbets,"I guess everytime the news say that it has been one of the worst days, you should just run as fast as you can towards your investment account and go 50% all in. If the following days are red as well, then you add another 25% ; then keep the rest for a potential depression."
2021-06-24 10:35:09,wallstreetbets,Don't use this logic to hold bags though.

2021-06-24 11:46:11,wallstreetbets,actually many studies show that even lump sum at the top beats a DCA strategy. maybe with the exception of buying in at the very tippy top of the dotcom bubble on exclusively tech stocks

Then again, not cutting your losses before it gets worse is just extending your misery/pain deeper.

I remember assholes like Ben Stein and Cramer on TV telling us to buy the dip after Lehman...it has 6 more months of sliding before it turned up even a bit, and if the gov hadn't bailed them out, it would have been a longer struggle back.

Make no mistake, we are in the longest bull market ever, when this MF'er turns, the charts look higher today than 1928...  It's not question of if, it's a question of when.   And you want to be out in the part of the drop, not holding bags watching 90% losses 6months later."

I'm not well-versed enough to know the difference between it and an ETF, but the concept is similar and it's been around a long time. You can go for several funds if you want some variability but large funds like the S&P really do track the overall market quite well, in general."
2021-06-24 13:15:26,wallstreetbets,Why would you ever sell? That makes it real
2021-06-24 12:22:27,wallstreetbets,"No idea, OP stated ideally you want to buy in at the low of a crash...which means you would have already sold your shares to take advantage of it. Not hold through it. If you missed that, then yeah hold your shares.

Do I know when this is going to happen? No lol, I don't think I was implying that.  I was just stating that ""buy and hold"" strategy is not exactly supported by this post.

I suppose you could hold and wait for it to hit a peak, or you could sell, buy low and then sell high again. I guess in that case holding would be playing it safe, and if that's the case maybe you are in the wrong sub.

I don't claim to have the answers by any means, it's a fucking wild ride and you just have to hope for the best."

They will just seize your assets and sell them to pay the debt. If your family wants to keep your old house and the rest of your estate, they must take on the debt."

2021-06-24 09:59:15,wallstreetbets,"I understand batteries because of my work and after reading through the short report, I am choosing not to mess with QS. The short report was clearly written (it was written poorly in my opinion) to discredit QS with a lot repeating negative comments on every slide (the font was also a poor choice and I felt like I was being yelled at while I was reading it). The most important thing from the report was the discrepancy on the ability to hamper the formation of dendrites. The graph that QS had showed they received little to no dendrite formation BUT the methodology to get those results are not how batteries are used. Dendrites are essentially (this is just an analogy I‚Äôve used before and it‚Äôs the most successful at explaining it) similar to stalactite and stalagmite formation in caves. They build up from the inside of the battery in prevent the electrons from moving from the anode to the cathode and vise versa (charging and discharging). The way QS prevented this was by only charging/discharging for a short period of time, taking measurements, and then moving on with the next data point. Your battery in your phone is always discharging because it‚Äôs being used; if you were to only use it for an hour a day and then shut it off until the next day you would then start to replicate how QS claimed to ‚Äúprevent‚Äù dendrites. Preventing dendrites is a holy grail of battery technology.

With all this said, I feel like there is still money to be made in the short term with the company but I think It‚Äôs a hard pass from me dawg. Invest wisely in this company my friends."

2021-06-24 15:23:54,wallstreetbets,Interesting take.  I appreciate that perspective. I do believe that there's more ground to be gained with improving technology.  And I'll always take some sort term money üí∞ it goes well with my short term capital gains.  Maybe QS will be an M&A story in the future...

If you bought some Aug $10 calls at ~$4.20 your net cost is $14.20 (if exercised but no reason for that) about .13 cents more than you paid, but it would cost you ~$21,000 not $~$70,000 and being itm will go up almost nickle for nickel and if it drops to $10 you would be down almost the same as if you‚Äôre holding your shares and it dropped to $10.

2021-06-24 11:30:52,wallstreetbets,It is poetic that you are buying $wish and getting something less valuable than you paid for even though at first it looked like a really great deal.
2021-06-24 16:01:57,wallstreetbets,"Remember last few weeks all the clowns were on here ""But but wish is terrible they make crappy products"" and I was like ""pigga we don't care about their fake ass necklaces we want lambos"""
2021-06-24 10:26:30,wallstreetbets,"WISH‚Äôs growth rate looks incredibly tempting. They grew revenue by 35% last year.

However, $WISH lost $745 million last year. Ouch. Worst of all, nearly $400M of that is stock-based compensation to pad the pockets of management, as well as $265m in G&A expenses for their new lofty salaries, a 300% increase in spending from 2019.

So $WISH is burning YOUR cash and diluting shares to grow its revenue. They‚Äôre paying management massive salaries, giving them stock compensation while stockholders suffer losses.

If you completely discount these one off charges from going public, $WISH still has over 200M in EBITDA losses, which doubled over the past year despite revenue only increasing 35%. EBITDA loss margin is expanding which is exactly what you want to avoid in a growing company. The point of owning any growth company, like TSLA who recently reached positive EBITDA, is for the EBITDA loss to increase slower than the revenue or even decrease. This was during covid when basically every ecommerce competitor did better than $WISH.

Bluntly, the company is spending too much. Shares have been squeezed up nearly 100% from the low. There's better opportunities out there than $WISH right now."

Currently I have less than twenty stocks that have a roughly equal portfolio diversity. They are all mostly good stocks that have been making good returns. How does one amplify this ? I know this subreddit is famous for ‚ÄúYOLO ‚Äú. Therefore I‚Äôm pondering on the specifics of how one should go about doing this.

1) How much due diligence is needed to undertake such a strategy ?
2) Does it require a degree of a leap of faith as they say ?
3) in order to maximize gains from one stock do you put it all into options or hold shares?"

2021-06-24 09:24:28,wallstreetbets,"If you have been consulting wsb for your stock selection, you probably have less diversity than you think.

You might imagine that because you have some ev tech, some ecomm, some retail, some entertainment you are diversified. And you could not be wrong.

All of your stocks being NA, is sloppy, and exposes you to US inevitable down turn via runaway fraud, and 10 consecutive bull years.

All of your stocks being small cap Hail Marys, is also trash. WSB has to pick small caps to have any chance of degenerately doubling their money in a few weeks. However when (not if) markets turn, small cap gets obliterated, and leaves you nothing to trade with.

2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"EV Car Battery sector play So every EV car contains about 200 lbs of graphite on average.  It's in the car batteries.  Since EV car battery production will have to 100x from current levels we will need a lot of graphite.  As it turns out, there is not a graphite industry.  Currently, CATL, LG, Samsung, Tesla pull from a lot of small suppliers all over the world, sort of an open marketplace for price and quality of the refined graphite.  This will not cut it when we need 100x the battery supply.  There is really no major player.  Biden's $170B EV plan he announced some 6 weeks ago is the perfect opportunity for a graphite player to be produced right here in the U.S. (there is only one US graphite supplier).  Tesla wants clean graphite from this continent for its Nevada gigafactory.  This is a sector of the EV batter play that hasn't been played yet because there is nothing to play, but there will be now because we NEED the graphite, picking the few graphite stocks here could be extremely lucrative."

2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DOCS IPO Let me preface this by saying that I‚Äôm a doctor and I use this app every day. 

Today is the IPO of Doximity. It is an app (saas) that is a mix between telehealth and a social media platform for doctors, nurse practitioners, PAs, dentists, etc. They are one of a kind in that they‚Äôre the only ones with this scope in the industry having the social media platform plus telehealth all in one. 80% (me included) of all doctors in the US use doximity. They also allow you to find jobs in your field and keep you up to date on the latest research. It is going to debut for 26$ and boy is that a deal. 

This business has a market cap around 4 bil and is the market leader in an industry (telehealth, social media for professionals) that is about to drip like the oil boom. According to their S1, this industry is worth ~18 bil and is growing rapidly. That is telehealth. That does not include all the other aspects of this business. Last year alone over 63 million telehealth visits occurred. There are so many implications for this service (seeing patients unable to make it to clinic, counseling, etc). This is just the tip of the ice berg. With the money from the ipo they plan to grow rapidly and may incorporate an electronic medical records with this service eventually, which is fucking huge. It would make my life so much easier lol. 

Within the last year revenue grew 78% from 116.4 mil to 206 mil. They also are already positive with earnings. Their biggest competitor, tdoc, (look at what they ipo at and now) are not profitable. This company is about to fucking boom don‚Äôt miss out. I‚Äôve included a few of my sources.

The rule ""positions or ban"" basically means that the only people who can post DDs are those who are heavily biased in their positions. It's going to be very rare that you find someone who says ""Hey I just put 20 grand in this company and here is a balanced and unbiased perspective on why it will do well."" I get stupid about stocks I put *twenty dollars* in.

If anything, WSB needs to require that you prove you have *no* position in a company that you're advocating for (good luck proving that, though). That's the only way you're going to get a DD that isn't trying to sell you a bridge in Brooklyn."
2021-06-24 08:47:19,wallstreetbets,OP's track [record](https://www.markovchained.com/profiles/view/reddit:PathoTurnUp) has been pretty mixed

2021-06-24 07:33:20,wallstreetbets,"""amazon has a netflix?"" - my dad. thankfully experiences arent universal"
2021-06-24 07:33:33,wallstreetbets,"can confirm - i dont see the value proposition of doximity. 

medicine is still such an old boys (and now, girls) club that many jobs are still obtained by who you know (or trained with) and reputational status. at least in my field, many jobs on doximity are either bad jobs that no one wants, old and already filled but posted for equal opportunity reasons, or locums jobs. specialty-specific job boards on various professional association websites tend to be much more productive for a job search.

as for telemedicine - it might be here to stay, it might not. i haven't been using it via doximity. i have met zero doctors who have used it via doximity. 

as for social networking - already spending all day talking about, thinking about medicine. not a second of my evening goes towards facebooking more of the medicine crowd. at best, doximity has been a nice rolodex of who i know and may want to contact at some point.

they do offer a hipaa secure pdf to fax line but that's about all i've used it for. 

gonna wait and see on this one. could be the next linked in or facebook. my bet is it will be the next myspace."
2021-06-24 07:32:35,wallstreetbets,"I have not either but it‚Äôll probably be used more once they incorporate mid levels more than they do now. Docs find jobs other ways (currently), I.e recruiters, references. Doesn‚Äôt mean that can‚Äôt change at some point"
2021-06-24 07:39:30,wallstreetbets,"I think it was the start of something new. Often times there are so many patients that no show for various reasons other than being lazy (ie they‚Äôre disabled, too sick, immunocompromised, no transportation, etc.). Once using it, our no shows decreased significantly. We also use it if someone does no show because of one of those reasons and are able to get them back on the schedule. Most insurance providers cover it now and it‚Äôs being used for other healthcare fields like counseling, lactation consultants, even dentist use it."

2021-06-24 12:43:25,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs an IPO, so the assumption is no retail investor is invested yet, which is false -due to the early stock offering to doctors (retail investors) who use their platform. If he/he/Xir came out and disclosed this from the start I wouldn‚Äôt have sounded the alarm."
2021-06-24 07:32:19,wallstreetbets,"What do you mean for Telehealth? Calling patients or other docs?  The telehealth space already feels crowded.

2021-06-24 10:14:01,wallstreetbets,"WISH‚Äôs growth rate looks incredibly tempting. They grew revenue by 35% last year.

However, $WISH lost $745 million last year. Ouch. Worst of all, nearly $400M of that is stock-based compensation to pad the pockets of management, as well as $265m in G&A expenses for their new lofty salaries, a 300% increase in spending from 2019.

So $WISH is burning YOUR cash and diluting shares to grow its revenue. They‚Äôre paying management massive salaries, giving them stock compensation while stockholders suffer losses.

If you completely discount these one off charges from going public, $WISH still has over 200M in EBITDA losses, which doubled over the past year despite revenue only increasing 35%. EBITDA loss margin is expanding which is exactly what you want to avoid in a growing company. The point of owning any growth company, like TSLA who recently reached positive EBITDA, is for the EBITDA loss to increase slower than the revenue or even decrease. This was during covid when basically every ecommerce competitor did better than $WISH.

Bluntly, the company is spending too much. Shares have been squeezed up nearly 100% from the low. There's better opportunities out there than $WISH right now."

2021-06-24 11:28:21,wallstreetbets,CLOV dip is juicy af
2021-06-24 09:42:33,wallstreetbets,"Not analysis, just a small list of facts that make SNDL an intriguing long-term hold, regardless of any possible short-squeeze (expanded from a comment I made over the weekend to another post by a new member of our sub)

1. SNDL has a small investment in Pathway RX, a company that does research into the medical benefits of CBD/THC including the benefits they might produce in fighting the inflammation of the lungs caused by COVID-19

2. SNDL Invested 22 million $ into Indiva edibles

3. 10 % owner of Valens shares who already have an entry into the U.S. Market

4.  Acquired a special purposed vehicle that owns $58.9 million of Zenabis Global's senior secured debt in December 2020

5. Taking over Spirit leaf in July  (MJ retail chain projected to have over 100 store fronts by the end of 2021 - currently have somewhere around 80 stores) 

6. Entered into a JV with SAF called Sunstream Bancorp with a 188 million $ investment 

7. Possess Approximately 1 billion in liquid cash reserves 

8. Zero debt

9. Achieved their first ever positive EBITDA in Q1 2021

10.	As per their investor webpage, ‚ÄúWe have a knowledgeable and talented management team, including industry leaders with experience in consumer packaged goods (CPG) from companies like Kellogg's, General Mills, Molson Coors, Conagra Brands and Mars. This approach sets us apart as we develop our products, our brand and our customer loyalty‚Äù

11.	CEO Zach George has a vast amount of experience working in and with hedge funds. He understands market conditions and how to use them to benefit SNDL‚Äôs investors. He understands how to play the long game, which is exactly what SNDL has been positioning themselves to do since he took over in January 2020. Here‚Äôs a brief synopsis on his career thus far https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/SNDL/company-

12.	A link to their corporate video. If you don‚Äôt find this impressive, then I‚Äôm not sure what to tell you https://www.sndlgroup.com/investors/corporate-video

The acquisition of spirit leaf is huge because now they have a place to exclusively sell their home grown (which is also now testing out at approximately 28% THC), along with also being able to feature Indiva edibles products in a storefront. They now own the means of production and have a deep avenue to sell that production. 

The JV with SAF, plus their huge amount of liquid cash reserves, more or less positions them to be a bank to other MJ throughout the world (think something akin to becoming the Berkshire Hathaway of MJ)

The ownership in Valens gives them a back door entry into the US market before they make an actual upfront entry when legalization finally occurs 

All of the above will eventually work to to absorb the large share float they have. The more companies they invest in via the JV the more valuable that float becomes

SNDL are not an overnight thing, but if you look toward the future, they are vastly more well positioned than any other MJ company for future long term success."

I've attended the shareholder meeting yesterday and it kinda seems like earnings per share will be bad as expected but that the strategy for the company's turnaround is working well. So really depends on what institutional investors want to see.

2021-06-24 13:01:46,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve been anti BB for awhile. But taking a step back away from my puts. BB is a meme stock. It is up 30%+ over the last few months with no real news. Look to GME every time they had done an ER since January. It usually doesn‚Äôt support the price the stock is at and it has a rough day. BB could break the trend if they have great news for the long term because that‚Äôs what investors want. ER can be great and beat EPS but what really pumps stocks is unexpected news now. If they have a hidden deal my puts are fucked.
2021-06-24 13:12:08,wallstreetbets,BB was a fun ride when the hype was there made some good returns. But I don't have much long term hold in BB. Good luck if you do though!

2021-06-24 11:03:38,wallstreetbets,"EPS isn't the only thing that matters. If BB can show that it's turnaround strat is working and they're on their way to stable and increasing revenue that's sufficient to raise the company's value for investors.

Same thing happened with AMD"

I'm not trying to make a short term play so I'm not too worried. I have 90 @ $10.87 but I see this stock being at least $20 EOY. Probably a lot more"

2021-06-24 10:04:24,wallstreetbets,Your own fault for buying after a stock has a 600% run up
2021-06-24 10:08:57,wallstreetbets,"Maybe, maybe not. Every day it‚Äôs down for a while but keeps ending the day a couple points up. Might just need some patience with it."

2021-06-24 10:56:09,wallstreetbets,"TLRY doesn't have the short float like SNDL......

How do you think a meme stock *becomes* a meme stock?"

2021-06-24 10:01:40,wallstreetbets,I have a  theory that anytime a Redditor sees a downvote they automatically pile on regardless of the merits the post may have. That mob mentality is strong here
2021-06-24 07:34:19,wallstreetbets,Boyo I gotta thank you. Im sittin here blurry eyed fresh outta bed and your comment was the first thing I read today. Thanks for the good news! I have a bunch of 1 dollar calls that just blew their load.

2021-06-24 10:03:23,wallstreetbets,Their ceo just updated guidance the analysts have not. We will have an earnings positive surprise.
2021-06-24 10:57:12,wallstreetbets,Because it jumped 8% AH/premarket and all the AH/premarket bulls shit themselves.
2021-06-24 11:09:39,wallstreetbets,No volume would be my guess
2021-06-24 11:14:00,wallstreetbets,nobody has been shorting it dude... there is very little buy interest in the stock.
2021-06-24 11:09:02,wallstreetbets,Holding very strong!!!
2021-06-24 06:33:51,wallstreetbets,Maybe if they actually put the popular tickers instead of their newest p&d targets we wouldnt have this problem.
2021-06-24 09:44:18,wallstreetbets,Literally the worst cannabis stock to own.  Man I can't wait until WSB finds out about MSOs
2021-06-24 09:45:13,wallstreetbets,I think I took that in high school
2021-06-24 08:09:04,wallstreetbets,Bad time to sell :(
2021-06-24 11:12:11,wallstreetbets,I actually grabbed a straddle with +% on PUTS... just in case it does something dumb like rocket up... but I actually expect it to head towards 11 after earnings.

2021-06-24 13:05:03,wallstreetbets,CLF is a buy and hold stock

2021-06-24 13:17:23,wallstreetbets,The chart just formed a huge cup and handle. One famous stock picker just bought a lot of it. Be patient not everything will happen overnight.
2021-06-24 13:16:42,wallstreetbets,How long?
2021-06-24 08:18:41,wallstreetbets,Gotta scoop some options to dump when these apes spike the volatility tho

2021-06-24 09:19:59,wallstreetbets,Yeah I bought that lesson back in January. Went from 5k to 40k on some far OTM BB calls and didn‚Äôt sell on the day that it spiked like crazy.

I think strategies / tactics / psychology."

Huge vertically integrated steel producer based in the USA that will be key for any infrastructure, automobile, construction industry. They're paying down shedloads of debt. The CEO LG is a certified badass and they're making cash hand over fist,fundamentally a sound company and long term hold for me.

Edit: agree it hasnt been talked about much here (it is mentioned) so idk how the algo picked it up"

2021-06-24 15:13:36,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre saying I should buy more then?
2021-06-24 11:06:57,wallstreetbets,But BB is still losing money. The target price and the price prior to bubbling was well below this. Do you think that beating expectations and demonstrating a 'turnaround ' is going to raise the fair price up by like 40%+?
2021-06-24 11:04:48,wallstreetbets,You think it's going to make a >50% jump by EOY? What are you basing this off of? That's like 5 years of return at least for most stocks.

2021-06-24 10:49:26,wallstreetbets,penny stocks are banned... ?
2021-06-24 10:51:08,wallstreetbets,"Go to a penny stock sub, we don't do that here."
2021-06-24 09:14:47,wallstreetbets,I scoff at that..its got another run..$114-$118 top-out. I do wonder how many times i can go to the well on it though
2021-06-24 15:46:40,wallstreetbets,Not with this setting anyway

2021-06-24 08:13:14,wallstreetbets,I can totally see that in WSB lol
2021-06-24 08:15:07,wallstreetbets,"Pro tip: follow multiple ticker trackers that track WSB tickers. Look for similarities and differences between lists and between what you personally see as well. Make your best educated decision off of that. SNDL was barely mentioned at all and I saw GSAT way more times than the WSB ""WSB ticker tracker"" claims.

Also an issue of bots promoting pump and dumps. They have this club now (link in daily discussion) that allows everyone in there to be ignored by automod and they can spam their favorite tickers without being filtered like others because of automod bypass. That's just one of my thoughts though."
2021-06-24 08:56:44,wallstreetbets,Lets compromise on $20 and you got a deal
2021-06-24 08:22:08,wallstreetbets,I think it's a combination of bots and people saying fuck sndl yesterday when it went up 12%
2021-06-24 10:18:48,wallstreetbets,Yup. Major retarded. You shall be our king henceforth!

2021-06-24 07:06:46,wallstreetbets,So longterm then? Not short term
2021-06-24 07:07:31,wallstreetbets,Thank you. I like this response. Ppl acting like its gonna pop off today to FOMO heights
2021-06-24 06:38:06,wallstreetbets,"You mean here? Because there‚Äôs been tons of good DD on it. It‚Äôs an actual profitable company with lots of room to run. Though I‚Äôll admit, I don‚Äôt want to see it in here either."

2021-06-24 12:04:30,wallstreetbets,"Can't argue that.   But high market cap = low price.  Kind of a wash I think except for two things.  One, the barrier to entry for retail investors is very low.  And two, the fact that they used their capital to clean up their balance sheet so when they grow they grow into profit vs growing out of debt.


Of course I'm a knuckle dragging retarded ape who puts mustard on his crayons so I'm probably overlooking a thousand things, but the shares were super cheap so I got some üòÅ"
2021-06-24 08:20:44,wallstreetbets,I agree it‚Äôs a great long term play. The charts don‚Äôt lie. I just think after this infrastructure deal falls through it‚Äôll come back down to earth for a minute. It was actually my first ever stock. It was my free stock on RH back when RH was still a thing. Had it @5.50. Regret not loading up on it!
2021-06-24 10:18:30,wallstreetbets,I just want to make my 50 cents back from this slug
2021-06-24 08:43:54,wallstreetbets,"Only ones I own is clov and wish. Havent touched wkhs.

If you've payed attention, youd see these are the ones being spammed in the main thread much more than SNDL.

I own SNDL lol."
2021-06-24 08:34:32,wallstreetbets,No because those annoying fucks in the daily thread don't stop spamming those tickers!

2021-06-24 15:20:07,wallstreetbets,Depends how big a portion of a fully integrated steel company you would want to own when the US starts taking bids on contracts for major construction projects accross the country.
2021-06-24 11:11:15,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I think that's actually more than fair, at least over the longer term.

Considering that a well adopted cybersecurity provider for electrical vehicles makes a lot more money and sees more growth than a dying patent salesman.

Again, AMD went from 6 to 50 in a relatively short time under the same premise. Although the markets are different, changing from a losing strategy to a new and innovative one in a growing market may warrant quite the change in valuation.

It may not be priced in this earnings, but if they can keep momentum it's really not odd to think they'll be around 20 eoy."
2021-06-24 11:54:12,wallstreetbets,"Well the current price reflects the future more than Q1 earnings.    The future is still bright.  I expect a dip because sell the news, but it will bounce again.  Im guessing anyone holding onto BB as a short term play will be disappointed"
2021-06-24 11:08:35,wallstreetbets,Sounds like your scared cause your not it! Bye!
2021-06-24 11:09:44,wallstreetbets,"I think the stock is extremely undervalued. BB is positioning itself very well in a market without a ton of competition, and people still think it's just an old phone company."
2021-06-24 09:08:32,wallstreetbets,I am good
2021-06-24 09:07:08,wallstreetbets,"I tried something new, i didn't buy the top. Instead i watched and bought a few as it dropped to .89 and when it broke out yesterday AM i got a call and 100 shares. Not much, but it's my first call."
2021-06-24 11:24:04,wallstreetbets,"You kind of missed my point.  AMC is a short term squeeze play.  You should be out of AMC by the time those shares hit the market.

What, are you looking at their long term fundamentals? ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)"
2021-06-24 10:15:16,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm only here because SNDL was specifically mentioned by the MOD. These are the reasons to buy. I‚Äôll cash out of my long term casino play in another year when SNDL will make WSB look foolish for constantly overlooking them.
2021-06-24 10:15:24,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm sorry this is the dumbest thing you can possibly say. I‚Äôm down for making a quick buck, but I‚Äôm sure many of us are also down for long term."
2021-06-24 10:32:27,wallstreetbets,"Terrible company? Maybe in January 2020, but not in June 2021. They‚Äôre a company in the midst of a rather remarkable turn around. They‚Äôre a company that‚Äôs also still pretty new. They‚Äôre not old and outdated like BB and GME."
2021-06-24 09:26:43,wallstreetbets,Nice. I don‚Äôt think I was in SNDL at the right times. Good luck today retards
2021-06-24 10:06:57,wallstreetbets,I do not write for motley fool

2021-06-24 14:02:25,wallstreetbets,I agree with your statement. Tho any surprise in ER would shoot BB up quite significantly. im with him today!
2021-06-24 07:08:48,wallstreetbets,It could. I holding 4000 shares in case it does but I am more LT
2021-06-24 06:43:36,wallstreetbets,No for sure it is! Just saying I haven‚Äôt seen it mentioned enough to be a popular ticker.. shouldn‚Äôt it have like a post every other hour at least
2021-06-24 08:36:52,wallstreetbets,Keep telling yourself that boss
2021-06-24 08:53:08,wallstreetbets,"Ok, you have to assume that. What I meant is the GME showed a sideways movement for a few hours and suddenly it lift off. Then I read that a British HF had closed his positions. So many memes are shorted, positions can't be closed."
2021-06-24 07:31:26,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what you meant lol
2021-06-24 09:35:10,wallstreetbets,"It depends on the expiration. On September, I see clearly min $7 (the premium is $0,3 right now) and on November $8. Obviously, it depends on the sort of investor you are."
2021-06-24 13:35:31,wallstreetbets,I bet we see a buy back in the next year
2021-06-24 13:40:30,wallstreetbets,I like buying around. 77 and selling over 1.22 easy cash üí∏

Anyone whos payed attention sees that those are the ones being spammed."
2021-06-24 10:24:32,wallstreetbets,Yeah I‚Äôve been doing it with 500 shares of wish. It‚Äôs a win-win. I sell CCed at the price I want to sell for profit taking anyway. It goes ITM I make what I wanted to make. It stays OTM I keep the premium. Do it long enough and those WISH shares are basically free. Love it !

2021-06-24 15:21:35,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm already all in. What‚Äôs the name of this bill? Where can I find more info?
2021-06-24 11:34:38,wallstreetbets,Lmao what?
2021-06-24 09:09:07,wallstreetbets,Why feel the need to comment then? Just had to let me know ‚Äúur good‚Äù huh
2021-06-24 11:29:25,wallstreetbets,Short term squeeze play where the shares are being constantly diluted. Shouting $500k/share at the top of your lungs will help you get there. Keep trying ü§°ü§°
2021-06-24 12:16:41,wallstreetbets,By that point in time AMC may well be a good investment for entirely different reasons.  I hope they pull through this as a strong company who never lets any hedge fund employee watch movies again.
2021-06-24 10:16:05,wallstreetbets,Amen

2021-06-24 10:33:44,wallstreetbets,"What, because they diluted the shit out of the stock to get rid of their crippling debt? Sure, the company is in better financial shape, but at the expense of its shareholders. No thanks."
2021-06-24 08:05:29,wallstreetbets,a Pittsburgh native?

2021-06-24 15:52:41,wallstreetbets,Yea thats right but 1 year are no long term

2021-06-24 15:35:54,wallstreetbets,"Ya ok. Nobody is going to help make your bags lighter, but you can keep trying."
2021-06-24 10:39:17,wallstreetbets,I agree. 2023 is my estimate as to when we'll see ~$50 holding steady.
2021-06-24 19:14:57,wallstreetbets,"I think I found the answer. It depends on how the number was calculated as GAAP vs non GAAP. It seems like GAAP is the better way to calculate, so it might be fair to say they beat expectations (technically). I don't know much about accounting, so I can really say much about the implications though."

2021-06-24 12:30:12,wallstreetbets,"You're right.  It could be a long term play to evaluate after things settle down.

I wouldn't put money in now for the long term.  Money in now is for the squeeze up to the moon, cash out your tendies, and then maybe invest after it bottoms out again."

2021-06-24 10:36:07,wallstreetbets,"True, but that dilution was for a purpose. Believe what you‚Äôd like. The above list I put together are facts, not opinions. You can take them for what you want. I prefer a company like SNDL that has forward looking vision of what the MJ sector is going to need. ZG remade them into a wholly unique MJ company."

2021-06-24 15:02:03,wallstreetbets,You can't even own shares under Communism where the State owns all industry.  Anyone seriously supporting Communism yet living in a free society is a sublime idiot (not saying you.... unless you're a Commie).
2021-06-24 07:12:34,wallstreetbets,I think if it hits over 18 today the shorts will be done on Friday and you will see  another Friday spike late that could get outrageous. Again depends on volumes.  Keep in mind I bet big last Friday and nothing happened but me losing my money.
2021-06-24 10:29:32,wallstreetbets,Haha yeah gotta fund my degeneracy!

I do respect Mayfields passion and swagger but long term I‚Äôm bullish on Burrow. At least we both hate the Steelers"
2021-06-24 08:52:20,wallstreetbets,I'm just saying... i'd bet on SNDL getting to $2 before TLRY gets to $40

2021-06-24 15:50:47,wallstreetbets,Haha bro You're just so grumpy because your girlfriend fucks your boss and he still only pays you 6 dollars per hour
2021-06-24 07:19:23,wallstreetbets,Wow wow wow I never said it was a safe stock.  It is not. It‚Äôs high risk high reward. And if this this thing hits 100 I will cease to be LT. If it goes that low  I think it will rebound with results or contracts.

2021-06-24 16:16:00,wallstreetbets,Good luck!!

The more shares locked away the smaller the float and more fuel for the pops.  I thought the next rally would be +24%.  Now I'm thinking higher.  The market is forward looking.

2021-06-24 10:14:07,wallstreetbets,"WISH‚Äôs growth rate looks incredibly tempting. They grew revenue by 35% last year.

However, $WISH lost $745 million last year. Ouch. Worst of all, nearly $400M of that is stock-based compensation to pad the pockets of management, as well as $265m in G&A expenses for their new lofty salaries, a 300% increase in spending from 2019.

So $WISH is burning YOUR cash and diluting shares to grow its revenue. They‚Äôre paying management massive salaries, giving them stock compensation while stockholders suffer losses.

If you completely discount these one off charges from going public, $WISH still has over 200M in EBITDA losses, which doubled over the past year despite revenue only increasing 35%. EBITDA loss margin is expanding which is exactly what you want to avoid in a growing company. The point of owning any growth company, like TSLA who recently reached positive EBITDA, is for the EBITDA loss to increase slower than the revenue or even decrease. This was during covid when basically every ecommerce competitor did better than $WISH.

Bluntly, the company is spending too much. Shares have been squeezed up nearly 100% from the low. There's better opportunities out there than $WISH right now."

They have been, and will continue to, maneuvering the company to capture a growing slice of revenue from several sectors within the EV ecosystem.

This is a no brainer investment - the world-wide momentum around EV and its infrastructure will only continue to grow.  Positions: 2500 shares (planning to buy more), 7/16 & 10/16 calls."

Sadly, the apes were sold as slaves to Elon Musk‚Äôs emergency predecessor, and used for new SpaceX experiments. One ape was resold by a lower level engineer to rocket lab (VACQ) for a low orbit launch just days before the first alien invasion of July 18th, 2021 and still orbits our home planet of Earth to this day in 3492.*"

15¬†As evening approached, the autistics came to him and said, ‚ÄúThis is a risky play, and the company is trading at 1000 PE. Send the Boomers to buy XOM/BA/INTC/GE so that they may go live on 3% yield.‚Äù

U.S. Orphazyme deposit stocks rose 61% on June 16, then fell for the next three days. The bank did not respond to Insider's request for comment on the matter.  
The stock has been on a wild ride since June 10, when it jumped 1,387% in a single trading day. The company rose to popularity on Reddit's Wall Street Bets that day, though some retail traders questioned whether the trade was a hedge fund pump and dump."

When you WISH upon a star,
Makes no difference who you are.
Anything your heart desires,
Will come to you
If your heart is in your dream,
No request is too extreme!!
When you WISH upon a star,
As dreamers do
Fate is kind,
She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of
Their secret longing.
Like a bolt out of the blue,
Fate steps in and sees you through!!!
When you WISH upon a star
Your dreams come true!!

EDIT. 

""When You Wish Upon a Star"" is a song written by Leigh Harline and Ned Washington for Walt Disney's 1940 adaptation of Pinocchio.[1] The original version was sung by Cliff Edwards in the character of Jiminy Cricket."

The return on investment is higher with the batteries in the cars, but surplus production can be used for energy arbitrage using autobidder. Tesla‚Äôs secret ‚Äúgambit‚Äù Company in Texas is definitely not the only one. Zero chance. Why so secret? the amount of pushback they will get will be absolutely enormous if they start really publicizing what they stated goal is. Right now you only really hear it from Youtubers‚Ä¶ But the ability to store energy gives you the ability to control the price of energy. Tesla can essentially, overtime, control the price of energy via storage capacity. they will arbitrage this while not being responsible for grid upkeep or generation. It‚Äôs a pretty sweet situation but it could backfire heavily when it becomes more publicly known to the extent to which this program is expanding, it will be fought. Imagine Tesla taking in energy at night very cheaply, then distributing it during the most profitable part of the day, early to late afternoon. This will bankrupt grid owners and create hundreds of billions of dollars of stranded generation assets."

Here's one. $FATE

They are the leader in 3rd gen cell therapy for cancer. They use engineered stem cells that can be gene edited unlimited times, then split into natural killer cells (and standard t-cells also), which may as well be cancer slaying nanobots. You inject them, and they go around rampaging on tumors, and patients typically have very minor side effects - very mild compared to any chemo.

Their early results look real good - no safety issues, causing strong remissions in a lot of patients at their lower doses with earlier versions that have less gene edits.

They are $8b market cap, but they are the frontrunner, and if they crack solid tumors they could easily be worth 100b+. 

Right now, they are showing good phase 1 results on liquid blood cancers with earlier versions of their tech. They soon branch into solid which are a big test, but I'm enthusiastic.

Their competitors have similar products, but they either have safety issues, or can't be gene edited much, have horrible margins/feasibility, or are just straight up behind (e.g. IPSC which is also fine, but earlier).

Did you know that the average American uses 1 roll per day? For a family of four that's nearly 29 rolls per week. you might call it asinine or irrational, but for the members of our society that are the most competent thinkers among us, the toilet paper hoarding we saw in the early days of the pandemic is seen as a highly rational run on the most valuable survival resource known to man. Imagine if you will, if you were LITERALLY out of toilet paper? what would you do? use leaves? a red neck bidet (garden hose in the pooper)? just leave it be? with a smelly anus, how do you expect to interact with others? you think you'll be welcomed into other survival communities smelling like that? And it's not just for wiping up hershy squirts. Toilet paper can be used to build a shelter, as rope to scale a building or cliff, or lay down 4-5 plys about 15 ft long, place a rock in the middle and grab both ends to weaponize your roll for killing bears or members of other rival tribes.

Would they function analogous to regular shares during a buyback, with the ADR‚Äôs being purchased and absorbed by the company alongside the underlying stock at the set ratio of stock/ADR?

**OR,** Would the company typically only purchase shares on the underlying‚Äôs home exchange, with the value left to ‚Äútrickle through‚Äù to the ADRs? Carrying it out this way makes sense to me, since the whole point of ADR‚Äôs is to gain access to liquidity in the US markets.

If that‚Äôs the case, would/is a different approach typically taken by companies for whom the majority of their daily trading volume occurs via their ADR‚Äôs (i.e., TX)? It seems like it would be a little odd for a buyback to occur on an exchange where only a fraction of the total dollar volume trades.

Any help or experience with this is greatly appreciated - it‚Äôs not a question that‚Äôs easily Googled lol.

I  made some profit and sold on its early climb after IPO thinking the  growth isn't sustainable, which it was bc it crashed into 70s from $175. After the crash I kept buying here and there but now it seems like its gaining momentum again.

I'm a big VR/AR bull so I naturally like Unity. Although I'm not exactly sure how I should grasp around 30B valuation. I tried to think the valuation should be somewhat similar to Autodesk(60B) since they both serve as a development/blueprint tool one for engineering and other for game/VR. 

Any thoughts on recent movement or company itself?

My position is 40 stocks cost average of $104."

2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CNK looks like a win-win CNK ""Cinemark Holdings, Inc"" has rallied as a sympathy play off that other movie chain. With ~20% short interest and a 6.5 short ratio - possibly the same bettors against AMC - the squeeze is still juicy.

There's much more going for it beneath the surface though.

Unlike many entertainment and event businesses, CNK did not need to dilute during the COVID downturn, and in fact recently re-financed some nearer-term debt to long-term leaving it with ample cash ($4.42/sh or 19% mkt cap today, current est) to pursue growth/acquisition (mentioned during earnings) or be liquid enough to grind out a slow re-opening.

EBITDA for FY19 (pre-COVID) was $745M on $3.3B revenue with an Enterprise Value (EV) of $6.4B (2019, 10-yr median is roughly $5.5B). Compare that to AMC with $716M EBITDA on $5.4B revenue with an EV of $10.9B.

So CNK was a cheaper/less indebted business that produces higher EBITDA on lower revenue. Check check check. (If EV isn't your flavor, they have net +$1.1B assets long term as of 3/31/21 vs -$2.2B for AMC.)

With their solid financial position, CNK is already considering when they can re-instate a dividend, which was 4% pre-COVID. (2Q22 target for me.)

CNK has also had long-term interest in E-Sports and Gaming partnerships, and their PR in June sent set off a nice spike, which is a good test for the theory that it's set up to run on a good catalyst. I personally believe the Gaming segment will reach parity with the motion picture segment in the long run as gaming is now a more prominent form of entertainment and the typical theater setup can be augmented in creative ways (4D, VR arcade, high-margin beverage and food offerings, large events).

I think fundamentally, CNK is well-managed, well-positioned for the near and long term, and presently undervalued.

Things get even more interesting when you consider the price action over the last 6 months, in steady uptrend with occasional spikes. Price broke above a large bull flag at the end of May, and then broke a falling wedge today on strong opening and closing volume. This wedge break was after a few daily hammers that seem to indicate a bounce off a demand zone aka sellers are exhausted. Commons were a great entry at 21.40 this week.

The most enticing Risk-Reward seems to be in longer-term options due to the low Implied Volatility (IV). It's been around 56 which is 80% lower than AMC. This means the option premiums are much lower than AMC. Which means your ""bet"" on CNK costs a lot less. Also, call options appear to be sweeping for a couple of weeks now, including Jul 25C, 30C, Dec 25C, 30C, and Jan 25C, 30C.

The last angle I have is this: money is flowing from one squeeze play to the next, and since CNK hasn't squeezed yet, I believe it can benefit either in sympathy to a big AMC squeeze OR if AMC craters and folks plunge into #CNKCHIMPS. The possibility is there for a massive trend and squeeze to start.

I'm long CNK and have an IWM short hedge."

Bull Case for Wish
1. Growing incredibly fast. 
2. Impressive revenue numbers. 
3. Gamify shopping 
4. Incentive people with daily login discounts. Also to keep buying things by offering games, and gambling spins for a % discount on deals
5. Targets a younger audience
6. Cost conscience audience
7. Impulse purchases
8. International platform
9. 40% of revenue from USA 
10. 40% of revenue from Europe 
11. Merchants from all over the international world 
12. Advertising program for merchants
13. Logistics program for merchants
14. Asset light approach
15. THE NAME (it‚Äôs EASY to remember) 
16. New partnerships so they don‚Äôt have to rely only on their sellers from China. 
17. 350k+ new sellers from Latin American countries 
18. Expanding in Africa
19. Partnerships in USA will cut down on shipment time, and product quality issues. Already starting to see a shift. 
20. With the hiring of Jacqueline Reses from Square. Wish might provide financial services to the underbanked and merchants they serve in the future. 

Price/Sales comparison with other E-commerce Companies 

Wish 2.9
Ebay 4
Jmia 17
Meli 15.55 
Amzn 4.22
Pins 23.39 
Shop 55.09 
Posh 12.11
Etsy 12.42 

As you can see Wish P/S is significantly lower than its competitors. On 12/31/2020 WISH P/S was 4.37. Wish is trading at only 56% of the    P/S value it was in December. 


Over the past 12 months Wish has generated almost 3B in revenue. 

Wish is projected to become profitable in December of 2023 according to analysts projections. 

Revenue Estimates Year End | YOY Growth | FWD Price/Sales
Dec 2021 3.32B | 30.59% 2.13
Dec 2022 3.81B | 14.82% 1.85
Dec 2023 4.49B | 17.85% 1.57
Dec 2024 5.24B | 16.76% 1.35 
Dec 2025 5.99B | 14.20% 1.18 
Dec 2026 7.40B | 23.62% .95
Dec 2027 8.38B | 13.18% .84 
Dec 2028 9.43B |12.58% .75 

There is no arguing that thing is MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE than a lot of the other 
e-commerce stocks out there. 

I like that there is no debt and almost 2 Billion in the bank. 

I think that the product quality, and delivery time will become better for the consumer over the next 12 months based on recent hires, and partnerships. 

Wish local allows the buyer to save money by picking up at one of the wish local locations and allows the small businesses to have an extra revenue stream. 
Wish boost (sellers can boost their products for a certain amount of time. Similar to tinder or bumble for all you horny fucks out there)

Google trends. Wish is trending more THAN DOUBLE what it was in Jan-April. 

Because of this I expect wish to have strong revenue, and user growth for this upcoming quarter. 

I like the stock. This is not financial advise. I‚Äôm just an ape ü¶ß"

Again, I like the company so don‚Äôt get me wrong. Just wondering if p/s ratio is as useful considering the differences in their particular approaches to e-commerce, or if some other indicators might be a better focus. Just opening discussion because I genuinely do not know for sure."

2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Russell Reconstitution and why I believe $RIDE is the best play to capture gains TL;DR: üöÄüöÄ from forced ETF purchases.  If you don‚Äôt care about supply and demand economics, just stop reading, buy some fucking $RIDE and buckle up.  It‚Äôs about to get wild. 


1. Russell reconstitution will cause $75 - $115M in forced purchases by ETF‚Äôs that follow Russell indexes.  This will happen Friday - next week. 


2. Few other stocks have been as beaten down by media / short sellers over the last 6 months.  Granted $RIDE has had its fair share of hiccups, but GM owns 7.5% of the company, WKHS owns 10%, they have a 6 million sq foot production facility, manufacturing equipment, and vehicles. (List goes on and on) 


3. $RIDE has had a complete whirlwind the last 12 months, SPAC, üöÄ to $30, down to $13, üöÄ back to $30, down to $7, and here we are today at $11.  Anybody that is left holding today has no incentive to sell to the index. People continuing to hold at this point have been through the ringer, and they‚Äôre 3 months out from production.  Why would they sell now?  Aside from CEO and forward progress with vehicles, nothing fundamentally has changed since when it was hitting 20‚Äôs and 30‚Äôs earlier this year and late 2020. In fact they‚Äôre closer to production, with Betas and crash test rating approvals.  Again, why sell now?  When ETF‚Äôs are forced to purchase to follow the index, they have to buy those shares from someone willing to sell.  If nobody wants to sell and wants to see this through, we‚Äôre going to see fireworks. üöÄüöÄ


4. Undervalued compared to other EV companies that are not nearly as far along. NKLA $6B? Canoo $2B no facility? Rivian $70B pre revenue?‚Ä¶ if $Ride captures a 10% valuation of Rivian, we‚Äôre looking at an SP of $40 


5. High valuation going into the index ranking day ~ $1.8B.  This is a decently new phenomenon with large companies getting added to the index as opposed to growing up into the index (I.e. WKHS).  This is because SPAC‚Äôs aren‚Äôt included in the index until they have completed their mergers. 

Other SPAC‚Äôs are also getting added in, also at high valuations, but out of all the others, $RIDE seems to be most undervalued with the strongest base of support.  Why sell now?‚Ä¶ 

Some others that are getting rolled in, and why they may not see as strong of results: 

RIOT / MARA: heavily tied to the price of ‚Äúalt currencies‚Äù.  If the index throws this out of whack compared to ‚Äúalt currency‚Äù price, people will sell 

CLOV: $34M of revenue & $4B valuation.  Short squeeze possible, WSB loves this stock, why not get both? 

SKLZ: Has anyone used this platform to make money?  It preys on low income gambling addictions. 

GOEV: facility?‚Ä¶ production‚Ä¶? 

Nikola: overvalued‚Ä¶? Production?‚Ä¶ facility / timeline?


Long story short, this slingshot seemed primed and ready to rocket back up to $30. Throw short interest on top of all this, and we can have a very exciting next couple of weeks ahead of us. Plus all the long term action of getting in early 

Obligatory: 2,000 shares + 450 7/2 $20C"

2021-06-24 13:59:56,wallstreetbets,"RIDE is better than FSR, but that's not saying much. RIDE likes touting they have the third largest facility in America, but that comes at a huge operational expense that is completely unnecessary. Anyone could've bought the factory, which they bought for a mere $20m. When you buy the factory, you also buy the baggage that comes along with it. You buy the tax situation that GM was fighting with the State of Ohio, you buy the aging equipment, you buy the enormous tax/maintenance expense and etc. The equipment isn't coming until August, so what exactly did they buy?

What concerns me about RIDE is that they've had very little testing and validation of their product. They're rushing a process that could take years and whittling it down to a few months, not because they have the talent that can, but moreso it's the unrealistic expectations of Steve Burns. They have virtually no engineering and no IP. What's so special about a partsbin truck where they buy motors from Elaphe and pair it to the previous generation Silverado chassis? Tech companies are valued for their IP and their innovation, which Lordstown has none.

A better play would be Canoo / GOEV. They've engineered everything in-house from their chassis, bodies to even their own motors (which is a huge deal). Their drivetrain efficiency (miles/kwh) is on-par with the likes of Tesla and Lucid, this beats VW, Nissan and etc. Canoo is taking a two prong approach where their first vehicles will be built by VDL Nedcar, a world class contract manufacturer who is currently manufacturing the Mini Cooper and BMW X1. In parallel, they're building a plant in Oklahoma, which after months of negotiation, received a $300m incentive package from the State of Oklahoma. 

GOEV will also be included in the Russell 3000. The volume and constant buying pressure could cause a squeeze, since it has the highest short interest (38%), utilization (99.39%) and borrowing rate (25%) out of almost all EV SPACs.

Lordstown is starting with a traditional body and strapping batteries on to it. This makes it a traditional company.

>Lordstown is starting with a traditional body and strapping batteries on to it.

This is how I know you're clueless. Lordstown has created a brand new chassis from the ground up, and it is designed to be modular with respect to body style. The fact that the body looks like a traditional truck is meaningless, except it was done intentionally so LMC and customers can leverage Silverado OEM parts."
2021-06-24 04:04:47,wallstreetbets,What's interesting about RIDE's production line is that the machinery for the motors won't even arrive at the facility until sometime in August. They are still advertising a September starting line üôÉüôÉüôÉ I won't be surprised to hear the delay news

The Russell inclusion!  ETF‚Äôs are forced to purchase shares to match the index. $RIDE was included in the index this year. 

WKHS was last year, go look at WKHS price from June 23rd 2020 - July 2 2020 when they were added to the index. 

Created a new higher floor for the stock value.  And that was 1/3 of the purchasing power we anticipate for $RIDE"

2021-06-24 07:14:12,wallstreetbets,Lordstown Motors met with Trump and showed off the truck in front of the white house so it's really not that far-fetched when you consider how childish those people are.
2021-06-24 19:19:03,wallstreetbets,WKHS has way more potential for sure.....
2021-06-24 19:28:27,wallstreetbets,"Not a crowded space. In fact at the moment, there are exactly 0 electric trucks available. GM and Ford are years out from offering base model electric trucks, Lordstown is months. There is space, and with enough time, Lordstown's only product isn't going to be the truck. They have an RV/Van/Military Vehicle in the works. The innovation of Lordstown is the skateboard with hub motors. Very short-sighted to look at this as a company making one product that will inevitably be taken over by Ford/GM."
2021-06-24 01:01:53,wallstreetbets,"My bad that was a type, its 18 months, theyll start production in 2023. It shows you barely looked into all of these companies blinded by confirmation bias"
2021-06-24 17:04:54,wallstreetbets,"I've mentioned it twice, because there are two issues with the taxes. There's the $28m that GM was ordered to pay the state of Ohio which GM might get RIDE to pay. The second issue is the on-going taxes for a plant of that size, that's not needed. There's perpetual expenses for an oversized facility, instead of a right-sized facility. This is a huge problem for a company with an on-going concern of meeting their capital needs.

Your bread and butter, the hub motor, is owned by someone else? That doesn't make RIDE valuable, instead, it makes Elaphe valuable. Any modifications in design to Elaphe's motors will require extensive testing which could costs hundreds of millions. You don't buy something to modify it, you buy something that's been perfected and validated so you don't have to do it yourself.

As far as the W-15 platform, it was designed as an hybrid, not a fully electric vehicle. The issue with any electromodded vehicle is that they never perform as well as one where it's design was intended for it. Case in point, the W-15's initial plan was a 60kWh battery, whereas the Endurance has a 109 kWh battery. The additional batteries throws off weight distribution, handling, adds additional stress to a chassis not designed for it and etc. Not paying attention to deal and rushing a product to production will be the downfall for Lordstown; resulting from massive recalls or lawsuits from negligence.

Edit: Don't get me started on WKHS. Total failure of a company. Some of us made more money at our day jobs, than Workhorse generated in revenue in past years. They're no longer a start-up; they've had 10+ years to prove themselves. Anything that Steve Burns touches is done half-assed. Getting rid of him was a step in the right direction of making RIDE remotely investable."
2021-06-24 14:43:32,wallstreetbets,">The factory doesnt allow customisations and high volumes at the same time.  


EV incumbments that are hoping to emulate vehicle sales in 100's of thousands by manufacturing the same or limited models are in for a rude shock. They will need to offer deep customisations in order to go beyond 10,000 sales. The customizatios can be such as bed length options, body style options and interior arrangement options. 

But to do these customizations and be able to sell high volume will mean that EV incumbents will need to do something that no other OEM has done so far including Tesla. They will have to take up microfactory model which allows customization and interconnnect multiple microfactories with a Tesla style production line to deliver on this outcome. Arrival and Canoo are the only EV startups that are moving in this way.

EV startups cannot just sell one or limited options models in millions and achieve financial nirvana. 

&#x200B;

>Lordstown is starting with a traditional body and strapping batteries on to it.

It might be designed from scratch but still is designed in a traditional way. Did they reduce 35% parts because its an electric powetrain? Did they reuse more that 25% of parts as EV powertrain makes that possible? Did they incorporate majority of the critical and crash components in the platform so that it opens various advantages related to custimizations. You can enlighten me on these but i think the answer is NO for lordstown and yes for Canoo and Arrival."
2021-06-24 06:04:19,wallstreetbets,"Not to mentioned they havent really tested their beta product enough.

We dont know what they did about the fire that gutted the beta and took a long time to douse.

They dont event care about a gamma phase which is supposed to incoroporate limited user feedback before plunging to production."
2021-06-24 07:50:09,wallstreetbets,The company and independent contributors have stated that a month is sufficient time for set up.

2021-06-24 09:11:35,wallstreetbets,WKHS is about to explode. We horses know that and the numbers speak for itself. BUT Ride will benefit from beeing added to the index and this means a nice gain. So OP got a point.
2021-06-24 01:19:19,wallstreetbets,"One - wasn‚Äôt calling him a boomer.  I was thanking the boomers for buying ETF‚Äôs. They have created this phenomenon we‚Äôre about to experience of forced demand pressure from ETF‚Äôs.  This is not pump and dump, this is supply and demand economics.  

This company currently has zero debt, with one of the easiest markets to finance debt.  Sure, dilution can happen. It can happen to any company.  They‚Äôre in discussions with ATVM loan (treasury rates), and hosting an entire investor week this week to showcase assets / truck performance and facilities. 

You‚Äôre also right, Burns appeared to lie / falsify pre-orders (100k), but the independent research committee has reconfirmed enough pre orders to satisfy 2021 and 2022 production (22,000 vehicles ~ $1B in revenue). 

‚ÄúAlmost broke‚Äù - they have $500M in cash, and reconfirmed cash to last through May 2022, with production at 50% of capacity without any additional funding. (Go look at financials yourself) 

So what they have to pay combined $1M - not even sure where you heard this.  Regardless that makes up 0.2% of remaining cash. 

Shareholder lawsuit - definitely FUD.  Have you seen the companies running that scam shit? 

Also it is called ‚ÄúGoing Concern‚Äù not ‚ÄúOngoing concern‚Äù.  This is literally a check mark they have to check if certain criteria are met. [you should check out going concern definition here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goingconcern.asp)

They have $500M, they‚Äôre producing vehicles whether you like it or not."
2021-06-24 02:23:19,wallstreetbets,"i think its interesting that you really have a LOT of detail to present on the negative aspects - like you'd have to have read all their press releases and amended statements including the severance terms of the CEO and CFO to know that. You are correct, that is where those payments to them was reported.  That's some fine print reading for someone who's just ""casually interested"" and backing up some FUD.

But after all that scrutiny, you failed to pick up on the even newer amended statement that they have operating capital to last through May 2022 and the expectation they'll have produced 20k units by then.

then to categorize this DD as 'pump and dump' when its obviously not that, in fact its some damn astute observations if you ask me.  It makes me wonder why you're trying so hard to paint the negatives.

I hear there's a LOT of retailers shorting this stock and the hedge funds are easing out leaving them alone in that risk.  Might you be one of those?"
2021-06-24 12:43:29,wallstreetbets,"I did not say anything about that either.  I do see lots of bears spouting out that they do not have enough money to last to the end of this year, which is not what they said.  They have enough to last to the end of May 2022 right now, which is less than 12 months, hence the going concern verbiage."
2021-06-24 07:16:58,wallstreetbets,"Guess I shouldn‚Äôt be surprised the CEO and CFO dipped then, that actually aligns perfectly with trumps business ideals"

You‚Äôre telling me you have the patience to ride out a production facility that‚Äôll take 18 months to create?  This is the most fucked labor market we have ever had.  Especially with STEM shortages.  This just seems like more of a long shot, with a lot more uncertainty.  A physical 6 million square foot facility that was previously the third most productive in the US is pretty fucking compelling to me."

What I take issue with is that the same, shitty, companies keep getting regurgitated. Ones that are on life support. I did some research on the company when someone else tried to get people to buy this, frankly, shit company. It‚Äôs not shit because of the car or the factory, it‚Äôs shit because of their corporate governance and their leadership. Most of this shit was reported on by reputable newspapers like the WSJ like the fact that they lied about their pre order numbers, it‚Äôs not like people have to dig deep. Also where did I say I was ‚Äúcasually‚Äù interested? I thought this was a great bear opportunity in fact. Do you understand that even if they produce the cars, they don‚Äôt have customers and ford has a competing offering that is being manufactured before Lordstown and it‚Äôs cheaper. Finally, people are going to be hesitant to buy this company because this company might not be able to service their trucks if they go bankrupt, not to mention they don‚Äôt have economies of scale to deal with either the chip shortage or the sky high steel and aluminum prices lol."

2021-06-24 01:41:44,wallstreetbets,Theres 25k oi thats itm fo 7/16. And about 70% hedged so I would say theyd have to buy about 700k+ shares to pay out

Just checked, $RIDE has 100k OI for $25 strike and below.  My thesis supports a price between $20 and $30 purely from Russell inclusion‚Ä¶ let alone any other catalysts, and gamma / short squeeze.

2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$TLRY I mentioned yesterday that there was a fake wall appearing at $17.51 when $TLRY hit near $17.40. (Do not worry, I posted evidence of this post below for you to see). The wall would go away anytime price would come down after the rejection. I said that there was accumulation occurring and sure enough, as I said, today that wall disappeared. $SNDL had a great day and $TLRY also pushed above $18 level. Huge orders again today for $TLRY. These runs will continue into coming days and weeks. Like I said, regarding Juneteenth stocks that went 500%, I expect this kind of potential leading up into federal legalization. $TLRY is the worlds largest weed company and has at least a 10% short interest. Not going to tell you to buy or sell, I am not a financial advisor. Just my own personal opinion based on research and reading these charts. Just want my fellow apes to be in for the run up to legalization.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o5tndm/watch_tlry/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Not sure if it is still showing for everyone else. I want everyone to have success here! There is plenty of reason to be bullish on weed in general, I just think $TLRY has the best shot of being huge!

2ND EDIT: I am receiving PM‚Äôs from some of you, trying to respond promptly. I never expected anyone to pay attention to what I post here. Thank you for that! I don‚Äôt want to mislead anyone and I am receiving messages about buying. To save my inbox, the chart is technically good and the catalysts are there. Do with it what you please! I think many of us believe in weed, think revenue in Colorado after legalization, the federal government wants a piece of this. How else do we pay for stimulus packages?

3RD EDIT: This is unbelievable the response here. Even for those who have a bearish outlook on $TLRY, I respect that too. We‚Äôre here to share information and thoughts. Want to point that out to those waking up today and reading this. I hope this information helps someone and if you have criticism share it! Again, I am not a financial advisor. My goal here is to share my own personal opinion based on what I have learned trading. Hope you all kill it out there today!"

2021-06-24 06:51:23,wallstreetbets,"I responded to inner_attorney as well. It is a bull thesis because it helps the ticker move in a bullish direction faster when shorts are trying to cover. Do not think of this as main catalyst and again, not a financial advisor, buy or sell at own risk."

2021-06-24 06:49:40,wallstreetbets,"Good morning, it does apply as a bull thesis. I do respond to criticism and I actually welcome it. I am not a financial advisor and I will not recommend you buy or sell. I posted the info for everyone to see, you do with it what you want. Let me respond to this. The short thesis is technically a bullish catalyst, but do not think of this as the most important catalyst. Think this, not only would you get a run from something like legalization but near 10% of the float is short. Short floats can really make a ticker move. I will reiterate again, this is not financial advice. Just a reason to watch $TLRY and why I think it has potential. Everyone, including myself, buys or sells at our own risk. Also want to add, the whole point of WSB is to share trading ideas. That‚Äôs simply what I did, I have seen you comment about SPCE, which has $0 in current revenue. Doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a bad idea, you just see the potential, right?"
2021-06-24 09:26:39,wallstreetbets,"Not every stock that‚Äôs shorted is gonna short squeeze, those are extremely rare and only happens to stocks with high short interest and a major catalyst. Every stock is shorted to some degree."
2021-06-24 12:03:42,wallstreetbets,"The point of my comment was to point out the amount of time you‚Äôve been on WSB and the content you‚Äôve posted. You‚Äôve posted 4/4 posts about the same exact ticker. It‚Äôs one thing to see potential and post your DD but it‚Äôs another thing to spam post a ticker. 


As for $SPCE, sure they have low revenue, definitely not $0 lol, but they are valued at that revenue price. It is a company on the market that is pioneering through an industry that has never been done before in the history of man kind. Couldn‚Äôt be a better investment."
2021-06-24 10:56:10,wallstreetbets,Please take a look lol
2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why $WISH for something you already have? $BABA DD Tl;Dr: BABA is the preferred alternative to WISH from a value/fundamentals perspective.

$WISH and $BABA both excel in selling chinese shit to american consumers. $WISH‚Äôs growth rate looks incredibly tempting. They grew revenue by 35% last year. 

However, $WISH lost $745 million last year. Ouch. Worst of all, nearly $400M of that is stock-based compensation to pad the pockets of management, as well as $265m in G&amp;A expenses for their new lofty salaries, a 300% increase in spending from 2019.

So $WISH is burning YOUR cash and diluting shares to grow its revenue. They‚Äôre paying management massive salaries, giving them stock compensation while stockholders suffer losses.

Wouldn‚Äôt you rather get the same exposure and performance from a company making money?

Let‚Äôs take a look at $BABA.

TTM Revenue $110B

TTM FCF $34.5B

TTM FCF growth 20%

TTM Revenue growth 40% vs. $WISH 35%

5 year average Revenue growth 45%

3 year average FCF growth 30%, $AAPL 20%, S&amp;P 25%

Price/TTM FCF 16.5x, $AAPL 23.7x, S&amp;P 25.5x, $WISH has no FCF.

Price/TTM FCF/3yr growth .5-.85, $AAPL 1.2, S&amp;P 1

Market cap $572B

Book value $150B

Bear Case: Assuming company maintains current FCF and dies in 20 years, generates $680B cash for shareholders. $680B + $150B book value = undervalued by $250B

Bull case: Company maintains 20% FCF growth for 10 years, $213B in FCF by 2031, generates $3000B over 20 years for shareholders = undervalued by $2500B

5-year DCF model using 5 yr averages with a 8% discount rate and 2% perpetual growth/10yr yield puts this stock at $350.

Oh, and all these valuations assume no Ant group IPO, which alibaba could own a $50B stake in. Not to mention the massive moat and diversity in revenue stream for $BABA.

No need to $WISH for gains or growth. They‚Äôre already here in $BABA."

2021-06-24 04:08:06,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm in WISH too, but BABA is clearly the master play.  It‚Äôs at such a low price only because of psychological reasons, it‚Äôs a great opportunity."
2021-06-24 00:11:02,wallstreetbets,Stock based compensation is by definition not burning cash. It‚Äôs a non cash expense that does not hit free cash flow. Many IPO‚Äôs have large stock based compensation in their first public quarter (see Pinterest for example). It‚Äôs very typical. And much of the rest of the 2020 Wish loss relates to refunds & other pandemic disruptions related to supply chain issues. All of that was a 1 time event in 2020. They‚Äôre improving the bottom line over time. JP Morgan forecasts EBITDA breakeven in 2022 & other analysts see positive EPS in 2023. It‚Äôs about operating leverage. Keep growing the top line while keeping costs under control little by little every year & the bottom line explodes.
2021-06-24 00:56:39,wallstreetbets,But $WISH has ~30% short interest so I am here just for the squeez
2021-06-24 00:09:09,wallstreetbets,"First of all you sound stupid with the stock based compensation talk. That‚Äôs normal for every company that goes public. It‚Äôs a one time expense.

$wish is just starting to grow and expand. $wish has a 8b dollar market compared to baba‚Äôs 500b. Wish could easily double and triple your investment as they grow. 

Also, baba, I agree that it is undervalued but I wouldn‚Äôt touch it. The Chinese government could shut them down and break up the company if they want."
2021-06-24 00:01:54,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm getting out of Baba. Tumbles everytime the Chinese govt meddles with it.

2021-06-24 00:14:25,wallstreetbets,"They haven‚Äôt been cutting the bottom line at all though. Expenses are scaling faster than revenue growth, losses compounding at a faster rate. Even when you exclude the one off items. EBITDA loss went from 127m in 2019 to 217m in 2020, nearly a 100% jump but revenues only increased 34% YoY."
2021-06-24 00:10:53,wallstreetbets,"If you think $BABA can‚Äôt 4x, you‚Äôre mistaken. It‚Äôs about 1/4th the market cap of $AMZN with the same FCF and FCF growth."

2021-06-24 00:48:21,wallstreetbets,"Independently audited by the Hong Kong wing of PWC, a PCAOB certified and big 4 auditor. Doubt they're forging their financial statements. Just go talk to a Chinese citizen, their lives revolve around Alibaba in some way."
2021-06-24 00:08:07,wallstreetbets,"The stock‚Äôs price per share has literally nothing to do with whether a stock is more affordable. Besides, you can buy fractional shares of course."

2021-06-24 10:07:46,wallstreetbets,Trade restrictions? This isn‚Äôt trump America anymore bud also baba was higher with more trade war threats.
2021-06-24 00:27:40,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre talking absolute dollars. Their EBITDA margin was -30% in 2016 & it was -7% in 2019.. the pandemic & IPO blew out their 2020 numbers. Their Q1 2021 EBITDA margin was -10% vs -12% in Q1 2020.. they‚Äôre currently forecasting -7 to -8% EBITDA margin for Q2 & the back half of the the year is seasonally stronger. And again, JP Morgan is forecasting EBITDA breakeven in 2022 & that was before Prestashop & the WSB buzz.. when it flips to profitability, that net income is going to just grow on autopilot. That‚Äôs the power of operating leverage, which is what they have."
2021-06-24 00:12:11,wallstreetbets,"They will never get the premium valuation because they are a Chinese company. Investors are always scared to invest. We saw what they did with jack ma earlier this year.

If they get too powerful, the Chinese government will shut them down."
2021-06-24 00:06:33,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm getting out of this toxic stock. I‚Äôm stuck with Baba for now. Beware of Baba.

If you want a lambo now, get into $WISH"
2021-06-24 00:50:02,wallstreetbets,If wall street was buying that it would be trading near 800 by now.  But it isn‚Äôt and never has.  Smart money is suspicious.

2021-06-24 00:32:54,wallstreetbets,"You claim 2020 numbers aren‚Äôt representative then use them to show their YoY EBITDA loss improvement. In reality, their EBITDA loss has gotten worse from 2019-2020 and Wish should have been a direct benefactor from Covid."
2021-06-24 03:06:32,wallstreetbets,Smart money priced in GE at 600B and Zoom at 200B. You really have no fucking clue what you are talking about lol good luck with your investing though
2021-06-24 00:50:47,wallstreetbets,"What he‚Äôs saying is price per share doesn‚Äôt matter, just the amount you invest. $100 is $100 whether you buy 8 wish or .5 BABA. If that .5 BABA goes up 10% you make $10, if your 8 shares of WISH go up 10%, that‚Äôs still $10"
2021-06-24 00:57:45,wallstreetbets,"No. This year they should be at or better than 2019 margins. And the business of 2021 has a much higher logistics mix which currently isn‚Äôt profitable but will be in a few More quarters. And if you‚Äôre truly interested, go back and read about the disruption Wish faced with shipping out of China in the early days of the pandemic. They pissed a lot of customers off by not delivering on time when China turned into a Ghost town."
2021-06-24 01:24:59,wallstreetbets,Got to be the education system failure. There are actually lots of people who do not get the concept.
2021-06-24 03:02:17,wallstreetbets,"As mentioned, Ebidta loss doubled while revenue increased only 34%. 2020 margins were worse than 2019 margins. BABA, like all other established ecommerce, performed better in the pandemic despite shipping concerns. Why not Wish? I would understand if you argued that their business model is more focused on china to American consumer and got hit harder, but their revenues actually increased substantially. Company has a blatant spending problem, and the return on that spending isn't that great compared to alternatives."

I use EToro and it doesn't seem to be on there? What platforms is everyone using to be able to buy it? as you can probably tell I'm relatively new so I do apologize for what could be a silly question!"
2021-06-24 13:49:10,wallstreetbets,Will you be my wife's boyfriend?
2021-06-24 13:54:57,wallstreetbets,"Here is something I want some comments on.
I was buying like 10 and 12 GME and AMC at Robinhood every week and then getting Fidelity to request the transfers. It would take about 6 days and the prices were not what I supposedly paid at time of Purchase. 
Here is where it gets interesting, Robinhood has been unwilling or unable to transfer 44 GME and we are going on 6 weeks! 
Any wrinkle brains have any thoughts on it?
Next question...Should I sell them after I buy 44 replacements at Fidelity or just keep asking for the transfer?"
2021-06-24 13:55:33,wallstreetbets,But wish stuff always get refund..
2021-06-24 13:57:21,wallstreetbets,Haahaaaa. Is that real??????

If it was $4mil in options to buy $wish at $15 on July 5 I'd think that's a bit more yolo. But owning a position in a company just isn't doing it for me. I have 7 figures in a vanguard ETF, do I get to yolo?"

2021-06-24 18:38:33,wallstreetbets,"Yep. That‚Äôs what makes people like roaring kitty so rare. It‚Äôs actually pretty easy to make $50,000+ on a single stock move when you you‚Äôre starting with millions. When you‚Äôre not starting with millions‚Ä¶not so much. Or you have to do it like 10+ times to get to this point. Needless to say I‚Äôm not retarded enough, because if I had that kind of money to play with, you guys would never see me again (not that anyone has any idea who I am now, but you know). I would just set things up to DCA a bunch of VTI, make interest off the rest, and call it a day."

2021-06-24 07:32:06,wallstreetbets,Can't you get around this by transferring your shares to another broker and then cash out?
2021-06-24 08:33:58,wallstreetbets,Transfer it to another brokerage and withdraw all within a week. I'm sure it's only on robinhood to post on this forum and get the most attention
2021-06-24 09:15:55,wallstreetbets,You can wire transfer it all out for a fee of 75 bucks I believe
2021-06-24 14:42:01,wallstreetbets,That's the withdrawal limit. For account transfer there shouldn't be a limit. It costs $70.

2021-06-24 08:02:52,wallstreetbets,You just said it... you took out from amc and put it into wish... why would anyone do that? Unless they are trying to manipulate people into doing the same and trying to steer people away from making real money. selling 4 mill in amc at under $60 at this point seems like the worst move anyone could make.

2021-06-24 05:43:28,wallstreetbets,"It's going to tank, a lot. Basing on all this publicity and push to WISH which I read lately about, I would avoid investing any penny into this. It seems like setup for rug pull unfortunately. There was some shitty stuff happening before and right after company went public (suspicious fund rise from General Atlantic which is close with Citadel, bad customer reviews, low quality purchases etc, stun gun drama),"
2021-06-24 05:29:25,wallstreetbets,"Verified that money on account are legit. Not the person. Since WSB gained way too much publicity than it should, you can expect many different people infiltrating the sub to try and manipulate public sentiment by pushing certain tickers they have huge positions on. 95% institutional owning says even more about possible outcome of this push. Just don't say I didn't warn you. Accounts made solely to push different tickers of this magnitude didn't happen before."

2021-06-24 15:04:53,wallstreetbets,Any source on that? The top 1% make like $750k per year so it would seem common for them to have $200k brokerage accounts after a couple years unless they go full retard on drugs or real estate.
2021-06-24 16:59:32,wallstreetbets,I was very surprised when I looked up what income gets you into the top 1% where I live. I always imagined it around be way higher. Lower middle class is dense.

2021-06-24 11:12:55,wallstreetbets,"WSB isn't compromised - pump and dumps is what this Reddit has been about since January. It's just another retail investor using a big bet to pump you guys to and get you to buy. The question is can you ride it up with him or not?

Also other guy is correct - this is no yolo - dude probably has 10 mil+ in assets."
2021-06-24 12:17:44,wallstreetbets,"when you put out a 4 mili yolo you get beat upon by people trying to ""help"" you manage your wealth. (Parasitic leeches that can't make money with their own funds and want to either use your or just straight up scam you)

So he makes a yolo account to pump up interest in his position."
2021-06-24 05:27:34,wallstreetbets,"If you think this person actually put all their net worth on 1 stock I got news for you ... they probably got plenty of millions elsewhere, and given the account was made 6 months ago (around GME hype) and has ZERO posts or comments prior this the thread it's probably just a hedge fund pump and dump like the others. Post some rediculous ""Yolo"" to make it seem like wish is a good buy and encourage others to buy too"
2021-06-24 08:12:28,wallstreetbets,Only a retard would keep over $500k in Robinhood‚Ä¶ thus only a retard would put everything on one stock.
2021-06-24 05:49:08,wallstreetbets,Well but are those his life savings? If not then it's not YOLO
2021-06-24 07:11:56,wallstreetbets,"Meh, it's shares. Boring shit.

Only options are true YOLOs"
2021-06-24 11:15:27,wallstreetbets,"No it's not! People can open as many accounts as they like. Many people will up open a fresh account for these ""yolos"" so you can't see the other 10+ million in assets they have invested."
2021-06-24 11:15:54,wallstreetbets,It's all about the ability to make more money in the future. Not really a yolo if you can have another mil by yrs end even if you lose 100% of your current possessions.

When you create a reddit account you can chose to decline a custom username and have a random one. I did that when I first started bc i didn't think i would be using reddit, but now i can't change it (or can't figure out how to yet).

You can believe me your believe your theory. haha."

IMO, stocks like CLOV and AMC (6 months ago) were not investments, but they were gamble just like this. However i do believe wish is undervalued.

Also,  I was with AMC back in January and I can't see the difference. I just don't understand why so much hate. (obviously i am bias cause i got money in the stock but still.....)"

Comparing the penny investment to 50k/y, they would even out around year 366. Comparing it to 50k/d they even out at year 472."

Ahhhh...you learn well Grasshopper.  Use the corporate world as a stepping stone to build yourself independent wealth.

Management: ""Why don't you work more so that you can move up in the company and make more money?""

Me: ""Once I learn everything I can from you I don't plan to stay that's why.""

This is the way.

Edit:  Most people work a job because they need the money.  The best feeling in the world is to prove you don't have to."
2021-06-24 02:50:16,wallstreetbets,"Dude get out of there. Is it like cold calling or something? Literally take the time and (free) courses to learn very (and I mean very) basic HTML, CSS, and how to use programs like Google ads manager, DoubleClick Manager, whatever program in the job description and get a job doing ad operations. I moved away from that a year ago and still get hit up with offers for ad opa. You will easily make at least $40k-$45k depending on state.

What I mentioned maybe would take 4 months to learn learning during off hours, and that is being super fucking generous. If you can watch YouTube videos and navigate UIs built by multi billion dollar companies you can do this.

You then can pivot to real money maker jobs in digital marketing like media buying and what not. Get that bread son."

This neglects the fact that most wealth is transferred over a life time, not just at death. It also leaves out all the other benefiting factors of being born into wealth which include better access to education, access to higher paying jobs and a million other things."

2021-06-24 00:50:49,wallstreetbets,"Sold 80% of it. Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea to do puts right now, since FSD is suppose to come out any day now."
2021-06-24 12:50:31,wallstreetbets,"I asked this question in another similar post and someone was kind enough to explain it to me. So I'll like to pass it on.

TSLA $575 Calls = A call contract to be eligible to purchase a share at $575. Each contract is 100 shares.

20 buys = Number of contracts purchased. In this case he bought 20 contracts which allows him to buy 20\*100=2000 shares if he decides to exercise his contracts.

7/16 exp = Date the contract will expire. In this case, 16th July.

$80.60 = The money you receive per share if you were to sell the contract. So take this number, times the number of shares to get the amount of money he earns. In this case, 80.60\*2000 = $161,200

He could also exercise his contract which means he can buy 2000 TSLA shares at $575 each. Since TSLA shares are $646.23 right now, he earns 2000(646.23-575) = $142,460.

But he will need about $1.15M capital in order to exercise his contracts and yet it will net him less gains as compared to selling the contracts itself.

Hope it helps!

Ps; thank you u/st1llet01 for explaining this to me 2 weeks ago."

2021-06-24 03:57:09,wallstreetbets,"The contracts are usually just sold off (you‚Äôd need millions to exercise these). You sell higher strikes that you don‚Äôt believe will be hit in order to lower the cost basis and limit risk a little, while also capping gains. 

Your calls will go up in price, but so will the ones you sold, cutting back on profits. 

If you were to exercise at $575 and it broke through $700 and you were assigned, you would still net a profit of $125/share before fees, so roughly 12.5k/contract. That‚Äôs max profit for those specific spreads at DOE. If you close out sooner, it can be a smidge higher based on the Greeks."

2021-06-24 02:50:29,wallstreetbets,It will be really hard to short squeeze AMC now with the low percent that is shorted compared to when the short squeeze happened with GME. Plus the market value of AMC is a lot now compared to when the short squeeze happened with GME. WSB will need to raise more capital.

2021-06-24 16:39:39,wallstreetbets,"If you click on the profiles of everyone shilling or ""yoloing"" wish, you'll see their mostly new accounts that's not active anywhere but wsb. All their posts and replies look like they're working from a checklist WSBish things to say. Like ""hellofollowkids.jpg"".  

IMO, wallstreet has figured out the formula to pump stocks they own, and hand off the bag back to retail. Their making the money they lost to retail back in Jan and March back. The beautiful thing is they don't care if we find out. They want WSB discredited. So whatever advantage retail had before is taken away again. Things go back to the way they were pre GME. 

Their probably in all the GME and AMC sub reddits pushing all the extreme tin foil hat conspiracy theories to. To make the whole thread look crazy.  Shit like ""in the dark pools AMC shares are trading at 5k. "" Or ""the floor is 5 million"".  And it probably doesn't even cost them money. Just make the intern do it"

2021-06-24 09:41:16,wallstreetbets,Because institutional and insider ownership hasn't really changed since the IPO. The lockout period just ended with the stock at near ATL. They'd lose their ass if they sold.

2021-06-24 00:22:03,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt see institutions selling any time soon if they are still in the game. WISH has solid fundamentals and is a growth stock in a desirable sector. Unless something happens that gives them a reason to sell why would they sell at $15 or even $20 when the IPO price was higher than that? Above $35 is when it‚Äôs reasonable to think institutions might start trimming their position and if WISH does make a similar move to AMC and go $50+ I would think quite a few of the big shareholders would take that gift and exit their positions. I have 1000 shares currently so I am biased.
2021-06-24 01:54:22,wallstreetbets,But why would another institutional investor buy premarket or after market?

2021-06-24 00:43:46,wallstreetbets,"It means everyone wants and expects the price to go up, including institutions.  They want to make their money back, too.  What happens when everyone thinks the stock should be more valuable?  (It goes up in value)

It means that certain people are betting on a company to fail or tank in price, but if you have a good reason to think those people are full of shit, then the SI is rocket ship fuel.

If I saw some inbred scam company like NKLA with high SI, I still wouldn't touch it because I agree that they're bound to fail."
2021-06-24 00:08:21,wallstreetbets,"I know.  AMC is going to $1,000 per share and a company that has no way of paying the billions of debt it has through its operations other than by raising money from a bunch of morons will become the world‚Äôs most valuable company by several trillion dollars.  Makes complete sense."
2021-06-23 23:56:28,wallstreetbets,Riiiight.  You obviously cannot.  Shorts can cover their position in GME in a day; in AMC it‚Äôs less than a day.  The percentage of float for both is lower as is the interest.  So please.
2021-06-24 08:39:40,wallstreetbets,"What I'm saying is they will act in their own self-interest. They're down over 50% on Wish right now.  They're not short the stock, either, so it's good for them to join us in pumping it up.  Once they've made their money back, or most of it back, and volume starts dying off, they could dump it, though... If you're the type to believe in manipulation... Which I think almost everyone is.

But for now, I don't see them dumping it just to screw retail because it's in their interest as much as ours for the stock price to go up."
2021-06-24 00:51:10,wallstreetbets,When it‚Äôs 30+ you‚Äôll wish it was at 50% off
2021-06-24 03:20:40,wallstreetbets,"Oh I know, it's just that every stock with big SI gets viewed as a rocket, while it actually means that some big moneybags think it will drop or are trying to make it drop. Both are not great signs.

I know it also gives a stock endless potential but still, its  a bit funny that short interest is almost exclusively bullish on WSB"

2021-06-24 03:03:42,wallstreetbets,Well that's how it works is it not? With 50 percent of the float shorted and the price going up it has to squeeze
2021-06-24 11:03:03,wallstreetbets,"I like $20, but I always sell early intentionally to play it safe.  I plan to sell most of my position around $16.  I will hold a small position after that until before earnings, then I will reassess.

I can't predict this, I can only guess.  It's really hyped right now, so there's no telling what it will do.  My personal opinion is it won't sell off significantly before earnings and that it also won't surpass IPO prices before then.  I wouldn't hold any risky positions through earnings, because if the numbers are bad again, it could really tank.  Then again, if the numbers are great, it could spike.  Personally, I'm not gambling on the earnings... One thing is for sure, there will be IV crush, so I really wouldn't risk options."

Sorry for the delay. I have been traveling for work and just got to the hotel. 

Today we saw $CLOV and $WKHS get good steady gains of 9%. Everything else kind of hunkered down in the +/- 5% range.

2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$BCRX Fundamentally sound with the potential for a short squeeze. Join me fellow apes. Hello everyone today I am going to try and convince you as to why you should buy $BCRX before we continue you should be aware I currently own 239.90 shares of BCRX as well as 4 call options 17$ strike for end of year 2023 and 18$ strike for end of this year.

1. **BCRX Short float**

$BCRX has a short float of 11.39% a total of  20,010,000 shares are shorted you may think 11.39% is a lot but considering the stock is on track to the moon we could possibly bankrupt some more hedge funds.

2.  **$BCRX upcoming drugs**

 

Peramivir (Rapivab) is a ***Government-bio defense antiviral drug*** for the treatment of ***Influenza***.  Peramivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor, acting as a transition-state  analogue inhibitor of influenza neuraminidase and thereby preventing new  viruses from emerging from infected cells.

In 2009 the department of Health and Human Services had already given about ***$180 million*** to support the program.

In 2013 (BARDA/HHS) released new funding under the current ***$234.8 million*** contract to enable completion of a New Drug Application filing for intravenous (IV) peramivir. 

&#x200B;

 

Galidesivir (BCX4430) is a  broad-spectrum antiviral in advanced development for the treatment of  viruses that pose a threat to health and national security, including  SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19), Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and  Zika. Galidesivir has also demonstrated broad-spectrum activity in vitro  against more than 20 ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses in nine different  families, including coronaviruses, filoviruses, togaviruses,  bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses and flaviviruses.   (Hepatitis C, West Nile, Dengue, Jap Encephalitis, Yellow Fever, TBEV,  OHFV, and Zika), orthomyxoviruses and picornaviruses... Galidesivir  trials are *fully funded by the NIAID*, It's a ***Government funded*** ***bio-defense drug.***

Galidesivir was safe and well tolerated in ***Phase 1*** clinical safety and pharmacokinetics trials by both intravenous and intramuscular routes of administration in healthy subjects.

 

FOP is an ultra-rare, severely  disabling condition characterized by the irregular formation of bone  outside the normal skeleton, also known as heterotopic ossification  (HO). HO can occur in muscles, tendons and soft tissue. Patients with  FOP become bound by this irregular ossification over time, with  restricted movement and fused joints, resulting in deformities and  premature mortality. There are currently ***no approved treatments for FOP.***

There are an estimated ***3,500 to 9,000 patients*** worldwide, with ***900 diagnosed*** so far.

Market size for this treatment is estimated to reach ***500M-900M*** in 2025, growing to 3B in 2028 as more patients are diagnosed. With a price ranging from $900K-$1M/year.

***‚ÄúIn  PH1 study, BCX9250 demonstrated potency for the target kinase,  selectivity, safety and strong suppression of HO in animal models, safe  and well tolerated‚Äù***

 

BCX9930 is a novel, ***oral, potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of Factor D***  which recently completed Phase 1 clinical development for the treatment  of complement-mediated diseases. Treatment that is able to ***control*** *both* ***Intravascular and Extravascular hemolysis.***

FDA granted ***Fast Track / Orphan drug designation*** for BCX9930's PNH study.

BCX9930  is an oral inhibitor of the Factor D enzyme that activates Factor B to  form the C3 alternative pathway. Developing this kind of inhibitors  ain't easy at all. Most of this inhibitors in the development process  fail or obtain poor results. At the moment BCX9930 is the ***best-in-class*** inhibitor in the game. Reasons will be explained below.

3. **CEO has commented on being able to ""handily"" beat earnings next quarter**

Last quarter they were expected to only get 0.26 EPS they crushed that expectation by getting 0.36 EPS this is due to their newest drug being approved and marketed the ceo seems to think next quarter will be even bigger than the last.

4.  **The newest drug BCRX has approved makes the life of the consumer much easier**

 

Orladeyo is the ***first Oral*** ***approved*** treatment used to prevent swelling attacks in people with ***hereditary angioedema (HAE)*****,** disease which is estimated to affect ***1 in 50,000 people***

\- Orladeyo received ***USA*** approval ***December the 3rd,*** ***2020. Q4***

\- Orladeyo received ***Japan*** approval ***April the 14th, 2021. Q2***

\- Orladeyo received ***Europe*** approval ***April the 30th, 2021 Q2***

\- Orladeyo received ***UK*** approval ***May the 12th, 2021 Q2***

*Orladeyo* is [ranked](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/pharmacy/20-most-expensive-prescription-drugs-in-2021.html) the ***#13 most expensive drug*** ***in the USA*** market. *$37,308*  is approximately what patients ( insurances ) must monthly pay to  access the drug. Despiste it being an expensive drug, it's the ***Cheapest and only Orally taken option*** in the HAE field.

It is very important to note here the only other treatment for HAE is injection based only. This makes it very likely the person with said disease will switch to this oral pill over an injection for improved life quality netting more revenue for the company.

5. **Soaring stock price $BCRX is already up 318.78% from the end of 2020**

Considering the stock price was only 4.40  nov 23 2020 it is safe to assume the shorts placed on this stock are already being squeezed to death so it won't take much more to force the hedge funds to cover their losses. If you want more hedge fund blood in the streets, won't you join me?"

Sit back and prepare yourselves for the lowest effort DD out there

For those of you who don't know, the marble EFT is the way to pick stocks when you just want to sit back and scratch your nuts. It's a gravitational algorithm where marbles are given ticker names, and what ticker lands twice in the top ten is picked for day trading the next day. Five maps are played each evening and if there are no winners than the day is taken off.

**Today was a break even day.**

**As of April 5th the current overall is 10.75%**

When playing the marbles an equal amount of money is divided into the stocks that are picked, stocks are bought at open and sold at/before close the same day.

2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"üöÄ$TELL and The Driftwood Pipeline is planning to deploy electric-driven compression, reducing the pipeline‚Äôs carbon emissions by more than 99%üöÄ TLDR - TELL is using green tech, how will this affect the stock price?

Tellurian ticker TELL had a press release 
yesterday that confirmed the low carbon footprint that I had previously only heard spoken of in the Chairman‚Äôs weekly talk to shareholders as a carbon capture system. This pipeline Tech seems to reduce carbon emissions and I do not think is the carbon capture that TELL plans to implement. Regardless I find this news to be extremely Bullish. 

If Driftwood is constructed using this proposed tech, along with carbon capture, then TELL is going to stay competitive longer with Green Energy tech. I am wondering if they have a shot at getting a piece of any infrastructure plan from the government(if it comes to fruition) or any Green Energy grants. At the least they would save money by not paying lofty carbon tax. 

I am curious if anyone has any input on carbon capture, carbon tax breaks, or Green Energy grants and how this could play out for TELL and inevitably lead to  bolstering the stock price. 

TELL often gets compared to fledgling Chenerie. If TELL pulls of this pipeline  it would be superior to Chenerie not only with its proposed business model, but also having a smaller carbon footprint. I can‚Äôt help but wonder how high this stock can go if and when Driftwood is built and operational.

‚ÄúAs part of the design, Driftwood Pipeline is proposing to deploy Baker Hughes-supplied electric-driven compression, thereby reducing the pipeline‚Äôs carbon dioxide emissions by more than 99%. The proposed pipeline project, coupled with other strategic steps Tellurian is taking, will lead to nearly a one million tonne reduction per year in direct greenhouse gas emissions (a 14% overall reduction).‚Äù ‚Äî- from press release https://ir.tellurianinc.com/press-releases/detail/242/tellurian-files-application-for-new-pipeline-project-to

2021-06-24 08:07:42,wallstreetbets,"You are right is not new tech. I do think it is relevant that they are staying consistent with vocalized plans to keep the project as green as possible. There are other choices that could have been made in regards to pipelines pumping system, ones that would not lead to 99% reduction in carbon emissions. I maintain that news of this nature is Bullish for TELL. The more the company does to stay GREEN and highlight through PR the steps and choices they are making to be cognizant of their environmental impact, the better off Tellurain will be. 

I did not say it was catalyst nor do I expect direct price movement from this news alone. TELL still has a lot to prove as a company and a lot mile markers to pass to reach their goals. If they continue down the greenest path possible and continue to publicize it, I think it further bolsters longterm and medium term price targets."

2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"NKLA to $0.00. Or the Moon. IDK Howdy y‚Äôall, welcome to a bad DD post, but first! Let me get my butt covered really quick‚Ä¶ I am not a financial advisor. This is not financial advice. If you continue to read, you will lose money whether you agree or disagree with this DD. This is all satire and I‚Äôm making everything up. Upon writing this, I have had enough drinks to consider texting all my exes at the same time, especially the weird one.

Let‚Äôs talk about Nikola, shall we? Other than being a bargain-bin Tesla knockoff, they‚Äôre also one of the worst publicly traded companies to ever exist, including Theranos, Enron, and Worldcom. Basically, go watch Patrick Boyle‚Äôs video on them and see all the sketchy things they‚Äôve done to pretend to be a real vehicle/tech company. However, instead of taking a nose dive into the ground, they have climbed up to $18.00 per share from their low of like $9.50 a few months back after their crash from $75. So, what‚Äôs going on here? Is it time to but puts or calls? If you look at my post history, I am great at losing money on these kinds of questions.

The fundamentals:

Disclaimer: For the purpose of this analysis, the environment doesn‚Äôt matter. Sorry, but business is business. I hope for sustainable practices and want the world to be a cleaner and sustainable place, but that‚Äôs currently not a line-item on the income statement.

Let‚Äôs look at the financials. Nikola has less revenue than the average ice cream truck. They‚Äôre currently all sitting on the edge of their seats to see if they‚Äôll even be able to make a real vehicle that doesn‚Äôt have to be rolled down a hill. And they‚Äôre burning poopy tons of money doing this. At the end of 2020, they had about $900,000,000 in the bank. That‚Äôs a lot of money, but how fast do they burn their Benjamins? According to their cash flow statement, they outflowed about $240,000,000 from Operating and Investing activities. Looking at their growth rate from 2018-2020, I‚Äôm ballparking a 75% increase in operating negative cash flow expenses year-over-year, but indeterminant investing activity cash flows. Remember, they want to build a bunch of charging stations around the county because their trucks will only use their proprietary charging system. I have no idea what that would cost to put these stations around the USA, but I‚Äôm imagining it‚Äôs not written with 9 digits. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre going to be able to afford the infrastructure or even make a viable product work before they run out of money. Between the large capital expenditures required, the quick burn rate of cash, and the necessity to either leverage up with debt or issue more shares for money, I don‚Äôt like the fundamentals for this company surviving. Cathy Wood also doesn‚Äôt like it.

Now let‚Äôs look the team: Trevor Milton is gone. This is bullish because he‚Äôs a fart-monger. If I had to guess, this is why the stock price has rebounded a little over the last few months. I can‚Äôt find much on their new CEO Mark Russell, who picked up the gig from just being their President, so I‚Äôm going to assume he‚Äôs also pretty sus because he was around when all the sketchy stuff went down. I‚Äôm probably wrong though, so he might turn this ship around. I‚Äôm not seeing anything significant on anyone else in the company, so I‚Äôm guessing they‚Äôre irrelevant. Bearish.

And that‚Äôs the problem: What if it doesn‚Äôt just go to $0.00 like it should? What if an army of retards decide that this dumpster fire is the next moonshot? I don‚Äôt know those answers, but I‚Äôm willing to take the risk and lose some money to find out if I‚Äôm right or wrong. So how about the part everyone cares about?

Puts or calls? This company doesn‚Äôt belong on Wall Street. It belong on Shark Tank with a unanimous ‚ÄúI‚Äôm out.‚Äù However, I know I‚Äôm retarded and terrible at doing stock analysis. There‚Äôs only like 4 numbers in my financial analysis, so it‚Äôs gotta be bad. Therefore I‚Äôm going to outsmart myself by buying some $20 Jan 2022 calls and get some some $10 Jan 2023 puts . It‚Äôs either going up a lot or down a lot. Or I‚Äôm just wrong, it just stays at $18, and I move into a nice tent under the bridge. Now if you‚Äôll excuse me, my next appointment is waking up on my kitchen floor a few hours after my shift starts. Obligatory üöÄüöÄüöÄ. Even though I‚Äôm thinking down.

Edit: my position is in the reply to the mod comment. Exit plan: close call at 100% profit or Close put when the company delists.

Edit 2: I put my brain to use and realized the big premium on my calls pretty much erases any potential gains on my puts, so I‚Äôll be looking to roll those into a cheaper and closer expiry if I can, like 1-2 months out rather than 7. These options are also pretty illiquid, so I may have just painted myself into a corner on this one.

Update: rolled the call down to the October $19 call for $360. Also made $1 on closing the Jan call lol. That‚Äôs 1/2 of a McMuffin right there!"

2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"TDOC DD Alright retards. Throwback to a prior WSB starlet. TDOC is where it's at. Cathie Bae owns 16M shares. Vanguard owns 12M shares. BlackRock at 5.5M shares. These legends on different ends of the investment spectrum on the same page? Madness. Current price as I write is \~$160 / share. All analyst targets anywhere I can see show low of 162 and high of 300. CATHIE BAE's cost average is basically the CURRENT PRICE... so you're not missing the boat here by any means.

TDOC fell off a cliff in March as the world started opening up and vaccines rolled out - dropping from \~280 all the way to \~140. Classic over-reaction. Behind it all? Fundamental concern that ""telehealth"" is a COVID stuck at home thing and not the future? Some speculation of Amazon being a healthcare player in the future? Peepz investing in COVID recovery stocks? (that last one is understandable... but winding down as a strategy)

The reality is TDOC is taking healthcare by storm. Healthcare is one of those industries that is decades behind technology-wise... super archaic systems, paper documents, antiquated everything. For anyone who has had the misfortunate of working in healthcare like myself it's a bit of a cluster. The tech driven health industry will be growing like crazy as big companies modernize and new players enter the market. TDOC has a massive lead, fantastic market penetration, and great overall financials. Revenue increased like crazy during COVID and is still on a solid growth trajectory. P/E good. Overall just a very solid play.

Back to Cathie Bae. She has been increasing her position for ages. It is second only to TSLA across the ARK funds... but TSLA is one of those things in the limelight that has already been pumped like crazy. Room to rebound and continue growing? Probably. I'd argue TDOC's potential in the next 6 months is greater because it is beginning to climb out of a 50% drop that was largely unwarranted.

TDOC acquired Livongo and has the footing in this quickly evolving industry to continue expanding offerings and building on the market penetration it's already established. Expect more acquisitions, more partnerships, morrrre rocket emojis.  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ

I'm in 75K deep and fully expect to double my money... just a matter if it takes a month or a year? Good earnings or another catalyst might just send this thing back to it's proper valuation pretty quickly. TDOC is up 14% the last month, but still down basically 50% from where it was.

TL;DR - TDOC go uppity up to the moon. Trust the Cathie Bae. This is the way. üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ"

2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"A lot of our retail investors base is in stocks reporting a lot of dark pool activity lately The SEC is supposed to be ""looking into"" Dark Pools but I had never heard this allegation that ""Hedge funs can short stocks through dark pools without reporting it"" outright. What do you guys think?

The clip is from ""Making Money with Charles Payne""

https://reddit.com/link/o6q1aq/video/cbgg6w6324771/player

If you haven't heard of dark pool stocks, there‚Äôs a good reason for that. A ‚Äúdark pool‚Äù is a [**private exchange**](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/dark-pool/) used for trading securities in a non-public manner. The dark pools usually aren't available to the general public. They are more frequently used by large investors like hedge funds. 

 Public stock exchanges like the [**New York Stock Exchange**](https://marketrealist.com/p/nyse-short-restriction-list/) and the [**Nasdaq**](https://marketrealist.com/p/what-is-nasdaq/) are heavily regulated and monitored by the [**SEC**](https://marketrealist.com/p/sec-to-allow-tokenization-of-stocks/). In contrast, dark pools are subject to very little regulation and oversight by any governing organizations. This is why they are also called [**‚Äúdark pools of liquidity.‚Äù**](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/060915/pros-and-cons-dark-pools-liquidity.asp) 

Dark pool investing can save institutional investors money since they aren‚Äôt managed by a large public exchange and therefore avoid exchange fees. Also, the intentions of their trades aren't public until after the trades are executed, which can also offer a price benefit for an institutional investor.

An institutional investor has a greater chance of selling a large block of a security within a dark pool since it‚Äôs already restricted to large investors.

## Three types of dark pools

Dark pools are legal trading exchanges that are kept private. They might also be called [**alternative trading systems (ATS**](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-a-dark-pool-5188584)) or private trading networks. *Investopedia* reported that as of February 2020, over [**50 dark pools**](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/050614/introduction-dark-pools.asp) were registered with the SEC, falling into three different categories.

The three categories include:

1. **Broker-Dealer-Owned Dark Pool**‚Äîexamples include [**Credit Suisse's**](https://marketrealist.com/2020/07/hanesbrands-gets-boost-credit-suisse-wells-fargo-upgrade/) *CrossFinder*, [**Goldman Sachs's**](https://marketrealist.com/p/goldman-sachs-cheap-global-stocks/) *Sigma X*, and [**Morgan Stanley's**](https://marketrealist.com/p/morgan-stanley-high-conviction-global-stocks/) *MS Pool.*
2. **Agency Broker or Exchange-Owned Dark Pool**‚Äîexamples include agency broker dark pools *Instinet*, *Liquidnet,* and *ITG Posit.* Some exchange-owned dark pools are those offered by BATS Trading and NYSE Euronext.
3. **Electronic Market Makers Dark Pools**‚Äîthese dark pools are managed by independent operators.

 The privacy of dark pool stock trading can be helpful in keeping details of large trades away from news media coverage. On the public market, these types of trades would likely ‚Äútrigger price overreaction or underreaction,‚Äù according to Corporate Finance Institute.

Dark pools enable large trades to be broken into smaller pieces and executed before the price drops. These trades are also called ‚Äúblock trades,‚Äù and they are so large that they have the potential to impact a security‚Äôs price, which is minimized by using the dark pool. This is the main reason dark pools were created.

## Cons of dark pools

Certainly, a major negative aspect of dark pools is their lack of transparency. This leaves the dark pools ‚Äúsusceptible to conflicts of interest by their owners and predatory trading practices by HFT firms,‚Äù according to *Investopedia*.

Another con of dark pool stocks is that their trades disproportionately benefit institutional investors over small-time retail investors. The off-market prices can be very different from public exchange prices. Institutional investors might be able to sell large holdings of a security on a dark pool before retail investors are aware of this activity."

2021-06-23 21:09:33,wallstreetbets,"Riddle me this OP, if you wanted to short the stock, why on earth would you use a dark pool? When you short you want to drive the price down. So you want to do it on the exchange for the maximum impact. Doing it through a dark pool defeats the whole purpose. In fact if you are long the stock then you would prefer that all shorting would go through the dark pool so as not to drive the price down.

Now it may make some sense if you want to build the initial short position at the top and the push it down, but still from the longs perspective the more shorting goes through dark pool the better because the less selling pressure is on the stock."
2021-06-23 21:16:07,wallstreetbets,"The trades from dark pools are all reported.  The only non-transparent part is that there are no bids or asks visible.

However, consider that exchanges offer non-displayed or partially-displayed (""iceberg"") order types in addition to the ""normal"" order types.  So they are not perfectly transparent either.

The main problem (IMO) with the lack of order transparency is that the ""best execution"" requirements only deal with displayed orders of round lots.  If too much trading happens in this way, ""best execution"" starts to be meaningless.

If you've ever placed an order with a broker and seen  ""price improvement"", you are benefiting from this.  It means that your order filled at better than the best displayed price.

It's no longer true that dark pools are not available to retail investors.  Most of your trades probably execute in dark pools, even if you don't know it.  They are no longer only for large block trades."

2021-06-24 06:26:46,wallstreetbets,"If they are reopening shorts on weekly highs over a period of a few months, they could take out bigger shorts than they are showing, keeping the price on a controlled down trend with apes still buying FDs every week and still doing mini pumps along the way to open more shorts."

If you have been a STAR holder comment below how well you're doing.

Today, we saw some amazing price action brought on by B Riley Financial Inc initiating coverage of $STAR and setting a buy rating and price target at $35. This helped our $STAR position close +10% up for the day. Chart below.

The below data isn't anything to write home about. However, the days I am watching are Friday and Monday for any significant changes as a result of todays acceleration towards fair value.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Below is the current holdings of STAR by ETFs. There may have been a glitch in reporting on Monday, which showed a significant drop in holdings. However, todays reporting shows the holdings are strong compared to last week.

A key date I am watching will be June 30th. This is the date where mutual funds will start updating their holdings.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Today, we also saw iStar Financials credit rating improve. While not significant in the short term. This will allow iStar more play with their debt structure in the years to come.

&#x200B;

I had an initial price target of $22.75 for July 16th 2021. However, with this weeks acceleration I will be reevaluating said price target on the weekend after the rest of the weeks data comes in. Note: There will be another evaluation on July 3rd after mutual fund data is released.

Next update will be Friday aftermarket."

2021-06-24 01:57:47,wallstreetbets,Rome on HBO. It follows Julius Caesar Gaul to his death in season one and season 2 goes until Mark Antony's death and Octavian's last roadblock to being a true Emperor. High budget and paved the way for Game of Thrones in a lot of ways.

2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$WEN DD - Morty's! Not financial advice, this is completely retarded, and a mix of research from myself and other WSB apes.

The post that started it all -

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nudcrm/to\_the\_guy\_who\_recommended\_wendys\_stockwen\_proper/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nudcrm/to_the_guy_who_recommended_wendys_stockwen_proper/)

[u/Chillznday](https://www.reddit.com/u/Chillznday/), pointed out to us the first sign of Wen Moon potential - The Wendy‚Äôs Summer Salad, the best salad of the summer as certified by salad experts. ‚ÄúOnly Wendy's can bring to life this sweet and savory culinary creation with quality ingredients like hand-picked strawberries, crisp Applewood smoked bacon, savory Tuscan cheese blend topped with a sweet and tangy Champagne Vinaigrette‚Äìall on top of a bed of freshly chopped lettuce and spring mix for a sweet and savory experience.‚Äù I bought into [u/Chillznday](https://www.reddit.com/u/Chillznday/)‚Äôs vision the second I read his wonderful and educated DD, as did many of you.

Once all you apes caught wind of the glorious summer salad, we had a glorious jump to an ATH of almost $30 with a 90M daily volume. Cramer tried to be cool and ruined the momentum, and Wendy‚Äôs insiders dumped large portions of their holdings for a quick profit. $WEN is now back to its pre-WSB share price and volume at about $23 with a daily volume of around 2 million. I have doubled down my long position ($35C 1/21/22) in preparation for the $WEN moon.

Now, I still believe $WEN has the potential to be a meme stock. I think it perfectly suits this sub. (tendies, ‚Äúsir this is a wendy‚Äôs‚Äù, and our favorite employer of WSB members, to name a few examples.) But if you morons think this is going to be another short squeeze like GME or AMC, you‚Äôre wrong. This is an undervalued, solid stock that has real sustainable future potential as-is, and the Summer Salad is just the beginning.

[Wendy's Bourbon Bacon Cheeseburger](https://preview.redd.it/vunzws2hw3771.jpg?width=678&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b61841fb4b6fe0cfdfbe0a121d0e5880ff8f874)

First, the Bourbon Bacon Cheeseburger. This thing looks delicious. It tastes delicious. It‚Äôs one of the best burgers ever sold by Wendy‚Äôs, certified by me, a burger enthusiast who has tasted numerous burgers. And it‚Äôs a huge step in the right direction for where the higher-quality dining menu of this establishment is headed. The quality of the food is going up, as are the prices. That leads to higher revenue. In combination with the Summer Salad, Wendy‚Äôs looks like it‚Äôs on track to beat expectations in their next earnings release.

Second, Analyst ratings and predictions. Right now, it‚Äôs at 60% buy and 40% hold. Analysts believe Wendy‚Äôs is a BUY, with the most recent rating from Northland Securities rating it a buy with a price target of $30. Here‚Äôs a link to some recent analyst ratings. [https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-wen-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-06-2-3/](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-wen-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-06-2-3/)

Third, the Rick and Morty advertising campaign - two internet favorites and the perfect mix of meme and undervalued stock. The Morty‚Äôs pop-up restaurant drew in a lot of attention on social media, and the Rick and Morty-themed drinks ""Mello Yello BerryJerryboree"" and ""Mello Yello Portal Time Lemon Lime"" are available at more than 5,000 US Wendy's locations throughout the duration of the release of Rick and Morty season 5. As hype for Rick and Morty returns, Wendy‚Äôs is set to profit from a large increase in demand for their BerryJerryboree and Portal Time Lemon Lime with the average restaurant profit margin of over 70% on soda sales.

Fourth, Wendy‚Äôs is opening stores in the UK. ‚Äú\[Wendy‚Äôs\] plans to open hundreds of restaurants in the next several years, according to a company spokesman‚Äù. As Wendy‚Äôs becomes more available to our European brothers and COVID recovery progresses, we‚Äôre sure to see huge increases in profits internationally.

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/brits-queue-up-for-new-wendys-as-american-fast-food-invades-u-k-11623153601](https://www.wsj.com/articles/brits-queue-up-for-new-wendys-as-american-fast-food-invades-u-k-11623153601)

Fifth, Wendy‚Äôs Breakfast. I‚Äôm sure by now you‚Äôve heard that Wendy‚Äôs has breakfast. It‚Äôs pretty good, and since the inception of Wendy‚Äôs breakfast last year it has accounted for 7% of their total sales, and is predicted to reach 10% by 2022.

[https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/03/business/wendys-breakfast-sales/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/03/business/wendys-breakfast-sales/index.html)

And finally, Wendy‚Äôs social media activity is still the biggest draw for meme potential for $WEN. According to an actual scientific study done on The Wendy's Twitter account, ‚ÄúCreative humour and corporate communication norm violation promote the company's positive image and high user engagement.‚Äù In other words, being funny and ‚Äúnot like other companies‚Äù on social media is the most progressive advertising form that Wendy‚Äôs has adopted, and it‚Äôs worked extremely well, to the point of other companies following suit and copying the Wendy‚Äôs example. Wendy‚Äôs has had interactions with other big meme stocks on twitter as well, such as GameStop. If Wendy‚Äôs Twitter would acknowledge WSB and their retail investors, it would be met with a lot of enthusiasm. If we could gain enough traction, I could see us getting some free frostys.

The scientific study is available to read here - [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216620301120](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216620301120)

Wendy‚Äôs is undervalued, according to both analysts and WSBers. There is a lot of potential. Analyst price targets are around $30, and another WSB user compared McDonald‚Äôs and Wendy‚Äôs and came up with a valuation of $50+ per share, based on revenue and market cap data. [u/amerikayo](https://www.reddit.com/u/amerikayo/) posted their comparison to McDonald‚Äôs valuation that is worth reading here - [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvapjt/wen\_dd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvapjt/wen_dd/)

Hey /u/Engineer_Economist, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit."
2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$FNMA $FMCC Fannie Mae is larger than Apple and Microsoft  

Not a political post!

The Supreme court decision today is sending the financial relief decision back to the lower court but a favorable ruling regarding the unconstitutional FHFA director position.  In hours, Biden Admins have already removed the FHFA director.

**Quick history:**

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been in government conservatorship since the 2008 housing crash.  In 2012, the FHFA decided to take all the lambos for themselves and sweep the money into the treasury when the companies turned a profit.  The congress at some point realized that they could not end these companies because of stonks so shareholders still exist.  In 2019, Fannie and Freddie were finally allowed to retain their capital to the tune of billions.  Many apes agree that Fannie and Freddie‚Äôs current woes largely resulted from them being used as a political scapegoat but to top it off, the former FHFA decided the two companies would need to raise $283B to be released.

**Enterprise Value (EV):**

To give you an idea what these companies are worth, Fannie and Freddie service half of the mortgages in the United States.  They are a cash and dividend paying cow.

  

|**Company**|**EV**| **Market Cap**|Share Price|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Fannie Mae|4.1T|2.5B|$1.52|
|Freddie Mac|2.7T|1.4B|$1.41|
|Apple|2.2T|2.2T|$35.20|
|Saudi Armaco|2.0T|7.0T|$133.70|
|Microsoft|2.0T|2.0T|$265.28|

&#x200B;

**Institutional holders makeup 24.7% of total outstanding junior preferred.**

Top institutional holders include Paulson & Co., Pershing Square, Capital Management and Fairholme Funds, Inc.  These guys have diamond hands since 2008!

**Short Volume fintel:**

Short Volume   22M

Short Volume Ratio 4868%

&#x200B;

I'm curious what would happen if we send this stock to its proper valuation, $10, $20, $50, or $100+? Would this force the government to sell their senior preferred shares?  The relief sought by shareholders would entitle them to $124B, rapid raise in share price and future lambo paying dividends.

2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Employment Weeklys are the move Since January Ive lost money at a pretty good rate. Read all the good DD and bad that you guys take so much time (not really) to put together before you post. At the beginning of June though i was forced to get a job to keep up with my habit and ever since then i dont have the time to read new DD, or scroll through the daily thread to pick which FDs that will almost certainly be a 80% loss once Friday morning creeps around. Jus doesnt feel right that im making money on the clock instead of sitting home laughing at all the memes yall put hard work into while my 800 tesla weekly's  wither away like Thanos jus snapped his fingers. After a good amount of thinking ive came up with this fool proof idea called ""employment weeklys"". At the beginning of each month i will fill out 7-8 job applications and the first one to hire me i will quit after one week, take the entire next week off to lose the money i jus made and during that week accept whatever the next job is that contacts me back and repeat the process. And at worst i will break even by the end of each 2nd week (1weeks pay + FDs the 2nd week) which is better than ive done the rest of 2021. This will be plan until ive worked for every place that is willing to hire me in my city."

2021-06-23 20:02:04,wallstreetbets,Awesome! Same here ... I was playing low here and there..... No more playing lowball .. I went all in as I felt this stock is solid..
2021-06-23 21:23:20,wallstreetbets,Leave the options alone on this one. They seem to be doing a pretty good job of keeping most of them out of the money. Just my .02.
2021-06-23 20:04:14,wallstreetbets,"So the biggest risk in a covered call while prices rise is that the calls you write get assigned, meaning someone is exercising the call options. In that scenario you‚Äôll get the premium (the money you get for writing the call) and the price of the shares.

Ex.

Wish is currently $14. You write covered calls for next Friday for $20. The price is 55 cents, meaning each option you write is $55. With 1500 shares, assuming everything else stays the same, you‚Äôll have a weekly income of $825. As the week goes on if wish stays below $20, you just keep the money just for writing the option.

What happens if it goes above $20? If that happens and you get assigned, you‚Äôll get $20 per share that you own, plus the $55 premium of the contracts you wrote. At that point, I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôll still be bullish, all you do is use your new found gains and buy into the stock again with the same money plus an extra $825.

Remember you can close out these options at any point you want, so if you‚Äôre about to be assigned and you don‚Äôt want that, you can ‚Äúbuy to close‚Äù. That means you‚Äôll buy a $20 option for the same date as the covered call. The options will cancel each other out and you keep the difference between the 2 prices which should mean you made money.

There are different ways to play around with these, you can buy weeklies, 2 weeks out, a month out, etc. and if you think the squeeze won‚Äôt happen soon you can lower the strike price for more money. Up to $143 per contract. However, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be smart. I‚Äôd far out the money like $20-22 dollars. Check out some YouTube videos about it that are better than my explanation. I recommend ‚ÄúIn The Money‚Äù, blonde kid with glasses. He explains it really well.

Not financial advice. Good luck."
2021-06-23 20:09:57,wallstreetbets,He‚Äôd have to close before he gets assigned. If not he‚Äôd have to risk the few minutes between getting assigned and buying back in.

2021-06-23 23:57:10,wallstreetbets,just buy leaps if your going with options
2021-06-23 20:57:56,wallstreetbets,Question if you don't mind. If you write covered calls for 20 and for some reason you wanna sell the stock at 19 for example. Can you sell the shares while having the covered calls open? How would you go about closing the options since you no longer have the shares?
2021-06-23 21:05:32,wallstreetbets,"Awesome! Thanks for the explanation.. I can sell weeklies I think... Within 1 week, if it hits 20, I will take that and get in again on a good opportunity. 2 weeks or months I will be worried. Thanks for typing all these in details."
2021-06-24 00:33:52,wallstreetbets,you must not browse wsb much then. I see shots of fidelity and td ameritrade all the time here.
2021-06-23 20:06:14,wallstreetbets,"Sell when you're up. If you're day trading - don't get greedy and don't get emotional. If you're about to place a trade to ""win"" back the money you just lost - stop and go take a walk, or better yet. Don't trade anymore until the next day. Trading with emotion is just the fast forward button to the future where your money is gone. 

Or, have patience and invest in stocks you have researched and believe in.

Best of luck."

2021-06-23 22:06:23,wallstreetbets,I have the same problem. You need to have predefined targets to take  profit. You can never time the top so the best way to not lose all your gains is to sell a little at a time when you're up.
2021-06-23 22:35:01,wallstreetbets,when youre happy with profit sell. If ur up like 20-30% and ur happy with it sell. nothing goes up forever. better some profit then none at all fckk it lol
2021-06-23 22:33:29,wallstreetbets,"Thanks.. What do you mean by 3? I got 1500 shares, I can sell 15 right?"
2021-06-23 22:04:15,wallstreetbets,You'd have to close your call position before selling the underlying asset. Otherwise you would have naked sold calls and that's a dangerous game.
2021-06-23 22:44:01,wallstreetbets,"Just like Dense said, you have to own the stock to be able to do this. Assuming you‚Äôre using Robinhood, they actually won‚Äôt even allow you to write naked calls (writing calls without owning the shares) because the risk is essentially unlimited just like with the naked short sellers."

2021-06-24 05:16:17,wallstreetbets,How would closing your call position go about? Buying a copy of the same call? Would you be paying more premiums if you sold you CC at 13 and bought the new call at 19 for example?

2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Opendoor Technologies -- Currently selling my home and after experience want to short the shit out of this company-- Am I missing something? WSB bro's and anyone else who's up for a good discussion can you please tell me if I'm missing something about opendoor? My Spidey senses are tingling that this company has no place now that Zillow and Redfin do exactly what they do but IMO, better. I just went through the process with all three companies to get my final offer for a home in Las Vegas. Bullet points below for how they go about this.

1. You get a preliminary offer based on area and comps

2. You talk to a team member and discuss a time for a 30 min walkthrough while they inform you of what the process will be like.

3. Video walkthrough via zoom or stream on device of your choice with a ""housing expert"" who looks at the entire house including plumbing, appliance dates, wall dings etc etc

4. You get final offer with repairs and closing cost included. 

Now between the three Opendoor takes 5% for service charge, plus added $2200 repair cost and 1% for closing cost. They also gave a larger prelim offer (477k) after walk through went to 460k (bait and switch) 

Zillow on the other hand gave 457k preliminary offer, post walkthrough it stayed at 457k no repair cost (home was built in 2016) and they only take 1% for service charge! -- 

**Note still waiting on final from redfin just did final walkthrough. 

Now my question is how the hell does Opendoor last when they are heavily reliant on their tech and boast that it's superior but the heavy hitter in this industry is now doing it just as good but for 5% or more less?! As mentioned, makes me want to put a couple puts on it and see what happens. All opinions appreciated!"
2021-06-23 21:15:35,wallstreetbets,Zillow has their fees lower right now as they are trying to capture revenue.  Opendoors competitive advantage is that they were in the space for years before Z even got started I buying.  Their data an algorithms allow them to offer more for homes (as you listed above) and still turn a profit.  I think this advantage and their growth into many new markets will ultimately make Open the champion of this space.  I am long open but always open (see what I did there) to counter arguments.
2021-06-23 21:42:36,wallstreetbets,6% charge is literally double what a selling agents fee should be.
2021-06-24 08:22:38,wallstreetbets,"Opendoor does ibuying more successfully then zillow, offerpad and the others. No one is as profitable(or close to it) as opendoor."
2021-06-24 07:43:40,wallstreetbets,"unfortunately just because someone has a superior product/app, doesnt mean everyone will use it. I mean look at Robinhood for example. obviously not the best choice, and you wouldnt think 75% of the WSB posts would be RH screen caps but here we are"
2021-06-24 10:48:18,wallstreetbets,5% service and 1% closing? You might as well hire an agent at that point. This just confirms that they are a quick flip scam company trying to turn all real estate into a quick flip. The interesting thing to me is what these companies list at following their purchase. This will tell you what the spread is and how close to breakeven you get in comparison to a traditional agent.
2021-06-24 19:34:46,wallstreetbets,Should also post on rocket homes
2021-06-24 00:24:10,wallstreetbets,"I invested in WISH around their IPO and have had AMZN since they were around 1200 a share. Anyways, OPEN has the tech and really paved the way for a hassle free buying and selling experience, but I just don't see how they're going to compete long term. Their growth story is compelling, but I sort of see them like a lemonade-- big growth curve and risky as hell because the uncertainty of them executing properly. We shall see!"
2021-06-23 21:18:17,wallstreetbets,"And to those who say ‚Äúpeople will always want to work with a real agent in person‚Äù.  They used to say that streaming would be a dud because of the experience of going to blockbuster and wanting to physically have the film.‚Äù

2021-06-24 00:30:52,wallstreetbets,"I understand that but those competitive advantages in my personal experience just don't add up. Now that ZG can be hyper competitive with $ and employ the same tech of the hassle free video walkthrough and doing it all virtally etc etc then say ""hey only one percent"" why the hell would you go for 6% with OPEN?"
2021-06-24 00:25:19,wallstreetbets,I agree and of course when I came back with my Zillow offere they upped their offer but still falls well short because of the fee's. Very curious to see how they scale

2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Canoo Gonna $GOEV it to ya! üõ∂üé∂ This is my due diligence, I happen to like it, and I know nothing of finance. Eat crayons. 

All these other DD on Canoo don't even mention the following tenets on Canoo: Canoo's cars will change the auto industry, car ownership, and the market's view on affordable EVs, or that $GOEV is listing on the Russell index this week, or that their investor's day was bullish af, or that weekly options recently became available, or that there was pretty good gamma action last couple weeks to solidify our thoughts.  Just go listen to their accountants say EBITDA aloud and you'll be sold on this company instantaneously. 

Serious note, those accountants colorfully showed us that Canoo has more than enough cash to make it through first manufacturing deal, which was simultaneously signed alongside Canoo's $300m-incentive-laiden contract to manufacture in the Great State of Oklahoma. Look at the Governor's vest, nicely branded and it only cost him $300m.  Did I mention their contract to manufacture in the US has $300m in incentives in addition to federal manufacturing incentives?  Yep. That deal alone added a hefty amount of rocket fuel to this Canoo. Additionally, VDL Nedcar will imprint on the European markets while completing their base year contract, laying grounds for EuroCanoo takeover. 

Further, Canoo has an expandable product lineup that can be converted in 69,420 ways, bullish af. I like potential military applications, Canoo's CEO has military ties. So many ways for people to paddle their Canoo to their own drum. Not sure that's how the phrase goes, but there it is. 

Recently, the ticker has been increasing SI, but it is meeting all its deadlines and milestones en route to product launch Q4 2022. Canoo has assembled an exceptionally talented leadership team and will be actively seeking engineers to assist in the next phase of manufacturing. All of which is accounted for and paid for already. Canoo is perched where no other EV startup in the last 5 years has been, ready to grasp the low-cost EV market by the balls, *with style*. Canoo's CEO said they simply will not be beaten on price by vehicles like the Cybertrunk and the Ford Lightning Rod. 

This week, insider lockup period expired and insiders did trade the stock, but they mostly didn't sell it ... they bought more. Canoo's CEO took his additional CEO pay in shares as well as some other members of the leadership team. Pair that with with fact that institutional ownership is also up this spring and things are interesting. 

Finally, some analysts continue to view Canoo as a hold with a price target of $18. This in conjunction with the Russell listing affirms my haphazard belief that Canoo is what I think it is, lightning in a bottle. Other analysts don't see it this way, but it makes me wonder how much time they spend researching a company before coming up with these outlandishly-bearish price targets.

TL;DR. Financials in check, manufacturing agreement lined up, green lighting factory in OK, being paid to do it ... üõ∂üöÄ

One may say I'm bullish af for the $GOEV Bangbus on the Mars. üöÄüöÄüöÄüõ∂üé∂üååüå†

2021-06-23 21:28:55,wallstreetbets,"Sir I didn‚Äôt average down BB just to make myself feel better, I‚Äôm buying more because I believe in its future just like I buy more of my Apple you spoke about because I believe in them too."
2021-06-23 22:01:50,wallstreetbets,Agreed with OP; always put a stop-loss and move on. Just cut your losses and do something productive instead of being petty on yourself ü•µ
2021-06-24 00:22:07,wallstreetbets,Average down on your winners from their ATH. Who in their right mind would average down on a lose.
2021-06-24 10:42:42,wallstreetbets,All I know is stonks only go up.
2021-06-23 20:36:07,wallstreetbets,I averaged down on lmnd calls all day yesterday and got paid today for my bold effort.
2021-06-23 20:49:31,wallstreetbets,Averaging down = buy the dips
2021-06-23 20:53:59,wallstreetbets,Yeah I always average up üòé
2021-06-23 21:52:51,wallstreetbets,"Solid use of emojis, GME to the moon!"
2021-06-23 23:37:27,wallstreetbets,I agree with the OP... buy high sell low.
2021-06-24 04:15:38,wallstreetbets,Disagree. Told my friend to average down on AMC. He didn‚Äôt. I did. Maybe not average down. But DCA. Same difference
2021-06-24 06:32:09,wallstreetbets,"I thought this too at first.

It does sound really retarded.

But then you see retards doubling down on a stock that they are sure is going to moon and it actually does. Which stock is the winner now?

I‚Äôm fine with extended yolos now. It‚Äôs definitely retarded, but meh."
2021-06-24 10:54:36,wallstreetbets,This is some full retard shit.
2021-06-23 21:03:34,wallstreetbets,"Clearly no one is getting it.  If you go to the barbershop to get a haircut and the barber takes your pants off and uses his scissors to cut your penis, my advice if you want a good haircut is not to return to that same barber because he having a special for 50% off"
2021-06-23 21:03:45,wallstreetbets,So much this. I was making angry sounds up to #3.
2021-06-24 01:34:29,wallstreetbets,"1 share at $400, 1000 shares at $100. Yeah, that's legit."
2021-06-23 21:11:09,wallstreetbets,You never go full retard. Someone did though. Oooof
2021-06-24 02:01:11,wallstreetbets,"You clearly cant read. He said dont rebuy your failures and buy your winners. You're going full retard, pull back some poncho."
2021-06-23 20:14:58,wallstreetbets,Can you even get Outlook on a blackberry or is Brick breaker still the main app?
2021-06-24 00:41:12,wallstreetbets,Finally someone gets it.  That‚Äôs ‚Äúaveraging up‚Äù though since it increases your cost basis
2021-06-23 21:13:15,wallstreetbets,"I agree, penis scissors is bad. Don‚Äôt do that."
2021-06-23 20:51:07,wallstreetbets,Oooh I like this. I use ‚Äúmake money make money‚Äù
2021-06-24 05:21:42,wallstreetbets,Even if he bought 50% at 400 and 50% at 100 he'd have an average of 250 which means he'd be well in the green when it went over 300 again...
2021-06-24 04:33:23,wallstreetbets,Only buy winners sound like a great way to either lose money or make no money.
2021-06-24 02:04:59,wallstreetbets,"He‚Äôs talking about averaging down, aka adding to your position when a stock drops and you got in at a higher price. With his rational being the stock is just gonna a keep doing down. Are you a literal retard or what guy? Think before you comment"
2021-06-23 20:12:16,wallstreetbets,What does a narc say when they are accused of being narc?
2021-06-23 22:07:57,wallstreetbets,You copy the content and added a little of your own I seen this information before without the garbage mouth piece
2021-06-24 02:53:00,wallstreetbets,Jesus it's like you cant even comprehend what you read. Just shut up.
2021-06-23 20:15:13,wallstreetbets,Ok fine u got me I‚Äôm an intern at citadel guess you retards are smarter than we thought :(
2021-06-23 22:12:33,wallstreetbets,"Prove it then, fucking idiot"
2021-06-24 02:57:19,wallstreetbets,Lmaooo you‚Äôre an idiot bro. ‚ÄúBag holders‚Äù of ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù stock like AMC who bought the top in February and averaged down over the next months have made out like bandits. That‚Äôs exactly what this guy is saying not to do. STFU and get some reading comprehension
2021-06-23 21:15:11,wallstreetbets,Yo can you help me get a job there?

2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$XOM Triple play combo pattern strategy, riding Crude Oil for the next 12 months There are several ways to play this Triple play combo pattern in $XOM.

Here is a straightforward one with today actions and the past months when you have been holding XOM:

1. Take profits from XOM Options, rotates it into commons, while it's still under valued. Build up XOM c.shares to collect more massive div.
2. Wait for some profit taken or pull back on options premium (like last week FED meeting) to rotate XOM div in leaps.
3. Repeat and keep riding XOM to $90 or the next 12 months, while crude oil maintain its level.

Only work when there is a triple play combo pattern for big money:- Massive dividends- Price actions- Low Options IV

Your move/play?

Edit 1:  This strategy can also be play for $XOM during market crash by buying low Options IV Puts as long as XOM doesn't cut it dividends -- which it didn't during the Crude Oil crash in 2020. Triple play combo pattern, plays both income and leverage low Options IV, while rotating to build up common shares for long term plays in both bull and bear market as long as div still hold...XOM is the best I see with this pattern! "
2021-06-23 21:21:22,wallstreetbets,"I like leaps for growth stocks and some blue chips but not so much for cyclicals- I‚Äôm bullish on oil for the next 6 months but not sure leaps are for me for Xom . Now I can‚Äôt mention the ticker, but if you google mino loc, you will see it. Now that is a stock that I want leaps on when they open up in the upcoming weeks."
2021-06-23 20:47:37,wallstreetbets,Oil is dead.
2021-06-24 16:27:17,wallstreetbets,What? $90 is the top but it‚Äôs at $64
2021-06-23 20:28:39,wallstreetbets,Are you doing ATM spreads? I‚Äôve never seen high enough premiums to do slightly OTM without having to trade double digit contracts.
2021-06-23 21:26:34,wallstreetbets,"XOM has YTD return of \~%54 with its low Options IV that can produce a 6-7 figures return in itself based on your risk tolerance so it's as good as growth stocks with high Option IV causing IV Crush quick with time decay if it doesn't work out.

Edit: not even including massive dividends you get from holding its share and building it up. that's a triple play combo pattern -=)"
2021-06-23 20:50:49,wallstreetbets,"Sure, it's only break 52-week high each week. Can't imaging when it alive lol"
2021-06-24 00:15:27,wallstreetbets,That was the 1st wave rise; the 2nd wave is set and ready to fly.
2021-06-24 16:28:55,wallstreetbets,Why not both? Oxy is a beta play. It will outperform  as oil goes up. XOM is similar but it‚Äôs a major so it‚Äôs a little safer. I like it
2021-06-23 20:32:49,wallstreetbets,I traded double digit contracts- I sold 30 62.5p/ 57p jul 2nd exp. and collected 6k -closed yesterday for 70 percents so 3800ish profit. Rolled out to a 65p 60p and collected another 5 k of off 20 contracts. I‚Äôm all about theta gang.
2021-06-23 20:34:59,wallstreetbets,"With inflation , I‚Äôm heavy into financials and oil - I just need them not to go down much and I just keep collecting . If I lose 30 percent- I close and roll a lower strike spread if I think it‚Äôs a dip. So far the strategy has been working."
2021-06-23 21:35:53,wallstreetbets,"Oh I agree. But with leaps, I feel like I‚Äôm using in a substitute for just buying the stock. I feel like I could make more money on just selling shorter term puts spreads.  I‚Äôm honestly kinda bearish on 2022-2023 with rate hikes, inflation , changes market conditions and consumer behavior - I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm married to the oil industry long term, but I think as a reflation trade this year, it‚Äôs a great play. If they increase dividends, it may shoot up another 30-40 percent over 12 months. I‚Äôm more worried about what the oil supply looks like, penetration by the ev market, possible policies changes out of Washington ‚Ä¶. So if I‚Äôm not sure about 3 years from now, I‚Äôm not sure I should pay for that time, even though it‚Äôs cheaper than a lot of other stocks."
2021-06-24 16:06:17,wallstreetbets,"1st wave in March 2020  
2nd wave in October 2020"
2021-06-23 20:54:31,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the info. Appreciate it
2021-06-23 21:07:43,wallstreetbets,"Sell put for income plays, nice!

Triple play combo pattern play both income and leverage low Options IV, while rotating to build up common shares for long term plays in both bull and bear market as long as div still hold...XOM is the best I see with this pattern!"
2021-06-23 22:01:00,wallstreetbets,"Not all Options leaps are the same, read my strategy post again ( the key is low Option IV). So no, buying leaps is not the same or even similar to buying/holding shares. It's part of a strategy that an be combined with another strategies. As for Crude Oil, read my post again, 12 months play, not 12 years play. But it can be played on both bull and bear market, which ever way it turns on us."
2021-06-23 21:13:13,wallstreetbets,"Selling bull put spreads on stocks that I‚Äôm bullish on seems to make me a lot more money than buying calls with ridiculous iv baked in or getting crushed during a sell off. Betting that Xom will stay in range or gradually increase is easy money. The only threat I see is if Iran dilutes the market heavily or cause opec to ramp up production. Even then, there is a shit ton of demand for at least the summer. Wti is trading at 73/ barrel and Xom is going to crush earnings ."
2021-06-23 21:16:22,wallstreetbets,Options Leaps reduce time decay risk.
2021-06-23 20:00:50,wallstreetbets,"Goodluck to you bro, oil is the move rn"
2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Betting on inflation. Ok so I think there‚Äôs gonna be massive inflation. All the videos I see of how to make money during inflation are absolute dogshit. I‚Äôm not gonna buy a fucking house, I‚Äôm not a trazilionare. So if I have a few thousand bucks how could I profit from inflation? I was thinking of shorting the US dollar or buying puts on UUP or calls on UDN but I‚Äôve been told that isn‚Äôt very smart. But then again neither am I do it might be a match made in heaven. So tell me how do you profit from inflation if I‚Äôm a WSB follower. The more risk the better."

2021-06-23 20:57:41,wallstreetbets,"Just borrow as much as you can with a low, fixed interest rate. This could mean a car, a house, etc. Or pay off your debt with a consolidated loan at a fixed rate because during recession, interest rates go up so it‚Äôs harder to borrow"
2021-06-23 20:59:01,wallstreetbets,"If you think massive inflation is in the horizon just go buy pure value plays. In theory all your money will lose value and any company dealing with everyday products will shoot through the roof.

Don't be crying afterwards though. SPY puts were on the menu as soon as COVID shut everything down... It all made perfect sense... 

Except everyone failed to consider that a country's (more so a worldwide leader's like the US) economy is not like a company. The instruments that they have to exert control are far beyond your comprehension and Burry's models."
2021-06-23 20:19:57,wallstreetbets,Guns and dehydrated food.
2021-06-23 21:02:10,wallstreetbets,"Low risk with yuge gains by next year silver (physical and PSLV)...inflation safe haven and massive new industrial consumption for years to come so it's going higher either way.
Housing market is bad idea right now...it wont keep going higher...will pay a lot for not much and then stuck with it.
REEs mining stocks...feed into first comment for massive solar consumption plus they're tied into getting green money from govt printed money that'll create a lot of the inflation.
Once it all comes crashing down again, anything that made huge gains 2009-2010 timeframe after housing bubble popped. The stock market right now IS the next bubble. 
Am guessing once this human-to-human bird flu gets out that'll be the next pandemic, so whatever did well August 2020 in height of lockdown. Stay away from supply chain related/dependent anything...it's fucked."
2021-06-23 22:04:31,wallstreetbets,Uranium.
2021-06-23 20:15:06,wallstreetbets,I think CLF and commodities will do well with rising inflation.

2021-06-23 22:47:31,wallstreetbets,Forget derivatives. Buy and hold $CLF
2021-06-24 02:16:11,wallstreetbets,Basically pick a shorted stock on here and go all in with your thousands. Even if the economy is going to hell the fuckers here will still be gambling and running up prices.

2021-06-24 01:55:56,wallstreetbets,"Jumping in to say UUP is stupid. It's based on other currencies that are also going to shit. So if those go to shit faster then UUP goes up even if inflation is super high.

Commodities are good but even those are manipulated by banks making fake paper gold/silver to fake supply, or China unloading stockpiles.

Look at invitation homes or KBH. They're a Blackrock spinoff and they're gobbling up all the starter homes everywhere with cheap debt so that you and I can't get them and have to rent them.

I also like the asset that must not be named here, but that has issues too."
2021-06-23 21:31:01,wallstreetbets,"Dr. Micheal Burry approves of this strategy. Scion's latest 13F filling shows they own a lot of TBT Calls, and TLT puts."

2021-06-23 21:29:47,wallstreetbets,You have to then acquire something that holds value or develop something that creates value with said money.

2021-06-24 06:14:48,wallstreetbets,Are you suggesting taking a loan to buy a car is a hedge against inflation?
2021-06-23 21:07:23,wallstreetbets,Any example stocks?
2021-06-23 20:22:59,wallstreetbets,Silver is a very bad investment. Has been all the time   It is the #1 pimp-n-dump in metals.

2021-06-24 02:20:26,wallstreetbets,Are you for real about this?
2021-06-23 20:25:21,wallstreetbets,It may be. But if Biden and the Left get what they want it will be Jimmy Carter 2.0 and unemployment will skyrocket. I lived it and the signs are there.

2021-06-23 21:49:49,wallstreetbets,"Nice, but does that mean to late to play this?  I don't know when he filed but I don't think thesis is dead.

I am long TBT shares for last couple weeks.  Nothing excessive"
2021-06-24 10:50:03,wallstreetbets,"i am in 6/2022 TBT $22.  Figure it is going to be a painful ride.  I will probably just average down over next 3 months until i hit my personal risk tolerance.  Reevaluate in 5 months.  I don't see any change to this without a recession or growth significantly slowing.

How far you out?"
2021-06-24 10:38:02,wallstreetbets,"It protects you a bit due to low interest and the actual amount you pay over time. During inflation, the value of your dollar goes down. If you borrow 30k, at a low interest rate, that 30k could turn into 35k next year, but you still only owe 30k, so now you have positive equity. And the low interest is a good protector during recession. In a recession your dollar goes up so you‚Äôd probably think, ‚Äúwhy shouldn‚Äôt I just buy then?‚Äù You can, it‚Äôs just harder and higher interest rates. It‚Äôs only beneficial to buy during recession if you have the money to blow and can pay it off somewhat quickly or if it‚Äôs dirt cheap and don‚Äôt mind interest. If you say, want to get a new car, now would be the time imo. Retail pricing can‚Äôt be beat because new car pricing doesn‚Äôt change much year to year. 30k at 4% is better than 31k at 8%, just an example. 

I definitely don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm an expert, I could be wrong on a few things but that‚Äôs my understanding. Also seems like inflation might keep going until next year before interest rates rise."
2021-06-24 04:24:39,wallstreetbets,"not financial advice, im just some retard with a tin foil hat and some bananas, but I think the Chinese stocks, BABA , BIDU and maybe NIO for growth are a good bet, because the Chinese government have proven they will bail out to protect their interests at all costs and are Ultimately successful, despite the FUD. 

I also bet heavy on the semiconductor supply chain, I,e TSMC. I also think if NVIDIA dips that's a banger aswell with acquisitions coming to play."
2021-06-23 21:13:08,wallstreetbets,"This is the dumbest sentence written on this sub. Look at 1970-80 and 2001-2011, the high inflation periods. What happened to gold and silver?"
2021-06-23 21:14:55,wallstreetbets,They'll offer around 400ish after taking into account its present value and taking their huge cut. Those place call pretty often to try to buy it
2021-06-24 07:15:48,wallstreetbets,It was moreso a younger in cheek about inflation because I'm nervous inflation is going to eat away at that future money so much

2021-06-24 12:43:57,wallstreetbets,Very important detail: if you want to buy a car ALREADY. People are saying buy real estate because the resale value of that stays or goes up almost guaranteed. Buying a car would just be dumb cause they lose 30% resale value as soon as you buy it.
2021-06-24 03:55:18,wallstreetbets,"Are you implying that, following these periods, we had deflationary periods? Because last time I remember, Inflation tends to be relatively consistent. Look it up if you'd like, multiple hedge funds have said its a bad hedge against inflation."
2021-06-23 21:19:05,wallstreetbets,Lol I would hold on to it for a couple more years it might come in handy if inflation takes off.

The used car market right now is a good example of this happening. Depreciation like that doesn‚Äôt apply to cars as a whole. 

Real estate is safe because people hang onto real estate for a decade or more, and this obviously applies to any investment- hang onto it long enough and it‚Äôll make you money. Your point is?"
2021-06-24 04:29:29,wallstreetbets,Those were high inflation periods. Hedge funds say whatever helps their positions.
2021-06-23 21:25:43,wallstreetbets,Well I would sell it bc of inflation. I'd rather have that cash from 2040 right now so I can invest or buy property since in 20 years that 2500 will have the buying power of like 1200
2021-06-24 13:33:32,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm legit interested. I would say 90% of cars are not worth buying as investment. You‚Äôd have to be knowledgeable about cars (don‚Äôt mind educating me). This is not the case for RE.

2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Globalstar ($GSAT) Shorts Could Get Slammed - Article Globalstar Inc (NYSE: GSAT) shot up 44% on Monday and Tuesday after B. Riley initiated coverage on the stock and announced a price target of $3.25.

Globalstar, a Covington, Louisiana-based satellite communications company, has not traded above $3 since April 2015 and until 2021 had spent the previous three years trading under $1.

In January, Globalstar became popular in Reddit communities and was targeted in a short squeeze that caused its shares to shoot up about 650% between Jan. 7 and Feb 10, topping out at $2.98.

Although the short interest on Globalstar's stock is relatively low at 6.94% some members of Reddit communities, such as WallStreetBets, have noticed irregularities in the stock's statistics.

Globalstar has very high levels of ownership, with insiders owning 59.43% of the total available shares and institutions owning 16.58%. With just over 76% of Globalstar's 628.58 million share float tied up, that leaves only about 150 million shares of the company available.

On Tuesday, 161 million shares of Globalstar changed hands which is 11 million more than what is available to retail traders.

The high level of volume on Globalstar's chart shows there is massive interest in the stock again and it could be setting up another big short squeeze.

The Globalstar Chart: After its meteoric rise at the beginning of the year, Globalstar plummeted over 70% between Feb 10 and April 21 when it found a bottom and reversed course.

The stock spent much of May and June trading sideways on relatively low volume until Monday when massive volume entered following the analyst's coverage.

On Tuesday sustained bull volume pushed Globalstar up over a resistance level at $1.66 that had been holding it down since March 18. The same day, Globalstar printed a large engulfing candlestick with a larger lower wick than at the top. This indicates when the price dipped into the low $1.50 level buyers came in and purchased the stock. This type of candle often means higher prices will come in the near future.

Globalstar is trading above both the eight-day and 21-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) with the eight-day EMA trending above the 21-day EMA, all of which are great signs for the bulls. The stock is also trading above the 200-day simple moving average which indicates the overall sentiment in Globalstar is bullish.

Bulls want to see continued bullish momentum push Globalstar's stock up over its next resistance level at $1.92. If it can regain the level as support, it was room to trade up toward $2.05.

Bulls should not feel disappointed to see some consolidation on Globalstar take place before its stock reaches higher levels because its relative strength index is overheating at about 72% and needs to cool down.

Bears want to see Globalstar reject its upper resistance level and for sellers to come in and drop the stock back down toward $1.66. If it were to lose that level as support it could fall back down to the $1.50 mark."

2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"How the fuck did Shorties become Personae non gratae? /RANT/ DD/   


All right, gents, no rockets, no crayons, no rainbows no funky shit. Just a pure, unadulterated rant.

I have a serious question to all of you here present venerable retards and pencil munching autists.  
How did we come to a point of hating short-sellers? And I am not talking about Citadel style shorties that hold RH by the gonads and dictate what is right and what should be blocked to fuck the small guy. I am talking about smaller outfits like Hindenburg, Culper, Spruce, Muddies etc.  I have followed  these dudes for the past 4-5 years for ideas that were against the establishment, kicking all the mutuals, 401k grampa plans and Long-Short equity old farts right in the nutsack.   


Sure, they make moneys off of uncovering accounting shenanigans, non-existent assets and narratives that are LSD-fuelled lucidum intervalum at best. But that's kind of the point, eh? Get money for bringing new information to our sleepy, passive money driven markets and hope that enough sensible investors catch the drift to get rid of hitherto misunderstood shit.

  
Sure, guys, there are shitbags trying to short and distort to earn a few meagre basis points, but these campaigns I am talking about are fucking elaborate. They don't aim to push it down by 5 points and bounce, this is not HFT to suck of few retail retards for their pennies before order placement,  but months of god damn unpleasant DD with some retards in South America (like the campaign against Tilray back in the days) and death threats to your kids for going after some brainless eunuchs in Bulgaria.  


I get it. These former market Anarchist became the establishment we want to fuck over and it's never nice when you hold few ks-worth ITM calls about to mature and some dip shit calls out the shitco on all the bullshit going behind the curtains. Happened to me, not good. (5/7, would no do again).   
But these are the rules of the game, we buy companies we barely understand, with fundamentals that are as far away from sensible as only possible and hope that enough apes land on the bait and push the shit up.  

I follow this nihilistic medium - WSB - since Shkreli (without an account then) and I could count financially sound companies coming out from this forum on one hand, perhaps two hands of a Cambodian village farmer. We bet on belief, say-so, hype, rumor and greater fool game-theoretical plays, so why the fuck arent't we going after those sweet plays that short-sellers serve us right under our noses?   


To close this rant, I have been following all the big and small names in short seller universe, read thousands of pages of their reports, built algos to evaluate their campaigns and estimate potential impact and how to size it. So far, with the exception of 2020, which was a fucking awful year for rational markets, it has worked better than funds of these short sellers themselves. So what I am trying to find out here, on this god-forsaken, conspiracy-ridden, masochistic platform is, why the fuck, aren't we loading up on puts when all of these Axlers, Blocks or Gregos announce they found a fucking zero, fraud, criminal empty shells acting as revenue-generating entities.  


Rant - over.  
Thank you for your attention and very likely, negative karma a turds going in my direction.  


P.S.: I don't give shit if these short-seller campaigns get more traffic or more hate. In the end, markets discover that a turd in a diet Snickers packaging is just a fancy looking shite. And all turds go down the drain at the end of the day (unless you are a German connoisseur indulging in these tart delicacies), I will make my greens and retirement funds will observe in disbelief, that the good guy CFO bailed out with a $50mil golden parachute.

2021-06-24 01:59:42,wallstreetbets,"Because it's in vogue to pretend like they're ""activist"" investors because they short, but really it should be the other way around. The half-assed anti SPAC campaign by hindenberg comes to mind. They were right about RIDE, but let's be honest here; it's about the amount of work they put in. The recent DKNG hit piece was godawful. They were 100% trying to push the price down over nonissues (in terms of profitability). They're acting all ""high and mighty"", but really it's about making money for them, and they picked a stupid thing to harp on. They were wanting to short the company and gathered just enough confirmation bias to move forward and bring the price down a ""whopping"" 9% pre-market (honestly it's what I saw after reading the article that Monday, but my point stands that it was literally nothing, as the share price has more than recovered the loss).

They're not the only ones in the business of pretending to care to make a buck. They all act like they're the hero from the big short, but they're just leeches. Every now and again, they do something right by exposing a company trying to defraud investors and vote with their wallet. The vast majority of their time is spent spinning things that aren't technically lies into something Big Bad Corporations are Doing to Hurt You. Fuck em."

2021-06-24 05:23:59,wallstreetbets,"I think if short selling had more limitations and couldnt essentially drive a company out of business Id see its value. But when it comes to ppl genuinely trying to discover a price and short sellers just keep manufacturing synthetic shares driving the price down further and further, they kind of deserve to get the shaft. Had they been profitable they may have cost hundreds or thousands of ppl their jobs. Its difficult to feel sympathetic towards that kind of business strat considering the number of money making methods that dont result in someone elses family going hungry. *shrug*"
2021-06-24 05:45:50,wallstreetbets,"Because there are millions of people on this sub now and we have regressed to the lowest common denominator.

2021-06-24 06:44:29,wallstreetbets,"I think it's the idea that shorts aren't contributing anything meaningful or a product to the economy or the world. They are simply making money off other's misfortune.  Add to that the idea that they are using the media to manipulate a companies image, driving the stock down even further. bankrupting companies and causing people to lose their jobs for the sake of profit.

It is kinda interesting now that you mention it. But we've become so polarized as a society recently, a lot of Us vs Them mentality, so it's not much of a stretch from there. But in my opinion, the fact that they are betting on red is a Negative action at its core and feels more cynical/evil than say, buying a stock and contributing to the effort and joining the ""team"""

2021-06-23 22:30:50,wallstreetbets,"I agree shorts offer a third party a way to profit from uncovering fraud, but fraud can also be discovered by the government, customers, long investors, or competitors and the courts can help hold fraudulent companies accountable."
2021-06-23 20:02:47,wallstreetbets,"That's the big question.  


If you follow bad short sellers, you get bad attempts at sinking small companies with unclear business plan and small float.  
if you follow good short sellers, you get the full serving of why the business doesn't deserve the valuation they are getting. No shortcuts, no heuristics. And I am not talking about what these guys post on twitter - thats just a digest, if you go through the pdf, page by page, you can easily find why they believe what they present and you are free to disagree and buy the dip.  
I like it both ways, buying shorts I do not agree with (those based on panic and valuation) & shorting campaigns based on fraud, accounting manipulation and concealed criminal record of key persons.  


In the end, it depends on whether you read the report and if the source is someone with solid reputation. Shit leads to shit and quality, more often than not, produces quality.  


Cheers!"
2021-06-24 07:08:10,wallstreetbets,"i agree, but honestly overall I love that people other than the upper class are getting involved and trying to learn what they wouldnt teach us growing up. I now can make (and then immediately lose ofc) in a day from my bed, what I used to bust my ass for two weeks working out of my mind for, all because I wasnt taught how to. because essentially- we can't all be rich. I dont think its an accident we (in general) didnt learn how to invest but definitely learned all about random shit like roman history. they taught us quadratic formulas, but somehow forgot to teach us how to abuse tax write offs. every step of the way they try to keep us out. i get it tho, someone has to hold the bags and be the greater fool ;) these burgers wont flip themselves. and whats the point of a lambo if everyone has one?

that being said, I fucking hate seeing a whole thread of people posting their positions, all comparing like I give a shit what they bought at. that and claiming everything is a squeeze/going to the moon and emoting rockets and asking what the price will be at some specific time/date like i wouldnt be a billionaire already if i knew"

2021-06-23 21:35:44,wallstreetbets,"It's hard for me to get the data, since I am not in the short seller industry but by rough estimates and some heuristics, they are far from being large. Sure, large for a retail crayon eater like ourselves, but they probably work with 2/20 fee structure. At approx $150mil, that's not that much to finance a team of 4 to 8 people in the US (I guess these are educated dudes with masters at least).  
So rich and not rich. Some of their campaigns are wonderful but I am willing to bet that very few make returns upwards of 30% pa on a consistent basis to make some reasonable buck for the GPs.  


On a different note, shorting is fucking awful. As you said, it can only go to 0, so a maximum of 100% unleveraged return (and Dollar volume changes suggests there isn't that much juice to handle a leveraged position). If it goes against you and you try to diamond hand it like a true retard, you can be 300-500% up (down) on a position (aka how a 5% position becomes a 20% position with a prompt FUUUUUUCK and no performance fees for the bois)"
2021-06-23 20:28:16,wallstreetbets,"Agree, yet I was talking about small short-seller outfits. Not the Citadels, not the Melvins. These guy short about 20-40% of their fund or whatever capital they manage, that's what I have estimated looking at volume movements across the targeted names in the past 4 years (lot of assumptions). So no leverage per se is applied, if you consider leverage anything above your initial capital.  


Your last sentence hits the nail - I got fucked quite a few times, and shit was I furious. Deep ITM calls, nice long positions. But in the end, I was holding something I barely understood only for the sake of holding it and riding some retail momentum. I got fucked but it was my fault that I skimmed the DD only to ride some WSB pseudo-research. After the initial cussing and m\*therfucking, I read their reports and saw, that I am the retard in the game and should adjust my play accordingly if I want to jump on a group-think bandwagon.  


Quite honestly, I don't think they are printing money. Only a few if any have 13Fs submissions, indicating they are rather small players. (Obviously not talking about the malevolent players of this February).

2021-06-23 21:05:14,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. Not all shorts are evil, but sadly all evil market manipulators are shorts."
2021-06-23 21:24:21,wallstreetbets,"It must be a dick to behold if some shorties withstood 200-300% movements against them before being vindicated.

2021-06-23 20:35:15,wallstreetbets,"The entire derivatives market and the gambling on it led to the 2008 crash, and you know who took that one in the balls the worst? Regular Americans that never had profited off all the wild speculation and fraudulent activities. I don't think there would be a problem with shorting if it were controlled properly. There's just too much fake money all over the place and the people riding high won't have to pay for it, it's all the regular folks that will.

Look at the people that bounced back right after 2008 vs the regular people that took years to recover, and we have that debt forever.

A lot of people are just sick of this cycle."
2021-06-23 20:52:29,wallstreetbets,The act of shorting does nothing but impede price discovery and is a burden on the system.
2021-06-23 20:10:08,wallstreetbets,"I would argue to the contrary.  
Let's use an example: I get Spruce Point's report to my email, when he publishes it on twitter. I muted him on twtr, because he is way too noisy and notifications every 10 seconds at work are rather unpleasant. I open it, get a coffee, spend 40-50minutes reading it and understanding his arguments and then decide if it has merit or if he is blowing up the claims to his advantage (it's business after all and nobody is 100% right always). So far, I would say it is pretty straightforward.   
I know that I will not catch the initial drop, I don't have an algo and neither do I have any insider knowledge of his publishing time. But if you agree with his thesis, that the company or the execs seem like lying pile of shite, you wait for the moment when algos start covering and then you go short for the 10-15% bump on a minor position commensurate to your risk profile.  


Overall, easy profit on a well structured and substantiated investment, that costs you less than 1 hour of work."
2021-06-23 21:09:32,wallstreetbets,"Oh boy have I been burned.  
Not that long ago that I was buying SPAC names from Chamath. As much as I wish him good fortunes, he fucked over a big portion of the retail market by pushing his bullshit on twitter and by extension reddit.  


Lost a few Ks on Chammath. But it's interesting to see how short of a memory we have. I was a kiddo when the big guys were pushing dotcom shitcos, all long, all platforms prior to reddit buzzing with these names. Buy & sell an hour later for 50% easy money.  


I would dare to say that hyping longs nowadays is much much easier that shorts (as I found out, RH doesn't allow outright shortselling - that's a few $ bn lost)"
2021-06-24 00:16:43,wallstreetbets,"I'm pretty sure that there are a lot more pump and dump schemes (where the crooks make the money on the long side) than there are short sellers who spread fake news to try to sink a good company.

It's just easier to pump and dump, and people have been doing it forever."
2021-06-23 20:45:19,wallstreetbets,"2008's GFC was rough and interestingly enough, we are seeing some of these products making a comeback - synthetic CLOs, CDOs and all of that lovely bunch. Sure the regulatory environment got much stricter, but you are pitting the finance industry against the SEC and we know who wins in this race (who won, I am already seeing higher traffic on these ""weapons of mass capital destruction"").

I for one view the short-sellers as the embodiment of the pissed of investor. I have accepted the written, the spoken and the declared for so long, taking it as the truth (!), and suddenly some guy appears who had a couple of interns sitting in front of the factory for the past 3 months, counting how many trucks are entering and leaving, how filled they are and so on. His observation leads to one simple argument- this is one big fat fucking lie. ""1 quarter of observation lead us to believe, their sales, revenue and OCF numbers are largely inflated"".  
And to be honest, I love that. I got chewed during the GFC and lost more than I am willing to admit. Now I can get my hands/portfolio off from a company that reeks of self-serving accounting misrepresentation and managerial fuckery."
2021-06-23 21:02:19,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate your input, but shorting is an integral part of price discovery.  
I recall one study that was looking at Hong Kong stock market during a brief period of total short-selling ban. This whole episode led to egregious overvaluations in some companies that would otherwise be brought down. You need both sides of the coin to understand what the coin looks like.  
There are quite a few papers from the last 3 or 4 decades that studied the benefits of short-sellers on market information, asymmetry and, finally, cleansing. Worth a read!

PS: again and again, I am not talking about 140% float short effected by Melvin. Those guys fucked up big time and became a laughing stock not only on the market but among the short-sellers as well.

I mentioned that guy a few comments up, but some time ago there was some legit farmer-financier dude betting on re-opening of the US dining industry.  
You can probably find him via google, but his bets were sweet, well substantiated semi-insider & non-obvious bets on live cattle futures (e.g. LE Aug 31). I don't trade futures or options on futures but have followed the trade since to see how it unfolds. And Lo & behold, if I entered at the time of reading I would be taking a loong break now with a hundred grand under my seat.  


Yet instead I am waiting out my autistic calls on meme stock I did not cover at 200% gain, like the fucking retard I am"
2021-06-23 21:07:59,wallstreetbets,"Right, I understand we are not talking about the GME situation. Selling has the exact effect you are describing when it comes to price discovery. These ""sky high"" valuations you are discussing in my opinion are shareholders finally getting a piece of the pie."
2021-06-23 21:20:55,wallstreetbets,"How is it getting a piece of pie, when you know the company is never going to justify the value? (as, for example, one recent WSB-smoothbrain-paid financial analysis of AMC from the Medium demonstrated)  
Forgive me, I might be oldschoool, but any company value/capitalization in my view is just a reflection of the company's ability to generate cash now or in the future. If there is no ability, plan or hitherto misunderstood surprise strategy to generate these sales, we are just buying the CEO's dreams of grandiose future.  
\- fair enough, some are great visionaries that can deliver either sales or new , even grander dreams.   
But in the end, if a short seller comes and says that your beloved visionary has had 4 bankruptcies in the past, criminal record for pilfering shit from his first company and several unresolved issues with the SEC, I am more than happy to knows these facts that I myself am unable to find."
2021-06-23 21:36:27,wallstreetbets,"Every investor has a choice to make before they hit that buy button. If collectively these purchases result in valuations that seem too high for you, dont buy. It's that simple. High valuations aren't a burden on the market it's simply people making money you didn't get in on. Valuations come down with natural fluctuation of the market (aka selling, yes it happens). 

As far as valuation is concerned it's not up to entities with more money and risk appetite to decide what is overvalued and what is not. The market takes care of this. If an investor likes what they are purchasing and  wants to overwrite what YOU believe (remember valuation is an opinion) the stock is worth that is entirely up to the buyer. 

The problem lies within the power that the act of short selling is found to have on the market when wielded by extremely wealthy entities. We have seen this year how it disrupts natural price discovery and has been used specifically as a tool to sway bad trades in an entities favor. This is why I believe the practice does more harm than good. 

In summation, the market doesnt need additional help finding the price. This is what selling does for the market on the downside. Short selling's drawbacks far outweigh the perceived benefit in my opinion."
2021-06-23 22:05:57,wallstreetbets,"Good argument, yet I am still inclined to belief that the most efficient way to find real value, be it stock, bond or convert, is to allow movement in all directions. A handful of informed investors losing their conviction about particular company isn't going to move the needle, unless we are talking about large institutionals and if the informed few aren't sufficient in numbers to provide informational groundwork for the larger funds holding our pension plans or university endowments, these will simply continue holding these questionable positions - as there is no significant downward pressure. In the absence of short-selling no outright remuneration to dig out the dirty bits exists. If I understand the business correctly, big part of short-seller's daily operations and the ultimate strategy is to convince big boy holders that these stocks are shite. Not us, the bottom feeders who may add 7% to the ADV if we feel like it (or perhaps 10% if Mr Shitron orders us to do so..)  
All of my arguments about the merit of short-selling boil down to the actual reward for uncovering hitherto unknown negative information; not an outright attempt to sway the market your way by means of overwhelming it - like some crazed guys from Citadel (I bet they got rid of them very shortly afterwards) and the idiot at the helm of Melvin did.  
To be frank (and I know a lot of hate, shit and profanity is coming my way), Citadel and Melvin weren't wrong for shorting GME and AMC. These companies were dying out, their fundamentals were bad enough to dissuade any institution from holding them. What happened in February was remarkable, not because we beat the shit out of large funds, but because we brought those companies back to life. They could issue new equity, refinance mounting debt and continue as a going concern, which was questionable at best But in the end, these companies were meant to die. Like Blockbuster and MySpace, their age is gone and whatever comes next is a new plan that has nothing to do with their financials & business plan from Q1 2021."
2021-06-23 22:46:28,wallstreetbets,I hate to summarize such a lengthy arguement this way but buying and selling IS price discovery in both directions. Anything outside of that is bloated gambling (derivatives market is worth 1 quadrillion) or price manipulation (gme/amc.) Blockbuster did not need the help of the derivative market on the way down. Selling would have done the trick. I know WSB is very fond of their calls/puts but I dont see it as a necessity.
2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"RITE AID ( RAD ) AFTER HOURS ON EVE OF Q1 EARNINGS ANNOUCNEMENT HEADLINE READS: ""Rite Aid CEO - Our vaccine rollout was much bigger than expected"". [Stock is rising after hours on comments by CEO. Earnings announcement due out before market open Thursday, June 24, 2021.] \[NOTE: The following article was released on June 23, 2021 at 4:40 PM ET\]

**Inundated with people trying to get a vaccine**

When Rite Aid ( $RAD ) stepped up to help distribute coronavirus vaccines as part of the nationwide rollout, the demand was overwhelming.¬†

‚ÄúWe never thought we would get inundated with people trying to get a vaccine,‚Äù Rite Aid CEO Heyward Donigan said in a discussion panel moderated by Yahoo Finance Editor in Chief Andy Serwer as part of the Milken Institute's Future of Health Summit. The panel also featured Medtronic ( MDT ) CEO Geoff Martha and Labcorp ( LH ) CEO Adam Schechter.

""There was no battle for turf‚Äù between the different drugstore chains like CVS ( $CVS ), Walgreens ( $WBA ), and Rite Aid, Donigan added. ‚ÄúIt was just all-hands-on-deck with the labs and anybody else that you could get to help you because at this point, you're not trying to save the company, you're trying to save the world.‚Äù 

According to Donigan, one of the biggest challenges Rite Aid faced in meeting the unprecedented demand for the COVID-19 vaccine was creating an appointment scheduling platform. It was especially difficult for certain jurisdictions like Pennsylvania, which did not have scheduling tools for vaccines.

Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, patients could walk in to receive vaccines for shingles or pneumonia, or get a flu or strep test. However, this all changed over the past year and a half when Rite Aid realized the need for an effective scheduling system that allows patients to book their own appointments.

‚ÄúWe developed, in partnership with many of these different jurisdictions, our own scheduling tool, and that was pretty intense,‚Äù Donigan said. ‚ÄúYou wouldn't think it would be that intense, but it actually has taken us many months to get this tool up and running in a way that is really user-friendly.‚Äù

 **Adapting to the pandemic**

Even before the onset of the pandemic, Donigan said that Rite Aid already placed a ‚Äúsignificant emphasis‚Äù on incorporating digital technology into the customer experience. She cited Rite Aid‚Äôs mobile app, new website, and new digital experiences for its pharmacy benefit management (PBM) business, in which Rite Aid serves as a Medicare Part D insurance company that covers prescriptions for seniors.

And in addition to its pharmacy business and PBM company, Rite Aid also has a significant amount of front-end retail business. She stated that the pandemic pushed the company towards improving their e-commerce fulfillment capabilities, an area in which they were lagging behind prior to the pandemic.

‚ÄúOur digital capabilities were accelerated significantly during the pandemic,‚Äù Donigan said. ‚ÄúWe're actually pretty fortunate in that we were able to respond as quickly and take advantage of these 180% growth rates that many \[retailers\] saw in the digital space.‚Äù 

The pandemic also forced Rite Aid to shift its clinic staff to be able to fulfill telehealth consultation roles in a very short time frame, Donigan said. She emphasized Rite Aid‚Äôs pharmacists roles as being the main facilitators between patients and health systems.¬†

Although Rite Aid is incorporating telehealth in its in-store consultation and new virtual care rooms, Donigan noted that telehealth will not become a main component of the drugstore chain‚Äôs business.

‚ÄúGoing forward, we're focused exclusively on our pharmacy,‚Äù Donigan said. ‚ÄúAnd so we are in the process of considering a launch of a teleRX business where \[patients can\] do telepharmacy consults with a provider who can then prescribe a prescription that can get filled in our stores.‚Äù

Donigan also emphasized that Rite Aid was not acquired by Walgreens, and still remains an independent, publicly-traded organization. However, she stated that the company did sell some stores to Walgreens, which is reflected in Rite Aid‚Äôs $25 billion projected annual revenue this year."

2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$FIGS as a long-term investment I know there are tons of discussions about stocks with a possible short squeeze but this isn't one of them.  I am talking about a long term investment strategy with a recently IPO'ed company called Figs ($FIGS).

**Fact #1**: its revenue grew 140% or so.  You can verify this with their S-1 filing below

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1846576/000119312521151936/d29047ds1.htm#toc29047\_9](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1846576/000119312521151936/d29047ds1.htm#toc29047_9)

**Fact #2**: gross margin of 72% / EBIT of 26% / NPS 81

They are considered to be the $LULU (Lululemon) of scrubs and guess what their gross margin was when they went public.  50.9%.  NPS score for Lululemon is now hovering around 32 ([https://www.comparably.com/brands/lululemon-athletica#nps](https://www.comparably.com/brands/lululemon-athletica#nps)).  

**Fact #3**: before I got into their IPO and ended up buying more shares, I have done some research.  Yes, I am a bit of a nerd but also a former management consultant.  So I reached out to over 60+ healthcare professionals about their experience and the product.  Some videos for you ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59NkA6X4Br8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59NkA6X4Br8)) ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXlplUeqCeM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXlplUeqCeM))

Key takeaways

\- better fit

\- a must have specially for female healthcare workers

\- more than a dozen healthcare workers (mainly assistants, front desk) said they would forego shopping other products so they can have one pair of Figs scrubs.  ""It's like having an LV bag.  You have to have at least one even if you can't afford to have one""

\- Overwhelming number of them (all but one) said it's worth the money and they will never go back to their previous scrubs

**Fact 4#**: market potential is enormous.  22 million healthcare workers in the US alone ([https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/04/who-are-our-health-care-workers.html#:\~:text=There%20were%2022%20million%20workers,American%20Community%20Survey%20(ACS)](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/04/who-are-our-health-care-workers.html#:~:text=There%20were%2022%20million%20workers,American%20Community%20Survey%20(ACS)).)  and they spend $22,000 in their lifetime and about $570 a year ([https://www.barrons.com/articles/figs-jumps-as-wall-street-predicts-growth-51624308042](https://www.barrons.com/articles/figs-jumps-as-wall-street-predicts-growth-51624308042)).  Yes.  That's $12.5 billion in scrub/apparel sales per year for the US market alone.  Imagine the market potential through geographic expansion into other countries.  This can be massive!

**Fact #5**: not everyone will buy Figs and that's okay.  It's the same with Lululemon as well.  It's expensive and maybe you have 1 out of 5.  If you assume that consumers will behave similarly to Figs, what is it worth?  Figs market cap is at $7.8 billion and is trading at $46.  Lululemon is at $48.6 billion as I am writing this and is trading at $359.

**Fact #6**: not all of you will be convinced that this is a good investment and that's okay.  Not all of you believed that my recommendation was decent went I recommended $WANT (5x return), $FAS (7x return), TNA (7x return) among others.  But I believe this has the 10x potential if not 7-8x potential in the next 3-7 years so I made a significant investment in it.  

Would love to get your thoughts on this!"

I got high and drew some lines earlier this week on WKHS and decided to enter a very large position which I exited for around 80% gain today.

**2) TLRY**

As you can see via my new imaginary lines, TLRY is poised to break out because I say so, and I say this will happen tomorrow. It also just genuinely seems to have bottomed and is gaining more positive sentiment with all of the legalizations coming. Once we hit $20 there is a gap to fill to $22, so that is my price target.

&#x200B;

Also there is about 10% short interest for TLRY. Not enough to really matter but just enough to give me a chub every time I think about this gaining momentum.

2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Strong Upside for Dick's ($DKS) DD Did a [recent post for $MNST](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o6kycx/dont_be_scared_of_an_investment_into_monster_mnst/) and following up with one about $DKS

Investment Thesis:

* Recently, due to the pandemic, many sporting goods stores have struggled to make money, and the sector is expected to bounce back this year.
   * Dicks was one of the ‚Äúlucky‚Äù few to report a profitable year. However, Dicks did not just have a profitable year, they were able to have an incredible year and impress investors by beating estimates by a long shot.
* As a result of their recent successes, I have decided to look into Dick‚Äôs and find out if it is a good investment, and if they can keep outperforming their industry competition.
* According to my valuation techniques Dicks is undervalued and has the potential to grow.
   * By following the plan set out in this report, if everything goes to plan, the potential return of an investment into Dicks will be 23.77%.
* There are risks to every investment, these risks are highlighted at the end of the report.  

   * Along with the risks, there are several catalysts that are also listed at the end of this report.

Company Overview:

Founded in 1948,[Dick‚Äôs Sporting Goods](https://utradea.com/stocks/DKS) is a leading sporting goods retailer in the USA that offers high-quality equipment, apparel, footwear, and accessories to their customers. Currently, there are 730 Dick‚Äôs locations across the USA, and own/operate 125 Golf Galaxy, and Field & Stream stores (also in the USA).

Dick‚Äôs goal is to create confidence and excitement by equipping their ‚Äúathletes‚Äù (customers) with the necessary equipment to enjoy their sporting experience.

Investment Information:

*Macroeconomic Outlook:*

COVID-19 had a negative impact on the sporting goods and sportswear industries. However, some companies were able to perform well due to their ability to change their operations to fit around COVID (ie. Online DTC, curbside pick-up etc.). The companies that were able to adapt the quickest and most effectively were the ones that succeeded big time. Fortunately, Dicks already had an E-Commerce presence, but due to the pandemic were able to focus on this channel more and further develop their online store to be one of the best. Dick‚Äôs was able to grow their online sales by 100% YoY due to the pandemic and their increased focus on their eCommerce store.

Due to the pandemic, many sports leagues were closed down, as people were advised to stay at home. Although this was not favourable for sporting good companies, there was an increased participation in home workouts and increased demand for activewear. This helped companies to offset their losses in sporting goods and perform well financially during the pandemic.

Although this industry was hit hard, they are expected to bounce back very quickly as the world starts to open back up again. This industry is expected to grow 14.7% this year, and 7% yearly until 2025. However, as we know, Dick‚Äôs performed well last year, and I expect them to outperform other companies as the USA starts to reopen.

*Financial Information:*

* **Financial Performance (Good):** Over the past year Dick‚Äôs has been able to increase their revenues by 9.5%, while only exhibiting an increase in the cost of revenue of 5.44%. This helped to increase Dick‚Äôs gross profit by 19.42% and increase their net income by 78.26%. Furthermore, Dick‚Äôs was able to increase their profit margin to 31.8% (from 29.2%) and increase their operating income by 97.60%. This financial performance is fantastic and gets investors excited about future financial performances and potential future expansion.
* **Financial Performance (Bad):** Over the past year, Dick‚Äôs has increased their interest expense by 186.93%, which is a lot, and is a result of them taking on 85.19% more debt. It is not good to see them taking on this much debt. However, they should be able to pay off their debt as their current and quick ratios are good.
* **Share Repurchase Program:** On June 12th, 2019, the board of directors approved a 5-year share repurchase program, that authorizes over $1B of funds available to repurchase shares. If these shares were all to be purchased (assuming their current price of $95.01), they would be able to purchase 10,525,208 shares over the next 3 years, which would increase the value of existing shares by 12.79% Knowing this we can expect 292,367 shares to be purchased each month, increasing the value of existing shares by roughly 0.33% per month.
* **Opening Stores:** In 2020, Dick‚Äôs was able to add 2 of their own stores and 2 of their specialty concepts stores to their total number of stores open. The fact that they were able to add new shares during the pandemic is a good sign given the fact that retail stores did not perform very well in 2020. It will be interesting to see this year‚Äôs number of new stores given the re-opening of the country and getting things ‚Äúback to normal‚Äù.
* **Liquidity:** Dick‚Äôs has increased their cash and cash equivalents position by 2292.64% to $1.66B. This huge cash position should help them to be able to meet short term cash and interest requirements. It would be nice to see them use some of this cash to expand operations and try to grow rather than their cash sitting idle, however it provides a safety net, which will draw in investors.
* **Convertible Shares:** Currently, Dick is has a total of 849,000 possible shares that are not yet issued and will be issued if their instrument(s) are converted. If all of these shares were to be converted, it would cause a dilutionary effect of 0.95%.
* **Equity Compensation Plan:** Under Dick‚Äôs equity compensation plan they have 4,352,896 shares that are yet to be issued through the exercise of warrants, rights, and options. Additionally, they have 848,800 shares in actual common shares that are yet to be issued. Totaling these two figures arrives at a total of 5,201,696 shares that are yet to be issued under their plan. However, if these shares were to be issued it would cause a dilutionary effect of 5.83%.

*Corporate Social Responsibility:*

According to the US Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment, the total Assets-Under-Management (AUM) for companies increased by 42% over the past two years.

Environmental, Social, and Governance, have social missions and aim for equality in the workplace. People who are investing into these types of companies are said to be sustainable investors. Knowing that this type of investing is growing quick can be good for companies like Dick‚Äôs who are constantly looking for ways to be more responsible.

*What Dick‚Äôs has already done:*

* Dicks has already diverted 29,000 pounds of plastic waste from landfills and oceans via their partnership with First Mile.
* Dicks has reduced their (scope 1&2) GHG emissions by 28%.

*What Dick‚Äôs is planning to do:*

* **2021 Goals:** Maintain their gender pay ratio of 100%. This means that they pay men and women the same for the same roles in the company no matter if it is a member of management or an employee.
* **2024 Goals:** By 2024, Dick‚Äôs plans to donate enough money and merchandise so that they can give over 1,000,000 kids the chance to play sports.
* **2025 Goals:** By 2025, Dicks plans to eliminate all single-use point-of-sale plastic from all of their stores nationwide. Furthermore, Dick‚Äôs is also planning to meet disclosure standards their Human Rights Watch Transparency Pledge for all of their vertical brands.

*Comparable Analyses:*

In order to undergo this analysis, I compared Dick‚Äôs financial ratios to that of their public competitors (found above in the ‚Äúcompetitors‚Äù section).

*EV/EBITDA:*

By undergoing this comparable, I was able to find the fair value of Dick‚Äôs to be $97.27, which would imply a share price increase of 3.29% from current prices. This supports the argument that Dick‚Äôs is undervalued, however this comparable argues that Dick‚Äôs is undervalued by far less than the DCF estimates Dick‚Äôs to be.

*EV/Revenue:*

These comparable estimates the fair value of Dick‚Äôs to be $88.88, which would imply a share price decrease of 5.62%. Unlike the previous 2 valuations, this comparable argues that Dick‚Äôs is overvalued, so I decided to undergo one more comparable to get a final verdict.

*P/E:*

By undergoing this comparable, the fair value of Dicks was estimated to be $104.33, which would imply a share price increase of 10.79%. This supports the fact that Dick‚Äôs is undervalued, however I decided to take the average of the comparable to get one final comparable price target.

*Average Comparable:*

By taking the average result from the 3 comparable analyses underwent, I arrived at one final estimate of $96.83/share. This indicates that Dick‚Äôs is slightly undervalued and presents a good buying opportunity.

Plan:

Based off of the valuation techniques underwent in this analysis, I was able to formulate a plan on how I would play this.

Buying Dick‚Äôs between its current price ($94.17) and the average comparable price ($96.83), would be a great buying opportunity and help to limit the downside risk of such an investment.

If the price falls below $93, I will sell my position and look for a re-entrance at the $88.88 level.

I would consider selling half of my position at $104.33, and the other half if the price reaches $128.78.

Risks:

* **Share Dilution:** Dick‚Äôs has a couple different forms of dilution that investors need to watch out for. These include convertible shares and equity compensation plans. Together, these two forms can account for a maximum share dilution of 6.78%. However, this dilution may be offset by their repurchasing. Lastly, this level of dilution is not of much concern for a company that is growing as quick as Dick‚Äôs Sporting Goods is.

Catalysts:

* **Financial Performance:** despite the global pandemic, Dick‚Äôs was able to have a fantastic financial performance in 2020. They increased their revenues, margins, profits, and income during this period, which cannot be said by many other sporting good companies. Dick‚Äôs great \[performance amidst uncertainty and poor retail conditions sparked my interest and the interest of many other investors who think that Dick‚Äôs can continue their great performances.
* **Share Repurchase:** As previously mentioned, Dick‚Äôs can repurchase up to $1B in shares. If they were to do this, they would increase the value of existing shares by 12.79%. This would be fantastic for investors, however, even if they only repurchase half of the available shares, they would still be able to offset their total dilution as mentioned above. Just knowing this is great news for investors, however we need to be alert and tracking them repurchases to determine how many shares they are purchasing every month to see if they are meeting expectations.
* **Social Responsibilities:** As mentioned previously, many people are turning to socially responsible investing. The fact that this type of investing is growing as quickly as it represents an opportunity for Dick‚Äôs to attract investors and increase demand for their shares. If they meet the targets, they set out and perhaps set new and more ambitious ones, they will be drawing in more potential investors, which should drive their prices higher.

* There is a big opportunity for non-alcoholic beverage companies‚Äô post-pandemic, with the demand of beverages from restaurants resurfacing as they go back to full capacity
   * This can help beverage companies especially if they are able to maintain their current level of at-home sales.
* Given my valuation techniques, and the valuations of analysts, there is a broad consensus that Monster beverages is undervalued and presents a good buying opportunity.
* Based off of the plan that I formulated near the end of this report there is a potential upside to an investment in Monster of 14.13%.
   * However, there are always risks to investments which are highlighted later in this report.

Company Information:

Monster develops, markets, sells, and distributes their energy drink beverages under 32 different brand names, most notably Monster, Reign, and NOS.

For reporting purposes, Monster has 3 operating/reporting segments:

* Monster Energy Drinks
* Strategic Brands
* Other Brands

AFF (American Fruits and Flavors) develops and manufactures the flavours for Monster‚Äôs drinks. After these flavors are perfected/approved, the recipes are passed on to third-party bottlers and packers. This means that Monster does not manufacture their own drinks, but they outsource them.

Investment Information:

*Macroeconomic Outlook:*

The beverage industry was heavily affected by COVID and the lockdowns that ensued. COVID forced restaurants, bars, bistro‚Äôs etc. to shut their doors, which meant that they would no longer need to be purchasing beverages from the beverage companies that the carry. This resulted in a massive decline in sales in this segment for beverage companies. However, some beverage companies offset this loss through exhibiting an increased number of in-home consumption/sales.

As we are starting to open back up the demand for beverages from restaurants will start to pick up as well, and hopefully return back to normal. However, it will be interesting to see if these beverage companies can still maintain a higher level of in-home sales than pre-pandemic times. If these companies can manage to do that and the demand from restaurants picks back up, they will be able to post great revenues and perhaps beat earnings estimates. If these companies beat these estimates than it is very likely that we see their stock price shoot up as a result.

Analysts are forecasting a bounce back once we start to reopen as well, as they have projected the non-alcoholic beverage industry will grow at a 6% CAGR over the next 5 years.

These trademarks are not advantageous to Monster based off of the fact that they can do something their competitors cannot, however these trademarks help them to uphold their brand name, and product names to their own standards and profit off of ‚Äúcopycats‚Äù.

*Seasonality:*

Monster has recognized that their sales are the best during the second and third quarters of each year. They have attributed this ‚Äúseasonality‚Äù to the change in weather during these months. Their reasoning for this is when it is winter in countries that have large weather changes (ie. Canada) there is not as much to do and the weather may make it harder to buy their products.

Monster has also found that the seasonality of their energy beverages are not as volatile/variable as traditional non-alcoholic beverages.

*Financial Information:*

* **Financial Performance (Good):** Monster has increased their revenues by 9.47% YoY, their gross profit by 8.14%, net income by 27.26%, decreased their effective tax rate to 13.3% (from 21.7%), and has a 59.2% gross margin. Monster had a great financial performance in 2020, and is very profitable, which should generate some excitement among investors, increasing the demand for their stock.
* **Financial Performance (Bad):** Monster‚Äôs cost of sales increased by 14.13% YoY, which is worrying given that the cost of sales increased more than actual sales (hurts margins), their gross profit decreased from 60% (2019) to 59.2% (2020), this was a result of the cost of sales increase mentioned above. Additionally, Monster‚Äôs sales in quarter 2 of 2020 were down by about 1%, this is understandable due to the uncertainty with COVID during this quarter.
* **Outstanding Options:** Currently, Monster has 8,323,000 shares outstanding in options that can be exercised this year. If all of these options were to be converted into common shares and sold on the market, it would cause a dilutionary effect of 1.57%.
* **RSU‚Äôs and PSU‚Äôs (Restricted/Performance Stock Units):** In 2021, Monster will have 947,000 RSU‚Äôs and PSU‚Äôs to award to their employees. If all of these units are vested in 2021, then it would cause a dilutionary effect of 0.18%.
* **March 2020 Repurchase Program:** In March of 2020, Monster‚Äôs board of directors authorized a share repurchase program, that would allow the company to repurchase $500M worth of common stocks. In 2020 Monster repurchased $58.5M worth of shares and have $441.5M left to repurchase shares in the future. If Monster was to use all of this money to repurchase shares (which they tend to do within the year), then Monster will be repurchasing about 7,905,103 shares (at $55.85/share, which is the agreed upon price). If all of these shares were repurchased, then the existing shares will rise in value by about 1.5%.
* **Employee Stock Purchases:** Monster‚Äôs employees repurchased 200,000 shares in 2020, inflating existing shares by approximately 0.04%.

*Analyst Coverage:*

The low analyst estimate for Monster is $92/share, the average estimate is $104.11/share, and the high estimate is $118/share. These estimates come from 21 different analysts and I found this data via the [Wall Street Journal.](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/MNST/research-ratings)

*Competition:*

In order to undergo my comparable analysis, I had to find 4 companies that I could compare to Monster.

These companies needed to be public companies, with financial ratios and multiples that I could compare against Monster, have similar market caps (although this is not a priority in a niche industry in the stock market like energy drinks), operate in similar geographies, and have similar businesses/operations.

To best check off these items as listed above, I decided to choose the following 4 companies to compare: $KDP ‚Äì Keurig Dr.Pepper, $CELH ‚Äì Celsius Holdings, $FIZZ ‚Äì National Beverage Corp., and $KO ‚Äì The Coca-Cola Company.

Investment Valuation:

*Comparable Analyses:*

*EV/Assets:*

By comparing Monster‚Äôs EV/Assets multiple to that of their competitors (found in the ‚Äúcompetitors‚Äù section of this report), I arrived at a fair value of Monster of $141.80. If this was to be true, the upside of this investment would be 54.96%. This is very high, and contradicts the results found in the DCF model, thus I decided to undergo another comparable.

*EV/Revenue:*

By comparing Monster‚Äôs EV/Revenue multiple to their competitors, I found that Monster‚Äôs fair value should be $128.46, which would imply an upside to such an investment of 40.38%. Once again, this is very high and contradicts the results achieved in the DCF model. However, I decided to undergo another comparable to see If this high valuation was consistent among comparable analyses.

*P/E:*

By comparing Monster‚Äôs P/E ratio to their competitors I arrived at a fair value of $353.32, which would imply an upside of 286.10%. This is extremely high; however, it confirms that the comparable indicate that Monster is severely undervalued. In order to get one final valuation, I decided to take a weighted average of the result achieved through the comparable analyses.

*Weighted-Average Comparable:*

I assigned a 45% weight to the figures achieved in the EV/Assets and EV/Revenue multiples and assigned a 10% weight to the figure achieved in the P/E ratio. By doing this I arrived at a fair value of Monster of $156.95, which implies a share price increase of 71.51%.

Plan:

Any entrance into a position under the $92 mark helps to limit the downside, as it is below the low analyst price target.

If the price decreases below $87.75, I will exit my position and look for a re-entrance at the $78.33 level, and potentially even the $67.67 level if the prices dipped this much.

I will look to sell my shares if the price reaches $105/share, which is justified through my average result from both the comparable and the DCF model, and this level is also near the average analyst estimate.

Risks:

* **Financial Performance:** Based off of their high valuation (when comparing their current price to the fair value I achieved in my DCF model), investors may be pricing in high earnings and growth. However, if Monster is not able to live up to this expected growth, then investors may dump their shares which will hurt the share price.
* **Share Dilution:** As I stated in the ‚Äúfinancial information‚Äù section of this report, Monster has a couple of different streams of potential share dilution. The main 2 forms of dilution in Monster are their outstanding options and their RSU‚Äôs/PSU‚Äôs, which can combine for a total dilutionary effect of 1.75%. This is not bad at all, as many companies exhibit way higher dilution, however it is something that investors should still pay mind to.

Catalysts:

* **Financial Performance:** As previously stated, some investors may be pricing in good financial performance from Monster. However, if they are able to outperform these optimistic estimates, then their share price will soar. This can be seen through their Q2 2020 financial performance, as they beat earnings by a fair amount, and as a result their share price jumped by over 6.5%.
* **Share Repurchase:** Monster has previously repurchased their shares, which is good to see as an investor. This is not expected to change anytime soon as monster has authorized $441M in share buybacks through their March 2020 repurchase program. Additionally, employees have the option to buy back shares as well. In total, Monster has the ability to repurchase over 8.1M shares, which will increase the value of the existing shares by 1.54%. This repurchasing can offset majority of the effects of their dilution and makes the share dilution less of a risk. This should help limit the risk for potential investors and entice them into entering a position.
* **Re-opening:** Reopening could help Monster to drive their sales as it is likely that they will start to notice higher demand from restaurants as they start to re-open and reach full capacity. This increased demand can help Monster to grow their sales hugely if Monster can find a way to keep their at-home sales up.

I hit the fucking gym that fucking day and worked out every fucking day from that point on without fail and radically reduced the amount of food I was eating.

2021-06-24 02:21:24,wallstreetbets,"I'm way too tired but I can't sleep. I peeked at the Krispy Kreme IPO

[Their debt](https://i.imgur.com/zpFZoT5.png) is so severe it eats exactly all of their profit üíÄ

Their [shareholder equity](https://i.imgur.com/wp2xxc2.png) is about $700m, but they have $1b **goodwill** and $1b **intangible assets** ‚ò†Ô∏èüíÄ

In accountant speak goodwill is a non-tangible, retained value asset that cannot have a hard value placed on it because it's a theoretical value, like brand recognition or if you acquired another business for a premium over book value.

This means the actual book value of Krispy Kreme is anywhere between -$1.2b and +$700m ü•¥

I would further pick apart the goodwill and intangibles to see why they could justify it and their auditors approved it, but I'm very tired and I've seen enough to know there's no way I'm touching this.

Krispy Kreme is IPO-ing to keep their lights on. Maybe the initial dilution and further dilutions will allow them to start bringing in some pennies every quarter, but to pay off that $1b interest-bearing deadweight debt $5 million/qtr at a time will take 50 years. Ok that's hyperbole but you get the point."

In July 2019, he continued to defend a prediction of $1 million by the end of 2020. In January 2020, however, he stated on Twitter that his previous predictions were simply ""A ruse to onboard new users"", and that buttquarters had limited potential because it was ""an ancient technology."""

Rest is all same As I said earlier..

Buying FDX Calls for 350 August Monthly, UOA activity for FDX looks good, FDX is still away from average of Analysts Target Price.  
Buying GS Calls for 400 August Monthly, no UOA activity but conviction to pop is higher due to profits from trading equities & other securities, GS is still away from average of Analysts Target Price.  
Already in COUP calls for Jan 2022, will ride till 275. already in TSLA debit spread will ride it till 750 before rolling.  
  
No Memes for now, as July is near where you can make money more reliably on upcoming earnings, I usually get out before earning until very high conviction.

The Companies numbers seem great, it seems like their stock performs great with very little volume, and looks like if it gets even just a little volume it would blow up. Short interest is good. So anyways, just to see if I'm doing my shit right, can one of you smart apes just give me a brief paragraph about why I'm wrong lol because I'm sure Im. Just basically point out the good and bad things about the company and stock so I know what A did right and wrong and how to look at things next time.

2021-06-24 03:56:24,wallstreetbets,"yes - also look at Ford and GM .. for the ""local"" market they got a LOT of weight in the ring to come against Tesla. They KNOW the future is EV and they INTEND to be the big boys through into the future. Look at their websites front page - they sell internal combustion now by millions =BUT= ALL their sites say in HEADLINE is:  <<**EV with us into the Future**\>>.. hmm.. check it.  Their fuel driven cars are on a 'later page' of their leader sites.

in Europe it's Volkswagen got the lead.  
Renault sell the most EV worldwide.  
Chinese have a massive home and ""local/regional"" market and are keen to move into India, Middle East, Europe (and the West) making manufacturing & badging deals.

But sure, I'm into **NIO** because 'battery as service' is a perfect solution to unlimited mileage.. just as perfect as gas stations today, no one thinks twice, there are gas stations totally everywhere, and that's WHY your gasoline car has ""unlimited mileage"". Built in batteries for EVs are stupid outdated dead-end tech.  
Might take a while but it's the inevitable solution.

I guess eventually EV batteries will be as standardized as USB plugs.. wtf.. what other electrical apparatus uses ""non-standard""  batteries?  That's crazy abnormal. Your existing car battery, you probably don't even know who is the manufacturer.   
**Only** Tesla batteries in Tesla cars, and only Ford batteries in Ford cars?..shit .. that wont last."

Income statement:

Revenue increasing 62% annually over the last 5 years!!! 

R&D expenses picking up heavily which I see as an extremely bullish signal over the long term.

Income has been slow, but cost cutting could result in major growth over the next 5-10 years

Balance sheet:

1.6 BILLION in cash on the balance sheet with 0**** Long term debt on the balance sheet. By increasing debt to finance any future expansion, they could greatly increase operating leverage and ROE.

Cash flow:

Change in cash (-345M) looks scary at a glance, but due to late payments on Accounts Payable I don‚Äôt think this will be a sustaining issue and cash will continue to climb. 

Positions: 30 $12c expiring 6/25
1000 shares $10.01 cost average

2021-06-24 03:10:28,wallstreetbets,"WISH‚Äôs growth rate looks incredibly tempting. They grew revenue by 35% last year.  
  
However, $WISH lost $745 million last year. Ouch. Worst of all, nearly $400M of that is stock-based compensation to pad the pockets of management, as well as $265m in G&A expenses for their new lofty salaries, a 300% increase in spending from 2019.  
  
So $WISH is burning YOUR cash and diluting shares to grow its revenue. They‚Äôre paying management massive salaries, giving them stock compensation while stockholders suffer losses.  


If you completely discount these one off charges from going public, $WISH still has over 200M in EBITDA losses, which doubled over the past year despite revenue only increasing 35%. EBITDA loss margin is expanding which is exactly what you want to avoid in a growing company. The point of owning any growth company, like TSLA who recently reached positive EBITDA, is for the EBITDA loss to increase slower than the revenue or even decrease.  


Bluntly, the company is spending too much. Shares have been squeezed up nearly 100% from the low. There's better opportunities out there than $WISH right now."

2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$CLOV TA good things coming Hello everyone

I wanted to do a quick TA Before market closes.

Looking at the 1 hr chart price action has held beautiful above ema9 as stated yesterday ema 9 had cross ema 50 and now it looks like ema 50 crosses 100 ( I know it may be obvious lol)

However if the cross occurs that means we have good momentum going.

We broke resistance at 13.95 and we are slightly above  13.95 , if we close above that resistance level I would set my target tomorrow at $15 .

We are making higher highs and higher lows an indication of bullish trend on the 1 hr .

In conclusion I am still bullish to possibly hitting $17+ by friday .

2021-06-23 20:59:48,wallstreetbets,I think if it breaks $15 there isn't much resistance back up to the previous high and it may run past that up to $30+  briefly before another period of consolidation.

2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"WKHS has been overlooked, but the facts don't fit the narrative (updated and with proof) 

WKHS has 97 percent utilization, at this moment there are no shares to borrow. The last number I saw when shares were able to be borrowed the cost was 25 percent. With an ORTEX estimated 60 percent of the float shorted, the story of this stock and the facts just aren't adding up.

 &nbsp;

This stock is primed for an upward movement the likes we haven't seen since GME in January.  

 &nbsp;

Just like GME there is a false narrative. With GME it was, ""No brick and mortar store can survive the pandemic, they are doomed!""  

 &nbsp;

With WKHS that same false narrative exists, ""Without the USPS contract they are doomed!""  
 
&nbsp;

Putting aside the problems with how it was awarded, they have an 8k vehicle backlog representing 100's of millions in sales. They are ramping up producing every quarter. They are building a drone delivery service for UPS.  
 
&nbsp;

They actually have and sell two commercial work trucks. They aren't in a prototype phase.

As a manufacturing engineer, if that's all you can manage to built, it doesn't matter if the back log is 8 or 8,000, or 8 million. You aren't going to hit the numbers. And if production is that slow, they need massive amounts of production infrastructure to be able to produce on a mass scale. That's not something that happens overnight.

All in all, share price drops 2.6% today but it cost the shorts another 1% SI. That is kind of a stalemate. That is a high price to pay from the shorts to move the share price just a little. But they did break our momentum some.  
  
Tomorrow is a huge volume day with the rotations of stock tickers in the indices. Hopefully that helps fuel the volume that we need for further progress. But make no mistake, the shorts also paid today with the increase in SI."

2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$KMX is your next real play you didn't think of. Earnings is Friday [DD] TL:DR - Used Car sales are at an all time high thanks to the chip shortage. CarMax is the largest used car dealership and have significantly more reach to acquire used vehicles for resell vs. smaller dealerships. CarMax is going to report HUGE earnings. 

**CarMax's business**

CarMax makes money 3 ways

1. Used car sales
2. Auction of used cars to dealerships
3. Services for dealerships

**Used Car Sales**

Look at any car related sub-reddit or Google it used car sales it at a all time high. This demand for used cars is largely driven by the fact you can't easily buy a new car due to the chip shortage. Because there is such a huge boner for used cars dealerships can't keep them on the lot. If you don't believe me take your POS Nissan Sentra and go get it appraised by CarMax, Vroom, Shift or your local dealership. I guarantee they will offer you more money for your vehicle then you would have got 6 months ago. 

*Question* \- But you may be thinking well golly whizz if every dealership is paying for used cars how does CarMax really beat out anyone else? 

Right here in this answer is the key to why CarMax will sky rocket with their earnings. CarMax is dominating online search for car appraisal traffic. Everyone in the today's age isn't strolling down to their local dealership and asking how much they can get for their car. Instead they are going online and Google ""how much can I sell my car for"" and other terms. Because CarMax (and other major websites like Vroom) are able to win online they deliver appraisals all online. They are gobbling up all the inventory before you even take your broke ass to the local dealership to upgrade to a Honda Civic. 

*Question* \- But if they everyone offers a bundle of cash for my used car won't they lose money?

Yes, CarMax (and other competitors) are paying a premium for the vehicle. However, those SOBs are marking that vehicle up and passing the expense onto you. Any vehicle they are unable to sell they clean up and sell in their auction service to the dealerships desperate to get inventory.

***Acquisition of*** ***Edmunds.com***

It floated under the radar a bit but CarMax made a massive acquisition in June. They acquired the car review website Edmunds.com. However, what you may not know about this website is they have a shit load of content related to selling your car. Again CarMax is making acquisitions in an effort to takeover everything related to selling and buying a used car. This acquisition gives them incredible reach to customer's looking to buy and sell their used car. 

[Acquisition of Edmunds](http://media.carmax.com/press-releases/news-release/2020/CarMax-Partners-with-Digital-Automotive-Leader-Edmunds/default.aspx)

**Auction of used cars to dealerships**

If your still with me congratulations. I think this is pretty straight forward. CarMax buys a lot of shitty cars. A huge part of that business is to refurbish the cars and sell them off to other dealerships with low inventory. Remember if a dealership has no inventory they have no business... 

At the start of June CarMax opened up jobs to hire 1,800 people for vehicle prep work. You really think they would open up that many positions without something behind it? Use your smooth brain to read behind the lines.

[CarMax hires 1,800 people for vehicle prep work](https://www.autonews.com/used-cars/carmax-wants-hire-1800-vehicle-prep-work)

Services for dealerships

This part of their business is a little more unknown but I think has huge potential. CarMax is going to be announcing a series of services they offer dealerships at a significant cost. This is additive to their business model so anything is gravy.

**Positions or ban and why CarMax is so undervalued**

I love this stock. I am a huge fan of CarMax's long term strategy and think they will continue to take over the used car eco-system. 

When I think about their stock price it blows my mind that Carvana (a online only competitor) has a market cap of 54B and a stock price of $315. Carvana is a shittier version of CarMax. Case in point Carvana has revenue of 5.5B. CarMax has revenue of 18B and a stock price of $118. CarMax's market cap is only 19B. Let that sink in... I put it in a chart for you true autists. 

|Company|Market Cap|2020 Revenue|Stock Price|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|CarMax|19.33B|$20.3B|118.50|
|Carvana|54.45B|$5.59|315.84|

Buy the stock buy calls. Just get on the rocket ship as we are about to blast off. 

***Earnings call is this Friday pre stock opening. So buy before the market closes Thursday.***

They might also be selling them for more money but are they selling less of them in general due to shortage? They might be selling them for more money but they‚Äôre also paying more to get them on the lot, are the margins bigger ?

2021-06-24 13:41:28,wallstreetbets,"Thats true, but they also lack the logistics and ability to expand. They aren't the Amazon of cars because you can't simply ship something across state lines. The car has to be registered and titled, etc. If it were an internet only business where you could ship something via FedEx, I'd agree with you. But they are limited by inventory they can't control and logistics/sites they don't have the funds to expand on. They don't make a profit, bleed cash, and rely on overhyped investors to expand. 

I'm not saying they can't be successful, they disrupted the market. But the problem with disruption in a capital intensive market is that it isn't always the first to disrupt that wins, its the one with experience and deeper pockets; and when it comes to that, CarMax is king."

2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Palantir. The Solution to the Problems that didn't exist (Yet) Palantir. Love it. Hate it. You will never stop hearing about it. And here's why.

Palantir was created for a world that didn't exist yet. A world where information and data would become so large no human workforce could ever be able to manage it effectively let alone, extrapolate insight from. So what's data do? It either sits there, or becomes a parasite on you for companies like google and facebook to target your dollars in the form of user specific ads. This way of utilizing data is indeed parasitic, and Palantir rejects this use of data in everyway possible.

But what if data wasn't used to fuck over your own customers, but instead used to help save them money and resources. Perhaps their lives? Restore supply chains, accelerate cancer research, and help restore the world to (somewhat) normalcy post pandemic. The sophisticated tools required to manage this type of data would have been inconceivable. No one predicated this kind of disjunction. Well. maybe some, but no company that would sacrifice half their revenue in R & D to solve problems of this magnitude they may or may not come to fruition. No one. Except 1 company. Valued at less than 1 billion back in 2010, then up to 9 billion in 2013 and 20 billion in 2015. And as high as 41 billion right before becoming public. Palantir 40x in 10 years is impressive, but its total addressable market would suggest a runaway so large and growing so fast that those returns are far from over. 

How big is this market? Well. Looking at the S-1 Filings it's estimated to be 119 billion. This is broken down into 63 billion in government and 56 billion in commercial. This is less than a fucking percent. How fast is it expanding? Well the S-1 is old news in my opinion of the ""macrotrend"" that Alex Karp says is happening.  

This comes from COO Shyam Sankar himself...

 ""And -- and with our investments in the end-to-end, sensor-to-shooter workflows from space to mud, we're not just going after the roughly $60 billion of government IT spend anymore, we're talking about the quarter-trillion dollars of U.S. DOD weapons system spend in 2020.""

This is fucking huge. And is completely overfucking looked. Everyone is still looking at the S1 filings about PLTR's TAM and its just wrong, it's so far much more now. This is why perhaps that government revenue is actually picking up at a more rapid pace despite it being their main customer base to this date. Government revenue grew at 68% YoY in Q3 2020 and in Q1 2021 it was 72 percent (With US revenue at 83%).

All-in-all I believe that a price to sales ratio of 40 is completely justified. This TAM is most definitely expanding into the commercial space as well. As IBM pointed out, 90% of all data has been generated in the last 2 years alone. This means that the data is growing faster then people can analyze it. This is where software like Palantir will be crucial in the future. What we're seeing with covid is all but just 1 example of how Palantir has been preparing for a future of disjunction. Palantir's investments only exacerbates  the obviousness of the problem the large amounts of disperse data creates. They're putting their money where their mouth is by not only putting half of their revenue into R&D  (561 Million, up 100% from 2018)  but taking whatever's left over into data-intensive business startups that utilize Palantir software. These actions of SPAC investments are probably more or less on Peter Thiel's part considering he's created the Founder's Fund and has a track record of picking innovative companies. This doesn't suggest that Palantir is slowing down and that Palantir simply doesn't know where to put their money, but they're more or less trying to plant seeds in industries and sectors that they are wanting to penetrate. Not only could they see significant returns that startups that succeed bring about, but also an increase in reputation and a testament of Palantir's usefulness in that sector. They want to make examples like BP saving 50 million in the first 2 weeks to potentially a billion a year off using Palantir's software become the Rule and not the Exception to the Rule. Palantir's usefulness is not 'niche' but can be applied across any sector.

I don't want to consider this DD as I barely did any research that I'm sure most of you guys didn't already know. My main point here is the counter argument to Palantir's valuation. And the skepticism surrounding its potential slow down in the future. In my opinion, Palantir and their competitors aren't growing as fast as the TAM and that's why I don't expect to see revenue both on commercial or government to grow slower than 45% in a couple years when the entire commercial sector will start to generate so much data that they'll have to switch to something new then their own built in piece by piece enterprise software that simply just doesn't work. This is the reoccurring problem Palantir has on it's sales side. It's not other software enterprise companies that they mainly compete with, but their own customers that try to build their own systems.  If they can get this much revenue from less than 200 customers (not to mention that the top 20 customers continue to pay 30%+ more for their subscriptions on a YoY basis) then any fear of a slowdown should not be on your mind when deciding whether or not to purchase Palantir stock. 

My main concern for Palantir is ironically how much cash it has. I say ironic because Peter Thiel ripped in Googles cash hoard saying they aren't innovative enough to know how to use their 50 billion cash hoard. Now Palantir only has 2.3 billion cash but there market cap is much smaller than Googles back in 2012 when their massive cash hoard was addressed. (50 billion Vs Googles 270 billion). Now this cash hoard isn't nearly as severe and a drag as google's through the forces of inflation but it does pose some headwind if they cannot utilize it in innovative ways. Now Palantir has invested in 4 additional SPACs that I'm aware of since their ER (Perhaps 5, Idk if the ""partnership"" with Primer includes a PIPE investment) and perhaps we may actually see a decrease next quarter on their cash on hand which I'm not opposed to, as long as its being reinvested in some way.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Palantir may be a multibillion dollar company but the the billions of dollars spent on R&D are just now beginning to pay off as the macrotrends are beginning to point closer and closer to companies like Palantir to be the next solution to the next problems that will plague the world in the not too distant future.

2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UWMC looks like it wants to explode You might all remember my last post about how great RKT is and why it's my number 1 position.  It's still my number 1 bet, but there is a short term trade at hand that could prove hugely profitable.  RKT's number one competitor is UWMC.  The entire lending industry has been suppressed due to the anticipation of interest rates rising and housing becoming unaffordable.  That being said, the hedge funds have over leveraged themselves in UWMC.  UWMC is making loads of money with no need to raise funds whatsoever.

&#x200B;

Whether you believed me or not in my last post about RKT, I do not think UWMC is a terrible company.  I do think RKT is a better company for the long term, but anyone can come up with their own opinion on that.  What I'm showing to you today is a chance at very profitable squeeze or swing trade.  UWMC has been shorted, has a great balance sheet, and everything is lined up to cause this stock to explode to the upside if it breaks and holds its 200dMA.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[9.33 is its 200dMA.](https://preview.redd.it/aucte5sn22771.png?width=1410&format=png&auto=webp&s=5edfca17ab442e42c799f8079dbe5765e8affec8)

Currently the stock is trading at 9.38 just below its 200 dMA.  With that resistance out of the way, there is nothing stopping it from going up.  The short term borrow borrow rate is 20+% as you can see in the image below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kmz4j1n632771.png?width=1288&format=png&auto=webp&s=887dbc3bc7ba40a75f881b17caf13ee59f689242

There are very few shares to short left, and the borrowing fee has jumped dramatically since the fed spoke last week and interest rates for the 10 year went down.  The stock is under valued, so there is little risk to the downside, and a lot of potential to the upside.

The float is very small in this company.  There are only 113.7M shares available in float, and there are 14 million or more shares shorted currently.  This is a $15B market cap stock, with only about $1.37B available for purchase since so few shares are outstanding.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hq4yx3vt32771.png?width=2748&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8422bb9b1876621bdbd580b67a696c5893bc44a

**THE CATALYST:**

This Friday after hours (06/25) they are being included into the Russell 1000.  All the ETF trackers that follow the Russell 1000 will need to purchase shares for their ETF to simulate the index.  ETFs don't typically buy early or late, they buy right on the 25th or 26th so that their ETF tracks the index properly.  That means there is a tail went of buying from these ETF trackers.

&#x200B;

I believe in this short term trade enough that I have sold my entire RKT position today (about $1.5M) and bought UWMC.  Again, this is just a very low risk trade, and it's in the same sector as RKT so I'll be going back to RKT at some point, but I just want to be upfront.  I like both companies and in the long term I prefer RKT, but short term, UWMC has an incredible opportunity IMO.

&#x200B;

Enjoy the ride!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Edit 2:** 

&#x200B;

**Everyone keeps asking about proof of the UWMC inclusion to the Russell, and here is the list.  They didn't make the first cut in March because their share structure was mis-understood.  They appealed, and they were added the following week.  They no longer tell you what index the companies are going in, just a list of all the companies going into the Russell 3000 (which is composed of the Russell 2000 and Russell 1000).  When it was announced a month or two ago that UWMC was being added, they showed it was for the Russell 1000.  That original page of changes to the additions has since been replaced by the overall list of all the companies going into the indexes which you can see below.**

2021-06-23 20:43:44,wallstreetbets,">  I do think RKT is a better company for the long term, but anyone can come up with their own opinion on that.

A lot of people here seem to think that. The interesting thing is although people praise RKT here and in other trading subs, if you venture into subs about realestate, realtors, or home buyers on reddit, the consensus is that RKT is best to avoid. Tons of posts from people saying they take a long time, drop the ball on fairly routine things, communicate poorly, or have higher rates than alternatives. i get that this post is about UWMC, but I can't help but respond to this comment about RKT as for some reason nobody can  seem to make a post about UWMC without also trying to draw attention to RKT.


Disclosure: I'm holding a position in UWMC, mostly because RKT was being touted everywhere and research independent of WSB suggested RKT was less likely to increase in value as a result of company performance, and mainly just pumps from the memery."
2021-06-24 00:40:15,wallstreetbets,Great DD but you are wrong about RKT. Wholesale mortgages will make up a larger and larger percentage of overall residential mortgages and this is a bad thing for RKT and a good thing for UWMC long term.

2021-06-23 20:23:04,wallstreetbets,They both plunged because Biden is forcing out the CEOs and the government will have more control over them.  The new CEOs are likely going to have less requirements to buy the loans issued which will cause lenders to lend more with more risk.

2021-06-24 10:55:12,wallstreetbets,UWMC is heavily shorted with a short interest of 20.71% per fintel. I think you‚Äôre confusing short selling (which is very common) and short squeezes (uncommon).

2021-06-23 20:15:35,wallstreetbets,"No, there isn't enough SI.  The shorts are not being forced to cover (it's not a squeeze); they are covering at their leisure.  The price actually dropped as a few million shares were covered.

For  while a squeeze looked like it was on the table.  Extremely unlikely but possible.  Now it looks impossible.

I'd love to be wrong -- selling my 50k shares for $100 each would make me a happy man.  But I'm not deluding myself into believing it.

What I do see is a rise to $20 or more over a longer period of time.  The reason I have so many shares is that I believe it to be undervalued.  It will have to wait until their price war is over though -- they reduced their margins significantly to fight it.  I believe that they will win it but until then earnings are going to be low.

I don't believe that other originators can compete at these ptices.  UWMC has much lower costs than their competitors.  If they originate a loan at a 1% gain margin their competitors have to do it at a loss to match their price.  I think of it like Walmart vs the mom & pop."

I personally think RKT is undervalued at this price. RKT has moved from around an intraday low of $19 to a high of $20.35 which is actually a significant move.

I am not seeing any specific news to substantiate the price movement upward besides John giving it a shoutout. The option chain is poppin off right now with June 25 $20 calls leading the way with 30,518 volume as we speak. July 2nd $20 with 24,154 volume at the moment. On the other hand there is an insignificant amount of puts. The bears are scared of meme stocks because of the Wall Street boys.

2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CURLF - Tech like growth trading at a fraction of the typical tech valuation. Institutions still not yet allowed to buy in! üëÄüí®üöÄ With laws changing in the US, there are a ton of eyes on the weed industry. I have been researching the sector since 2016 when CGC was trading at $2 and the Canadian weed stocks were all the rage. 

It seems to me that there are still a lot of people interested in these shit fuck weed stocks like many of the Canadian companies and even some garbage companies in the US that are basically worthless. (Not gonna mention any names in particular). 

I‚Äôm here to shed some light on the space, and bring a little more attention to the companies who are actually making money and leading the sector. From where I stand, Curaleaf is king and I think the next couple years are really going to show a difference between them and all the others.

Here‚Äôs why:

Total revenue or leading US cannabis companies -

Curaleaf: $767.1 M
GTI: $556.6 M
Truelive: $521.5 M
Cresco: $476.3
Verano: $354.8

Those are the top 5, if you are investing you‚Äôre money into anyone else, they probably aren‚Äôt worth a damn to be honest. 

Curaleaf is already doing more in revenue than any other company. Not only do they have the largest footprint in the US, they also recently acquired EMMAC, which is the largest operator in all of Europe. This now provides them another giant market to launch their products into. 

Now let‚Äôs take a look at the numbers Curaleaf is putting up and how fast they are actually growing. 

Total revenues grew from $40.7 mil in Q1 of 2020 to $260.3 mil in Q1 2021. Thats 170%!

AEBITA grew from -$2.8 mil in Q1 2020 to $62.6 mil in Q1 2021, or a growth rate of 213%!!

The numbers speak for themselves, but allow me to shed a little more light on what‚Äôs really going on here‚Ä¶

These numbers are great, but they don‚Äôt include the recreation market in the northeast, which is likely going to be one of the largest markets in the world. Curaleaf has the largest market share in states like NJ, NY, and CT, which are all about to go recreational in the next few months to a year. That alone should provide explosive growth on top of what is happening in the rest of the country and Europe!

What‚Äôs even more exciting is that Curaleaf is growing earnings at an incredible pace while still spending money to grow its footprint and capture market share around the globe. Not only that but they are also paying a substantial amount of tax due to the federal illegality of the product they sell. 

This will change when laws change and 280E gets removed. For those of you who don‚Äôt know what 280E is, it‚Äôs a section of the tax code that prevents businesses from deducting expenses incurred in the production, distribution, and sale of illegal products such as marijuana. 

Now let‚Äôs have a look at the US weed market projections as a whole:

The legal weed market is expected to grow from $17.5 billion in 2020 to $37.7 billion in 2025. Thats a CAGR of 19% over the next 5 years! üò≥ 

How‚Äôs that for a multi year secular growth trend? Talk about tailwinds?! üöÄ

Another aspect of Curaleaf‚Äôs business that sets them apart from competitors is the Select brand and wholesale distribution network. Not only is Curaleaf selling their products out of Curaleaf branded stores, but Select products are now available in thousands of other dispensaries as well. üí∞ 

In case that‚Äôs not enough to YOLO you‚Äôre life savings into this generational opportunity, here‚Äôs one more tidbit of information that‚Äôll make you happy to be a retail investor:

INSTITUTIONS STILL CAN‚ÄôT BUY SHARES!!
This is probably the most exciting part of the whole situation. Us apes are able to load  the boat before big money starts flowing in for once. When laws change and the MSO‚Äôs uplist is when the party gets started in weed. ü§ë

So stop wasting your money/opportunity on Canadian companies and small time US wannabes and start loading the true market leaders. 

Curaleaf is king! üëë

**Who am I?**

Do you remember me? I'm the guy who [broke the news](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m911ba/uwmc_is_not_on_the_final_russell_index_inclusion/) to you back in March that UWMC will not be included in the Russell 1000 index. I'm also the guy who [told you back in May](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n7ahq5/uwmc_dont_be_fooled_my_friends/) that Wall Street is playing games with you and trying to convince you that UWMC is going to $0.

[Told you on May 7th, markets are bluffing on UWMC](https://preview.redd.it/5fnnfg9su1771.png?width=676&format=png&auto=webp&s=283ff75375546cb5905310cd25fc883d006910b5)

**Why am I here?**

This time I'm here to tell you that UWMC will get added to Russell index on Friday, June 25 after market hours. It's for sure this time. It has been confirmed. They made it to final list. No fooling around this time.

**What does this mean?**

This means there will be a significant demand for UWMC stock, [starting Monday, June 28](https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1407323737150693382?s=20). Every index fund manager, tracking Russell 1000, will need to buy UWMC shares. No questions asked. This is going to be a one-time jump in the price until each index fund gets the correct amount of shares.

**Why don't index funds buy the stock right now?**

Cause they can't. Rules are rules. Each index announces its changes in advance, but index funds cannot acquire the new company until the effective date of change.

**History tells**

Remember TSLA being added to SP500 on Dec 21, 2020? Remember what happened after inclusion? It had a 35% run up over the next month.

Remember YHOO being added to SP500 on Nov 30, 1999?

**Calm before the storm**

My gut feeling is telling me we are in the calm before the storm. The stock price has been pretty quiet. Many of you losers lost interest. Implied volatility is almost at the 6 months bottom, but you don't care about that because you are waiting to start buying calls when IV shoots through 100%.

https://preview.redd.it/fnh0ymqqs1771.png?width=1868&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bbf16654551e13f14567fa9705b2d336a40fa73

**Conclusion**

* UWMC is being added to Russell 1000 on Friday, June 25, after market hours
* Index funds will need to buy UWMC
* Stocks tend to go up following index inclusion
* IV is low *(gambling tickets are not overpriced)*

**Position**

* 5000 shares

* \-10 Nov P $8
* \-10 Dec P $8

A study conducted by FTSE Russell on price movement of its annual newly added holdings starting from the early 2000s showed that on average, stock prices experienced a temporary price increase in June before the date of the constitution, and then experienced a permanent price decrease afterwards.

If it sounds too good to be true that's because you've likely already missed the boat.

His entire thesis here is that Russell buying is going to cause the stock to go up.  Yet just look at how many companies are being added to the Russell 3000.  You think all their stocks are going up?  You think the trade is that easy?  How simple it would be if all you had to do was buy a stock right before every Russell inclusion to get an easy 10% (or 35% this guy tries to imply with the Tesla example).

No, it's not that simple.  This stock was very recently downgraded twice and another analyst initiated at hold.  I know people don't want to hear it, but if this stock goes up, it's because people successfully pumped it on here.  Just trying to help.. you may downvote now.

Edit: Let me add that buying into a WSB pump isn't necessarily a bad idea if you can time it.  Just saying that if you decide to take this gamble, consider that you're probably betting on a WSB pump more so than the stock going up on its own accord, and trade accordingly."

2021-06-24 00:27:24,wallstreetbets,Counterpoint. This paper is about R2000. UWMC will be entering the R1000. R1000 is the top 1000 US companies by market cap. R2000 is the next 2000 or 1001-3000 biggest companies in the US. UWMC is completely bypassing the R2000 to leapfrog to the R1000. UWMC can expect institutional holders to grow from 100 to 350 and ETF holders to grow from 7 to 60 plus.
2021-06-24 01:28:41,wallstreetbets,All that movement was related to the Russell inclusion. UWMC didn't make the initial list due to Russell automatically excluding them based on public votes available. UWMC got that sorted and was on a correction list that posted after hours on the 11th. After hours on the 12th UWMC again made the Russell inclusion list.
2021-06-24 04:34:19,wallstreetbets,he sold puts
2021-06-24 01:56:05,wallstreetbets,I respect hearing a different opinion. The point is that if a stock gets added to an index it can't be a bad signal.
2021-06-24 11:11:39,wallstreetbets,"To his thing doesn‚Äôt need a WSB pump to continue to go up.  Currently it is undervalued. The share price with their current financials should be $15-$18. There are several reasons that isn‚Äôt there yet. After they turn in the next couple of quarterly reports and they have more history it will go well above $18. The issue here is if WSB wants to moon a stock UWMC is primed to do it. Russell inclusion is just part of it. It means institutions will buy up more of the float that won‚Äôt be sold, thus reducing available shares. Institutions currently own ~20M shares and from the projections I‚Äôve seen Russell inclusion should be another ~3M shares. There are approximately 15-17M shares short and only ~80M shares available to trade. 

With all of that being said, there is literally 0 downside to buying shares right now. Right now you‚Äôre going to get a 4% dividend to hold the shares, likely to have a 100% gain in a year or less organically, with the potential to be early in on another GME/AMC run up."
2021-06-24 06:04:47,wallstreetbets,"But there might be insiders or institutions who want out and will decide a deal, right? It's never as black as white as it seems."
2021-06-24 00:44:16,wallstreetbets,"Counterpoint to your counterpoint. 

That's actually worse for UWMC than being put in the Russell 2000 if it were eligible with a lower market cap. 

The average market cap of a company in the Russell 1000 is $412B. UWMC at 15B quite far down on the list of the Russell 1000 in terms of market cap.

A stock with a market cap on the lower bound of the Russell 1000 will have a significantly lower weight than a stock with a market cap on the higher bound of the Russell 2000 comparatively. The upper portion of the Russell 1000 is so stacked that not many shares of  new additions need to purchased as they don't really change the overall makeup of it very much."
2021-06-23 21:56:05,wallstreetbets,"It depends on the supply. Some will be very small in relation to their float (so not as much movement). Likely, what I've experienced is a pop (if there's a buy indication for the market on close) or drop (if there's a sell indication). Right now, they're just projections - won't really know until then. It can happen on Monday as well. Also don't forget about the end of month rebalance (happens on the 30th)."

Unfortunately, that's not quantified, and since for the small firms, it was trivial, I can't imagine the non-trivial amount was much.  Also even if there is a non-trivial increase in buying, it doesn't rule out that it's just retail traders buying on the expectation of a rise in price like y'all are doing.

I've been involved in plenty of stocks over the years that irrationally plummeted for months or failed to move despite every reason to go up ($MU and $PFE come to mind but there are plenty more).  The truth is, without someone to successfully pump them, boring stocks stagnate, and this is a boring stock.

You think they're undervalued, but the 2 recent downgrades and one hold initiation from professional analysts disagree with you.  And 20% of float shorted is not enough for an organic epic squeeze.  The only hope of a squeeze is if you pump it inorganically... Which is exactly what I'm saying that the play here, if there is one, is -- to play the pump.  But expect a dump after the shorts cover, because this is a boring stock and without professional analyst support.

You say there's no downside but that's not true.  Even a 4% gain over a year is less than the market typically gains.  You *need* this thing to go up or you are losing on opportunity cost.  Heaven forbid it go down and you've wasted your time."

Even the babies of the R1000 have huge institutional ownership. I get it, their weight is piddly in the big boy pool. The thing is inclusion doesn't occur in a vacuum. It isn't just the ETFs that have to buy some paltry amount of the stock. You have 529s and 403bs and tons of others that each have to own some UWMC. Russell inclusion is just a part of this stock transitioning from being a pariah for being a SPAC and being recognized as a legit publicly traded co. My humble opinion. Best of luck!"

That's how pricing-in happens. It's not priced in, then a hedge-fund arbs away the opportunity and it *is* priced in. They push the price around, and they only stop when the opportunity is all gone or they reach their Personal Risk Tolerance and don't want to guh if they screwed up the math.

Admittedly, sometimes they really do leave money on the table. If you're betting on them leaving money on the table it's worth thinking about whether and why they have, because the well isn't infinitely deep, and the information about the index inclusion is widely distributed now."

2021-06-24 01:29:54,wallstreetbets,"The points that you bring up are valid. I don't disagree that institutions and funds other than the Russell and its trackers will increase their UWMC holdings post Russell 1000 inclusion.

I'm saying that, specifically for the catalyst discussed in this post, the only funds that are *guaranteed* to be buying on Friday are specifically the Russell 1000 and the indexes that track it. Now, I don't know how many of those there are or what their holding volume look like compared to the main index, but from the Russell 1000 addition you can expect around 1 million shares to be purchased. 

You can also expect Friday to be a high volume day. Looking at one of UWMC's recent high volume trading days, on June 9th 25.5M shares were traded. So the Russell's purchase would have made up ~4% of that day's trading volume. And again, who knows what the volume that day will be or how many shares the Russell + its tracking ETFs will buy in total?

Long term, I can see this being a positive catalyst for UWMC. However, institutions and mutual funds that don't track the Russell 1000 have no reason to buy UWMC at this time, as they are aware of the temporary price effects of the Russell inclusion and can likely slowly accumulate at lower prices in the near future. Be wary of overestimating this particular catalyst in hopes of a spike on Friday, as I would guess that it will be equally as likely if not more likely to be a red spike."
2021-06-23 22:05:43,wallstreetbets,No it‚Äôs not infinitely deep.  It‚Äôs self regulating with there on average being still a bit of excess demand on rebalance day.

2021-06-24 11:41:56,wallstreetbets,"I see an average price target of $9.07 on Tipranks, meaning pros expect it to decline 3.61% over the next year.  Basically, you would break even after dividend.

If safe returns are your goal, why not buy Pfizer, which is making billions and billions on its vaccine, yet the stock has barely moved, and it also has a 4% dividend and analysts expecting 13% upside over the next year?

More exciting than a mortgage company, too.  Yet still stagnating (for now).

Look, feel free to park your money wherever you want.  But why pump a boring, ""safe"" investment like it's the next big thing?  Comes off very suspicious to me.  I just want perhaps more easily influenced people to be informed before they place their bets."

$TASA3 $TASA4

1Q21

&#x200B;

Possibly this is the last thread I will do about the role. I've already exposed the bulk of the thesis here and it all ends up getting boring.  
Share capital, CVM358, balance sheets, expenses. Everything has already been said. Exceptionally, something very off the radar, I I come back here out of respect for those who followed the news, to talk about something more complex about the case.  
Let's get to the result. Trying to model what was to come in this first quarter, the accounts were simple. Always taking 4Q20 as a reference. Most of the data was already known.  
we would have an average dollar of 5.48 for revenue, +1.7% and 5.70, +9.6% (last ptax) for cash markdown + company debt, QoQ. Obviously, generating the well-known financial expense for us, eroding a good part of the period's net income.  
We also knew that production would have ended the quarter with 8,500 weapons/day, against 8,200 a/d. The transfer of 13.2% of IGPM on revenue from the domestic market, and, obviously, the average ticket, which was perhaps the main point to be addressed by the company, at 210U$ consolidated in 2020.  
Now, in a call with RI, there was already the theoretical information that the average production for the quarter would have been slightly lower than the peak production in late March. What didn't cross my mind was that this number would come 7% lower. Yes, we ended 1Q21 with an average of 7,900 weapons/day. All this was addressed to with the company.   
From the outset, it is understood that every manufacturing process involves issues that a simple rule of 3 does not include. There were mandatory vacations, fewer working days and training that would imply optimizing your current process lines.  
That said, at first the revenue below 4Q20 caught my attention. Again, the issue of daily production ends up being one of the reasons. Going further, I bring up a reflection on the company's audit regarding this amount of weapons produced daily. The volume was higher QoQ, which, instinctively, it would not make sense if the 8,200 guns/day of the 4Q had been conceived. This is something of internal management, which I will cover later, especially regarding the upcoming production. Anyway, let's go back: despite the theoretical shortfall in this first quarter of the year, the volume GREATER produced, thus, attention is paid to SMALLER revenue, in addition to a SALES volume, also LOWER, QoQ.  
Let's do it by steps. Synthesizing. We produce more, sell less and generate less revenue per weapon sold. Average Ticket dropped. Why did this happen? We don't have the entire backorder sold? It is here that the main points of this balance reside, which are not explicit to those who look only at the numbers.

1-The QoQ stock grew 35%.

2-The ticket actually fell. 498,000 weapons were sold. 512.5M of revenue generated. Dollar 5.48. This makes us reach a average ticket of 187.8U$ per quarter in question. 11% lower than the 2020 consolidated.

\- What the fuck was that!? haha

Everything needs to be analyzed calmly. They exist reasons for the above. Once again, everything was promptly addressed to the company, which was very helpful in answering all points. The ticket dropped due to turnover and breakdown of sales and specific production in the 1Q. Mostly low value products were sold like Heritage, which would tend to generate less revenue for us, but higher margin. So it was done. (Follows message from CFO, S√©rgio). The ticket being disclosed only in the 4Q annual result has a reason. This composition is dynamic. The 2Q will contain billing for Rifles, being sold for at least 560U$. 200% above the 1Q ticket. The company continues with its relentless commitment to add the increase in this consolidated average ticket in 2021, as this is one of the main points where there is room for Taurus to grow at the expense of its competitors.  
Therefore, this potential revenue additive should appear in the next results.  
The stock inventory and its fattening. Why was this production not readily transformed into sales, given the backorder sold? The answer is simpler than it sounds and brings out, once again, real life stuff. Logistics. Yes, logistics. The majority of BR production takes an average of 15-20 days to arrive in the US. Included in this current stock are weapons destined for bids already known by the market, and, quite possibly, part of the GX4, with scheduled release for May 19th.  
Let's go back to quantitative analysis and company perspectives. Commented on this adverse issue of the audit regarding the average daily production of weapons, this time the doubt was removed so that there was no room for interpretation. Taurus 2Q21 is operating with a daily production capacity of 9,510 weapons per day. 20% more than the 1Q21 average.  
Capabilities and process improvements, together with the continued ramp up of Georgia, which, by the way, uses 30-40% of its current land for operations, leaving A LOT of margin of business expansion in the future, coupled with new lines, such as the one mentioned earlier about GX4, are increasing the company's productivity and capacity to reach a new operational level.  


A simple account. I will use 9,750 weapons/day as an average by the end of 2021.

492,000 weapons produced this year.

492,000 + 9,750 x 191 business days (2T (63), 3T (65), 4T (63) = 2,354,250 WEAPONS

That's right. This had already been commented on both by RI and by Sal√©sio. But there is always pragmatism on both sides, and this, in fact, is the best way to follow. This number implies paying for the complete backorder of the company still in 2021. At least as far as its production is concerned. Final sales could spill over into 1Q22. Little changes. What needs to be highlighted is the company's current potential. Which is NOT in the prices, and NOT it reflects the maximum capacity they can get, as I see many preaching.  
The case today reflects strategic planning delivery. There is no longer the asymmetry of a turnaround, however, what is on the table still exposes us to a beautiful earning potential.

I will not bring up here calculations and calculations of how much revenue would tend to generate from the total sale of this backorder, much less how much the 2021 consolidated ticket could be. You need to sensitize scenarios with an average dollar for this year and understand where you are getting into.  
I remain very calm with the charge of my position, even having increased it at the beginning of the trading session.  
Finally, the debt, just to make an imagination of the scenario in terms of multiples.  
Net debt closed the quarter at 665.7m. With 221.5M in the maturity profile for 2021. \~100M rollable.  
Forget about those projections they brought in on the balance sheet including the sale of helmets and land in POA. Use this as an add-on if they materialize.  
2021 final EV -> I'll embed the remaining T13 and T15 deleveraging here (full subscription) and do not put anything on the account of the T17s still in circulation. That would take us to -80M provided with this strand. I will use the 5.40 dollar as a base, both to calculate debt and ebitda. That said, keeping the current composition unchanged, we would have -40M currency exposure.  
Now the main point when measuring the company's enterprise value: The possible cash until the end of 2021. Excluding the debt that will have to be paid by the end of that year (110M) and adding 150M of capex announced by the company (these launches can be diluted ), I'll just normalize 1Q21 EBIT to imagine where we would be headed. (168.4\*3T remaining).

EV 115,000,000 (diluted Q13/Q15) \* 26.00 + DIV BRU ‚Äì CAIXA E RECEB (220,000,000) / EBITDA (30% mg 2.4B revenue {800,000,000}) = 4.01x End 2021

The company's net margin ex-effects does not recurring rates in this quarter reached 26.2%. Once again, make the calculations of how much revenue the company could generate and make this number aware to arrive at the end of the period. Addendum 1: this excludes all sorts of non-recurring effects. Addendum 2: weakening dollar we should see smaller margins. Do your calculations. Target intact. 45 BRL KD lowered qoq, WACC 8-9% perpetuity 4%, under these conditions I would be satisfied.

2021-06-24 01:44:40,wallstreetbets,"Disagree. Bigger sales in EU because Tesla doesn‚Äôt have production there (still). Shipping cars is not the same as shipping iphones so localization of production matters. Berlin factory will be online soon and ramp up sales. Decades more experience count for nothing - ICE is comparable to EV.  The Elon share price too high tweet was clearly alluding to the incoming split (meme potential). 

Too add: Tesla is the only vertical integrated EV manufacturer. Check the video I posted about the battery and understand why they are years away from competition. Tesla even built its own supercomputer (which is the 5th fastest in the world) to develop FSD. The battery wars are coming which will significantly delay production for the less integrated manufacturers.

Edit: plus, Tesla doesn‚Äôt have a cheaper car YET."

The only other EV I have seen is the fuckboi smart car, and it's been quite some time. Tesla is pretty far ahead, and the growth on production and sales has been pretty stellar.

EU sales are higher because the Berlin factory isn‚Äôt online.  Yes, the lower price of the VW does help sales but Tesla will eventually release their $25k model that will have even a bigger impact on the EU market.  Tesla is dominating the EV market in the US and China.  VW is working with Ford and Argo on the autonomous driving and if it‚Äôs anything like BlueCruise it‚Äôs still going to be far behind Tesla."

# Alright retards; put your fucking sombreros on, grab a margarita, and buckle up.

Telefonica is one of the largest Internet service providers in the world, operating in 13 countries with over 113,000 employees. Coming out of the pandemic, Telefonica is currently undergoing a transformation with the shift to 5G provision across its markets.

I won't bore you with a ton of numbers that shows that **TEF is profitable** as FUCK, **undervalued** AS FUCK, has a ton of **CASH, and is consilidating its debts. Shorts are keeping this stock down. It should \*not be at 2020 levels.**

TEF is clearly set to explode higher given high short interest of 18% and lack of borrow (borrow rate currently \~20%).

At the beginning of the month, Telef√≥nica finalized its merger with Virgin Media in the UK and the sale of Telxius Towers, two transactions that will allow it to reduce 9,000 million in debt. With this reduction, Telef√≥nica's debt will remain at 26,000 million euros, at about 2.3 times its gross operating profit (Ebitda), and an amount that could drop further with some divestitures such as the submarine cable business of Telxius or a subsidiary in Latin America, he said. Income 4 analyst Ivan San Felix for Europa Press.After this process, ""the investor's anxiety should ease a lot,"" San Felix says.Conditional on the overall performance of Ibex 35, which has fallen in this period, Telef√≥nica's share has rebounded by only 2% since the closure of these operations, to ‚Ç¨3.94, yet it has accumulated more than 28% of revaluations since the beginning of the year.

TEF has a current dividend yield of 7.1%, and has had above a 4% yield for the past 4 years.

**Telefonica Analyst Ratings:**

This stock has been beaten down by shorts over the past few years. I am extremely bullish on this stock as the telecom industry isn't going anywhere. With the recent merger of their subsidiary O2 with Virgin Media, Telefonica is set to go higher. They also have 113,000 employees. This makes them worth waaay more than 22b mirite.

[https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TEF/research-ratings](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TEF/research-ratings)

Based on fundamentals and the possibility of a short squeeze here to expedite the inevitable, I like the stock. **TEF should \*not\* be at 2020 levels, especially given their recent consolidation of debt.**

# FAIR price of $TEF should be at least $15-20."

2021-06-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$AMD - The Return of Su Bae - 10 Month Old Technical Setup Looking to Breakout I'm a fan of this stock like many others here I'm sure - so I try to keep a close eye on the chart. There has been a very large falling wedge setup building for 10 months now. With Nasdaq going crazy - we might just nail a breakout this week.

[$AMD 1W 2Y](https://preview.redd.it/osqk5jp6h1771.png?width=2229&format=png&auto=webp&s=f15d503aa5d3e4e7a863197cea2920546476ba84)

Here is the setup in question. You can see its a falling wedge that began on the week of **7/27**. We attempted to break last week and closed **just** on the line - with some increased volume. After a back test yesterday - it looks like we are trying to nail the close this time around.

In order for that to happen - we need **4 PM on Friday to be above** **84.00.**

This would trigger a breakout targeting **90** resistance first, followed by **100** and **110.**

Maybe we could overshoot to **125** \- but I'm going to be selling all/most around that last target.

This breakout is invalid if we don't get the close - but the pattern will still be alive. It has some room for another trip down - so long as we hold **72.50.**

Overall a pretty textbook chart setup - don't overthink it. I'm looking @ **August 90c** for this one, I might roll them back when we get ITM.

Post breakout - I'll be putting a stop loss at **83.00.**

The move should play out over **2-3** months."

I have a plan: you buy a cheap call or put, tell us what, we yolo in the opposite direction, we win thousands, we each give you 100 bucks as a fee. Your profits are directly proportional to the amount of apes you rent your services to.

2021-06-24 10:41:57,wallstreetbets,Brazil also has raised rates 3 times this year. Which equals more $$$ for banks. Brazilian real is also losing value which is better for banks also.
2021-06-24 13:17:36,wallstreetbets,The US volume is misleading on this one. A) metric fuckton of shares B) US promissary notes that you're trading on US exchanges are 500 shares each.
2021-06-24 13:19:56,wallstreetbets,"I'm long out to January. If you zoom out on the chart, ITUB has been steadily recovering in a positive channel. Its at the top of an oscillation now, and had a chance to break out to 7. That window is starting to close, so if it follows trend its going to dip over two months, then come back up by December/January. That's the technical bet.  


If you look at other stories coming out of Brazil, they're slowly unfucking their vaccine problems, and should be looking pretty strong in the 5-6 month time frame we're talking about. That's the regional bet for the value play. If Brasil does what every other economy has done as COVID has tapered off, the bank should trend back towards the 9-10 range."

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

2021-06-24 08:22:44,wallstreetbets,I'm consistently doubling my money annually by >selling< OTM puts and letting them expire. That makes me the bookie instead of the punter and the time decay provides a natural edge. I pick a strike below an obvious support level and try not to be too greedy(difficult).  If I get assigned (not often) I >sell< covered calls until the stock recovers or I earn enough to break even.
2021-06-23 21:48:58,wallstreetbets,You're probably buying them otm and too close to expiration. If you genuinely believe in the company you should be buying long term call atm/itm options because short term the market can be irrational. Also choosing atm/itm instead of otm lowers the breakeven for the stock price and gives you larger % returns.

2021-06-23 20:01:26,wallstreetbets,So on that example you would sell a call and put at the 200 strike price
2021-06-23 20:05:22,wallstreetbets,"If I were making a trade today, i would sell a call at $245 (.2 delta) for $673 for 2 days. I would also sell a put spread at $200/$150 since there seems to be a lot of support there. You can make like $975 for just waiting 2 days and $5000 in collateral if you already own 100 shares of gme.

The fintech giant is in discussions to start a new credit-scoring business with Chinese state-owned enterprises  
By Jing Yang and Xie YuJune 23, 2021 6:08 am ET  
  
HONG KONG‚ÄîAnt Group Co. is in talks with Chinese state-owned enterprises to create a credit-scoring company that will put the fintech giant‚Äôs proprietary consumer data under regulators‚Äô purview, according to people familiar with the matter.  
  
The new entity, which could be established as soon as the third quarter of this year, could result in Ant ceding some control over the voluminous data it has on the financial habits of Chinese citizens. More than one billion individuals use Ant‚Äôs Alipay app to spend, borrow or invest their money, and the information that Ant has collected and used has been the secret sauce behind the company‚Äôs success in recent years.  
  
The talks between Ant, which is controlled by billionaire Jack Ma, and Chinese state-owned companies are likely to result in the formation of a joint venture that would be licensed as a credit-scoring company. Ant and regulators have also been discussing whether the firm should be run and controlled by Ant or state-owned companies, according to people familiar with the matter.

The regulators are pushing for prospective state-owned shareholders to play a greater role in the new entity in order to have a bigger say in how it operates, according to some of the people familiar with the negotiations. Potential shareholders include a Shanghai-based financial conglomerate. There have also been talks about what sort of data would be collected by the new firm, and how the credit scores it produces would fit into China‚Äôs broader plans to build a nationwide database, the people added.  
  
The discussions are continuing and final decisions haven‚Äôt been made, the people said."

2021-06-23 22:00:05,wallstreetbets,"Anyone else notice the gamma spike on GME options? Far OTM weekly options tripled in price in the last 90 minutes of trading, with the price of many closing at or slightly less than the previous day‚Äôs close, despite GME closing red. Theta should have made it so those options would close at least 30% less than the day before, but IV on the long tail of the IV/price curve has spiked giving it a strong right skew. You can see this in the options pricing as well. A call option $50 OTM is valued over 15x more than a put option that is $50 OTM.

2021-06-24 03:10:44,wallstreetbets,"WISH‚Äôs growth rate looks incredibly tempting. They grew revenue by 35% last year.  
  
However, $WISH lost $745 million last year. Ouch. Worst of all, nearly $400M of that is stock-based compensation to pad the pockets of management, as well as $265m in G&A expenses for their new lofty salaries, a 300% increase in spending from 2019.  
  
So $WISH is burning YOUR cash and diluting shares to grow its revenue. They‚Äôre paying management massive salaries, giving them stock compensation while stockholders suffer losses.  
  
If you completely discount these one off charges from going public, $WISH still has over 200M in EBITDA losses, which doubled over the past year despite revenue only increasing 35%. EBITDA loss margin is expanding which is exactly what you want to avoid in a growing company. The point of owning any growth company, like TSLA who recently reached positive EBITDA, is for the EBITDA loss to increase slower than the revenue or even decrease.  
  
Bluntly, the company is spending too much. Shares have been squeezed up nearly 100% from the low. There's better opportunities out there than $WISH right now."

Also care to share how your bot identifies other bots? 

I‚Äôm sorry I know you guys already take a lot of heat but to suggest you‚Äôre able to filter for bots without addressing it seems outlandish. The mods have made points to say they‚Äôre making efforts but it sounds like you have one that‚Äôs not being utilized or I‚Äôm misunderstanding. But more importantly, my point is that I would include the bots in your metrics for the popular thread because without doing so, no issue is solved. Say you have WISH, CLOV, and whatever garbage being spammed by bots that you‚Äôre able to identify, but don‚Äôt quarantine them into the popular thread (and correct me if I‚Äôm wrong is the real purpose of the popular thread) then you‚Äôre letting the bots continue to spam the daily.

If the above is the case, then the bot that filters and the mentions quantified for the popular thread are derived from user posts and does not include comments. Is that correct?

2021-06-23 20:28:04,wallstreetbets,"Maybe not 100 but it has plenty of room to grow :)   Saudi's breakeven on just the oil itself is in the 60s due mainly because of the ties to it's fiscal policy to the amount of oil revenue it generates.  2020 was bad enough that they needed [to take on more debt to cover part of this fiscal budget](https://www.reuters.com/article/saudi-bonds/update-3-saudi-arabia-raises-5-billion-via-dual-tranche-bonds-idUSL1N2K20SW).   There are 2 things that hamper Saudis or really OPEC in general from being aggressive about raising the amount of oil they drill:  
  
* OPEC countries generated a bunch of debt and with a limited American increase expected for 2021, keep oil above 70 but below 90 won't push other countries as hard to restart oil production and this allows them to sell their current supply of crude at a nicely inflated price to fund their fiscal policy and maybe cash in coffers or pay down some debt.  
* If OPEC gets too aggressive about increasing supply and OPEC+ countries get aggressive about the ramp up, it can lead to a significantly depressed price, which is well below breakeven for most OPEC countries, which doesn't bode well for their debt.  
  
If they do increase, it will be very modest, they will milk the 70-85 oil as long as they can.   If it gets above 90, that is where the pressure will increase significantly due to inflation concerns in other countries and now other countries that might be timid to restart capex expansion will get more aggressive, which will lead to depressed prices.  That is where they would drop the biggest increase if they're going to do it, get in before the other projects restart.  
  
**tl;dr**:  OPEC countries got debt and a good thing going with American oil getting hit.  They probably don't want to fuck it up or let Russia fuck it up anytime soon.

2021-06-23 21:58:37,wallstreetbets,"Research, research, research your stocks. I started in 2003 and believe me I've lost alot however I learned at every loss. You have to find what works for you. I would do stupid stuff. I would buy pre market. Now don't get me wrong sometimes pre-market can be of an advantage. I would see a stock take off and buy but my buy was at the top and I was too late to the party. Then you have the fear of missing out. My biggest problem was my emotions. If the stock started to tank I would sell. It would come back and I learned. Stocks go up and they go down and it's only a loss if you sell. I watched my dad lose over 250,000 in 2008 and he held. In the end he retuned the 250k back and then busted out another 300k. I would be complaining about losing two grand and he would be like just hold it's going to come back. I am not a financial advisor I just love trading stocks. This year is the first year I've actually done good. Yes lots of learning curves. For me anyways. Some pick up fast and get to üí∞. It took me some time. In the end I figured out it's not how you start to the race it's how you finish it. Now I shut up üòÇ"

It will be a lot more cost effective than solid state.
2021-06-23 22:11:28,wallstreetbets,"I don't know about you, but for a $74 difference getting the AWD seems like a no-brainer to me and the most significant factor in comparing them. The base F-150 Lightning EV with standard range has a tow capacity of 7,700 lbs. I think the 5,000 lb number you found is for the internal combustion model. Good luck to anyone towing anything near that weight with RWD only. The Cybertruck's front middle seat is not really suitable for a person due to the bucket seats, just watch the video of Elon Musk on Jay Leno's Garage with it if you need a visualization of this. The F-150 also has BlueCruise autonomy (Level 2 semi-autonomous technology), and yeah FSD sounds better but in practicality it's not going to be legal to use for a long time, at which point there will be better EV trucks to choose from than these two first generation models."

2021-06-24 04:41:24,wallstreetbets,"This is the paragraph from the motley article you linked which I'm assuming is what you're referencing. 

>Debt levels are fine
While $14.2 billion is no small number, it's nothing that Ford can't handle. Consider that in 2006 Ford took on more than $18 billion in debt to help restructure the company while taking massive losses. Between 2006 and 2008, Ford managed to lose over $30 billion from its operations. Nobody wanted to buy a Ford vehicle then, nobody. Things are completely different today. The Fusion is changing consumer attitudes and the Escape is selling like hotcakes. 2013 has started off with a bang in automotive sales, and Ford is taking full advantage of it. The company was confident enough in its financial shape to double its dividend a few months ago. There are a lot of reasons to be optimistic in Ford as a company and in having its stock in your portfolio. So the next time you hear someone mention that its $100 billion in debt is too much, enlighten them, please. Thanks in advance.

Besides the fact that the article is from 2013, my interpretation is that the author is claiming the debt levels are fine because of good sales in the first quarter of 2013? My understanding is that debt is fine if Ford can keep producing ICE cars, but if they want to pivot to an EV producer (by that I mean a majority of production being EVs, not just 10% or something), they will have to purchase new equipment, which is capital intensive, and pivoting also renders old equipment useless/less productive. So the concern is essentially that the equipment purchases with debt stops generating income, and they will need capital to purchase new equipment. 

Do you have a more up to date explanation regarding Ford's debt? Even if one accepts the explanation from 2013 of ""sales are fine so no need to worry about debt"", things are certainly different with the current context that legacy auto will most likely have to pivot heavily into EVs in the near future."
2021-06-23 23:43:31,wallstreetbets,"Again, the argument is circular... first, there's not room in the market for a company with that kind of valuation.   Then, the company that is lagging by years will replace that unreasonable market cap.  Then, the company that isn't vertically integrating will be able to take advantage of the total addressable market.  Seems like a very silly way to bet against tesla to me.   either the value is there or not.  This whole thesis is premised on tesla discovering the value in a marketplace that was overlooked.

If you think tesla is going to fail, buy puts..  At least that doesn't rely on tesla being overvalued.  Trading ford as a tesla bear is a weak tailwind play that needs a market leader like tesla to pay off.  You do you though..."
2021-06-23 22:35:52,wallstreetbets,0.002% of the earth's crust is **a lot**.
2021-06-23 22:49:33,wallstreetbets,"I doubt a 230 mile version (or 250 mile version in the case of Tesla) would be suitable for off-road usage as your efficiency would go way down. Meaning, you probably need more range if AWD is important. In that case the pricing for the Dual-Motor CT with Dual Motors is 50K which is about the same as the F-150 Pro with the Extended Battery. Like I mentioned above there are various things Tesla will offer that Ford will not have (notably the Supercharger network) so might be hard for Ford to compete.

What Ford has going for it, is a large base of users. I think Tesla can win over those users, but of course we will see. The only concern I would have with Tesla is the CT design is new and unproven if people will end up liking it. I think it offers enough benefits to make it an appealing choice (e.g. Stainless steel body means less damage and less rust, however to do Stainless Steel the body has to be a structural element otherwise it would add weight. Further, you might be limited in how you build it, in order to keep costs down. In other words, there are many considerations why Tesla is building the vehicle this way and why it might be necessary the benefits of this design come with the controversy of this design)."
2021-06-24 09:37:57,wallstreetbets,"Well, he‚Äôs fucked."
2021-06-24 15:31:48,wallstreetbets,"You have it. They need to invest $100b in new equipment, while writing down $200b in stranded assets, while paying on $100b debt.

All on the backs of $10b/yr profit from ICE vehicles. It‚Äôs an insane knot to untangle and not going to be easy.

Meanwhile Tesla has the new equipment already, no write downs, no debt, and $20b cash."
2021-06-23 23:56:35,wallstreetbets,im not buying puts on tesla because there are too many elon dick slurpers in the shirt term that dont see the big picture.  half the battle is gaging public interest and i refuse to go against the army of his pale neckbeard cult from twitter

That's not a lot. Electric card going into the millions made annually. Not to mention all other types of batteries that use it."
2021-06-23 20:27:43,wallstreetbets,"Wait is this a response to me? Because the quote doesn't match anything I wrote?

In regards to the test drive, you can still test drive the car dude. It's not like you buy one sight unseen and Tesla gets that.

As for the breakdown of the car, from my experience if your euro car breaks down and you get it towed to a service centre it takes a couple of weeks to fix anyway? Aren't you still out the car? lol  I mean there are so many variables with ""break down"" that it's hard to create a generic case for it."

2021-06-23 20:18:31,wallstreetbets,"Second comment here. 

It looks like that dip isn't because of sales, but because of the supply chain disruptions it is going to face.  Purely speculation on all the dumper's parts."
2021-06-23 20:13:12,wallstreetbets,"First off, thanks for the DD.  This caught my eye. Also, mkt cap is a yes pls.

Question: What about their sales? Profits?  Growth?

I hear you on the allure of the price of the stock, and its recent dump.  But is there something substantial here to run off of?

I have been in a La-z-Boy, and holy smokes was it expensive.  The sales lady told me it was like the ""lego"" version of the furniture world.  Not a good sales pitch, as I had no clue what she meant."
2021-06-24 19:10:51,wallstreetbets,"They told me it would take 4 - 7 months to get my chair that I ordered.  

But yeah I can see them rebounding when they catch up, and that should also tell you demand is not LOW."
2021-06-23 21:22:47,wallstreetbets,"Np! All credit to u/working_choice_7785 for the DD! Agreed, on the earnings call they stated margins might be lower but they‚Äôve adjusted some pricing to account for this. It‚Äôs not a sure bet, by any means, that supply chain issues will hurt them too harshly. I believe they beat on almost all metrics, earnings per share beat expectations by a whopping 17% and revenue beat by 4.20%. Sales are up 41%. I was an early investor in Restoration Hardware (bought it several years ago and recently sold after their latest earnings) and I think LZB could have a stronger run because their product is more accessible with a larger potential market share."
2021-06-23 20:56:45,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for the DD! Completely agree. Going even further, I see this as a tenable long term play. The housing boom is not going anywhere and a large share of those mortgages are going to millennials ‚Äî there is plenty of more room as many of us held off on purchasing homes so the upswing is probably here to stay. That trend bodes well for LZB ‚Äî gotta have at least one LZB in your house."

2021-06-23 20:07:20,wallstreetbets,"Is this a genuine question or a sarcastic one? Buying a call ITM will give you more intrinsic value and a larger delta which will allow the value of your contract to more closely move with the value of the stock, which is a good thing.

Also, call contracts are literally contracts saying that you have the right to purchase 100 shares at X price. Why wouldn't you want to have the right to purchase the stock at a lower price than the market price? Ultimately, this point doesn't matter since it is almost always better to sell a contract than exercise one, but that brings us back to my initial point/paragraph above."

2021-06-23 22:23:29,wallstreetbets,Yeah sorry there‚Äôs no 100% gains just bleeding like hell over last yr... you know why? Because they pushed an 18 wheeler down a hill lolllllll with a corrupt ceo and now pushing ‚Äúhydrogen‚Äù?

2021-06-23 20:11:37,wallstreetbets,"How am I making shit up?

Do some research on what it costs to build a hydrogen refueling station.  It is crazy expensive.

It is even more expensive to build a plant to produce hydrogen.

The entire float is held by Retail investors alone. It's not IF theres a squeeze, its WHEN. And I'm holding till then.  I wont ever be holding bags as the price I got in at will probably never be touched again. Minimum 200% gains nomatter what happens"

Additionally, everything dumped this afternoon. I'm assuming the AH dump was a preemptive reaction to fears of lackluster earnings or just negative drag from the earlier report. 

Having said that, if you look at Pennyether's previous DDs, they're always well researched, full of warnings, and generally lucrative if you time them properly. 

No one forced you to make your trades. If you still have the conviction that you had reading the DD, stick by your guns and don't judge a stock by its AH movements. None of your calls are expiring for a few weeks and your shares aren't going anywhere, so just see what tomorrow brings.

2021-06-23 23:07:24,wallstreetbets,Damn this AH action is nasty.
2021-06-24 15:09:54,wallstreetbets,"This is a great writeup and I hope the action after earnings didn't deter people from buying shares. Buying options are risky on this thinly traded stock so after today's dive I sold $45 CSPs for Aug 20. The same dive happened after Q1 earnings and then the market realized ""oh shit, there's a housing shortage and the market is still super hot.""

One thing I would say as cautionary is that states KBH operates within are notoriously difficult to get permitting for housing. So it naturally slows the build process and thus you get less volume. Earnings were probably better than expected because the national home builders actually stockpile lumber and copper and so when the futures market exploded they could tap reserves and ignore the volatility. The revenue numbers are more concerning, but in the end, this stock is off its mkt cap highs and can rally long-term.

Have you, or anyone reading this, looked into LGIH? They build multi-unit housing in FL and TX  (notoriously easy permit application) which are both seeing inflows of residents. I like the play not just from a rotational perspective, but also because 99% of the float is owned by institutions, they have 9% SI, and only have 25mm shares outstanding. It could see a pretty fast runup once retail tries to pile in."

2021-06-24 16:43:24,wallstreetbets,">but they have 25m shares outstanding, not $25m. Not necessarily low float

typo. edited on your catch, thank you. 

and yes, the liquidity in home building stocks has been higher relatively speaking, but I still don't think its catching the retail volume it deserves. So you're absolutely right, when a stock has retail attention and beats earnings estimates by 15% and super bullish outlook you'd think it would run 6% the other direction. Your thesis is sound and as long as home sales maintain strength I think it'll yield strong returns. I mean, it doesn't even seem like the market is factoring in that we haven't even reached peak home sales season, but markets are weird."

2021-06-24 13:05:46,wallstreetbets,When a DD is posted you always see an overreaction in IV/Pricing.  IF you like a play it's best to wait a bit.  Let the dust settle.  FOMO is never a good move
2021-06-24 13:17:06,wallstreetbets,I would just wait and see how the eviction moratorium ending affects housing in general.  If we see a huge surge in home listings then that will put a lot of pricing down-pressure.  If we get a nice dip in homebuilders I might go in for some LEAPS.  I almost never play earnings with options.  To me thats a disaster waiting to happen.
2021-06-23 22:36:51,wallstreetbets,ü§°
2021-06-24 08:45:15,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it looks like analysts are just head scratching and using that miss as the only thing they can think of to cause a drop - because it's irrelevant given the rest of the report. Earnings are up, and they're selling and filling their backlog faster than was projected, which just means faster future growth.

  
I think the real answer is that the stock pumped a bit pre-earnings because of it's newly minted semi-meme status, and Wall Street used the earnings as their opportunity to cash out short term profit. I'd hazard a guess that they also took full advantage of the 75% spike on call premiums the moment this DD was posted and have an incentive to protect their positions."
2021-06-23 21:35:41,wallstreetbets,"Yes, to buy shares. Reasoning: they went up a lot, I had enough exposure to earnings w/ Jul calls, and I can buy the Aug calls again in mid-July before the other builders post earnings."
2021-06-24 12:53:08,wallstreetbets,Aug much safer. I bought some more Jul but not nearly as much as I bought Aug. I'll post an update soon.

2021-06-23 20:40:11,wallstreetbets,"They are very related theses -- both sectors are undergoing a surge in demand after a drought in supply, with COVID exaggerating both aspects. Their share prices (aside from the ebb and flow of the general market) depend on the market updating their long term outlook from ""return to norm"" to ""oh, there's a new norm.""

FWIW: Having spent much more time reading about steel than housing, my conviction in steel is higher, and I have a lot more at stake there. I think they offer similar risk/reward, but KBH, to me, represents a shorter term opportunity, as I think price discovery is much faster in residential construction than steel (as you probably know by now).

I'd hate to lose you money if it doesn't work out, so probably just stick to steel if you're strapped for cash!"

2021-06-24 01:12:02,wallstreetbets,"Yeah man, it's an interesting play. Not the most excited about it but bought a few calls to speculate. If it got picked up here it would undoubtedly go crazy."

2021-06-24 16:25:21,wallstreetbets,EEENF is actually in a decent spot right now. Rumor mill in the industry is someone is looking to buy them out.
2021-06-24 03:01:26,wallstreetbets,Good post. I've been following since inception and that's a good analysis.
2021-06-24 15:46:04,wallstreetbets,"Major short attack by Viceroy Research.  Please check it out.  Lot of mis-information being put out in an attempt to manipulate the SP.

2021-06-24 04:43:46,wallstreetbets,so jealous!

2021-06-24 09:15:27,wallstreetbets,I have made more money on this stock than I did with GME.
2021-06-24 13:18:56,wallstreetbets,"Oil is a necessary evil to balance not completely avoid now. With too much supply climate change accelerates even faster, with too little, prices rocket and serve as a drain on economic development especially for poorer countries. 

My read (convenient for me as an investor here, but probably true nonetheless) is that the battery transition is already happening via regulation, so oil price won‚Äôt significantly speed it up. So keeping oil price reasonable will probably help poor countries more and not significantly change the type of global warming we will get. Namibia is an exaggerated microcosm of this. They‚Äôre already going to be hard hit by global warming, does the few % more from this field change that much? Probably not, especially compared to the economic gains they could get from the oil itself, which can help buffer the population against the effects of global warming.

I know the oil industry has been shitty for a long time, but people forget that the reason they got the clout to do so was because they are absolutely essential to modern society, and still will be for 2-3 more decades. This is not a Tobacco or even McDonald‚Äôs situation."

Here are a few things you should read about Viceroy Research.

2021-06-24 00:29:59,wallstreetbets,Great entry. I bought some around $8 too. It‚Äôs been a fun ride üòÖ
2021-06-24 15:53:59,wallstreetbets,"Thanks man. Mid-Late May was not fun with the short attacks - had to take a step back. Nice PR this morning with the 1,100 ft of shows. More encouraging news :)"

2021-06-24 15:46:22,wallstreetbets,"Yes, that viceroy. You do realize that they were right with Grenke, right? I don't always agree with their findings, but Steinhoff, Wirecard, Grenke and Reco I fully agree with the assessment of fraud.

Edit: I do mean Viceroy the shortsellers. I don't know whether they shorted AMC. Don't think they did."
2021-06-24 15:56:34,wallstreetbets,Officially we are not but after the July investor package is released these bargain prices should be long gone.
2021-06-24 11:13:23,wallstreetbets,Dicaprio sent out a statement about RECAF destroying the environment and I think that's why it was brought up.
2021-06-24 11:10:27,wallstreetbets,What is going on? Why is wish barely over $13 today? The volume is lacking compared to yesterday too? Am I missing something?
2021-06-24 16:26:05,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs mooning right now.
2021-06-23 21:01:02,wallstreetbets,"There was one ""DD"" where the guy was like ""so yeah, the downside to Wish is they have lots of customer complaints but they can solve that easy"" and offered zero elaboration. When I asked if he could, you know, SAY HOW, I got downvotes and some asinine response. I had to go look in my post history because I couldn't even fucking remember it, it was so ridiculous

2021-06-24 09:02:18,wallstreetbets,"Honestly it's going to be another 5 years, but it should be amazing once they finish.

It's like a new TV show - you can only watch one episode per week.  Old TV shows you can watch them all one after the other without stopping.  In another 5 years, they'll have dozens of systems, fewer bugs, more things to do... an entire virtual universe.  

Hopefully.  :-)"
2021-06-24 14:03:57,wallstreetbets,"ANOTHER 5 YEARS???

Jesus Christ. By the time this launches, it will immediately be antiquated because of next gen tech advances.

At least, I hope not.

2021-06-23 22:04:38,wallstreetbets,Yeah I think thats because theyre both at bearish points in their natural cycles and theyre being heavily shorted at these levels for that reason more or less if you want the truth.

How much more growth do you want?"
2021-06-23 22:55:12,wallstreetbets,People want a lot of growth and they need a lot to justify the multiple. I think it's undervalued with a 3 year investment horizon. Might be some disappointed people over the next 6 months though.

What got me really really excited is their approach to partnering with hardware manufacturers like HP. Think about cloud gaming industry and how many PC and TVs could embed Agora.io into their box to enable RTE.

Our approach to communication is changing and while Wall Street focuses on the past, I felt it‚Äôs time for us to live them behind. They think all we know is squeeze, I think we can prove them wrong. Crowd sourced intelligence is definitely better. Welcome the new age of forensics investment."

[CPNG SHort interest Chart - Ortex](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16UWkxInzGDt_drr86raySqy8yT_b2ISo/view?usp=sharing)

Ortex is also reporting that 97% of the Shares that are available to be Shorted have been lent out...this can be a really interesting situation

i am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice....i currently own 50 shares at $45.29 and will add more today

good luck to all"
