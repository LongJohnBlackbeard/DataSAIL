2021-05-16 17:15:26,wallstreetbets,"Some completely true facts about Elon;

He got kicked out of a small website called x.com for being a dumbass. Peter Thiel then proceeded to turn it into the behemoth that is Paypal. He just happened to still hold stock as its value explodes. He did not found or build Paypal.

TESLA WAS NOT FOUNDED BY ELON MUSK, it was founded by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Elon bought a majority stake in tesla and then proceeded to kick them out of their own vision and masquerade as a savior to humanity. 


In depth debunking of the Elon and his assumed history

Part 1

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=c-FGwDDc-s8 

Part 2

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DopFo1rjAr4


He has been lying about “self driving” coming out “this year” for 5 years despite the fact in recent emails they fucking told the DMV ITS NOT COMING.

https://sys.4channel.org/derefer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fdavidsilver%2F2021%2F03%2F09%2Ftesla-emails-to-the-california-dmv-emphasize-continued-reliance-on-maps%2F%3Fsh%3D5d6468d057e6


Did you know the only reason Tesla has a solar division is because musk used shareholder money to bailout his failing solar company?

Is Elon musk a psychopath?

Did you know he said he would “fire” his ex wife if she didnt dye her hair blonde?

He then proceeded to abandon her after having her bear 5 of his children.

TESLA WAS NOT FOUNDED BY ELON MUSK, it was founded by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Elon bought a majority stake in tesla and then proceeded to kick them out of their own vision and masquerade as a savior to humanity.

Part 2

He has been lying about “self driving” coming out “this year” for 5 years despite the fact in recent emails they fucking told the DMV ITS NOT COMING.

Did you know the only reason Tesla has a solar division is because musk used shareholder money to bailout his failing solar company?

Is Elon musk a psychopath?

Did you know he said he would “fire” his ex wife if she didnt dye her hair blonde?

He then proceeded to abandon her after having her bear 5 of his children.

Oil prices will continue to rise. Here are all the parties that want higher oil prices:

-US policymakers (they think it will drive green innovation)

-US/Canada shale, tar sands producers

-Mideast oil producers

-EU (same reasons as US)


Here are the parties that want lower oil prices

-all non-oil-producing nations but primarily China and India

So then what might cause flat or declining oil prices?

The only thing I can think of would either be a glut of supply coming online quickly (Iran), or cratering demand due to a big resurgence in Covid cases.

We are still well below the average price of oil during the Obama era.

TESLA WAS NOT FOUNDED BY ELON MUSK, it was founded by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Elon bought a majority stake in tesla and then proceeded to kick them out of their own vision and masquerade as a savior to humanity.

Part 2

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DopFo1rjAr4


He has been lying about “self driving” coming out “this year” for 5 years despite the fact in recent emails they fucking told the DMV ITS NOT COMING.

Did you know the only reason Tesla has a solar division is because musk used shareholder money to bailout his failing solar company?

Is Elon musk a psychopath?

Did you know he said he would “fire” his ex wife if she didnt dye her hair blonde?

He then proceeded to abandon her after having her bear 5 of his children.

He got kicked out of a small website called x.com for being a dumbass. Peter Thiel then proceeded to turn it into the behemoth that is Paypal. He just happened to still hold stock as its value explodes. He did not found or build Paypal.

TESLA WAS NOT FOUNDED BY ELON MUSK, it was founded by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Elon bought a majority stake in tesla and then proceeded to kick them out of their own vision and masquerade as a savior to humanity. 


In depth debunking of the Elon and his assumed history

Part 1

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=c-FGwDDc-s8 

Part 2

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DopFo1rjAr4


He has been lying about “self driving” coming out “this year” for 5 years despite the fact in recent emails they fucking told the DMV ITS NOT COMING.

https://sys.4channel.org/derefer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fdavidsilver%2F2021%2F03%2F09%2Ftesla-emails-to-the-california-dmv-emphasize-continued-reliance-on-maps%2F%3Fsh%3D5d6468d057e6


Did you know the only reason Tesla has a solar division is because musk used shareholder money to bailout his failing solar company?

Is Elon musk a psychopath?

Did you know he said he would “fire” his ex wife if she didnt dye her hair blonde?

He then proceeded to abandon her after having her bear 5 of his children.

Then when those kids are done messing around in their own game they will move to one where the have paid and continue to pay for upgrades.

My son plays Roblox and my wife recently asked me about Robucks. I am not really sure how it all works, but my wife is apparently seeing those as a popular gift or request from kids."
2021-05-16 13:56:06,wallstreetbets,I thought about buying a strangle on this but didn’t and regretted it since
2021-05-16 14:16:34,wallstreetbets,There’s no way Roblox can justify its share price when compared to more established competitors. Disclosure: I’m going to buy as many $40 puts as I can. Not financial advise.

2021-05-16 14:35:03,wallstreetbets,Roblox is going downhill from here. Youtubers aren’t playing it anymore and the ones that are are small time. Roblox plateaued.

2021-05-16 15:37:47,wallstreetbets,"Your son understands Roblox as an investor more than 99% of wallstreet does.

I still play an online game that I started playing when I was 8 years old in 2004. RPG games is really just pre-virtual reality or metaverses as they call it."
2021-05-16 17:30:05,wallstreetbets,Comparing Unity and Roblox is like comparing Autodesk to Scratch.
2021-05-16 19:25:23,wallstreetbets,"The roblox ecosystem is impressive, particularly fact that it can incentivize kids to work and earn money.  With a monthly subscription (\~$4) the user get Robux every month and has access to the Roblox marketplace where they can list their own items.  

I've seen normally lazy kids brute force learn to use Gimp photo editing software to create clothing for their personal stores.  With enough friends in school they make a steady stream of Robux from custom requests and just executing on every crazy kid idea rattling around their brain.   

I generally dislike the recurring revenue drug so many games are moving to, but in the case of Roblox there is a potential some kids come away from it with some real entrepreneurial lessons."
2021-05-16 17:03:54,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, a roblox gift card is a great gift for a kid from my experience."

2021-05-16 15:42:19,wallstreetbets,"They spend a fuck ton on their developer studio and are playing the long term. I've read their IPO filing and it's stated that they will do things that are not in the best interest of investors in the short term so that they can achieve global ubiquity.

There are many things they do that investors don't consider, like acquiring learn-to-code education applications like Coding Kingdoms to teach kids how to code and implement it into software curricula in schools."

2021-05-16 15:26:13,wallstreetbets,Yeah but think about how many accounts are made daily. Most of them are from kids who forgot their account info. Not enough of them are buying Robux to drive Roblox stock any higher. I have a feeling they’ve plateaued. Unless they can find a way to drive the price higher.
2021-05-16 14:52:09,wallstreetbets,Hmmm. Do you think it’s going to be big?

2021-05-16 13:14:36,wallstreetbets,"I had done a DD on UWMC sometime back. Hope you find it useful (might be a bit dated but fundementals still remain the same)  
  
Core Product  
  
United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM) underwrites loans for mortgage brokers, banks and credit unions. It doesn't lend directly to borrowers. Instead, they are simply the facilitator and underwriter. What they mainly provide is consumers, lenders and institutions a simple process by which they can apply, compare and complete a mortgage application. They currently have one of the fastest and most effective consumer to lender processes due to their heavy investments into IT infrastructure (UWMC’s mortgage process takes an average of 17 days from start to finish when compared to the industry average of 47 days)  
  
Financials  
  
UWM had a stellar year in 2020 and it reflects in its financials.  
  
UWM reported 4Q20 net income of $1.37 billion and FY20 net income of $3.38 billion, an 821% and 715% increase over 4Q19 and FY19 respectively. Their total loan volume amount for 2020 was $182.5B which was 69% higher than 2019.  
  
Cash in hand also rose from 133M in 4Q-19 to 1.22B in 4Q-20. Credit quality of the loans improved with the weighted average FICO of 757 for the full year of 2020. This brought down the 60+ delinquency rates well below the industry average. UWMC also just declared its first regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share on the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock. The dividend is payable on April 6, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 10, 2021.  
  
Potential and Hype Factors  
  
Russell index addition: UWMC is expected to be added into Russell 1000 and Russell 3000 index by end of March. This will force all the funds tracking these indices to add UWMC to their portfolio possibly driving the stock price higher.  
  
Technology moat: UWMC invests heavily in IT infrastructure and technology. They develop all their technology with in-house developers. They have developed tools such as Blink+, UWM InTouch, and Brand 360 which enables them to have an industry-leading close time (almost twice as fast as Rocket and 3x as fast as the industry average)  
  
Short interest: While the company is in no way similar to some meme stock case in short interest (up to 140% which was a very rare event), it still is at 31% which is significantly higher than average. (source: fintel.io)  
  
NPS score: They currently have the happiest customers among their competition with an NPS score 16% higher than that of Rocket (which is at 2nd place).  
  
Risk and Competition  
  
75% of the mortgage volume was based on refinancing ($42.9B new mortgages, $139.3B refinancing). This is predominantly driven by declining mortgage rates. If the mortgage rates increase, then UWMC’s refinancing volume will take a significant hit bringing down their revenues.  
  
There is a lot of discussion around this being one of the reasons UWMC went public so as to capitalize on the refinance boom. I don’t completely buy this argument as company executives themselves are solidifying their position (Director of $UWMC just reported his SEC form 4, showing he more than doubled his own position on March 1st, from 50k to 110k shares).  
  
The full impact of UWMC’s CEO's surprise announcement that they wouldn’t work with mortgage brokers that work with Rocket or Fairway Independent Mortgage is still not clear. UWMC has said that the split will take effect from March 15th.  
  
Conclusion  
  
This is the first time in my experience that a trending stock that has solid fundamentals is generating revenue, is profitable, and has no debt. Although there are some risks in terms of mortgage rates and the surprise announcement, I think the current market conditions put UWMC in a very strong position as a long-term play."

Think about it, they raised a couple billion at more than double their current valuation. That's like a 50% off sale, no amount of low fixed rates on corporate debt beats eliminating debt at 50% your basis. 

I also bought VIAC because they have an incredible amount of content in their library and have shown more inent to monetize it than just about anyone else. Seriously, download Pluto TV. It's a free app structured to feel like cable, but with hundreds of channels dedicated to just streaming endless reruns of old CBS content from Hawaii Five O to the Adams Family to Survivor. This is the first old line content owner to offer a free access to their entire library while simply monetizing it with old school TV ads format. The question is really why haven't all the other old line media companies done something as simple as this. Pluto already has 50 million downloads and is growing rapidly. That's not to mention Paramount + making serious headway. 

It's just refreshing to see an old line company taking notes from disruptors and acting accordingly."

2021-05-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"This is not economic boom, this is just recovery !!!!  The recent NFIB survey suggests we are only in an economic recovery, not an expansion. 

 While the mainstream media overlooks the NFIB data, they really shouldn’t. There are currently 30.7 million small businesses in the United States[*.*](https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/23142610/2019-Small-Business-Profiles-States-Territories.pdf) Small businesses *(defined as fewer than 500 employees)* **account for 99% of all enterprises, employ 60 million people, and account for nearly 70% of employment.** The chart below shows the breakdown of firms and jobs from the 2019 Census Bureau Data. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zw4426oprhz61.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=5692ffc300115b9a511e1647232fb8032c5f958b

 Let’s dig in. 

 

### NFIB Shows Confidence Drop

**The April survey showed a slight increase in the over “confidence” index to 99.8 vs. 98.2 in March. The reading is substantially lower than the August 2018 reading of 108.8.** Notably, despite a year-long economic recovery from the Q2-2020 lows, the level of confidence remains near recessionary levels.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6h4saayrhz61.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=05dc1256be3e935048e02e19f4c57d0e09cb3e16

 Not surprisingly, given the economy is still struggling with the current recovery,   “confidence”                               remains extremely weak. 

 The importance of *“weak confidence”* also affects the *“risk”* business owners will take concerning capital expenditures, employment, and sales. **Importantly, this is a** ***“sentiment”*** **based survey.** Such is a crucial concept to understand as ***“planning”*** **to do something and** ***“doing”*** **it can be very different.** 

 

### An Economic Boom Will Require Participation

Currently, many analysts expect a massive economic boom in 2021. The basis of those expectations is massive *“pent-up”* demand as the economy reopens.

**I would agree with that expectation had there been no stimulus programs or expanded unemployment benefits.** Those inflows allowed individuals to spend during a recession where such would not usually be the case. Those artificial inputs dragged forward future or *“pent-up”* consumption into the present.

However, the NFIB survey also suggests much the same.

**Small businesses are susceptible to economic downturns and don’t have access to public markets for debt or secondary offerings. As such, they tend to focus heavily on operating efficiencies and profitability.**

**If businesses were expecting a massive surge in** ***“pent up”*** **demand, they would be doing several things to prepare for it.** Such includes planning to increase capital expenditures to meet expected demand. Unfortunately, those expectations peaked in 2018 and are dropping back to the March 2020 lows.

 

### Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *“actually”* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *“demand”* meets its operating cash flows.

To increase employment, which is the single most considerable cost to any business, you need two things:

1. *Confidence the economy is going to continue to grow in the future, which leads to;*
2. *The increase in the production of goods or services requiring increased employment to meet growing demand.*

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qgpd1rqeshz61.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdf5af23ed3d590678c02894f1f43198031bf874

 Businesses understand that the stimulus [***“pulled forward”*** ](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***“costs”*** **of** ***“long-term employment”*** **for a** ***“short-term”*** **artificial economic boost.** 

 

### The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.** Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9vqsosfkshz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=d46a184ce87c222fc678ef69b207c8956ba94d17

 

While stimulus may lead to a short-term boost in consumption, the impact of higher taxes, more regulations, and weak employment growth will suppress consumption longer-term.

Despite economic headlines, the recovery of sales for small businesses has been less than *“booming.”*

 

### A Recovery Versus An Expansion

With this background, it is easier to understand why the recent exuberance in chasing small-cap stocks may be premature. **While small-cap companies do historically perform well coming out of recession, the basis was an organic recovery cycle of increasing productivity.**

Currently, the run-up remains the assumption that the stimulus-fueled recovery is sustainable. **Such is only the case if the stimulus becomes a regular benefit and increases in size annually. However, since** [***deficit-based spending is deflationary***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/macroview-a-vaccine-and-the-new-new-normal/)***,*** the outcome will fall well short of expectations.

>*“in 1998, the Federal Reserve “crossed the ‘Rubicon,’ whereby lowering interest rates failed to stimulate economic growth or inflation as the ‘debt burden’ detracted from it. When compared to the total debt of the economy, monetary velocity shows the problem facing the Fed.”*

https://preview.redd.it/2budem4qshz61.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3597e6ad0a525708b14a84e4b20ec242d56f381

 **Such is a critical point as it relates to small-cap companies given their high correlation to small-business confidence.** The correlation between the small-cap index (Russell 2000) and underlying confidence is very high. Given the annual change in “confidence” is declining, it is not surprising to see that small-cap stocks recently peaked. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1fi4wzptshz61.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a30c19ab1f3f10f823bbcb3eab9b287201d622e

 

### Conclusion

Given that debt-driven government spending programs have a dismal history of providing the economic growth promised, disappointment over the next year is almost a guarantee.

While there are indeed *“inflationary pressures”* short-term as the massive infusions, coupled with supply shortages and delivery bottlenecks, higher prices will erode purchasing power. The decline in purchasing power, combined with higher input costs, and potentially higher taxes, will continue to weigh on confidence near term.

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive.

**Most importantly, there is a massive difference between** ***“getting back to even”*** **versus** ***“growing the economy.”*** **One creates economic prosperity by expanding production, which creates consumption. The other does not.**

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one’s wealth longer-term.

Fed changed tune and soon began lowering rates and we were off to races 2019. 1 year before Covid19 shut down of economy. If we could not handle higher rates then... Well now LOL forget about it. All theses gains are recovery and low interest rates. If unemployment does not get better, taxes are raised, and Fed finally does what bond market will demand it will be correction of all corrections for many especially the young ones who have not lived through 2000-2001 and 2008-2009.

But half the country does not own and cannot afford. So then they will be. If you think they care about your home values your sadly mistaken. Always have an exit strategy of money saved to bay an additional property when markets crash...  600K house 1% property tax and 300K house 2% property tax is same tax revenue for government.

2021-05-16 19:31:18,wallstreetbets,"A Farm crisis leads to bank debt (they try to cover losses in the market - can you say margin call?). Meanwhile, Americans are overspending and going into debt. Businesses are reinvesting profits into more supply, leading to reduced costs (which was great in the 20s, but everyone had spent so much on credit they couldn't keep the demand high). Oh and all the while the fed kept interest rates low to encourage  risky loans and supply side mechanics.   


Then Americans in debt stop purchasing so much (obvs), further driving down prices. Wages had been concentrated at the top so immigrants/poor labor couldn't continue to keep demand for goods high (and those poor farmers). Unemployment, bank crisis, run on banks (everybody has lost their money = no more purchases = cycle of despair).   


Fed realizes their mistake and raises interest rates (whoops, less money in a dangerous cycle that needs to increase demand). Protectionist policy in the Hawley-Smoot tariff, and bam depression.  


Hoover + FDR  begin interventions with the RFC, FDIC, SEC, and so many more. FDRs New Deal makes Americans feel a little better without stopping the Depression. Then the SS tax and some dipshit idea to balance a budget creates a recession in 1937. Enter John Maynard Keynes and the beautiful deficit spending (bonus, overseas war = even more deficit spending!!). Small post war recession then the baby boom, suburban America boom (god bless the levittown), and the 1950s. Cold War looms, but White Americans keep building houses and buying TVs. Everyone acts the same so they don't turn commie. Commies are so scary Americans start playing dominoes in Vietnam. Civil Rights movement ramps up too.    


Then in the 60s LBJ and Kennedy get us really into Vietnam. LBJ also wages a war on poor people, er, poverty, and builds his great society. But damn if that ain't expensive. In 1968 everyone dies. Then Nixon comes along and many Americans become disillusioned with society because wow the government (that had been helping since FDR and defeated the Nazis and faced down Stalin and put a man on the freakin' moon!) is actually bad sometimes. Disillusionment. Also detente and grain trade to China (yay for farmers!). Uh oh OPEC is a thing and all that CIA meddling and Israel support created some enemies. Inflation (damn you LBJ!). Production costs high. We produce less. Stagflation. Watergate, more disillusionment. A peanut farmer POTUS. A hostage crisis. Hippies. Soviets in Afghanistan. Grain embargo (uh oh farmers).   


Then suddenly, Reagan. Fed kills inflation with high rates. Deflation = recession. Its short. Except for farmers who get ass pounded and lose their land and those banks are in trouble. Mr. ""government is the problem"" uses government to solve the problem. Ag bills. More exports. NAFTA. ""It's the economy stupid."" The internet is a thing, then it isn't, then it is again. Hey do you want a house loan? Financial crisis. Don't we have an SEC for this? Keynes is resurrected. Bull market. Cough cough crash no jk recovery. You want some stimmy? Is this inflation out of control?   


Sorry I got lost in the sauce here."
2021-05-16 18:37:51,wallstreetbets,"**A lot**, but simply put? **Over-leveraged investors and businesses kicked the first domino and sent the whole economy into a spiral.** Also, farmers, but they're basically over-leveraged investors who sell corn instead of FDs... But that's not today's topic. 

Too much leverage and not enough capital is something we *definitely don't have to worry about today.* Banks **totally don't** have 3-4x more commercial loans than they did in 2019 with the same limited amount of capital. That is definitely not the same minuscule amount capital that had them fail multiple stress tests. 

Plus, it's not like commodities are being squeezed, lowering margins for businesses. Meanwhile, the government pays out obscene levels of unemployment which keeps laborers out of the market which can force these smaller businesses to reduce hours and make less profit... 

It's definitely not a perfect setup for businesses to implode and banks to be left holding a bill they can't pay. All while people FOMO into markets at ATH with money they can't afford to lose and buy homes for 50%+ more than they're worth. Oh, and don't forget Daddy Powell has a bloated balance sheet that he's desperately trying to keep from causing irreversible damage to our economic/banking systems. 

Oh, wait... I have 47 chromies, this is a perfect setup.

Just think about the GD banging the GFC and you'll have our next recession. I am calling it: **The Great REEcession.**"

Now they get a cardboard spoon."

Gamma - for every $1 change in Disney stock price, the delta of each option contract will change by $244?  
Theta - for every day that passes, the price of each option contract falls by $719?  
Vega - I know this measures sensitivity to IV, but not sure how to use the ""3,382"" in a sentence...

Disney is a juggernaut. People are fanatical about the park. You have to reserve 2 months in advance for Disneyland. There merchandise flies off the shelf. Movies are killing it.

2021-05-16 16:14:29,wallstreetbets,I won't know what to stream once I finish watching all the Marvel content. It is not coming fast enough. I think people consume D+ content much faster than they release it. I think there is big retention in subscribers from families because we all know children can rewatch the same content over and over again.
2021-05-16 16:15:58,wallstreetbets,Sexy.  Very sexy.
2021-05-16 16:26:01,wallstreetbets,"While many here clearly seem to disagree, I don’t think dumping those calls was necessarily a bad idea. Doubt those July calls would make it in before the expiry. Not sure about January, but lots of doubt there as well.

2021-05-16 17:33:53,wallstreetbets,"Is dis real?   Why would you toss away long dated calls like that.  Parks are reopening.  Shits gonna be a madhouse at the parks.   People want in to Disney so bad they can raise prices by 20-30 dollars a ticket and it will still sell out.  Charge 6 bucks for churros lol.  Over reaction I think, rage sold?"
2021-05-16 17:39:11,wallstreetbets,"Why did you bet on the mouse, of all things? Shit was overvalued on D+ hype."
2021-05-16 17:42:05,wallstreetbets,Did you close the position?
2021-05-16 18:56:58,wallstreetbets,Stock investing isn't about YOLO. It's about research. It's also undermining the geniuses of WSB when people keep posting massive losses (which people like myself predicted) for the apes who blindly followed the lead & had no plan. They are laughing at us & already have plans to take the rest of the wealth from us. The once good deeds that were going on here are long dead. It's nothing more than lemmings jumping off a cliff with zero investment knowledge.
2021-05-16 18:58:11,wallstreetbets,Where the fuck are people getting the kind of money for these ridiculous investments?
2021-05-16 18:59:28,wallstreetbets,Hindsight is always 20/20.  Smarter thing would be to buy 1M worth of DIS stock then sell covered calls against it.

2021-05-16 13:58:07,wallstreetbets,"Betting on Disney isn't a good move imo. They seem to be bent on destroying all of their franchises to please very small but vocal groups. See star wars and the future of marvel. I think billion dollar blockbusters are a thing of the past for them until they course correct. 

Also Disney plus growth was as probably as good as its ever going to get with the pandemic, and I don't see the park traffic rebounding as strong as people forsee."
2021-05-16 14:41:58,wallstreetbets,"I dont like DIS. Thats like Nintento, “old trash” doing good cause of high fanbase. DIS streaming the worst out there and not worth 5$ a month 🙈"
2021-05-16 14:45:24,wallstreetbets,He's thinking Disneyland is reopening everywhere and will rocket back when people start throwing their money away at the mouse death cult again.

2021-05-16 11:54:22,wallstreetbets,"I am curious about the thought process : when people risk large amounts on Options , do they realise that 90% of options expire worthless ? Do they realise they are essentially gambling the money or do they feel they are making an “investment” ?"
2021-05-16 11:59:40,wallstreetbets,Rip

2021-05-16 12:05:43,wallstreetbets,"That screen shot is $590k loss not a million, still significant though. Hopefully you learn a lesson and stop gambling before you lose the rest and put yourself in debt."
2021-05-16 12:05:57,wallstreetbets,If you wanted to lose 1 million dollars you should have just wired it to me 🤣
2021-05-16 12:07:44,wallstreetbets,Why would you put a million dollars into options as an individual user
2021-05-16 12:07:53,wallstreetbets,"This is why I come here, got some nice material to beat off to tonight"

2021-05-16 12:24:45,wallstreetbets,"Straight greed buying options with that much money, you should be investing that kind of wealth, not gambling."
2021-05-16 12:24:49,wallstreetbets,You could make more money just betting on FDs with the spy at a much lower risk.
2021-05-16 12:25:04,wallstreetbets,I’m trying to feel bad about my 100k loss but now I can’t. Thanks a lot

2021-05-16 12:43:17,wallstreetbets,"Yeah so I was pretty shocked that the original post didn't get much traction, and this one is still way underrated IMO. OP you are a true fucking retard. I have no doubt you will make this money back, but holy crap.

2021-05-16 13:03:11,wallstreetbets,Better than a 2 million dollar loss
2021-05-16 13:03:31,wallstreetbets,The real question is how these people get one million dollars to begin with

2021-05-16 13:05:14,wallstreetbets,Star Wars tho
2021-05-16 13:06:19,wallstreetbets,Damn I just came
2021-05-16 13:07:29,wallstreetbets,"The 220 calls seem a little farfetched, but the 200s still seem like they would be possible. On expiration day, Disney would have to hit about 216 to break even, ~220 for a 40% profit. I would think that there are worse bets than 30% growth in 8 months when Disney is in a big reopening swing, but I guess you never know what the future will bring. It definitely seemed a lot more feasible when Disney was flying to the 200s months ago."
2021-05-16 13:07:55,wallstreetbets,"Meanwhile I am crying because I brought only one contract and am loosing money! 

You are the real retard!"

2021-05-16 13:22:19,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-16 13:22:50,wallstreetbets,"Did you buy calls?  That is about the worst possible strategy there is. You should sell options, not buy them!  Collect premium, don’t pay it.  Let time work in your favor, not against you!   If you are determined to buy, just buy the stock because it never expires, unless of course the company goes bankrupt."
2021-05-16 13:23:24,wallstreetbets,Tomorrow will be very strong.... Sell then as it's a trap. Or repair by creating a narrow spread.
2021-05-16 13:24:43,wallstreetbets,Just give me your investment money and I’ll make you and I both rich

2021-05-16 13:33:42,wallstreetbets,Has anybody here actually seen DIS again porn because I haven’t?
2021-05-16 13:34:14,wallstreetbets,"Sorry dude to hear this. Hope you can make it back with other opportunities like Gamestop, AMC stock etc. Good Luck bro! Wishing the best to you."
2021-05-16 13:35:45,wallstreetbets,"Why did you realize the loss with so much time left? Isn't the point of leaps to hold through something like this? Not judging, just confused."
2021-05-16 13:36:13,wallstreetbets,"Your flair should be ""FUCKED BY THE MOUSE"""

2021-05-16 13:51:03,wallstreetbets,The human brain really fascinates me. Giving up life changing money for worthless internet points. WSB really feels like a masochist expo.
2021-05-16 13:51:20,wallstreetbets,Should of bought AMC.

In all seriousness-I’m sorry bro."
2021-05-16 13:53:01,wallstreetbets,"🤦🏼‍♂️ I’ll be honest, I don’t understand some of the YOLOing.  If I had a million bucks, I’d pay off my house and put the rest in some dividend paying investments.  I just want to get to the million.

Must be easy come, easy go if you’re able to go all in on options."
2021-05-16 13:53:26,wallstreetbets,"So it was you who fucked the rest of us up.

Jan 21 200C should still print."
2021-05-16 13:54:30,wallstreetbets,Idiot
2021-05-16 13:54:33,wallstreetbets,Disney... seriously... 🙄🙄🙄
2021-05-16 13:54:43,wallstreetbets,"You get the retard of the year award for putting that much into options. Just stick with stock, at least your shares will be worth something at the end of 30 days."
2021-05-16 13:55:02,wallstreetbets,this is fake :(
2021-05-16 13:58:12,wallstreetbets,Wish I could afford that. Not really feeling you... Why are you even here?![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)
2021-05-16 13:58:50,wallstreetbets,You still have time on this. I don't know about July calls but It could definately over $215 on 2021 if bull market continues.
2021-05-16 13:59:29,wallstreetbets,"I gotta say it, FUCK DISNEY! A lot of people share that same view point. They bought Star Wars for 4 billion dollars just to run it into the ground. Then sentiment was changing by way of Mandalorian and Disney ran that into the ground, BECAUSE their leadership sucks ass! I hope you make your money back but I wouldn’t invest in Disney even to make money. I hate all get woke go broke companies, that would rather virtue signal than make money.. Good Luck."
2021-05-16 13:59:57,wallstreetbets,nice paper trades

2021-05-16 15:08:36,wallstreetbets,Gotta hedge that bet bro. Should have leveraged with some puts
2021-05-16 15:08:49,wallstreetbets,Yeah but your position doesn’t expire until 2022... unless you already sold like a dumbass then just hold.

I’m about as smooth brain as it gets, but to me it sounds a lot like they are OK with the idea of liquidating that retail side with how much loss they had from parks being closed.

2021-05-16 16:09:43,wallstreetbets,They said never bet against the mouse but looks like it’s just don’t make any bets whatsoever on Dis
2021-05-16 16:27:49,wallstreetbets,Yup could go either way and I'm not about to risk the remaining capital
2021-05-16 17:47:48,wallstreetbets,Could go either way but I think there are better plays atm

2021-05-16 12:37:56,wallstreetbets,"Dis+ growth is slower than projections but not hitting saturation, it's temporary delays. 3 factors that will jump start:

* Disney's [production](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/18/how-the-coronavirus-is-impacting-disney-studios/?_gl=1*pomd3u*_ga*MUIxR1V2NGNUNldRa3Vfck45R08wQ1hnZGFvd3ptMVhfOWNIc3NadV92NjZQbllVWWhXeDFLNGF2WklJcW15aQ..) has been closed leading to limited existing IP content
* Disney is sitting on new IPs so that they can still sell merchandise when stores and parks do reopen
* Hotstar+ rollout and ARPU has been [delayed](https://thetechportal.com/2021/05/14/disney-hotstar-sees-dip-in-arpu-due-to-ipls-suspension/) due to IPL cricket season being delayed in India"
2021-05-16 15:37:26,wallstreetbets,"I mean, this is not a bad thesis.  In fact, it happened-- Disney literally jumped from ~120 to ~170 when the vaccine appeared.

Did you hold too long after the recovery bump?  I'm still confused how you lost money here."
2021-05-16 11:48:58,wallstreetbets,"Im long disney as well, I believe in them and personally feel they will be the first trillion dollar entertainment company but it will just take time thats all"
2021-05-16 14:38:24,wallstreetbets,"Just out of interest, what factors made you so sure covid would be done by now in order for you to wager such a steep bet on a favourable outcome?"
2021-05-16 12:02:31,wallstreetbets,"Trust the mouse but don't be a retard. 

Dude, it is a 300 billion dollar company that was built literally a century ago. Stupid valuation doesn't apply to boomer companies. This is like saying because GM or F touched EV so they might get TSLA valuation. You can't expect Dis+ to take on the DVD giant Netflix who has been sharpening their trade for close to decades in mere months. FUCK DIDN'T YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED TO QUILBI!!

But then again this is what your wife would tell you. I am just here to say, ""there there it's going to be okay."""
2021-05-16 16:17:27,wallstreetbets,"Am a Floridian, Florida never really shut down, no lockdown measures and still plenty of tourism. Disney parks are open. Sorry about the loss"
2021-05-16 12:45:48,wallstreetbets,"My dude, any reasonable analysis of Disney’s financials would produce an unquestionable fact: while Disney is a healthy company, their stock price is inflated beyond all recognition.  Price to average free cash flow  is absolutely off the charts.  Disney’s stock price had nowhere to go but down."

2021-05-16 14:30:11,wallstreetbets,Dis will never be netflix's valuation when most of netflix's subscribers are outside of US and netflix is constantly making international dramas / films.
2021-05-16 12:48:45,wallstreetbets,"I used to think the same with my investing philosophy. However, it’ll serve you well understanding that an overvalued company like Netflix (growth stock) can’t be looked at as a comparable when looking at another growth stock like Disney. Netflix may be overvalued and Disney fair value but undervalued compared to overvalued Netflix. This rally has been nuts and although it may work in the short term, not a good way to invest long term. 

Speaking of which, will be interesting to see how good of an “investor” everyone will still be when equities cool down to something sustainable."
2021-05-16 14:01:36,wallstreetbets,"Assuming COVID would end only months after a vaccine rollout with prominent anti vaccine / anti mask conspiracies and most countries undersupplied is possibly the second most quintessential definition of WSB I have seen

And I realize the competition is fierce

Yes Disney is probably a good buy but calls inherently involve timing the market - even if you plan to eventually trade them

Also, Disney notoriety is incredibly high so you have to gamble that a majority of people participating in the market have not predicted the same growth

If you have this money to yolo hit me up in PMs and I’ll do suggestions just for opportunity to prove myself"
2021-05-16 14:52:12,wallstreetbets,Proof: You can bet against the mouse
2021-05-16 15:06:29,wallstreetbets,Disney+'s growth isn't as organic as you may think. I recently stopped working for Verizon but I can tell you the disney+/hulu/ESPN subscription package is bundled into the plans they push on people (esspecially those who needed more data or better unlimited for covid) which gave disney+ a huge subscription basis coming out of the gate. If they had to do it the way netflix did they wouldn't be half of what they are.
2021-05-16 15:22:12,wallstreetbets,Dude for $100k I could have told you there was zero chance COVID would be “over” by now.
2021-05-16 15:37:01,wallstreetbets,"Lol that wouldn’t happen in a year, if that was the thought process you have to wait like 5-8 years. You should have just bought stocks and waited.

Edit: the thing you overlooked about Netflix growth compared to Dis+ , is that when Netflix debuted, it was one of the only movie streaming sites of its kind. Dis+ launched at a time when the market is saturated and many options exist, the growth isn’t going to be as quick. 

I still think long term you are right, it will grow tremendously."
2021-05-16 15:47:08,wallstreetbets,"Numbers prob included all the free trials

And I’m sure many sigh up watch for a month and cancel with all of our streaming options we spend more time scrolling than watching"
2021-05-16 17:10:40,wallstreetbets,The calls were good till January right? They may not have been bad to hang on to but I get counting your losses at a certain point

2021-05-16 17:15:02,wallstreetbets,Yeah expiry was just off by a year
2021-05-16 18:58:08,wallstreetbets,DIS is already valued higher than NFLX...
2021-05-16 19:12:01,wallstreetbets,Now tell me how does this translate into a higher stock price.
2021-05-16 19:30:23,wallstreetbets,You may have been early but you’re not wrong.
2021-05-16 19:36:12,wallstreetbets,What’s the lesson? Buy the stock because it doesn’t expire and you don’t have to pick a strike.
2021-05-16 19:38:51,wallstreetbets,"Btw, I too learned this lesson the hard way. Cost me $10k tho not $1mm."
2021-05-16 14:13:28,wallstreetbets,idiot not even realizing how overvalued DIS was lol
2021-05-16 14:11:05,wallstreetbets,"Tried Dis+ for free from a provider and stopped using within a few days. Just doesn’t have all that much, pretty nostalgic but I can’t see how it could’ve overtaken the Flix"
2021-05-16 14:01:09,wallstreetbets,Idk I pay for Netflix and say fuck Disney. And I have a 1 year old. More room to fall.
2021-05-16 12:22:28,wallstreetbets,Have you ever used dis+? Never be at Netflix levels.  It sucks. Doesn't have crap on it.
2021-05-16 12:41:47,wallstreetbets,Disney is $100 billion more than Netflix
2021-05-16 13:12:26,wallstreetbets,You thought liberals would have ever let go of Covid? You think Gavin Newsom is the type of guy who would just hand back control to the people that quickly? You bet a million that? Man I wish I could have taken your bet.
2021-05-16 13:05:09,wallstreetbets,"If you still believe in the thesis, why don't you just reroll the calls, same strike, later expiration.  A $200 C, Jan 2023 is only a 10% premium over the current price."
2021-05-16 13:07:42,wallstreetbets,"Betting around DIS' all-time high in an already all-time high, propped-up market is one bold move.  I woulda wished you luck but you already sold them?


People will definitely be pouring money back into Disney this summer-- both the stock and the parks/products. They're already lifting mask requirements."

2021-05-16 16:46:32,wallstreetbets,I’m with you here bud. I had the same theory when quarantine hit and Disney+ was launching. It was about 100 or so and I have thought for a while I missed the jump. Thanks for your input; now I know I’m not the only one this retarded!
2021-05-16 17:03:00,wallstreetbets,"You are forgetting that close to 30% of its profits are from cable , cord cutting is slowly killing its cable business and Espn cable revenues per subscriber (+ ads) is more than espn plus so it cannot simply replace them. Plus cost for tv contracts for sports are skyrocketing while ratings are sagging (see nba). 

Fact that it’s over 20% above its Feb 20 highs makes me think it’s highly overvalued. We will see a correction once we reopen and earnings start disappointing"
2021-05-16 17:04:42,wallstreetbets,"Why would you think the vid would be over now? The cdc predicted back in January 2020 that it would easily last into August 2021, and realistically into December 2021.

2021-05-16 18:37:10,wallstreetbets,I think Covid is over so Dis+ slowed is what happened
2021-05-16 18:37:58,wallstreetbets,From someone who lives in florida last night was the first night that felt normal since the start. Our local town center had a packed lawn for some cover band and not a mask in sight. Hopefully this is a glimpse of what is to come. Also orlando is lifting its outdoor mask policy. When we went there a few months ago they had employees everywhere ensuring everyone outside was masked.

2021-05-16 19:49:21,wallstreetbets,Ah.  I should have let you know we canceled our subscription because nobody was watching anything on Disney+.  Pretty much just the mandalorian

You are retarded"
2021-05-16 16:38:38,wallstreetbets,"The problem with your thesis is that this stock didn’t take a hit due to COVID. The smart play would’ve be when it dipped to $100 during March of last year. 

$170 looks good during a bull market. Everything looks good during a bull market. 

You’re now hedging that it will go above $170 price point? It’s already bloated. In a bear market this stock maybe sees $70-$80

It’s definitely overinflated."

2021-05-16 12:44:32,wallstreetbets,"Nah it's real. Bro was up quite a bit on this position back in Feb along with SQ. Was up over 800k on DIS calls. He didn't sell.

Now he's here.

A lot of people are giving back their GME $$ to MMs basically. Me included. Think I'm down 160k from Jan/Feb highs. Oops.

(half is unrealized but still)"
2021-05-16 12:57:05,wallstreetbets,Loss is real. Check post history. Not a karma whore but I am starting an OnlyFans
2021-05-16 13:26:49,wallstreetbets,Please lose everything you own
2021-05-16 11:20:29,wallstreetbets,I don’t even know what shares are
2021-05-16 12:36:57,wallstreetbets,"You sold January dated calls that were 60% down that would most likely be itm long before that date?? Even the July ones likely would have recovered. You likely sold these at the literal bottom. 

The yolo wasn't regarded, you have good strikes and times, but selling them at the bottom was."
2021-05-16 09:59:31,wallstreetbets,In this case replace rope with rape

2021-05-16 13:53:30,wallstreetbets,You’ll get it back
2021-05-16 12:45:27,wallstreetbets,"Gtfoh, you did not make $20M “all because of wsb”."
2021-05-16 12:30:10,wallstreetbets,Nice bro.. you should make a post detailing how you made your millions with trading.. I'm sure you have a lot of knowledge
2021-05-16 11:07:25,wallstreetbets,Now they gotta pick themselves up by their bootstraps
2021-05-16 11:08:08,wallstreetbets,Glad to be of service
2021-05-16 11:07:46,wallstreetbets,Ain’t got that type of money
2021-05-16 17:03:03,wallstreetbets,I hate this aspect of Reddit the most - crawling through someone’s post history looking for a gotcha
2021-05-16 10:31:51,wallstreetbets,She fucking escaped poverty and then gave it all back???  That statistic on lotto winners going broke really is true god damn.
2021-05-16 15:42:45,wallstreetbets,"Her other post where she ""works a high income job,"" or the one where she works at Arby's, or the one where she's an NYC land speculator, or the one where she's still in highschool?

I'm trying to figure out which storyline is canon."
2021-05-16 11:43:34,wallstreetbets,"You have 300k, you have the money to just invest conservatively and consistently make good as fuck cash with average growth, dividends and covered calls. Fuck you could keep 50k for play money and use the rest to consistently build wealth. You could even be more aggressive and buy leaps ITM. Take a break and get a fucking grip."
2021-05-16 11:16:52,wallstreetbets,Follow your nose
2021-05-16 11:57:33,wallstreetbets,LOL
2021-05-16 12:13:10,wallstreetbets,"Turn on margin, buy 5000 shares of BABA (most discounted tech stock with the the highest upside potential) for about $1 million dollars, SELL weekly covered calls 2.5 to 5% out of the money, and collect weekly premium. You can collect between $15k to $35k per month on premium alone. Roll it over for more shares to compound gains, or use that cash for some fun money on your wacky far otm options. BABA is a top 10 hedge fund favorite for this, and top 10 hedge fund stocks return an average of 250% per 5 year range. Being rich doesn't mean it doesn't hurt to lose money, but OP YOU GOT THIS."
2021-05-16 13:09:36,wallstreetbets,I think it’d be true WSB fashion if you yolod it into whatever u/Nrdrage calls next
2021-05-16 17:47:48,wallstreetbets,GME 800 calls: allow me to introduce myself
2021-05-16 19:39:18,wallstreetbets,Oh dear.
2021-05-16 12:57:12,wallstreetbets,"I hate to say it, but yes, that was the wrong decision. A reasonable emotional reaction; but the worst time to act on emotion. You want to recover these losses quickly and that means riskier positions. You do this and it’s all gone, odds are very much against you. Don’t do this. You still have enough left to profit from solid, conservative strategies. Do this immediately and even if it takes a year or more, you will end up recovering all of this loss. If you yolo into positions for fast money, you’re toast. Beat the odds, don’t do this."

2021-05-16 11:44:55,wallstreetbets,"Yea but I make $400k a year so I'm just dramatic because i grew up poor af, some things never change ya know?"
2021-05-16 16:19:39,wallstreetbets,2 months will be july. Your expiration is in January.
2021-05-16 16:17:49,wallstreetbets,Was this a large loss for the portfolio or not too substantial?
2021-05-16 19:28:49,wallstreetbets,Yeah they’re down 50% so at this point I felt like I got nothing to lose 😅 “were” now it’s a lot more lmao
2021-05-16 11:35:58,wallstreetbets,"Losing a mil at age 30 means you've got plenty of time to make it back, and it's ok to take risks.

Losing a mil at age 60 means you'll probably never make it back, and were a jackass for taking such a risk.

So losing a mil at 42 means it sucks, but you can definitely recover from this."
2021-05-16 11:27:07,wallstreetbets,At least he did lose a million dollars.
2021-05-16 11:31:50,wallstreetbets,A place where the kids who rode the short bus get to play?

2021-05-16 14:14:33,wallstreetbets,This unironically.
2021-05-16 17:52:29,wallstreetbets,or next monday after sunday
2021-05-16 17:48:28,wallstreetbets,"Good, I’ve got October calls 🚀"
2021-05-16 15:17:07,wallstreetbets,The Monday after you sell. Doesn’t matter which one. That’s the rule.
2021-05-16 18:09:19,wallstreetbets,Yeah dude everyone was giving that shit away for free. But then again who pays for Netflix/Hulu/HBO? Not me but I somehow have em all
2021-05-16 19:48:30,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, forget about Disney channel, ABC, FOX, ESPN, FX, theme parks, Hulu, and all the ip that comes with that."
2021-05-16 13:32:26,wallstreetbets,"So you’re saying buy million dollar worth of otm calls? 

*Got it.*"
2021-05-16 12:48:41,wallstreetbets,"Biggest thing that'll happen to DIS in terms of a huge swing is if they ever lose that forever++ sweetheart protection in Congress for Mickey Mouse and other ancient IP.   


If that happens literally anyone can make and use the characters. Now individual products and later portrayals might still be protected but if that mouse ever gets out of the bag (or there's wind of it happening) the stock will plunge."
2021-05-16 16:13:12,wallstreetbets,Bought in around 180 in February on the thought that COVID was about over and Dis+ was crushing it.  Went up to 200 then trading down 0.5% every day for 3 months straight. Decided I was going to hold through ER to see what the Dis+ numbers looked like.  Numbers weren’t as strong as I would have liked and COVID has a long tail so I decided to take the L.  I kept shares.  Probably will get back into 23 LEAPS when I see the momentum go.
2021-05-16 12:27:52,wallstreetbets,youre gonna be waiting a long time 🤣🤣
2021-05-16 17:44:32,wallstreetbets,"If their leadership team gets their collective heads out of their collective arses, maybe. I don't expect that'll happen, though."
2021-05-16 12:49:06,wallstreetbets,And whats the timeline for your $550 PT for Disney 😂😂😂
2021-05-16 13:08:25,wallstreetbets,"Not going to happen. They have no solid ad revenue pipeline even after the Hulu deal (used to work at Hulu during the acquisition). Disney+ doesn’t have the long term content pipeline to support it, and user growth will eventually die down once people are back in the office. Plus they don’t have the back catalog of shows like Peakcock or HBOMax. Theme parks may do well, but it’s nullified by ESPN constantly hemorrhaging money due to bad sports licensing deals they’ve overpaid for. 

If Netflix couldn’t do it with relatively low overhead compared to Disney and billions in content deals over the next 10 years, and an already established international content network, and tons of awards for their stuff, I don’t think Disney is going to pull it off.  Entertainment is an industry of diminishing returns over time. It’s just not mathematically possible.

ETA: so many salty Disney fuckbois in this thread. No wonder this sub has gone to the cunts."
2021-05-16 14:45:47,wallstreetbets,In February when I got these it looked like COVID was coming to an end.  I assumed the whole world had vaccine when in reality it was just ‘Murica.  Then India started getting obliterated.  I decided to hold because I thought Dis+ numbers would be redeeming.  Turned out I was wrong.  So now it looks like we are at the tail end of COVID but who knows it could keep going on and affecting the stock. I still have shares because I still think the thesis is intact but it’s going to take some time to play out.
2021-05-16 12:41:16,wallstreetbets,NFLX subscriber growth is already slowing. And Disney is at half their subs at a period of time when they cannot expand on their IPs. It's a matter of time
2021-05-16 12:17:22,wallstreetbets,"You're an idiot for comparing Quibi to Disney. Like you said, Disney was built a century ago, they have the one of the largest, if not THE largest amount of IP in the industry which they can immediately put on their platform. With all the new competitors popping up, Netflix is losing many of the shows that made them popular in the first place, and so are having to rely on putting out Netflix originals to hope to keep their base satiated. Disney has incredibly deep pockets, and support from multiple generations of consumers based on nostalgia factors."
2021-05-16 13:09:59,wallstreetbets,"> YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED TO QUILBI!!

what the hell is a quilbi"
2021-05-16 12:25:09,wallstreetbets,"That you're saying Netflix should be valued more than Disney just proves how retarded you are
Whole different target group - Netflix and chill ya for how fucking long ? Enjoy those 10years in your 20s where you binge that shit every day after already spending 20years crying about Mufasa dying and wondering why no Prince picked you up. After forgetting condoms in your Netflix and chill times it's also back to watching Cinderella for another couple years if you even have the time for it. Oh and by the way by the time you're 80 you'll also be happy you'll have a movie character you can relate to with your stupid Alzheimer potato brain 🐟"
2021-05-16 13:52:40,wallstreetbets,I have f for the long term. TSLA shouldn't be valued as high as they are. As a company there actually piss poor. I can't think of another company that has not followed through on so many things and still had such a strong revenue.
2021-05-16 16:18:10,wallstreetbets,Still too many restrictions plus cruises need to come back as that’s a large part of their revenue
2021-05-16 16:01:05,wallstreetbets,Isn't it off the charts for every major stock?
2021-05-16 16:01:22,wallstreetbets,"I’m not holding these anymore.  It could continue to trade sideways for a while and there are probably better places for the money, like in the hands of my wife’s boyfriend.  Might get back into 23 LEAPS once I see some momentum."
2021-05-16 16:14:42,wallstreetbets,I have shares as well that I am holding long term.  I think dis is still due for a pop but probably closer to end of the year.  Might get 23 LEAPS after I think about it some more.
2021-05-16 15:52:13,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, got biffed by the initial numbers and now the hangover started to set in"
2021-05-16 19:33:36,wallstreetbets,I think so.  I’m keeping shares.  A lot of them.  I may get back into 23 LEAPS once I see positive momentum and/or COVID ends.
2021-05-16 16:47:15,wallstreetbets,Yeah wait until your 1 year old is 3 or 4.
2021-05-16 11:56:07,wallstreetbets,"So let me get this straight...

You got really lucky and went from making $17/hr to being a millionaire inside of a year, and instead of saying ""yeah...that's probably good enough"" and...I dunno...going to school, or traveling, or sticking it in some Boomer shit and taking $50k+/yr for free forever...you...YOLO'd it on DIS?

And I thought I was retarded...you truly do belong here! I hope your luck included another million or two."
2021-05-16 13:26:12,wallstreetbets,Shut the fuck up you lying bastard.
2021-05-16 11:48:39,wallstreetbets,So you have a gambling addiction is what you’re saying.
2021-05-16 13:06:09,wallstreetbets,Liar. Shame on you for pretending to be a front line worker.
2021-05-16 13:15:59,wallstreetbets,Are you really from New York and have a couple millions of dollars? How can I do that as well ?
2021-05-16 12:15:15,wallstreetbets,If you head across the street to the Wendy's I'll reserve a spot for you at the dumpster and take you under my wing
2021-05-16 14:48:07,wallstreetbets,Yeah no.
2021-05-16 14:57:05,wallstreetbets,"I’m calling bullshit on that one, chief"

2021-05-16 11:38:42,wallstreetbets,Is that a manger's pay?  I thought fast food only pay minimum wages and not even Seattle or NYC pay $17.

2021-05-16 11:54:05,wallstreetbets,Hope you get free roast beef hitters at least!
2021-05-16 12:01:41,wallstreetbets,"Holy crap man had you dropped that million in some dividend paying stock you’d make double your salary each year at Arby’s.

I know we celebrate losses here but damn that’s a life-changing amount you just yolod away."
2021-05-16 12:02:06,wallstreetbets,Thanks for taking this in stride. People for some reason love to eat at others who have money to burn
2021-05-16 12:06:30,wallstreetbets,"You fucking asshole.  You did it, you were done with poverty.  You set up an OF yet?"

2021-05-16 13:46:17,wallstreetbets,You work at arby and you thought it was a good idea to gamble a million dollars😐
2021-05-16 19:33:31,wallstreetbets,I understand why you work at Arby's now. Anyone with a brain doesn't pull dumb shit like this.
2021-05-16 16:37:23,wallstreetbets,I came.
2021-05-16 16:17:20,wallstreetbets,I’m a dumbass so I’m not surprised it’s not possible. Too bad.
2021-05-16 12:58:48,wallstreetbets,MMs always win it looks like
2021-05-16 13:42:24,wallstreetbets,"Yeah idk why you'd sell a leaps with so much time left, but then again seeing a ton of red can really test people."
2021-05-16 12:52:50,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the clarification

2021-05-16 12:51:40,wallstreetbets,"Yea, that’s complete bull. He said he worked at Arby’s in another comment and got caught lmao why this guy be lying, seems so sketch"
2021-05-16 14:08:58,wallstreetbets,8 figures from ev stock and Ape stonk
2021-05-16 13:10:13,wallstreetbets,"Probably the same behaviour but it was successful lol. YOLO'd stupid amounts into options while the market was at an all-time low, or maybe on GME or another meme stock before the premiums were driven up"

2021-05-16 18:05:06,wallstreetbets,It's not our fault OP is telling contradictory stories
2021-05-16 12:23:36,wallstreetbets,"Why does everyone believe OP works at Arby’s lol. Look at post history, he’s said he owns multiple properties in NYC and makes high income. This was definitely money he made off wsb last year and didn’t care too much about."
2021-05-16 11:23:28,wallstreetbets,You guys are close.  Started an options account last year and traded based almost solely on the DD here.  The account made 8 figures.  Looks like I’m giving some of that back.
2021-05-16 10:49:40,wallstreetbets,Apes betrayed gme apes deserved loss 🤡
2021-05-16 11:49:10,wallstreetbets,Yeah listen to this dude - you work at Arby’s but have 300k available for investing. Use that money to change your life by investing conservatively - don’t waste it all & live with regret
2021-05-16 11:46:09,wallstreetbets,That’s worked very well in the past
2021-05-16 14:19:42,wallstreetbets,"Would you mind sharing some of the conservative strategies? You seem grounded so you don’t belong here or are a troll.

2021-05-16 16:29:15,wallstreetbets,There are July and January.
2021-05-16 16:18:30,wallstreetbets,5-10%
2021-05-16 19:34:40,wallstreetbets,Problem for me is 50% down is still 300k which is good money
2021-05-16 14:06:11,wallstreetbets,Really depends on how many mills you have to begin with
2021-05-16 14:27:04,wallstreetbets,"I’d bet that there are equally as many professional traders here as there are GME yolo’ers. Jim Cramer himself reads and reacts to WSB. Not everything is as it seems, my friend. Some of us actually win more than we lose."
2021-05-16 13:35:22,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but if you leave, it just might be"
2021-05-16 12:25:00,wallstreetbets,That implies that at some point tendies will return.

2021-05-16 16:23:52,wallstreetbets,Literally can't go tits up!
2021-05-16 15:00:57,wallstreetbets,He could of just bought Disney and held it forever lol
2021-05-16 13:22:08,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, aside from the iconic image, Mickey Mouse isn’t exactly their big money maker.  No ones going to the movies or parks to specifically see Mickey Mouse."

2021-05-16 14:13:56,wallstreetbets,"All this talk about Dis+ subs and nobody mentioning the Mandalorian. That was easily it's main driver in recent past. They have to keep up with that or else people won't give a shit. Their other content on there, a lot of it is mostly niche to Disney obsessives, which we can all agree are a weird and small group of people"
2021-05-16 14:08:12,wallstreetbets,"There is already a million companies and small businesses ripping off Mickey, Goofy, Donald, etc. Go to any community surrounding one of their parks and you will see millions of dollars in unlicensed merchandise in every souvenirs store, gas station, Food establishments.....they all rip off Disney and they are still huge. They make wayyyy more dough off the new features like frozen. Check etsy as well and tell me the thousands of mickey and Minnie shirts on there are officially licensed."
2021-05-16 13:15:03,wallstreetbets,I disagree. Theres a reason Disney isn't lobbying to extend the copyright protection laws anymore. The amount they make off the mouse is dwindling quickly. Its such a small part of their brand these days its not worth fighting over anymore imo
2021-05-16 14:27:27,wallstreetbets,"It's a lot more complicated than that.

The copyright protection on the derivative works continues from the time such works were written. So Steamboat Willie can enter the public domain, but Goofy, Donald Duck, Minnie Mouse and others don't spring into public use at the same time. Likewise the Fantasia story and other famous stories will still be protected. And frankly Mickey and Friends are a modest part of Disney's IP portfolio (compare, Star Wars, Marvel, all Disney produced Pixar properties, all Disney-Princesses).

Disney also maintains trademarks on all these characters, so while you could tell a Mickey Mouse story in 2023, you couldn't use the three-circle Disney mouse head to market it. On top of that, ""famous"" marks, like Mickey, have brand-tarnishment protection, so no legal production of Rule 34 Mickey Mouse art can easily come into being (there are some untested legal defenses here, but litigation would be very expensive)."
2021-05-16 15:13:58,wallstreetbets,"Don’t worry, they will still find ways to sue Instagram bootleggers that make a few thousand bucks a year."

2021-05-16 14:09:42,wallstreetbets,"I think if Disney lost that protection it might be an amazing opportunity to buy after the panic

It depends on WHERE that protection is timed

Mickey going to the public domain might arguably be a net benefit and free advertising.  Unless he got Peped.  Some other properties no."
2021-05-16 14:57:54,wallstreetbets,Isn’t that for just the Steamboat Willie version of Mickey though?  I thought I read the current iteration still has decades of protection.

Almost every entertainment company is starting their own service. Netflix could be left with little content outside their own library and small independent studios. It’s why they are spending so much on original content. They see that writing on the wall and are adjusting to their credit. Disney could operate D+ at a loss to kill off competitors. Netflix can’t. We are just now entering the streaming wars and Netflix isn’t in the strongest position, but not the weakest either."

2021-05-16 17:40:57,wallstreetbets,"Given the Mando is probably one of the only new things Dis has dropped lately that was genuinely good.

I wouldn't touch that company with a 10ft pole. They might be getting kudos from various little niche groups for being 'diverse' and 'inclusive' and all that -- but fundamentally, most of their new projects are failing because they still haven't figured out that character growth is necessary for a good story. and if your boilerplate approach to diverse and female characters is that they aren't allowed to fail... those characters have no growth potential.

this single point is exactly what ruined star wars, captain marvell, the mulan remake......  and I see no clear signs that this tone-deaf titanic of a company will stop being offended long enough to realize what they're doing wrong.

as such, i have low expectations. the only way they maintain worth is by already owning a bunch of popular content they bought. like the MCU. if you think they're going to turn around and keep making the kind of content that made the MCU a success in the first place, you're more optimistic than I am.

HBO, Netflix and even Prime have far better original content pouring in, and they're making it faster than Disney. I see a lot of D+ cancellations in the future. Mando is probably the only reason a lot of subscribers are still hanging on, and if the company execs get their way and neuter the mando creative team, it'll tip over faster than Doctor Who.

Thems my reasons. Nope. 10ft pole insufficient."

And the next season will be episodic and likely lock people in for a good \~3 months who want to see it.   


I have a subscription but cancel it each month then renew when I want to watch again, saves some money if I don't use it for a week or whatnot.   


The thing Disney+ provides and arguably their market is the obsessives (but it is flat per month) and parents with kids. There's no way they'll reach Netflix level coverage with their vault offerings + Mando alone so they're fairly capped on subscribers.   


Now that's really not a huge issue because they have a ton of different income streams: release movies, merch, the parks and now the digital side (but they were making money licensing before so.. not sure if that's a net gain but likely smart for the future)."

And while they have marvel that’s a pretty niche subset of the viewing audience. Just because endgame and infinity war blew it out of the water box office, that doesn’t always translate into continued streaming success. And since churn will continue to grow as more people end up back in the office, people cut down on their steaming services."

Seriously look at the boomer giants. INTC isn't that fabulous of a company. What about GE? Or, IBM? Or, the car companies? Or dare I say NOK? Now, we have AMD, the big 3 cloud platforms, TSLA, AAPL and I am not sure what we have for GE.

I am not saying DIS is a bad company. Not at all. But DIS is a late bloomer. You can say, DIS took NFLX as a proof of concept for the streaming business but they acted too little too late.

My 2 cents is that when valuing DIS, one should go through each division of their business have a ""synergy multiplier"" and compare their business to other companies like NFLX, SIX etc."
2021-05-16 12:37:21,wallstreetbets,Actually... Disney now has Stark.
2021-05-16 14:03:11,wallstreetbets,But I know what Disney is

2021-05-16 12:28:28,wallstreetbets,90pct of accounts that make big personal posts like this are either heavily embellishing or straight-up LARPing. just something to keep in mind when coming across people like NrdRage or whatever the fuck their name is and feeling like you're missing out.

2021-05-16 19:24:41,wallstreetbets,42.  Have a retirement account in boring stuff that I have had for about 10 years.  Started an options account last year. Traded certain Chinese EV stocks and Ape Stonk.  Turned 70k into 8 figures. Looks like I’m giving some of that back.
2021-05-16 10:14:09,wallstreetbets,Answer me a single question: why do you always ban people for no reason?

2021-05-16 19:29:20,wallstreetbets,And don't forget Futurama! I was prolly depressed for a couple months when it was taken of air lol. Just recently binge watched the whole series
2021-05-16 15:46:19,wallstreetbets,There is a season of Boba Fet coming and another season of Mando coming. There is something to be said for being able to binge all 9 main arc movies as well as Rogue One and the Han solo movie without having to worry about discs. Can also binge the entire MCU.
2021-05-16 19:42:33,wallstreetbets,They are continuing story lines and they will all interconnect to each other... Having some hate for star wars because you don't agree with it's writers is completely ignorant
2021-05-16 19:21:34,wallstreetbets,"Lol. Yeah Netflix is going to make billions doing cheap mickey knockoff cartoons...once you see that sell all your Netflix stock because that ship is sinking. And as for cheap knockoffs on Amazon, already happening...Disney dont give two shits about those little guys. If they wanted, they could tie those little distribution chains up in any court globally for decades until they bleed out all their cash. Look, bottom line is regardless of any bs mickey mouse cartoons nobody is going to spend $150 a day at ""Netflix World"" or stay at Netflix resorts, shit have you ever seen Netflix merchandise?
 And as for their original content, name one movie that has been even close to the success of Disney's worst.....nobody going to pay Netflix to license one of their films as of now and if they ever get even close to Disney's brand recognition in that reagrds, you and I will be sleeping with the worms. Netflix may be the streaming giant now but they haven't seen competition from legacy money yet and now that it is here, it wont be a pretty battle for the top."
2021-05-16 14:44:49,wallstreetbets,Completely agreed. The point that is being lost is also that they cannot charge royalties for those works anymore when it goes public domain.
2021-05-16 18:18:17,wallstreetbets,Yeah that person must not have kids or even be around them. All of my nieces and nephews love that show
2021-05-16 14:36:53,wallstreetbets,"Imo, it'd be a win for DIS because it would give them access to a ton of other material that is currently held under those same copyright protections. They have the production capacity and merchandise distribution network to make the best use of all of that being opened up to anyone. Also, no one under ~50yo gives a shit about their mouse logo. Lol.     
      
Edit: downvotes lack perspective. Without that copyright extension, DIS would have Winnie the Pooh, Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Calvin and Hobbes, Curious George, Mr. Rogers,...thousands upon thousands of IPs. They lose a mouse that everyone already associates with their brand. Oh, no 😱🙄 [Also, the original trademarks on Mickey and all of those expire soon anyway.](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/01/a-whole-years-worth-of-works-just-fell-into-the-public-domain/) Disney isn't doing anything about it for good reason. If they cared, they sure as shit would be spoon feeding legislation to politicians.     
      
Also, lmfao @ u/StockDoc123. He must be from the late GME wave. I'm surprised he didn't win the paper trading competition."
2021-05-16 18:29:29,wallstreetbets,That is very true and is most definitely the avenue they will pursue
2021-05-16 15:28:57,wallstreetbets,My toddler and every other toddlers obsession with Mickey Mouse club house disagrees with you.
2021-05-16 13:17:47,wallstreetbets,"I know they don’t last forever that’s why they re-release movies and do director cut’s, additional features, etc. That is how Disney has kept their IP so long and I don’t think it’s all government lobbying. Look at how many remakes of Cinderella, Mickey Mouse tv shows, attractions, and movies there are. They add something slightly new to refresh their copyright I believe.

Edit:
Learned to read and saw that they are heavy lobbyists also."
2021-05-16 14:14:23,wallstreetbets,Huh? I just said it was gonna hit $550 in 3 years... is that not bullish enough for you?
2021-05-16 17:36:31,wallstreetbets,Content that has banked 200 billion at the box office has a “niche” audience? What are you smoking?
2021-05-16 16:37:47,wallstreetbets,And Netflix has a lot of original property?

2021-05-16 12:42:17,wallstreetbets,We really need to start requiring proof that these aren't paper trading accounts.

2021-05-16 15:34:01,wallstreetbets,"Sometimes the lessons you’ve already learned are extremely expensive, so be happy that you’re already way ahead on this. With 2k, as a starting point consider a stable, preferably undervalued company that has room to run. Ford (F) and/or GM comes to mind. Ford stock trades at just about 12.00 and they have a good future with just starting to get into EV. The semiconductor shortage will work itself out in due course, so that’s a non-issue longer-term. Consider getting ATM LEAP calls if you have options approval and then sell against yourself above your cost-basis. You’ll quickly build up equity, especially if the stock has a good run."
2021-05-16 18:05:57,wallstreetbets,Probably because could've sounds a lot more like could of than could have

2021-05-16 16:12:09,wallstreetbets,"Well yeah not just discs but also mostly to 4K which otherwise costs an arm and a leg at the stores every time they keep trying to sell you the higher res and newer discs. You get 4K included with disney, on Netflix it’s extra i actually downgraded to regular HD cause a lot of the content isn’t offered in 4K so why was i paying for it, i could upgrade if i knew a movie or show was offered in it but it’s whatever honestly.

And a lot of the time when you buy movies or rent say Redbox or so you just wind up annoyed when you see it was on a service and you paid for nothing. Like i still have guardians of the galaxy 2 sealed cause i liked it enough to buy it then pissed when Netflix got it so fast anyway i guess.

Also a lot of us probably don’t rewatch a lot as there’s so much new stuff we haven’t seen yet."
2021-05-16 19:31:10,wallstreetbets,"Full disclosure....I hate Disney but you can't deny these MFs got unreal money and clout for days. Cruises, timeshares, resorts, theme parks, merchandise, one of the largest production and broadcast portfolios, oh and they added streaming service to that. Ridiculous company."
2021-05-16 13:25:44,wallstreetbets,"Whether an IP is still in use or not has no bearing whatsoever on when it enters public domain. Its only time, and every time Mickey's time is almost up, the feds decide that they should add another 20 or 30 years to the length of copywrites."
2021-05-16 13:59:19,wallstreetbets,"It should be a creative copyright that lasts forever. No one likes thots that need to steal ideas and designs to make money. Formula 1 cars believe their designs should remain uniquely theirs, so do artists, so does anyone who creates things. China does this, and it does displace some market capital because plenty of people don’t check or know where their products are made."
2021-05-16 14:19:14,wallstreetbets,"Was responding to the other guys, I agree with $550 in 3 years ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|slightly_smiling), have to still expect pull backs along the way though."

2021-05-16 17:13:48,wallstreetbets,They do. They have to since a lot of major networks had their content licensing expire with no renewals foe Netflix. So you won’t find much from any of the broadcast networks on there anymore.
2021-05-16 18:18:47,wallstreetbets,So are you saying that’s not what happened?

His personality seems to clash with some, usually the ones who played his trades wrong or lost money on something he called them an idiot for buying. All you have to do is pay attention...it’s easy to see he knows what he’s talking about, and he’s not the only one. There are a handful of cats on here that spit truth bullets, but they usually get downvoted once they begin to get more attention than the inexperienced goobers trying to post their braindead, bullshit DD for internet points. 

Word of advice, ignore 99% of the folks on here. Try and filter out the 1% that know wtf they’re talking about and pay attention. Everyone else is simply regurgitating whatever BS they heard/read someone else say."

2021-05-16 17:42:39,wallstreetbets,Ultra HD Bluray cannot be compared to 4k streaming though. It's crazy good. Bladerunner 2049 is heroin for my optical nerve.
2021-05-16 19:59:24,wallstreetbets,"Oh Disney is huge real-estate and very diversified but I look at all of that as theirs to mess-up. They're not a disruptor or a innovator, they're the Empire and they're going to have to fight tooth and nail to keep that position, or they'll have to just keep acquiring anyone who is ala Google.   


They bought Star Wars. Everyone expects a top 2 blockbuster every 1.5-2 years at least as a result of that. Long term they're great and a solid hold but this is a casino."
2021-05-16 13:28:27,wallstreetbets,I wasn’t trying to argue that it’s still in use but I THOUGHT that when they release new shows/movies with Mickey or whoever in it that it would restart their copyright from then. Thinking I’m wrong though
2021-05-16 14:00:10,wallstreetbets,So is that applicable to  Disney?
2021-05-16 15:09:10,wallstreetbets,Fuck that. All creative works naturally belong to the public domain - copyright exists as a *temporary* check on that to ensure creators can get a limited payday out of it.

2021-05-16 19:13:17,wallstreetbets,She wasn’t worth the distraction and consternation her ridiculous and sometimes terrible views provided. I wouldn’t keep her around if I employed her in a public facing role.
2021-05-16 16:41:38,wallstreetbets,I do this but not to this level. Maybe say I have 5 kids when I really have 4. Say I’ve lived in 8 different states when it’s really 6. That kinda thing.

2021-05-16 13:57:01,wallstreetbets,To be fair he said calls 6 months out and specifically said not to buy short term calls. If people lost on the June calls they did it despite not because of him

2021-05-16 19:03:01,wallstreetbets,That’s fair i think streaming is just easier. And guess that’s depends on your internet and how well your eyes notice... paying for streaming beats paying $30 for a million copies of a movie I’ll watch once or twice. And we gotta be less phone distracted to pay attention to our movies. Like by myself I’ll prob just watch once unless a family or friend hasn’t seen it.
2021-05-16 16:41:58,wallstreetbets,"Yeah derivative works don’t currently affect the length of a copyright, but some have speculated that Disney is posturing to lobby so they do in the future hence all their recent remakes."

2021-05-16 18:28:50,wallstreetbets,"They have a niche for tv viewing audiences, which is what I’m talking about. Comic book shows, as a genre, have a niche audience. Movies are an entirely different audience model altogether. 

Further while the shows may have high viewership from their audiences, there is no guarantee these shows produce greater subscriber signups, and in fact subscriber growth has underperformed in their last quarterly earnings, and international subscriber valuation isn’t at parity. The revenue generated between a US subscriber and one in say India will be drastically different. 

You can misconstrue what I said all I want, but the fact is their longterm subscriber growth and viewership is going to continue to contract. They have too many liabilities on the books to make anything they do continually profitable. I’ve worked in this industry between film finance and OTT advertising for over a decade now, one of those stints at Hulu for almost 4 years. It’s a model that will show diminishing returns over time and isn’t sustainable in a fragmented media marketplace."

It has to compete with its own shows in some cases. I’m wondering how long those will exclusively be on other streaming networks and what the deals look like. If Viacom repatriates that content and makes those shows exclusive it will bolster their edge further.

Viacom is also a logical takeover target for a lot of companies (Netflix buying them makes sense to me)."

2021-05-16 12:22:14,wallstreetbets,"Its tricky with legacy content on streaming - my understanding is that most of the traditional tv industry is built around keeping the production side at arms length from the distribution side, with profit participants in between.

In order to repatriate Friends, HBO Max had to outbid Netflix for its own content, with the stars continuing to get paid out.

When Disney bought Fox Family, they mistakenly thought they could reair ABC content gir cheap, but those kinds of deals weren't in place. Source: Disneywar

ABC ended up getting sued for Who Wants to be a Millionaire reruns and for generally underpaying for the hit show through self dealing. They had to pay out millions of dollars is my understanding. 

Similarly, AMC is currently being sued by several of the producers of The Walking Dead in at least two lawsuits, although the preliminary judgements seem to be going in their favour on that front.

Most streaming shows are being produced on the basis of paying out the backend up front, aka the Netflix model, which has also been the norm for Canadian television for quite some time if not forever.  Hence, CTV/Bell owns the backend on Corner Gas.

In the case of Viacom, my understanding is that the Redstone family through National Amusements owns the majority of voting rights for Viacom, so any takeover would depend on what Shari Redstone wants to do.

We'll see what happens."
2021-05-16 18:53:58,wallstreetbets,I feel like not enough people acknowledge the rights to Uefa champions league understandably because soccer isn’t high on America’s priority list. That alone forces a large audience to subscribe with no care about the other content on the platform.

2021-05-16 12:20:58,wallstreetbets,Uhh exactly? So their streaming service needs to compete with their other shows on streaming networks. Yellowstone being a great example. They can’t move that to their streaming network so they have to make a prequel to it.

2021-05-16 11:57:53,wallstreetbets,"Firstly I wish you luck. I dont want to sound pessimistic but the largest owners of single family homes are hedge/investment funds. They are keeping retailer buyers out of the market and driving rents upwards. They usually buy 100s of houses from a builder in one fell swoop and there are no mortgages written for said properties.  Given where inflation is going,  no doubt property is the place to be. I myself received a letter recently from an investment company wanting to give me a lump sum with no payments for 17% of my property. Their fees were 8k and I'll be their free caretaker,  dont think so. 
  What im getting at is your investment in a residential mortgage related business,  in my opinion is a risky investment giving the trajectory of inflation/ interest rates which might climb rapidly within the next year. Commodities are surging,  precious metals are starting to climb, if this inflation gets out of control we could be in a recession within 2-3 yrs. 
  I've been on the wrong side of a trade many times and my biggest mistake was not taking small losses. Be nimble and dont let small losses grow, good luck"

2021-05-16 01:57:04,wallstreetbets,"Catalyst is that a $300m buyback was announced last week at Earnings. The stock has been rising since... and so has the short borrow fee rate.

It’s true that the company has been posted about on WSB before, but that’s part of why we’re getting a squeeze now. 

WSB posted about the stock, and it was relentlessly shorted as a result. This created an opportunity to squeeze the shorts. 

Yes, it’s the same play. Shorts doubled down, but now it’s way more expensive to short and there are no shares left. Don’t believe me though. Look at the shorting numbers yourself. 

It was beaten down way too far. The company is a buy from every article with PTs all above the current share price. Safe investment with a dividend and the CEO announced a buyback last week just to fuck with shorts. Which brings us to Monday."

2021-05-16 06:57:26,wallstreetbets,"Buy desirable models at bottom of depreciation curve, drive them for a little bit then sell for near, at, or above what you paid"
2021-05-16 18:38:19,wallstreetbets,"To summarize car hacking: 
Buy a desirable car (Mercedes, Porsche, even lambo or Ferrari, etc) at a low price. Drive it, keep it nice, keep miles low. Sell it within a year or two as optimal. Divide your total cost of ownership by the number of months you drove it and there’s what it cost you. Sometimes, not always, that number is a profit.

The point of a car hack isn’t to be an investment. It’s a way to drive a nice car either for free or for a very steep discount. The value of my car is actually up since I bought it, so if I sold it today and paid off the note, I will have essentially been paid (not much but still) to drive a corvette. Even if I lost 5000 on the car, that loss over 2 years means I will have only paid 208 bucks a month to drive a corvette. I know guys with a 400 dollar note on their Kia shitboxes. 

Again, car hacking was never conceived to be an investment. It is a way to drive a desirable, high-quality car either for free or for much less than you would pay for a car that depreciates badly."

2021-05-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UWMC is a powderkeg: low float, high short, huge buyback, unhedged options (Consolidated DD) I'm sure you've all seen some of this in various threads over the last few days so here is what I see as the complete short term case for UWMC in one place. Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor this is not advice don't listen to me etc.

Before the content let me say I'm not going to talk about the [fundamentals of this company](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/comments/n0414o/uwmc_a_fundamental_analysis_of_why_this_stock_is/) today (they're great), [the value even with no short-term price movement](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nd9hyr/uwm_holdings_looks_like_a_value_bargain_with_low/), [a super good dividend](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/ndc6pu/united_wholesale_mortgage_uwmc_is_the_most/), [the wild housing market](https://the1a.org/segments/housing-pandemic-market/), [the great strategic decisions the company has made](https://twitter.com/SleipnirPerkins/status/1378305915800186884), or anything other than strictly the stock. I like the company, but I love the stock.

&#x200B;

* **Low float, low volume**

UWM has 1.6 billion total shares, but 1.5 billion of them are owned by the CEO and not traded. The Class A shares outstanding are 103million, with \~13million owned by insiders. That's a 90 million public float, with another 25.5million in institutional ownership. Institutions can sell, of course, but a lot of this ownership is large conservative firms that aren't day trading this stock. (Pension funds, Vanguard, etc.). I would estimate the actual ""active"" float at less than 70 million.

Average daily volume is very low - volume Friday was 4 million, and there have been recent days with volume south of 2 million. The last time volume was more than 20 million was the first week of March, and look what happened to the stock. (Spoiler: it ran up to 12.50) If this stock gets real sustained volume, it can and will fly.

&#x200B;

* **Short interest, high short volume**

In the post-GME world we just aren't going to see short interests over 100% anymore - the highest on the market right now is 40-50% in Pubmatic and Root. But the shorts aren't gone, they're just more sneaky. The official Short interest over the last two months has been in the moderate zone, a bit below 20% of the active float. 

Short interest through May 15 won't be available until the 25th, but short volume has spiked since RKT's disappointing earnings took the stock down to ATLs. In fact over 50% of the volume on 6 of the last 7 trading days was short sales. ([Source](http://shortvolumes.com/?t=uwmc)) The shorts are here and they are relentless.

&#x200B;

* **Short Fee Spike, low short shares available, failure to settle**

Last Monday, there were up to 400,000 short shares available with about 3% interest. **Right now the short fees are around (or over) 100% with almost zero shares available to short.** ([Source](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/uwmc)) It's [over 300%](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_330645419.jpg) on Ortex. This is the same pattern that was seen in AMC last week, RKT in March, and other stocks that have had rapid runs.

Regarding naked shorting and FTS - It's happening, and it's significant. UWMC has been on the threshold securities list for 12 straight trading days. I'll [let the recent post on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ncczh8/uwmc_on_nyse_threshold_securities_list_regulation/) speak for itself and not explain this again except to say the official FTS data is only available with a 1-month lag so recent hard numbers aren't available.

&#x200B;

* **Huge Buyback**

Monday during earnings, UWM announced they will be buying back **$300 million** **in stock** over the next 2 years, starting this week. At the Friday closing price of 7.51, that's about 42.5 million shares, or **half of the active float** of the stock. Disclaimers: 1) they can only use about half the money (21 million shares) before the public shares become too low to be considered in the Russell 1000, which the CEO has said he wants next month. 2) They have 2 years to spend the money. But, they have every incentive to strike quickly due to the cheap stock price (and the CEO has said as much). 3) There are legal limits on daily buybacks equal to 25% of the average daily volume of the stock - 7M right now, so a limit of 1.75M shares per day. That's still a huge, huge potential amount though.

What does this mean, in effect? Besides the obvious buy pressure and lowering of outstanding shares, **incredible uncertainty and risk for anyone now shorting the stock.** It's tough to go heavily short when a million-share buy order could be coming in at any time. 

There's no way to know when buybacks are happening, but  there was a suspiciously big buy on Wednesday afternoon at about 1:45pm. Based on this and [public statements from the CEO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nclll1/uwmc_the_most_important_statement_for_all_shares/), It's safe to say that the buybacks are actually happening now and not theoretical.

&#x200B;

* **Options - Would you look at that**

This is where it get juicy. The options interest on this stock is massive, especially on next week's 5/21 expiry. **Between the $7.5 and $15 strikes, there are 205,500 open call contracts expiring next Friday. That's 20.5 million shares if they are all exercised. Most importantly,** the average delta of these options is currently about 0.1 **-** meaning the big Market Makers are only 10% covered on the shares**.** The 9, 10, and 12.50 strikes each by themselves all have open interest near to or greater than the entire daily volume of the stock on most days! 

As for puts, above 7.5, there are almost no (<5000) open puts expiring.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion -** What needs to happen

First, this needs to sustain above $7.5. The stock spent most of the day last Friday banging against a 300k share Ask wall at $7.5, and finally broke it at close (and climbed AH!). This was huge and encouraging, but I am 100% sure the shorts and option MMs will be back to try to pin it at 7.5 all week long. (Tangent: go look at what happened on April 16, the last options expiry date. it closed at 7.49 on the dot, wiping out everyone's options on both sides.)

Second this needs to get to, and through, $9. Once the price approaches and breaks $9, Delta is going to force the MMs to buy shares to cover their contracts. And once the price momentum breaks to the rapid upside through the $9, $10, $11, and $12.5 strikes, there are 12 million short shares that will need covering. 

It's not quite a pure gamma squeeze, and it's not a pure short squeeze, but there's elements of both here and it's all converging this week.

**TL;DR:** This stock has a low active float, a whole bunch of shorts, and a huge amount of unhedged calls expiring on Friday. All in the midst of a gigantic share buyback.  The conditions are perfect for a huge run."

2021-05-16 15:35:30,wallstreetbets,"The real good thing of this is that It is already a cheap stock in terms of valuation with the price of under 8$. Even if the short squeeze memeplay fails, it means that there is still no big loss to you. you still have THICC 5.5% dividend stock!I rode on GME play when it hit 14$(I sold it at 150$). Even with that price I was pretty unsure at that time because It had the worst scenario-bankruptcy- at that point.  But this? I bought 12000 share of this BEFORE this thread was written with no worry at all. It is a pretty safe play."
2021-05-15 20:57:12,wallstreetbets,"I don’t see how shorts get out of this one with the buyback. If we get to $9, the dominoes all go. Gotta buy shares to push the price though."

2021-05-16 09:52:12,wallstreetbets,"I work for a Mortgage Brokerage that uses UWMC and they are by far the best wholesale lender in our stable of lenders right now. They get it: Obsessed with fast processing times and almost exclusively work with Brokers. I’m bullish long. The only short term question I have is the impact their war with Rocket/Quicken Mortgage (RKT)will have. About two months ago UWMC sent a letter to all brokers that if they wanted to continue to use them they could not also use their competitor RKT because of shady practices of stealing business from their brokers for their retail (direct to consumer)business. All Brokers had to sign an exclusivity agreement. We went with UWMC but some Brokers took exception to the perceived interference in their lending processes. RKT didn’t take kindly to the declaration of war. Not sure what it is yet, but their will be a counter attack especially as loan volume drops with fewer and fewer re-if’s to fatten profits.

TL:DR - UWMC picked a fight with a gorilla in RKT and when revenue slows you’ll see a counter punch."
2021-05-16 13:11:23,wallstreetbets,Excellent DD...UWMC to the Moon !

2021-05-16 11:03:49,wallstreetbets,200 shares at 10.28 but been holding and feel the force is with me so bought calls last week
2021-05-15 21:52:09,wallstreetbets,"I've never been more excited about my portfolio (except for when I paperhanded GME @ 400% gain) considering nearly half is in UWMC. My ape ass bought in months ago and have been able to average down to 8.61 @1300.. LET'S GO BABY 🙌💎🚀🚀🚀  🐵🐵🐵🐵🐵🐵🐵🐵

Yes, I'm a broke bitch.

Love you, my fellow retard apes 😍"
2021-05-15 21:19:06,wallstreetbets,Excellent summary! This week will be HUGE
2021-05-16 10:58:14,wallstreetbets,"I have gone almost all in on options for UWMC, and have held through the downturn (I am retard) but am convinced I have diamond balls in my pocket. This thing ready to fly. Let us pray that we soar past 15 by Friday, or my 5/21's will hurt like a bitch."
2021-05-16 15:29:10,wallstreetbets,"It's not so much that anyone is ""trying"" to pin it at $7.50.  Is just a natural, normal, expected result of continuous delta hedging and high OI at a strike close to the current price, with other strikes being far away.

FWIW if you look through the UWMC sub you will see that last month I called that $7.50 close.

This time there is significant OI at the strikes above 7.50 but the strikes are so far apart that it will be hard to get there.  If the price is not above $8 by Thursday close you can pretty much call the 7.50 close on Friday,

I'm long over 32k shares but I'm patient.  If it happens this week great; if not, it's still undervalued and I'm happy to hold for months or years is necessary.  I view it as an easy double from current prices, even with no squeezes."
2021-05-15 20:45:49,wallstreetbets,"I agree. Also, I tried to get in on friday, for about 147 shares. Took my broker like, 10 minutes to find the shares and this was on a market order. This only happened before when I bought LSE ETF's that have volume of like 5 per day.

People need to not get hyped, it's not running to 40$ per share, but anything north of 12 is a real possiblity."

How exactly can you relate delta to a % of what the MM's have covered/hedged? Isn't this relationship you're showing assuming there's no one else buying the stock apart from the MM's?"

Its predicted to be 0.04 a share and even if they beat it by like .10 that is still a lot less compared to the first quarter of 0.41 a share.

2021-05-16 11:16:19,wallstreetbets,9 is going to be a tough barrier to hit though. Most of the shares shorted were likely shorted above 8.30. Millions are above that line. Although I'm confident that hundreds of thousands were shorted at or below 7 and have not covered. They are most definitely under water.

Great post, extremely detailed and accurate and you mentioned several things that I have researched personally ( buybacks and the timing  mainly )and several more I didn’t even consider looking into... the buybacks are happening at strategic price points, they’re full aware that it’s a balancing act of being able and getting into the Russel and owning as many shares as possible.

I’m highly considering holding onto my shares, even if they reach potential. The dividend is lovely... and I see very little to deter that from hovering where it’s at for quite sometime.

2021-05-16 08:09:47,wallstreetbets,Quantity on iBorrowdesk is meaningless but the rate is significant.  If they are showing a steady climb from 5% to 95% over a week then there is a real shortage of borrow available.
2021-05-15 21:29:18,wallstreetbets,The real number is probably also really low considering that IBKR is a pretty big broker
2021-05-15 21:31:31,wallstreetbets,"Sure, that's not the literal number but it is a huge broker so the numbers are indicative of the rest of the market."

2021-05-16 00:22:55,wallstreetbets,They announced earnings a week agi
2021-05-16 10:50:11,wallstreetbets,"Market Makers have a delta-neutral hedging policy to manage risk. This means that when they sell calls, the Market Maker is supposed to purchase shares equivalent to the delta. Delta goes from 0 to 1, so 0.1 is 10% and 1 is 100%. As an option gets closer to the strike price, the delta increases. Since delta is the chance that the option expires ITM, the time before expiry and the volatility of the stock also affect the delta. That's why if the stock goes up and stay above 9$ until friday, those 9c FDs will have a delta of 1, and the market maker is supposed to have either bought the remaining 90% from the float or sold puts, which means that the sum of the delta from their puts and calls gets smaller since puts have a negative delta."
2021-05-16 09:03:24,wallstreetbets,"The buyback changes everything here.

Also look at my ""strategic decisions"" link, UWM is well positioned for rising rates. And they do more purchase business than their competitors, which is less effected by rates."
2021-05-16 09:46:27,wallstreetbets,Higher interest rates mean more profit for UWMC
2021-05-16 16:10:11,wallstreetbets,You selling calls on Viacom or just holding?
2021-05-16 11:51:15,wallstreetbets,"So it looks like the concerns that mat/sfs can indeed convert class D shares into class A shares by first converting to class B, then selling at market and converting them to class A. That exchange effectively dilutes the economic interest of existing class A shares while increasing their voting power significantly."
2021-05-16 12:16:35,wallstreetbets,"So almost his entire net worth is in those class D shares. The question is when will he sell? This is my no. 1 concern 🤔
Obviously the dividend is unsustainable when those other 95% of shares enter the float.

2021-05-15 21:23:00,wallstreetbets,That might be true. Buts that’s given me the opportunity to load the boat at a 6.5% divi yield. It’s literally a win/win whatever happens rn.

2021-05-16 12:53:14,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, this whole bar thinks I'm psycho now for busting out laughing at nothing."
2021-05-16 11:59:45,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the reply. I guess maybe I was thinking about it backwards. I assumed from the OP that MM's buy/sell thus strongly affecting the delta (which I guess is still technically true) , but really it's that MM's are always adjusting their position based off the delta in order to remain delta neutral. The fact that we know MM's have to remain delta neutral allows us to directly relate the current delta to how much they've covered. I kind of get it now."
2021-05-16 13:53:31,wallstreetbets,"> Since delta is the chance that the option expires ITM, the time before expiry and the volatility of the stock also affect the delta.

My understanding is that delta measures the change in value of an option when the price of the underlying increases by $1. I know delta increases the further ITM an option is, but can it really be used to measure the probability that it expires ITM?

For instance, UWMC is at $7.51. Looking at 18 Jun calls, $7 strike has a .67 delta while $8 strike only has .42 delta. Shouldn't they both have similar chances of expiring ITM, since the underlying is right between them?"
2021-05-16 11:57:40,wallstreetbets,Yes but the bulk of their revenue the past 2 quarters was still refi. They could still see a huge revenue shrink
2021-05-16 12:07:21,wallstreetbets,Why are they predicting 46% less earnings for next quarter with a bunch of downgrades?  Yahoo finance quotes Simply Finance saying they predict a 46% decline in sales for the next quarter.
2021-05-16 17:02:39,wallstreetbets,"My goal is always to make money and I think this stock has potential, but it is not moving even after a good earnings report.

So I am selling short term covered calls, but I am picking out of the money strikes that I hope will not go off and are at or above my cost in case they do get exercised.  I sold June 4 - $43.5 and $42.5 calls and June 25  calls with a strike $45.5.  I  also sold some out of the money naked puts.  

I am trying to generate cash while I wait.  If I picked right, I will probably resell them when they expire at a higher price. We will see what the price is?

Maybe it will work.  Maybe not.  Either way, I am making money while I wait.

Good Luck"
2021-05-15 21:58:05,wallstreetbets,Got eeeeeeemm
2021-05-16 00:52:41,wallstreetbets,Educate me.  Are you selling covered calls or covered puts?

2021-05-16 16:31:45,wallstreetbets,I doubt that - this company has a solid 5 percent dividend  - why expose at 7.70 - risk/reward doesn't seem right.

But I've been watching and tracking the price movements on this stock while also watching borrow rates and short data for months.

2021-05-16 17:50:30,wallstreetbets,Come on dude
2021-05-15 22:12:00,wallstreetbets,"To an extent.. but I was under the impression that it still very much can effect the russle inclusion. The shares they buy yes do get burned, but the % still gets closer to russle exclusion due to the amount of shares the ceo owns compared to the public float.. just not a double whammy where the company gains additional shares."
2021-05-15 22:18:36,wallstreetbets,"It does impact the float percentage. For example, say there are 1000M total shares and 100M are in the public float (10% float). If 10M shares are retired, then the percentage becomes 90M/990M = 9.1% public float."
2021-05-16 04:31:58,wallstreetbets,It's not about the price of the option...
2021-05-16 17:21:04,wallstreetbets,"Now you get the gist of it. It is however possible for the Market Maker to sell more puts, which counteract the delta. Sometimes a price spike happens two days after a rally if an option that wasn't itm or fully hedged suddenly becomes itm at expiry, because the Market Makers have two days to deliver shares when they get assigned. They can also delay them further with a Failure to Deliver, but they're not supposed to do that iirc."
2021-05-16 17:08:52,wallstreetbets,"The 7$ strike is already in the money, while the 8$strike is still out of the money. If the share price of UWMC were to stay flat until June 18th (though I personally hope it will moon this week), the 7c option would get a delta of 1 at expiry, while the 8c option would go to a 0 in delta eventually. For the 8c to be itm, the share price has to increase by about 8%, while the 7c already is itm and has intrinsic value. Therefore a 7c is seen as much more likely and will therefore have a higher delta. Ofc, if UMWC rallies this week, both calls will be itm and end with a delta of 1. Then the 8c will most likely have a larger % increase in price since the change in delta will be larger. It is true that delta reflects the change in price of the underlying, but that is because it reflects the chance of being itm at expiry and thus the option will have that many out of the 100 shares hedged for. This will show up in the price increase or decrease. 

Edit: typo"
2021-05-16 13:22:13,wallstreetbets,"That's not accurate. Earnings call has there predictions. All huge growth planned. Either way, the technicals are primed to explode on this stock. Your choice, but I'm heavily invested and continue to buy more every chance I get."

2021-05-16 16:30:56,wallstreetbets,They’ve actually tightened restrictions lately due to Freddie and Fannie policy updates around self employed revenue documentation and a severe limitation on financing second homes.

2021-05-16 17:42:42,wallstreetbets,"Too many.  I was looking for a quick $5 pop that never happened.

My most interesting trade in this stock was selling 10 naked June 11 puts last Tuesday for about $3.8 with a strike of $41.  Those are already in the money over $600.  As the stock goes up, my gain should increase. a  However, the odds of my holding them to expiration is pretty low. In fact, I will probably be out next week if I can make a quick $1,000. Depends on the price action and what else is going on.

I am not on margin like some of these apes.  That can be really dangerous if the market turns.

Good Luck."

NUE Oct 90/110 (20)

MT Sep 35/45 (100)

CLF July 20/22 (60) and July 20/23 (40)

Those are all monthly bull debit spreads (I paid money for them). Shoutout to u/dhsmatt2 many months ago for his PRPL post that finally made me learn spreads. It's a lot of what I do now.

2021-05-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Comprehensive Guide to EV companies Electric vehicle stocks are down across the board since January, from the biggest Tesla down 33% from its peak to the smallest Canoo down 70% from its peak (on Apple acquisition rumors). 

Here is a guide to the EV landscape today.

tesla =  comedian nerd,
Makes a scene, looks like an idiot, does better than you'd expect with the ladies

Rivian = Wyoming rancher,
Looks like a Ford truck for the most part, just costs $80k, bought by Amazon

canoo = pretty girl, 
Gets great press for its Apple like designs (the ""cutest pickup"" was a CNN headline) has the lowest market cap, gets picked on by the jealous uggos (the shorts) and tried setting up an only fans letting Hyundai take a look at the goods cheap before spac funding

Arrival = sexy accountant,
Small practical British company that has practical designs and has small trial contracts with ups/hyundai. This is the same Hyundai deal that canoo backed out of because Hyundai kept trying to grab its ass. Arrival isn't as pretty so she puts up with it.

Lucid = my dad is rich 

Sleek, expensive, refined. The full blown blue chip factory right from the start. A bit on the bland side, but make no mistake driving a lucid  is  sure to put the riff raff on notice that your daddy can buy his daddy.

Fisker = the Donald of electrics 

Went bankrupt the first time when their Chinese funder had capital issues for their bold design , they are back again for their second try.

Nio = Chinese exchange student 

Pretty bland, doesn't say much. Just an average car that happens to be electric.

Bollinger = big dumb guy 

It's a big truck that doesn't look good that costs $125k. Shrug. You do you.

Lordstown = unemployed guy in fancy suit

Being investigated by the SEC. Testing prototype burned to a cinder, car entered in a race dropped out because it couldn't finish.

Nikola = your wife's boyfriend

They rolled the truck down the hill because they didn't have a product. Still not the lowest market cap of the bunch, company fired the old CEO because they said he misled investors."
2021-05-15 20:30:41,wallstreetbets,"Hyliion - girl with a great ass but nothing else goin on

A specialist in one area (class 8 trucks and even more specifically drivetrain/battery tech) which is enough for some people. Not a ton else to offer, but damn... dat ass."

2021-05-16 08:51:26,wallstreetbets,GM = 53yo divorced MILF that will fuck on the first date and stick a pinky in the stinky. Also makes good eggs the next morning.
2021-05-15 21:40:32,wallstreetbets,Hey a favorable take on R IDE! I'm going to be holding these bags until someone buys them out at this rate

2021-05-15 22:15:37,wallstreetbets,"Nikola Motor Company (NKLA) makes me think of ""companies"" like Bre-X Minerals & Theranos.

This is a company that mislead investors in an (IMHO) criminal way.

The founder has from multiple sources a long history of scamming people by selling businesses under false pretenses and information.

He took capital money and hired his friends and family who have no experience or expertise.  His brother was in the hydrogen technology department despite being a basic home repairs guy laying concrete driveways his whole life...

The only money on the books for the company was the founder (who as you mentioned got kicked out of his own company) putting money on the books for sales to him...

The company and old founder first lied about the technology existing, then promised huge rebuttals on social media.  Then made all the social media private, then ghosted social media all together...

It has went back down to IPO price only this time all the hopes and promises that made it launch at around $9-10 a share don't exist.

No one in any formal business sense wants to touch this company with a 10 foot pole.

They offered free cash and free stock to GM and even GM after discussion realized the association was so bad for business they turned down free stock and free capital....

For the investors that were in NKLA before all the lies and in my opinion fraud came out they should join the countless class action lawsuits, write to the DOJ and SEC to continue their investigations, and write to their local and state representatives to push for investigations as they people were taken advantage of and this business and those at the executive level failed in their fiduciary duty to the shareholders.

The people investing since the news broke and riding it all down to IPO price from around 70-80 are beyond cult kool aid level.  Lol it says something when even WSB gamblers mock a bunch of people for being ignorant.

If the executive team cared at all about the shareholders they would take the remaining capital and assets and merge with a respectable company pursuing hydrogen tech (if you agree with it or not) and lose the name and the history and give the shareholders a chance at some future or at least tech development.

Regardless this is a meme of the decade for one of the worst companies on the market.  It is Luckin Coffee level but without even the coffee.. 😂"

2021-05-16 09:56:58,wallstreetbets,"I went all-in VTI index fund on the dip, only made $11,000 in 3 days but safer for small investor.  PLTR is popular. Do you keep stops in place or trailing stops to protect your position?"
2021-05-16 11:47:16,wallstreetbets,$PLTR can go lower near term maybe even hit $12... but if you don’t start building a position in a popular growth stock after almost a 50% decline... when DO you buy it?
2021-05-15 20:02:48,wallstreetbets,Well Soros just sold off 18.5 mil shares of PLTR and jumped into VIAC
2021-05-15 20:29:29,wallstreetbets,Sir. This is a Wendy’s

2021-05-15 20:43:22,wallstreetbets,Nice work
2021-05-15 20:48:05,wallstreetbets,Where'd you get the mil from
2021-05-15 21:07:00,wallstreetbets,What was it that made you think that was going to be the day it went up? I’m invested in a lot of these high growth stocks and I saw nothing that made me think Friday was going to be such a good day.
2021-05-15 23:12:06,wallstreetbets,Don’t act like you’re never been hurt before

2021-05-16 11:54:47,wallstreetbets,It’s going to keep dipping lmao.

2021-05-15 22:17:53,wallstreetbets,PLTR will never go anywhere. But I am wheeling this bitch because so many people think it's going to 10x overnight
2021-05-16 11:59:39,wallstreetbets,You can’t trust a company who is not transparent because of nature of business it’s in. That’s hurting it bad
2021-05-16 05:25:26,wallstreetbets,"I hope you manage to sell if it goes up again because long term this stock is overvalued and wouldn't want you losing money, maybe goes to all time highs off future expectations but the revenue and profits wont be able to match and eventually it will level out"

2021-05-16 01:07:51,wallstreetbets,"PLTR is such an obnoxious buy-and-hold play.

Why buy so many shares right now?

I say all this knowing that I've been buying and holding since the way-way-back time of $15 a share. I like PLTR, but it's going to take for-fucking-ever to get to the promised land. PLTR is far from my biggest holding."

2021-05-16 13:07:42,wallstreetbets,PLTR has no support left on the bottom. Better chances it going to $10 than going up. Risky! This is the way
2021-05-16 13:24:57,wallstreetbets,"He had options that expired so he had to close them, as the resulted he need to sell some shares to pay for the capital gains taxes. Karp is too brilliant to sell his shares for No reason!  Yes many companies got hyped up for no reasons and pltr was confused in that basket, but as time goes by, and as the Market sees that pltr can deliver and growing like the last Er, funds managers will park their money here for long term."

2021-05-16 16:55:59,wallstreetbets,Read where Kirkpatrick who manages Soros money sold off Palantir and regrets the decision to buy. PLTR depends on gov’t contracts.  I’m not smart enough to know if they’re selling off to buy the dip or there are other issues.  Not my league.  I think it was Market Watch pub.  Don’t act on my comments.  Good Luck.
2021-05-16 17:21:19,wallstreetbets,Good to see all these people selling their souls to the devil.  Makes my path easier.

I don't buy the bullshit that leadership sells monthly only to cover taxes on options. If you were rich as funck with a stake as big as them is this world leading AI company, you would not need to sell regardless of price just to cover taxes, they can get the funding just for taxes from any bank in the US!

2021-05-16 12:43:00,wallstreetbets,"The stock is going to rally into the 4th quarter. Then, retail will start to learn that the remaining 80% of their float will be released from lockup at the end of the year and will be free to sell on the open market. 

I expect another race to the exits again there, which will allow it to retest support at 17-18, before all is clear for liftoff. 

I’m saying this as someone whose entire account is also in PLTR. Fantastic company, great future, EOY will be pain. 

Here’s my current position https://i.imgur.com/fgpf29T.jpg"
2021-05-16 05:44:07,wallstreetbets,alex karp is not „selling“ shares. as part of a compensation plan he gets some of the outstanding shares quarterly - wich he have to tax. he just sells enough shares to pay the tax.
2021-05-16 01:48:03,wallstreetbets,What is lock up expiration?
2021-05-16 00:33:18,wallstreetbets,"I’m thinking $40 minimum by 01/01/22. As long as Karp has his Scrooge McDuck’s money bin worth of call options that expire in January ‘22 I think this is a very modest expectation. At the same time the new customer contracts that were inked a year ago will stop bleeding revenue and instead start raking in capitol. As more and more of their contracts hit the initial year’s end revenue reversal I believe PLTR stock will rise steadily throughout the whole year and beyond.

Edit: changed ‘21 to ‘22 and probably need to add this is my opinion and in no way financial advice."

2021-05-16 07:23:14,wallstreetbets,Alex Karp’s sales aren’t the biggest concern.  It’s Steven Cohen’s.
2021-05-16 05:58:50,wallstreetbets,Oh really? So he paid $1 billion in taxes last year then? That’s incredible. How much compensation did he get that his taxes alone were that high?
2021-05-16 03:42:33,wallstreetbets,After an IPO usually not all shares can be sold. Early investors or founders have to wait some time. I think in PLTR case about 80% of the shares were locked. The lock up ended in Feb 21. Since that there is a much higher supply of shares. In my opinion this pressure now comes to an end. Let's have a look at Soros. He sold I think 19 million shares. But he can only sell his shares once 😉

2021-05-16 12:43:39,wallstreetbets,"I'm also not the biggest fan of their comp.  Made a few comments in my history with links to SEC filings that's not a great look.

That is the bear case but I actually think with the ME tensions flaring, this stock has room to run pretty nicely in the next few months (at the very least swing trades I expect a few profitable rips to take advantage of).  As OP has said, the biggest risk is not the comp it's the macro market condition and fear of inflation / interest rate general distaste for forward earnings (and resulting devaluation of them)."

2021-05-16 15:14:32,wallstreetbets,"None of this matters.  Also it wasn't an IPO (but there was a lockup).

Execs get most of their comp in equity.  If they actually want to live like rich people and not just be rich on paper they have to sell some shares.  It happens at every single company.  And doubly so for early investors.

Pay less attention to supply and demand of shares and more attention to what the company is actually going to be worth.  Shares don't really follow the rules of supply and demand because they are not a commodity that people need and consume.  The buyers and sellers are usually the same people, at different prices.  The only ""demand"" for shares exists because people think that they will be worth more later.  It's not like something like food or housing which people are forced to buy regardless of the price."

2021-05-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$X might mark the spot on a 2X-3X The entire steel sector has been on a tear the past 12 months, with companies like US Steel moving from approximately $6 to $25, and I believe there is plenty of room left to run.  Given that steel prices have been at all time highs, the steel producers have relatively low valuations, and other macro factors, the stock value for companies like US Steel could double or triple this year.

**High Steel Prices**

One of the reasons steel producers have flown under the radar and maintained low valuations has been analysts expectations that steel prices wouldn't achieve the levels they have and that they wouldn't stay at these high levels.  *See examples:*  [*https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/steel-price-rally-seen-under-threat-on-global-supply-revival*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/steel-price-rally-seen-under-threat-on-global-supply-revival)  *and*    [https://www.barrons.com/articles/u-s-steel-stock-got-a-rare-double-upgrade-why-it-will-end-in-pain-51610139992](https://www.barrons.com/articles/u-s-steel-stock-got-a-rare-double-upgrade-why-it-will-end-in-pain-51610139992).  

However, prices have risen over the $1,000/ton peak that some analyst called for at the beginning of the year and touched above $1,600/ton his month.  The price has pulled back a little to closing out at $1,505 on Friday.  However, looking at forward contracts for steel, the price is not expected to fall below $1,000/ton until August 2022.  

To better understand how high the price of steel currently is, see the 10 year chart below:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4ngegkdxucz61.png?width=796&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac2e3239d6127c1b08471ff1946c0f6098a554a7

In 2018, X share price almost reached $50/share.  Given where steel prices are now, I would expect it to touch that again.

**Low P/E**

The rise in steel prices have caused analysis to raise their earnings forecasts for the steel producers, but the stock prices do not appear to fully appreciate these earnings projections.  For example, X is expected to earn approximately $7.95/share in 2021.  At a current price of $25.5, X could earn 1/3 of its current share price in 1 year.      

**China Is Curbing Production**

The largest steel producing country in the world is China.  China's steel production growth over the last 15 years has been one of the main reasons for the demise of the US steel production industry.  This is why I don't compare what X's steel price was in 2008 when steel prices were 1/2 of what they are today.  Its just not the same company with China being the biggest player.

However, China has started trying to curb its production with its new green initiative.  [https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3132666/china-targets-air-pollution-steel-overcapacity-new-curbs](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3132666/china-targets-air-pollution-steel-overcapacity-new-curbs)  Time will tell whether China keeps to its climate change goals and cuts its steel production, but if it does, then we can expect steel prices to remain elevated for a longer period of time.

**Spending Seems To Be Under Control**

One of the disappointments in the steel industry has been poor management.  People who have been investing in X in the past remember Mario Longhi and the destruction he did to this company.  Longhi cut spending when he shouldn't have, he rejected new technology upgrades to produce steel, and he was in charge while the company's intellectual property was stolen by Chinese companies who now produce steel at a much lower cost.  Overall, Mr. Longhi's destruction caused the company to lose its top spot as a steel producer.  

X has a new CEO, David Burritt.  Mr. Burritt seems to be doing a good job turning around the company.  Instead of wasting money on money pits within the company, Mr. Burritt went out and acquired a new  technologically advanced steel mill in Big River Steel.  The timing of the Big River acquisition has played out to be a very well time investment as steel prices were close to their low at the time of acquisition and have tripled since then.  

Overall, the Big River acquisition shows that Mr. Burritt is willing to move away from outdated blast furnaces and into lower cost methods of making steel, which will help US Steel's future earnings.

**Tariffs and Potential Infrastructure Play**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, etc.  It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support.  The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

In 2018, President Trump placed 25% tariffs on steel imported from China.  Contrary to what some believe, Biden has made it clear that he is not interested in removing the steel tariffs placed on China.  This should also help keep steel prices higher for longer.

**Conclusion**

Overall, for the reasons stated above, I believe X has the potential to climb 2x-3x within this year, if not more.  There are other companies in this space that I will write my opinion on and explain why all are good investments.  For example, Nucor ($NUE), which I also own, is best in class when it comes to steel producers.  I believe NUE represents a great investment, but it has already doubled in the past 3 months.  I think X has the most room to run and is worth your consideration."

2021-05-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UWM Holdings Looks Like a Value Bargain With Low PE and Attractive Yield UWMC stock is worth $10 per share, 36% over its recent price at 8 times forward EPS UWM’s new buyback program. On May 11, UWM said it would repurchase up to $300 million of its shares over the next 24 months. This is a sort of dividend to shareholders.

With its $12.8 billion market cap, the $300 million represents a 2.34% buyback yield to shareholders (i.e., $300 million/$12.8 billion) over two years. This is also worth 1.17% annually, or 13.6 cents per share.

Add that to the 5.25%dividend yield (i.e., 40 cents annually divided by $7.68). So the “total yield” as I call it, is worth about 6.42% (i.e., 53.6 cents divided by $7.68). At $10 per share, the total yield is 5.36 % annually more appropriate valuation.

As there are about 1.605 billion shares outstanding, the adjusted EPS will be $1.16 per share. At the recent price of $7.38, this puts UMVC stock on a forward P/E of just 6.4 times forward earnings. That is very cheap.

My estimate of $1.16 is close to analysts’ estimates, as seen by Seeking Alpha, of $1.14 per share. They also estimate $1.23 for next year. That puts UWMC stock on a forward P/E of just 6 times earnings.

I believe a more appropriate valuation is 8 times earnings. That puts the value at $9.84, or roughly $10 per share. This is a potential 36% gain for UWMC stock."

Edit: I placed me order now after looking at the price."

2021-05-15 20:25:19,wallstreetbets,I would go for December 10 call  safe and cheap …. CEO give strong guidances for Q2
2021-05-16 01:01:46,wallstreetbets,"June $8 calls is also what I was looking at to increase my position for a probable shorter term spike in price, so think it is a good idea. Deep ITM Jan 2022/2023 calls would probably be the safer bet IMO, but think that the June 8C is very attractive.

Edit: Definitely wouldn't yolo 5-7k on a single call option, unless you have a significant position in the company already, in which case you probably would not be asking that question. Only been trading for \~6 months, so take that for whatever you consider it to be worth."

2021-05-15 20:20:38,wallstreetbets,Lol 😂 at 3 would be 14 % dividends and uwmc have 300M cash for shares buy back … so if the share at 3 uwm with that 300M could easy buy all free load back and take uwm to private . They would be making 7 buck per share = 700M so your analysis not gonna happen
2021-05-15 20:17:44,wallstreetbets,"Lol. UWMC is about to squeeze and you are talking about a 100%+ loss. Last week when the entire market took a hit, uwmc went up by 10+% you are waaaaaay off"
2021-05-16 01:31:17,wallstreetbets,"The correction is over.  People are realizing that all the analysts have increased their estimates, despite inflation data, and people will start to clue into how many share buybacks are happening because of record-breaking earnings for nearly every stock.

2021-05-15 21:18:44,wallstreetbets,"Market cap $12b if shares went to $3 the market cap would be ~$5,5b, how do you buy all the shares with $300m???  Math genius"
2021-05-15 20:22:32,wallstreetbets,"Yea, of course it's about to squeeze.  Just like CLOV, and MVIS. Squeeze seems to be a popular word that gets thrown around like it's supposed to mean something.

You will not squeeze anything, especially on a market correction. I don't care how much money you think you have, you will not hold it. GME had huge whale investor and it still went down."

2021-05-16 09:45:18,wallstreetbets,Hahaha truth!!! This company sucks!! 😂😂
2021-05-15 20:26:06,wallstreetbets,"In a market correction,  nothing is certain. Stocks need to be evaluated on a daily basis."
2021-05-15 21:45:23,wallstreetbets,"Because something like 93% of the shares are still privately held, so big market cap, small float"
2021-05-15 22:14:40,wallstreetbets,Free float only 90M shares …. U do the math … CEO hold 94% of the company
2021-05-15 23:13:59,wallstreetbets,CLOV Did squeeze you just got in late buddy
2021-05-15 20:46:57,wallstreetbets,The market has been “correcting” since Jan and MVIS *did* squeeze.
2021-05-15 20:28:31,wallstreetbets,"Bro you seem reasonable and an extremely educated retard. Do a basic, CURRENT DD and you'll thank yourself later. I'll give you a hint: check the short interest, amount of available shares to short and when approximately did they short (hint 2: price was 10%+ lower then now) hint 3: check the amount of 7.5-9 contracts . 
I gave you the squeeze now do your dd GL"
2021-05-15 20:41:34,wallstreetbets,"What? People jumped on MVIS for the Lidar and possible buyout from ford, not because of a fuckin squeeze"

2021-05-15 20:45:33,wallstreetbets,"Lol, what buy out. There has been no news about any buy out. That's what I'm talking about. Bunch of BS getting thrown around to fool people into investing into lame stocks."

2021-05-16 11:09:19,wallstreetbets,Unless you’re the ceo and already own them.
2021-05-15 20:51:52,wallstreetbets,Would have believed you if you said mid February.  But clearly you have no idea what your talking about nor do you know what a correction is. Please educate yourself before you do any further investing.
2021-05-15 21:00:38,wallstreetbets,I think you should go and finish your homework. School early on monday remember?
2021-05-16 16:34:21,wallstreetbets,Yup. $100 that would have been in my checking account earning 0.5% interest.
2021-05-16 11:31:02,wallstreetbets,"You still have to be paid for them.  The ONLY shares that don’t have to be bought are Treasury Shares.  This really isn’t that hard, regardless of who wants to own the co 100% they must pay everyone for every share that’s owned, even the CEO’s shares"
2021-05-15 21:01:35,wallstreetbets,"You have no proof, your just running your mouth."
2021-05-16 12:57:36,wallstreetbets,"I think we’re talking about different things. In this case, the CEO wants the price to go up, so he got the board to authorize a 300 m buyback. He has 90% of the shares, and won’t sell his into the buyback. Therefore, we’re dealing with currently a 1.2 B float, which 300 million will have a large effect on. That’s the theory. We could be wrong, and then my calls are fuk."
2021-05-15 21:01:57,wallstreetbets,ok kid.
2021-05-15 21:03:28,wallstreetbets,"Exactly what I thought. Nothing but insults, because you're immature and no proof to back it up."

2021-05-15 21:21:13,wallstreetbets,"Okay nothing, your talking out your ass. Show me the proof of Fords statement about MVIS Buyout. Show me where Ford made that statement. It' doesn't exist, admit it."
2021-05-15 21:25:11,wallstreetbets,ok bro lol.
2021-05-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"What's your strategy? The economy is opening up again and apparently masks are off the table. Kids are getting vaccinated and Tinder swipes are increasing. My local restaurants can't find people to serve me my favorite hamburger and Chipotle now wants to charge me more to make me a burrito.

I used to save all my paycheck that I used to spend going to the bar and picking up 8's that turned into 5's in the morning. I also saved the money I would spend going out to breakfast with said 5 in the AM drinking enough alcohol to turn them back into a 6.5 before we said our goodbyes.

Sometimes I would go to the mall and buy an Orange Julius or a Hot Dog On a Stick. Sometimes I would go see a movie or play paintball with some randoms just to pass the time. And other times I would just go to the local track and play the horses.

But during the pandemic all of that spending turned into gambling on stonks. Waking up early in the morning to read the message boards to see the next hot stonk. Buying calls on BJs and NIOs. Riding OSTK and GME to the moon. And spending hours on end reading Reddit posts.

But now that the economy is reopening I want to do all of that stuff again. Hopefully that 5 is still a 5 and not 300 lbs from binge eating while watching Netflix and Marvel movies on Disney +. Maybe I'll be able to find a mall that has most of its stores in operation and a movie theater with actual real good movies to watch. I want to go to the beach and get a tan. $#@& do I need one living in a cave during this last year.

This means I'll have less time and money to yolo on stonks. And since Biden and others want to stop the stimmy by the end of the summer. I imagine others will have to get a job too. Which means they won't have as much time to yolo as well.

What do you think will happen? What do you plan on doing? Why does everyone think this could all continue if the world is getting back to normal? And given your perspective, what are you doing over the next 3-6 months to take advantage?

TLdR 

Economy closed. Everyone yolo-ed their money on stonks. Now that the economy is reopening people want to do $#@& again. Are you going to sell some of your stonks and gamble less on them because you want to do $#@& again? If so, how much and when?"

2021-05-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Standardized Options by CBOE: the next evolution in trading available today! ""These shares just aren't cutting it! My account value barely moves, at most a few measly percent a day. It's been years and I'm barely keeping up with inflation!""

Now there's another way. Hi, I'm u/Flying_Madman, here to offer you financial advice. Introducing standardized options by CBOE, your go-to source for derivatives trading instruments. For years options trading was limited to market makers and large institutions but now you too can swing with the big boys!

At the CBOE we believe that you, the retail trader, should be empowered to make irresponsible financial decisions and blow up your account just like the professionals. With their wide array of strikes, expiries, and underlying securities, there are options to fit any trader's financial goals and personal risk tolerance. 

Standardized options are highly leveraged derivative instruments that amplify your buying power to never before seen levels. Going all in on just three 0 DTE SPY calls a week have been mathematically proven to make you a millionaire in less than one year\*.

What are you waiting for? Ask your financial advisor if standardized options trading is right for you today, then disregard their dumb advice and do it anyway!

Upcoming Catalysts :

- Earnings June 2nd . Lot of their clients had Covid impacts which reduced revenue last quarter . I expect a good bounce with realized gains this quarter based on how the billing is structured

- Rumor about potential buyouts . We already know Microsoft tried to buy them out pre ipo but CEO declined which eventually turned into a $50 million investment from them . At these lower prices , it can be attractive.

- Beaten down tech / growth stocks are poised for a recovery looking at last Friday’s action / C3 AI would benefit as peers like PLTR recover

- No. of shares Short is around 16% of float which can always create a mini squeeze as it recovers

- lockup expiry is on June 7th but they had a clause which let early investors sell prior to lock up if price increased by 30% after IPO. Most investors used this so lockup expiry would most likely would be a non event considering the stock price is not that attractive to sell

You can forget about the gme short squeeze and you can stop calling everything a short squeeze because they have shares short. Every company has shares short who cares. Find good companies and invest stop chasing everything you see on WSB

2021-05-15 21:45:51,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. Real fraudulent companies. $CLOV is NOT a fraud and are definitely being abused by short sellers. Mondays ER and subsequent DOJ investigation clearance will prove that without a doubt.

2021-05-16 12:09:13,wallstreetbets,"It’s a gamble.  I would definitely suggest studying up on options before trading them, but this is WSB, so fuck it.  Just don’t bet the farm.  Also, you won’t be able to buy any options until open tomorrow, so it may be too late."
2021-05-16 12:24:39,wallstreetbets,I would just start with one if it’s  your first time. I just started a couple weeks ago and I’m in to deep. Especially if CLOV has a shit day tomorrow. It can be addicting and fun.
2021-05-16 13:35:50,wallstreetbets,Do not do options until you study them. Doing them last minute on earnings is very dangerous. Stocks can react weird no matter the earnings report.
2021-05-15 22:22:52,wallstreetbets,There is only a 1.1% fee borrow rate on iborrow with 1.5mill shares available. Theres plenty of shares to short with no risk. Im in mid 8. Think this is a long play. I personally am not banking on a squeeze because of above reason
2021-05-16 10:32:48,wallstreetbets,"There are still over 1M shares available to short and the interest rate is still super low. AMC, GME, and UWMC all look like better options.

2021-05-16 04:29:10,wallstreetbets,"For comparison: GME has a 1% fee(artificially low) rate, and is hard to borrow. 1.5 mill shares is only 1% of the shares.

I have not studied CLOV and how many shares might be available to short, but shorting is never without risk.  If it squeezes, there is no limit to potential losses."
2021-05-16 13:42:27,wallstreetbets,"You're right for now but if the price rises even a bit, the pressure will be added bit by bit.1.5m shares isn't that much considering over 35m shares are already shorted. The way this stock is being manipulated it could very well go down on Monday regardless of earnings. Or if someone comes in with a 2m share purchase it could jump to $10-11 right away which would have the shorts starting to cover. So basically anything can happen. Definitely all set up for a very bullish movement, that is something nobody can deny."
2021-05-15 21:58:44,wallstreetbets,We don't sell... we love the stonk🦍🚀
2021-05-15 21:27:02,wallstreetbets,"1. Hope
2. Pray
3. Wait until sharp dip
4. Keep waiting
5. Convince yourself that it wasn't the peak
6. Wait some more
7. Expire worthless"
2021-05-15 20:02:19,wallstreetbets,"Options derive value from intrinsic and extrinsic sources. The extrinsic value comes from the difference between the strike price and the share price. Intrinsic value is derived from implied volatility. Earnings makes all of that volatility go to zero because everyone knows the ins and outs, there is no uncertainty and that uncertainty is where your intrinsic value comes from. So if your option is out of the money at earnings it will tank regardless of how good earnings are, UNLESS you are pushed in the money from earnings. And then your value is equal to your extrinsic only"
2021-05-16 00:25:23,wallstreetbets,Can I be there too at 12.5?
2021-05-15 22:57:11,wallstreetbets,Much more fun being the hammer and not the nail though

Mvis: 35% short interest, 120% fee borrow, 16 shares available(month ago)

Clover: 35% short interest, 1% fee borrow, 1.5mill sbares available. 

I personally don't think a squeeze is happening untill there is more risk associated with lending. As those rates come up and less shares become available that is an indication the squeeze is nearing. That's how I understand things. I am a retard though"
2021-05-16 13:01:53,wallstreetbets,What's your basis for saying that the GME borrow rate is artificially low?
2021-05-16 18:11:31,wallstreetbets,I think you top out at 0 actually
2021-05-15 20:29:01,wallstreetbets,"""Earnings makes all of that volatility go to zero because everyone knows the ins and outs, there is no uncertainty and that uncertainty is where your intrinsic value comes from. So if your option is out of the money at earnings it will tank regardless of how good earnings are,""

this is all completely wrong.

earnings doesnt make the volatility drop to zero, it all depends on what happens.    If the price shoots up during earnings then volatility will increase and the calls will be worth a lot more.  they dont have to be ITM 'at earnings' to be affected by volatility, that only matters at expiration if they are ITM, as long as the price action is strong on monday there wont be IV crush here, IV will just go up.

read up about Vega and Implied Volatility if you want to know how earnings actually affects options, youre confusing earnings with option expiration."
2021-05-15 20:03:58,wallstreetbets,Thankee kindly!! Apes together strong. Hoping the options will be OTM before they expire.

2021-05-16 11:12:08,wallstreetbets,Lol WSB hates RH. The app itself says not to use for trading and to only use for prices and if you do other trades than you don’t actually own the currency and it’s bad for options trading as well. It allows pretty much anyone to get into options trading and for newer people who don’t know what they’re doing and could potentially screw up the wishes of WSBetters... get off RH lol

2021-05-15 21:08:19,wallstreetbets,"My comment is actually completely wrong, I had extrinsic and intrinsic value totally flipped. I was trying to jot down quickly some rough info I had. After reading a bit more my wording was atrocious and what I meant was lost. That being said regardless of the news earnings almost always does result in a decrease in implied volatility, how much it decreases and the amount that it effects your options is another thing."
2021-05-15 20:44:07,wallstreetbets,"this.

 volatility/vega/implied volatility are affected by share price, and to some extent, options trading at that price. It's why $GME options went thru the roof and were ridiculously unprofitable when GME was soaring/falling. as a price evens out over time, the volatility and implied volatility drops - which is why your options lose value (and can quite quickly) depending upon where your strike price falls relative to the current price and price movement of the stock."

Not even a picture of my “food”…just a picture of my neighbors truck from inside of his car. All while I sat there and watched him do it because I have my window open and keep an eye out if I order out; a habit from pre-Covid when I would make sure to be ready for the driver so they didn’t need to wait.

2021-05-16 09:33:13,wallstreetbets,"Most bridges will be starting to reach their original end of life per design by now....post interstate building booms. It's not like they can't keep going, the Tappan Zee bridge in NY was built during steel shortages of the era and intentionally was supposed to be replaced in 40 years, it got 18 more years squeezed out of it but when they were finally started removing it, that bridge actually so near its last legs and they struggled to safely do it and switched to blowing it up halfway."
2021-05-15 20:05:27,wallstreetbets,"Well, Highway Departments and Road and Bridge Authorities should already have a priority based list on which bridges need minor repairs all the way through to which bridges need complete replacement.

The following is a quote from the 2021 Report Card for America's Infrastructure:

>*There are more than 617,000 bridges across the United States. Currently, 42% of all bridges are at least 50 years old, and 46,154, or 7.5% of the nation’s bridges, are considered structurally deficient, meaning they are in “poor” condition.*  
>  
>*A recent estimate for the nation’s backlog of bridge repair needs is $****125 billion****. We need to increase spending on bridge rehabilitation from $14.4 billion annually to $22.7 billion annually, or by 58%, if we are to improve the condition. At the current rate of investment, it will take until 2071 to make all of the repairs that are currently necessary, and the additional deterioration over the next 50 years will become overwhelming.*

So ignoring all other types of infrastructure in need of upgrades, $125 billion is needed just for bridges alone. 

Now according the White House face sheet, the $621 billion from 'The American Jobs Plan' that is allocated to infrastructure also includes roads, public transport, passenger and freight rail services, building electric vehicle infrastructure (charging stations), ports, waterways, and airports.

So that means only a fraction of the $621 billion will get allocated to bridges. The cost of replacing/rebuilding an existing bridge from scratch is a freaking nightmare - not only the logistics but the cost - and this option would only be considered in extreme cases. So the main headache would be how to spend the money they get allocated - fix thousands of minor repairs before they get worse? Or replace a handful of bridges that are over 70 years old? Some serious optimization of budget allocation will be needed."
2021-05-16 07:11:46,wallstreetbets,"You paid 30$ a sq ft for asphalt repair? Damn, did they have robber masks on, as opposed to COVID masks? That price is wild."
2021-05-15 20:29:11,wallstreetbets,"Engineering is all about optimization - meaning spend as little as possible to do the minimum needed to meet design and safety requirements. If the cheaper option does the job then that will be chosen over replacement. Of course if it's a safety issue that old steel **should** come out to be replaced. 

That's why I think (in my humble retarded opinion) we shouldn't be focused on certain materials like concrete or steel as an investment play for this. If Biden proposed $621 billion allocated to *new construction* then yeah maybe, but repair and upgrading infrastructure is more about expertise in diagnosis and smart budget spending so a better bet would be on Contractors and Engineering Consulting Companies. Unfortunately the list of these companies is too long to mention so some serious DD would be required to identify who would be the frontrunners to pick up this type of work.

After looking at CX again - it has a large focus on concrete materials (cement + aggregates) but also other construction products like asphalt, pipes, precast products for culverts, bridges, basins, drainage, barriers etc. so actually doesn't fit the Contractor category."

2021-05-15 21:27:04,wallstreetbets,"Can you explain this arithmetically? if you take publicly available shares out of circulation, without decreasing the corresponding private shares as well, then public ownership has to go down. I think someone else put it this way, Current 6/100 public, 94/100 private (6% public float), after 1% buyback 5/99 public, 94/99 private means it's a 5% float and no longer a 6% float."
2021-05-16 00:44:24,wallstreetbets,"Suppose UWMC has 100 shares only for the total company 94 (94%) are held by Ishbia et al, 6 (6%) are held by the public.

2021-05-16 01:36:04,wallstreetbets,"This just doesn't seem right... You would expect that in this scenario, the total after those 3 shares are retired would now be 97 and the public float would then represent 3/97 = 3.1%.

2021-05-16 04:52:30,wallstreetbets,"No. Steam doesn't buy games. You're right. It's strictly retail storefront (which supports your GME idea but I doubt that's in the works).

No. They don't develop games. And it's not a development platform. (but one could consider mods a form of creation)

But no one seems to have made a viable commerical space for games to be sold online. We're still dealing with ancient stuff like disc media. And yeah, there is PS Store and XBox store and a couple other online retail attempts but that could all be integrated into one platform -- but no one has been able to do that.

It's weird to let a brand name hardware dictate software availability and pricing. There's not a lot different between consoles or PCs. 

So many of the component guts are the same or provide the same function  (yeah, there are significant differences - don't want to fight about it - talking generals here).

The point is: were talking graphics card, CPU (motherboard, blah blah - you know what I mean - the engine in general terms), ram, ssd or HD space.

It would be like saying everyone needs a specific hand to grab toilet paper. It's toilet paper. We can all grab it.

If youre looking for the same set up as the GME squeeze, you dont realize how rare those are and are just bandwagon trading since Feb.

A classic undervalued and oversold stock who has only increased future holdings and licencing is just as good of a reason to put money down as a squeeze that comes once a decade.

Look at what 1 Superbowl did to its earnings. They have 3/4 in the next 4 years and a brand new streaming service.

Alright, all you have to hope for is that MSFT at least stays at $250.70 and hope they don’t tank once 4pm hits that day

By that time, both IV crush and theta won’t even matter to be taken into account

If anything, your best bet is to simply sell anytime before 4pm on 5/21, cuz exercising calls will actually net you less potential profit, since you lose the premium ($3.20 per share x 100 shares per contract x 25 contracts) unless you plan on holding 2500 shares of MSFT long into the future, which *can* be a good thing since it is MSFT"

They are proving that with racing development as well.

I think there will be a surge of movies goers, movies being exclusive to movie theatres, the attention that this situation has gotten could potentially shift the balance in movie theatres favour for the future. They are also looking into new innovative ideas to bring in revenue. I hope it has a bright future as going to see a movie was something I grew up with and have fond memories of.

Because of this, the geostrophic solar wind balance has deteriorated rapidly in the northern hemisphere. 

In essence, autumnal weather patterns in the western United States will lead to the biggest ornamental gourd yield in recorded history. 

Investing in gourd agricultural futures could likely produce up to $1600 per day in passive income. 



However, investing at the apex of the curve would be the most conducive to profit as the arbitrage (particularly 12b-1 fees) will develop at a market share higher than the back-end load. 

Basically, no one will be able to buy the stock at a higher price than you, and all value invested will be retained. 

A preliminary market penetration investment of $50,000 would be most efficient in generating this revenue."

A few days after the whole squeeze started to get absolutely out of control and there were like 200k comments, the mods put up an unpinned thread during the night shift. Only the regulars found it amid the chaos and there was this beautiful 3-4 hour span that felt exactly like how you feel reading the epilogue of a great epic book where everyone comes together one last time to reminisce, realizing that we’d never be back. It was honestly a bit of a tear-jerker. I’ve never experienced something like that on the internet.

2021-05-16 15:00:15,wallstreetbets,"Fed recently decided not to extensively concentrate their regular asset purchases at the short end of the yield curve. Rather, they are now distributing the purchases throughout the curve - more towards the longer end. This will make the long end less prone to spikes as we have recently seen. Also explains why it has been falling the last few days. On top this, even the bond market is now legitimately participating in LT bond purchases, given that the recovery hasn't been as explosive as it was initially expected.

This will make the dollar fall and real yields fall. Good for equities, especially QQQ. In commodities, should help gold experience an uptrend.

As she tosses her dark brown hair over her shoulder and glances at you knowingly, you crumble. She thinks it's because of her intoxicating sensuality--which is fair, because it *is* intoxicating. She steps forward, and allows you to bury your head into her pelvis as you weep. She interprets this as you realizing how much you love her, unaware that you're crying because you know you will lose her. Within a few seconds, you slide and your cheek is against her feet.

These taloned, tusked, and single horned beasts emerge every Zerl, specifically when the three moons of Remulak align. When his turn comes to enter the arena Beldar doesn't know what to do, so he does what he's good at it. Golf. He strikes the ball into the Garthok's throat, choking it to death.

This is an allegory we can all relate to. You have to step into the arena, and you should do it fearlessly on a foundation of skills you believe in. If you believe in yourself you can slay any beast. Be like Beldar."

2021-05-16 13:27:33,wallstreetbets,"You look up from weed eating, through grass-covered clear goggles, and notice the riding mower your dad is on isn't moving. You approach him from behind and ask, ""Out of gas?"" But as you come around and look him in the face, you find him crying. In 34 years, this is maybe the second time you've seen him cry. ""Whoa, what's up?""

He doesn't know where he is, he says. He doesn't remember getting on the mower; he doesn't remember you coming over to help him around the house. He's had another ""mini stroke."" Such a cute name for such a torturous thing. Since he got diagnosed with cancer, you've learned a lot of terrible things about what it does to a body, like how it ""thickens the blood."" He's been having a lot of these mini strokes. The doctors *think* they won't do lasting damage to his brain, but they don't comment on the lasting damage that you'll have from finding your father--the strongest person you've ever known--crying like a baby.

You help him off the mower and ask him if he wants to go to the hospital. He doesn't. He just wants to go to sleep. So you let him. You don't know if that's the right choice, but you decide to let him do whatever the fuck he wants.

As you close the door to his bedroom, you open your Robinhood app. Down again. New all time lows every day. You sigh at the cancer in your portfolio, the cancer that is SPY options. But what choice do you have? Your family can't afford his treatments--each pill, taken once a week, is $2500--so you're trying to get lucky. You're trying to buy his survival.

You casually notice United Health is up again. Why wouldn't it be, with what you pay for coverage, and with how little they actually cover?"

60F Mildly Cloudy

[The French Laundry](https://imgur.com/a/Q8Pe9Mc) is truly the absolute pinnacle of American cuisine. With Thomas Keller at the helm, he has transformed what was once a modest kitchen into the single most recognizable restaurant in America, with his masterful display of cooking with only the finest of ingredients, and illustrating the true beauty of what farms can produce in terms of both produce and meats. 

We begin our meal with appetizers - his salmon cornets basically savory ice cream cones with salmon. Followed, the first dish is his one true classic dish, Oysters and Pearls - essentially the plumpest beau soleil oysters with a sauce of hollandaise and tapioca, with caviar spooned on top to create richness and fresh salinity on the palate.

It is followed by one of the stars of the show, his chilled garden carrot soup - with young coconut puree, shisho, and mint infused olive oil. It demonstrates his mastery over the art of raising crops for his own restaurant, with the punctuality of the mint piercing the richness of the coconut combining with the sweetness of the carrots in order to bring our palates to orgasm.

The next dish consists of the Hawaiian big eye tuna ""A La Plancha,"" a dish comprising of a pan seared round of big eye tuna, with egg mousse, celery, deviled quail eggs, and nicoise olive oil, which really didn't inspire, but was a good experience, with the flavors balanced perfectly and showing off the fickle seasonality of fishing.

Desserts for each one of us consisted of a raspberry roll cake, strawberry and chocolate gelato with a wild berry jelly, beignets, macarons, toffee, and an opera cake with cacao nibs and toffee stripes, as well as a delectable foamy hot chocolate.

This entire experience has only reinforced my love for Keller's cooking, and I only wish I could have experienced it with my knights and men at arms /u/memetron9000, /u/angrysc0tsman12, and u/slugk0."

She would analyze all my picks and call me retarded. I would exit the room and sit on a bench, sobbing. She would finish her weekly update video and come to me after . She would laugh at me and call me a sorry loser. She would tell me to apologize to her for wasting her time. I would mumble 'sorry' but she would push me against the wall and slap me in the face. I would say 'sorry ma'am Woods'. She would instruct me to get on my knees and kiss her shoes, and I would oblige. After kissing one of her shoes, she would kick me in the face and step on my head, pushing my face towards the floor. 'You're pathetic' she would say. 'You're beneath me, boy'. 'I'm beneath you, ma'am', I would reply. She would go around me and sit on the bench. She would take off her shoes and wiggle her toes. She would instruct me to get up on my knees and face her, and then she would throw her shoes at my face. She would straighten her legs. 'I want you to kiss my soles, boy'. I would oblige and kiss her tired heels first, then go up the sole and end with the toes. 'I want you to lick my feet'. I would run my tongue on her salty, earthly-smelling soles while she would giggle. 'Come closer' shoe would say. Having me come closer to her, she would spit im my face. 'I thought you'd like the taste.' I would reply 'I do ma'am. It's heavenly ma'am.' 'Good boy'. I would go back and continue licking her feet for a few minutes. 'Alright, boy, that's enough. I expect you to visit me tomorrow. I'll keep my feet dirty just for you.' 'Of course, ma'am.' She would put on her shoes and kick me in the nuts as a goodbye."

2021-05-16 02:45:37,wallstreetbets,"This speaks to me, as i work for a restaurant under a very intense hospitality oriented individual that had a tenure under Thomas Keller. He told me that Keller's intensity was unmatched.

 He taught me that Keller created a dining experience that incorporated the law of diminishing returns. That is, Keller would create a dish with such concentrated fervor, that 3 bites would leave you wanting more, but the fourth bite would be superfluous, and at the end you would be 'just eating.'  Keller knew that we all can appreciate a bite, but once the meal got going we would turn the experience towards each other. Toward our community. So to keep the patron focused on the food, Keller would pull the small plate to entice us with another meme-potential dish, so the whole time we would be pulled into the culinary experience.

Anyways, you understand the paralells that i'm making with our everyday relationships with the economy and the things that we value. Keller was able to enrapture us by providing us with new compelling dishes over and over again."

Right now I sitting with the dogs and my daughter threw a toy pony at me while I was writing this.

Went to work, had a short day today. Just had to go in to get some paperwork done. Spent maybe 2.5 hours there. 

When I left I stopped by the grocery store to buy some green onions, bread, tomato, bbacon, and an 18 pack of bid light. 

Went home, pet my dog. Walked my dog, called him a good boy. 

Started drinking, made and ate 3 BLTs, downloaded Subnautica Below Zero (which is excellent) played that for a few hours, continued drinking. I have 3 beers left which I plan to smash in the next 20 minutes,  then I'll probably poop, wash my hands, and pet my dog some more.

 I had to re locate a rattlesnake I found under my truck tire in the driveway and take him down the road. It was a baby and had recently eaten so that was cool. 

Some roadwork started in front of the house it it seems another house was built further down and they are hooking up utilities but need to dig some holes in my road now.

So they are different “factors” but they are not different. A change in IV directly impacts the theta, or time decay.

2021-05-16 18:39:32,wallstreetbets,"I'm really excited about the UWMC possibility which was outlined above. But in such situations i try to imagine what could go wrong.

  
So here's a possible worst case scenario:  
Good news regarding the business, a very nice dividend and an announced 300 mio. share buy-back-program push the price upwards (or at least stops the ongoing freefall a bit). Soon after the lock-up period ends (as far as I know during July), part of the until then locked shares (9 times the current float in total!!!) are brought to the market - on a very high price because of the facts mentioned before. After the price plummets (because of the sold shares and therefore increased float), the company begins buying back the shares at a very low price. The seller of the locked-up shares gets a great price, the company buys some shares back at a good price and all the others lose.  
  
What do you think about that? Could that really happen?  
  
This is NOT financial advice nor have I the knowledge or experience to really judge such situations. Do your own DD and go for the tendies everywhere you want."

2021-05-16 12:55:52,wallstreetbets,"If borrowing costs go up, the cost to short goes up.

The percent of short matters yes, but it's really the unheld portion of the free float that sets the price.

Market beat says 13% short interest but those metrics are dated 4/15 or earlier.

Short borrow costs are updated constantly while FINRA short reports are always delayed.

Even a threat to to that early in the week , like a spike that they can't short back under control (cost prohibitive) would cause them to close positions.

2021-05-16 06:39:36,wallstreetbets,"The fact that you posted this literally as soon as you were out of that massive loss and are now finally up to some gains- shows a bit of a investor deadly fault in thinking. If you need confirmation from others to feel the need to hold this position- it’s not a good position. 

The question was not “to print or not to print”- the real question is why were you only brave enough and perhaps strong enough to post this as soon as you realized the slimmest of profit? 

I’m not saying this to be mean or beat a dead horse- I’m saying this to make sure you understand how your trading habit in connected to self destruction. 

If you felt comfortable to post this now that it seems like a “good” investment because you are making money- you may have not thought about it like that when you were losing. In that case it doesn’t appear to be greatly researched YOLO."

2021-05-16 00:39:15,wallstreetbets,"Yes, selling options is not for YOLO. But buying long dated options isn't getting you far, is it ? When you buy options you pay a premium over the actual value, over time this premium decays which is the main reason for your gigantic loss.
Selling options is not as hot favourite as I can see on reddit but if implemented correctly it can consistently make you 10-15%(at least) a month. The option buying; the way I've seen in reddit, is like taking a lottery ticket. You won once, that's crazy and exciting but you can't expect it to happen everytime. You'll just burn through your entire earning. There are a lot of strategies for option selling, consider them. You may not be able to brag about the next YOLO but over a few years you may be able to afford a new home."

Do all failures to deliver reflect improper activity? After adoption of Rule 204, why are there still failures to deliver?

A failure to deliver occurs when a broker-dealer fails to deliver securities to the party on the other side of the transaction on the settlement date. There are many justifiable reasons why broker-dealers do not or cannot deliver securities on the settlement date. A broker-dealer may experience a problem that is either unanticipated or is out of its control, such as (1) delays in customers delivering their shares to a broker-dealer, (2) the inability to obtain borrowed shares in time for settlement, (3) issues related to the physical transfer of securities, or (4) the failure of a broker-dealer to receive shares it had purchased to fulfill its delivery obligations. Failures to deliver can result from both long and short sales."

VRBO platform is just not as good and has higher fees for both hosts and users plus the clientele is definately an older crowd which is at greater likelihood of travel decline due to advancing age and associates health effects. I no longer host on vrbo because of this but also their customer service is just not as good. 

I bought more when it dipped back in the 180's, more again in the 170's, 160's, and again now in the 130's. The pent-up travel demand is real and enormous. I simply can't keep up with the demand and volume of messages and have been able to increase prices substantially as have many other hosts."

2021-05-16 17:37:11,wallstreetbets,Your not factoring in all of the homes that are going to be foreclosed when all this COVID shit is over. It’s a sellers market right now and it’s only gonna last till every state removes the no foreclosure and eviction bans
2021-05-16 17:45:00,wallstreetbets,"I guess I’m just betting that a housing crash doesn’t happen though. Plenty of states have removed the eviction or foreclosure bans and have had no negative impacts. The housing shortage continues to get worse and worse. I personally think it could be years before things turn around. While many who lost jobs may lose homes, there are simply too many investors snatching up homes because the wealthy continued to make lots of money during covid"

2021-05-16 10:48:01,wallstreetbets,Most people don't buy and sell at the peak dummy. That's not the same as market cap
2021-05-16 18:00:46,wallstreetbets,I felt your pain. I hope you can get one though. I made so many offers too and I think the only reason I was able to get mine was because the listing agent accidentally listed it as a two bedroom when it was three
2021-05-16 14:21:35,wallstreetbets,What the hell does people selling at the peak have to do with market cap. If you had an IQ of over 50 you would realize I meant AMC’s market cap would be more then the world economy if the share price hit 500k. Market cap is outstanding shares times the share price.
2021-05-16 10:49:07,wallstreetbets,This won't age well
2021-05-16 18:04:44,wallstreetbets,That’s not a good sign lol guess I’ll be scouting out possible listing mistakes. My problem is I have 3 kids so I don’t have a huge amount of wiggle room on what I want and need. I fully plan on my purchase lasting minimum till kids are grown and gone so I’m being very particular in a market that’s not allowing it. I also refuse to pay 350k for a house I can buy in another state for 120k. But fuck me is the market for 250k houses a bitch.
2021-05-16 14:31:45,wallstreetbets,"You don't understand math, get it through your lack of a skull. The hypothesis is it will hit xxxK at peak, that doesn't mean it won't roll back to reasonable levels. Go back to college."

It is not possible because that would mean a bunch of people selling at 500k would be taking out 100’s of trillions of dollars into the economy that was never there before, where is all that money gonna come from? It’s not possible bud, sorry to break it to you."

Where there is a seller there is a buyer, if there isn’t enough money in the world to buy up the 200 trillion, then how is everyone gonna get their money if they sell?

2021-05-15 21:57:10,wallstreetbets,"Isn’t the 9 billion valuation from Pfizer misleading? They only have 500 million to date + 150 mil for costs+ a few 100 mil likely coming from approvals. But we have no idea how they get paid by sales tier. For all we know, the sales tiers could be very large. This deal is probably good for Pfizer because they only pay once it is successful and if it’s not, their loss is limited. I don’t think this is comparable to a straight equity deal. Correct me if I’m wrong."
2021-05-15 22:14:31,wallstreetbets,"Pfizer didn’t pay 4.5 billion though. They’ve only given them 500 million to date that isn’t cost related. Do you have an idea on what the total payout has been from Pfizer in similar types of arrangements? Just to play devils advocate, I could come to an agreement with you to get half of the revenue from some useless widget and agree to pay $1 now and $1 billion dollars if we ever sell a billion of these. We wouldn’t say the fair value of the company selling the useless widget is 2 billion. So why are you using the 4.5 amount?"
2021-05-16 01:07:33,wallstreetbets,"You’re devils advocate argument is fair. To provide more clarification, the milestones are really not that difficult for the company to hit. In multiple conference calls the senior management has called them “manageable and attainable.

You’re right, it was very smart for Pfizer to protect themselves by making these milestone payments. It also helps them not have to pay everything out in one sitting making this a much easier cash situation for them to manage. 

I’m not asking you to blindly invest. The 10k is loaded with amazing details and they have a very transparent IR team that responds to investor inquiries. 

Last but not least on the Pfizer note, Pfizer is rooting for them. Their drug rugolix is sold either in support (with) their drug in the case of prostate cancer. And in a combination tablet for endometriosis and uterine fibroids. It makes so much sense they are putting 100 of their already trained urologist sales team on this. 

It’s a win win for everyone. Pfizer still stands to make a a lot of money as well."
2021-05-16 01:09:59,wallstreetbets,"You really do bring up some great points and I appreciate it! I doubt Pfizer would put up half a billion cash without any confidence in these guys.

It’s also worth noting Pfizer was an early round seed investor who used to have a right of first refusal (expired). They have been helpful and involved from the start. I imagine they have seen the potential since day one."

2021-05-16 10:55:29,wallstreetbets,Not the same. Volkswagen went to almost $1000 with 12% short. TSLA $4800(if you bought before the split) on 20% interest. GameStop was/is shorted over 100%. Over 100% detaches you from fundamentals and it becomes strictly supply and demand. If they get margin called it will keep rising until people sell and the short % goes below 100% THEN you can start drawing your triangles from there.

2021-05-15 22:05:04,wallstreetbets,"Not 100% on Canadian law so grain of salt but usa/most sane places I've lived, any stock held longer than a year is considered an asset and capital gains tax applies to the sale instead of income tax.

This is super important if you live/pay tax somewhere like Denmark where the income tax ceiling is greater than 50% and capital gains is a neat 22%

Picking the right stock and holding for the right amount of time isn't the only thing to consider when liquidating

If you're curious and want an end to end example feel free to reply here asking or DM me and I can take some time to further break down how to take advantage of a capital loss. If you like self research just investigate the term ""Negative Gearing"" most examples are situated around property flipping but the principal is applicable to all capital assets, eg sell a house (capital gain), liquidate some old FD's (capital loss) less tax payable on the house sale as your total capital gain/loss for the period is reduced.

Or the reverse, bought some land that turned out to be worthless due to contam? Sell it for a complete loss to offset the initial capital price on the land against your GME earnings that you diamond handed to 2023"
2021-05-15 22:22:52,wallstreetbets,"If he sold the whole asset at once yes its one fin year. You don't pay capital gains tax until you realise the value of the asset (aka sell it) at which point you pay tax THAT financial year.

Learn to read, or did you actually think you should backdate capital gains tax on a sale to the year you acquired the asset because that's some smooth brain shit the IRS will jail your idiot ass for. Capital losses can be carried forward."

2021-05-16 01:10:11,wallstreetbets,"although I completely agree with the sentiment that GM and F may have caught up to the EV game, I do believe FSR's business model does set them apart from their competition. As a designer for the vehicles, they're less liable to litigation and manufacturers are the ultimate executor for faultiness on the vehicles.   


Now, when accidents/faultiness do occur on their vehicles, the stock will still take a hit, but I don't see it as big of a concern as there has additional cushion for pushbacks... Additionally, by the time the FOXCONN plant is built, EV technology may very well be rounded out and companies like TSLA, NIO, CCIV, have already worked out much of the kinks for FSR to incorporate into their design."

In what alternate universe are you living in that design, interface technology (this is an EV my guy), and energy performance not require engineers (several different types of engineers)… nice try making up BS because you’re invested in a different EV possibly and by trashing  Fisker you think it will benefit you somehow or you think you’re doing some one a service lol …. Buddy you’re not a subject matter expert, have a seat and watch the market but don’t act like you know anything because you bought some shares that you have clout like a hedge fund manager or some wolf of Wall Street BS. 

Fisker is a great company model for America, period. You small minded pea brains are putting down American Company! Really!?! You put down an American company willing to create American jobs and plans for environmentally sustainable practices to to help pioneer preservation of our world for the next generation of Americans. Fisker gave it all and lost everything about 10 years ago. His previous model required lots of capital given liability of owning all manufacturing responsibility. That model was unable to absorb the cost of research and development and manufacturing product. Fast forward to today, Fisker is the American comeback story to never give up and to overcome challenges. Fisker learned a valuable lesson in his journey (I’m not talking about his last venture, I’m speaking to his entire career). I’m rooting for him because he is focusing on providing a real product to Americans that is innovative, sustainable, affordable. Don’t be surprised if EV makers start teaming up with Fisker or Tesla or GM. It will happen. What matters most is that we take care of American people, our environment, and deliver a high quality product to show the world that America is the best at everything we set out to do and we don’t give up. Just chew on that my fiend."

If only i had any more scratch (margin maxed) - i would, **without any hesitation**s, loaded up to the max again last week when SP went down to 72.50 - which imo is a free gift considering last ER and where the whole sector is going...."
2021-05-16 01:28:42,wallstreetbets,"OK, but at least wait until it drops to $58 or so.  It's probably going to $47 sometime this year before recovering.

Nothing to do with the business or fundamentals, but you need the current retards/bagholders to get flushed out before it's going to $100.  


Has anyone ever seen a merger happen on time?  


WSB is a laugh.  Deluding yourself of DD to justify something.  Doesn't mean shit.  How many times does a company beat earnings only to crater and vice-verse?  Price goes where the liquidity is, period."
2021-05-16 04:49:24,wallstreetbets,"I'd like to clear some doubts that WSB redditors may have. As you can see, my position size does not match up with the value of the available funds in my account.

I am attaching a link that explains how Margin Trading works in the UK with a broker such as IG Group.

Please educate yourself before making yourselves look like fools. Godspeed to everyone! [Margin Trading ](https://www.ig.com/en/cfd-trading/charges-and-margins)"

2021-05-16 04:36:13,wallstreetbets,"Numbers dont add up.

TSLA   4000 x $575 = $2,300,000 US dollar

APPL  2000 x $125  = $250,000 US dollar

Total = $2,550,000   at dollar to pound 1.41 conversion should be  \~1,808,500 UK pound

Screenshot says :  \~429,000 UK pound in margin

so you balance should show something like  1,380,500 UK pound

I call fake screenshot, BAN HIM"

From the looks of it, seems like a large majority of WSB investors are clearly not literate with financial products.

Instead, I'm bagholding for now"
2021-05-16 16:10:04,wallstreetbets,"I must say it’s not fair for me to judge what price is good or bad or if there’s potential squeeze potential, it’s popular on WSB so you may be able to get out of it. I just looked at it as if it was a Medicare company I was thinking about contracting with and I wouldn’t touch it. And I feel like the defense for the company was a little idealistic at best. I sell a lot of Medicare and I’ve never heard of them. 🚩SEC investigation 🚩 I could definitely be wrong but it just feels scammy."
