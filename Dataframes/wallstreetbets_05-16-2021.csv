He got kicked out of a small website called x.com for being a dumbass. Peter Thiel then proceeded to turn it into the behemoth that is Paypal. He just happened to still hold stock as its value explodes. He did not found or build Paypal.

TESLA WAS NOT FOUNDED BY ELON MUSK, it was founded by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Elon bought a majority stake in tesla and then proceeded to kick them out of their own vision and masquerade as a savior to humanity. 


In depth debunking of the Elon and his assumed history

Part 1

Part 2

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DopFo1rjAr4


He has been lying about ‚Äúself driving‚Äù coming out ‚Äúthis year‚Äù for 5 years despite the fact in recent emails they fucking told the DMV ITS NOT COMING.

Did you know the only reason Tesla has a solar division is because musk used shareholder money to bailout his failing solar company?

Is Elon musk a psychopath?

Did you know he said he would ‚Äúfire‚Äù his ex wife if she didnt dye her hair blonde?

He then proceeded to abandon her after having her bear 5 of his children.

Did you know the only reason Tesla has a solar division is because musk used shareholder money to bailout his failing solar company?

Is Elon musk a psychopath?

Did you know he said he would ‚Äúfire‚Äù his ex wife if she didnt dye her hair blonde?

He then proceeded to abandon her after having her bear 5 of his children.

-EU (same reasons as US)


Here are the parties that want lower oil prices

-all non-oil-producing nations but primarily China and India

So then what might cause flat or declining oil prices?

The only thing I can think of would either be a glut of supply coming online quickly (Iran), or cratering demand due to a big resurgence in Covid cases.

We are still well below the average price of oil during the Obama era.

My son plays Roblox and my wife recently asked me about Robucks. I am not really sure how it all works, but my wife is apparently seeing those as a popular gift or request from kids."

2021-05-16 14:16:34,wallstreetbets,There‚Äôs no way Roblox can justify its share price when compared to more established competitors. Disclosure: I‚Äôm going to buy as many $40 puts as I can. Not financial advise.

2021-05-16 15:37:47,wallstreetbets,"Your son understands Roblox as an investor more than 99% of wallstreet does.

I still play an online game that I started playing when I was 8 years old in 2004. RPG games is really just pre-virtual reality or metaverses as they call it."
2021-05-16 17:30:05,wallstreetbets,Comparing Unity and Roblox is like comparing Autodesk to Scratch.
2021-05-16 19:25:23,wallstreetbets,"The roblox ecosystem is impressive, particularly fact that it can incentivize kids to work and earn money.  With a monthly subscription (\~$4) the user get Robux every month and has access to the Roblox marketplace where they can list their own items.  

I've seen normally lazy kids brute force learn to use Gimp photo editing software to create clothing for their personal stores.  With enough friends in school they make a steady stream of Robux from custom requests and just executing on every crazy kid idea rattling around their brain.   

I generally dislike the recurring revenue drug so many games are moving to, but in the case of Roblox there is a potential some kids come away from it with some real entrepreneurial lessons."
2021-05-16 17:03:54,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, a roblox gift card is a great gift for a kid from my experience."

2021-05-16 19:32:13,wallstreetbets,"We should be well beyond caring about profits for newly IPO'd growth tech companies.  The revenue model and stream RBLX has today will likely not stay static, but hard to say where it will head.

2021-05-16 15:42:19,wallstreetbets,"They spend a fuck ton on their developer studio and are playing the long term. I've read their IPO filing and it's stated that they will do things that are not in the best interest of investors in the short term so that they can achieve global ubiquity.

There are many things they do that investors don't consider, like acquiring learn-to-code education applications like Coding Kingdoms to teach kids how to code and implement it into software curricula in schools."

2021-05-16 15:26:13,wallstreetbets,Yeah but think about how many accounts are made daily. Most of them are from kids who forgot their account info. Not enough of them are buying Robux to drive Roblox stock any higher. I have a feeling they‚Äôve plateaued. Unless they can find a way to drive the price higher.
2021-05-16 14:52:09,wallstreetbets,Hmmm. Do you think it‚Äôs going to be big?

2021-05-16 13:14:36,wallstreetbets,"I had done a DD on UWMC sometime back. Hope you find it useful (might be a bit dated but fundementals still remain the same)  
  
Core Product  
  
United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM) underwrites loans for mortgage brokers, banks and credit unions. It doesn't lend directly to borrowers. Instead, they are simply the facilitator and underwriter. What they mainly provide is consumers, lenders and institutions a simple process by which they can apply, compare and complete a mortgage application. They currently have one of the fastest and most effective consumer to lender processes due to their heavy investments into IT infrastructure (UWMC‚Äôs mortgage process takes an average of 17 days from start to finish when compared to the industry average of 47 days)  
  
Financials  
  
UWM had a stellar year in 2020 and it reflects in its financials.  
  
UWM reported 4Q20 net income of $1.37 billion and FY20 net income of $3.38 billion, an 821% and 715% increase over 4Q19 and FY19 respectively. Their total loan volume amount for 2020 was $182.5B which was 69% higher than 2019.  
  
Cash in hand also rose from 133M in 4Q-19 to 1.22B in 4Q-20. Credit quality of the loans improved with the weighted average FICO of 757 for the full year of 2020. This brought down the 60+ delinquency rates well below the industry average. UWMC also just declared its first regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share on the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock. The dividend is payable on April 6, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 10, 2021.  
  
Potential and Hype Factors  
  
Russell index addition: UWMC is expected to be added into Russell 1000 and Russell 3000 index by end of March. This will force all the funds tracking these indices to add UWMC to their portfolio possibly driving the stock price higher.  
  
Technology moat: UWMC invests heavily in IT infrastructure and technology. They develop all their technology with in-house developers. They have developed tools such as Blink+, UWM InTouch, and Brand 360 which enables them to have an industry-leading close time (almost twice as fast as Rocket and 3x as fast as the industry average)  
  
Short interest: While the company is in no way similar to some meme stock case in short interest (up to 140% which was a very rare event), it still is at 31% which is significantly higher than average. (source: fintel.io)  
  
NPS score: They currently have the happiest customers among their competition with an NPS score 16% higher than that of Rocket (which is at 2nd place).  
  
Risk and Competition  
  
75% of the mortgage volume was based on refinancing ($42.9B new mortgages, $139.3B refinancing). This is predominantly driven by declining mortgage rates. If the mortgage rates increase, then UWMC‚Äôs refinancing volume will take a significant hit bringing down their revenues.  
  
There is a lot of discussion around this being one of the reasons UWMC went public so as to capitalize on the refinance boom. I don‚Äôt completely buy this argument as company executives themselves are solidifying their position (Director of $UWMC just reported his SEC form 4, showing he more than doubled his own position on March 1st, from 50k to 110k shares).  
  
The full impact of UWMC‚Äôs CEO's surprise announcement that they wouldn‚Äôt work with mortgage brokers that work with Rocket or Fairway Independent Mortgage is still not clear. UWMC has said that the split will take effect from March 15th.  
  
Conclusion  
  
This is the first time in my experience that a trending stock that has solid fundamentals is generating revenue, is profitable, and has no debt. Although there are some risks in terms of mortgage rates and the surprise announcement, I think the current market conditions put UWMC in a very strong position as a long-term play."

Think about it, they raised a couple billion at more than double their current valuation. That's like a 50% off sale, no amount of low fixed rates on corporate debt beats eliminating debt at 50% your basis. 

I also bought VIAC because they have an incredible amount of content in their library and have shown more inent to monetize it than just about anyone else. Seriously, download Pluto TV. It's a free app structured to feel like cable, but with hundreds of channels dedicated to just streaming endless reruns of old CBS content from Hawaii Five O to the Adams Family to Survivor. This is the first old line content owner to offer a free access to their entire library while simply monetizing it with old school TV ads format. The question is really why haven't all the other old line media companies done something as simple as this. Pluto already has 50 million downloads and is growing rapidly. That's not to mention Paramount + making serious headway. 

It's just refreshing to see an old line company taking notes from disruptors and acting accordingly."

The hololens 2 is a massively unprofitable money pit right now. What it is now is the first baby steps of a mock up of the hololens. Computing will be migrated to data centers and streamed via packets to devices there‚Äôs 0 place for MVIS

Name an app exclusively for the hololens? Yeah you can‚Äôt there‚Äôs no fucking market for the hololens other than alpha prototypes illustrating the future.

 Not surprisingly, given the economy is still struggling with the current recovery,   ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù                               remains extremely weak. 

 The importance of *‚Äúweak confidence‚Äù* also affects the *‚Äúrisk‚Äù* business owners will take concerning capital expenditures, employment, and sales. **Importantly,¬†this is a** ***‚Äúsentiment‚Äù*** **based survey.** Such is a crucial concept to understand as ***‚Äúplanning‚Äù*** **to do something and** ***‚Äúdoing‚Äù*** **it can be very different.** 

 

### An Economic Boom Will Require Participation

Currently, many analysts expect a massive economic boom in 2021. The basis of those expectations is massive *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* demand as the economy reopens.

**I would agree with that expectation had there been no stimulus programs or expanded unemployment benefits.** Those inflows allowed individuals to spend during a recession where such would not usually be the case. Those artificial inputs dragged forward future or *‚Äúpent-up‚Äù* consumption into the present.

However, the NFIB survey also suggests much the same.

**Small businesses are susceptible to economic downturns and don‚Äôt have access to public markets for debt or secondary offerings. As such, they tend to focus heavily on operating efficiencies and profitability.**

**If businesses were expecting a massive surge in** ***‚Äúpent up‚Äù*** **demand, they would be doing several things to prepare for it.** Such includes planning to increase capital expenditures to meet expected demand. Unfortunately, those expectations peaked in 2018 and are dropping back to the March 2020 lows.

 

### Employment To Remain Weak

If small businesses think the economy is *‚Äúactually‚Äù* improving over the longer term, they would also be increasing employment. Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

To increase employment, which is the single most considerable cost to any business, you need two things:

1. *Confidence the economy is going to continue to grow in the future, which leads to;*
2. *The increase in the production of goods or services requiring increased employment to meet growing demand.*

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

 Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù*** ](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.** 

 

### The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9vqsosfkshz61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=d46a184ce87c222fc678ef69b207c8956ba94d17

 

While stimulus may lead to a short-term boost in consumption, the impact of higher taxes, more regulations, and weak employment growth will suppress consumption longer-term.

Despite economic headlines, the recovery of sales for small businesses has been less than *‚Äúbooming.‚Äù*

 

### A Recovery Versus An Expansion

With this background, it is easier to understand why the recent exuberance in chasing small-cap stocks may be premature. **While small-cap companies do historically perform well coming out of recession, the basis was an organic recovery cycle of increasing productivity.**

Currently, the run-up remains the assumption that the stimulus-fueled recovery is sustainable. **Such is only the case if the stimulus becomes a regular benefit and increases in size annually. However, since** [***deficit-based spending is deflationary***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/macroview-a-vaccine-and-the-new-new-normal/)***,***¬†the outcome will fall well short of expectations.

>*‚Äúin 1998, the Federal Reserve ‚Äúcrossed the ‚ÄòRubicon,‚Äô whereby lowering interest rates failed to stimulate economic growth or inflation as the ‚Äòdebt burden‚Äô detracted from it. When compared to the total debt of the economy, monetary velocity shows the problem facing the Fed.‚Äù*

 **Such is a critical point as it relates to small-cap companies given their high correlation to small-business confidence.** The correlation between the small-cap index (Russell 2000) and underlying confidence is very high. Given the annual change in ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù is declining, it is not surprising to see that small-cap stocks recently peaked. 

&#x200B;

### Conclusion

Given that debt-driven government spending programs have a dismal history of providing the economic growth promised, disappointment over the next year is almost a guarantee.

While there are indeed *‚Äúinflationary pressures‚Äù* short-term as the massive infusions, coupled with supply shortages and delivery bottlenecks, higher prices will erode purchasing power. The decline in purchasing power, combined with higher input costs, and potentially higher taxes, will continue to weigh on confidence near term.

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive.

**Most importantly, there is a massive difference between** ***‚Äúgetting back to even‚Äù*** **versus** ***‚Äúgrowing the economy.‚Äù*** **One creates economic prosperity by expanding production, which creates consumption. The other does not.**

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

Since Carter its like 10-12 times in San Diego. Many do not understand when they raise interest rates and or property taxes in could cut property values in half. But half the country does not own and cannot afford. So then they will be. If you think they care about your home values your sadly mistaken. Always have an exit strategy of money saved to bay an additional property when markets crash...  600K house 1% property tax and 300K house 2% property tax is same tax revenue for government.

2021-05-16 19:31:18,wallstreetbets,"A Farm crisis leads to bank debt (they try to cover losses in the market - can you say margin call?). Meanwhile, Americans are overspending and going into debt. Businesses are reinvesting profits into more supply, leading to reduced costs (which was great in the 20s, but everyone had spent so much on credit they couldn't keep the demand high). Oh and all the while the fed kept interest rates low to encourage  risky loans and supply side mechanics.   


Then Americans in debt stop purchasing so much (obvs), further driving down prices. Wages had been concentrated at the top so immigrants/poor labor couldn't continue to keep demand for goods high (and those poor farmers). Unemployment, bank crisis, run on banks (everybody has lost their money = no more purchases = cycle of despair).   


Fed realizes their mistake and raises interest rates (whoops, less money in a dangerous cycle that needs to increase demand). Protectionist policy in the Hawley-Smoot tariff, and bam depression.  


Hoover + FDR  begin interventions with the RFC, FDIC, SEC, and so many more. FDRs New Deal makes Americans feel a little better without stopping the Depression. Then the SS tax and some dipshit idea to balance a budget creates a recession in 1937. Enter John Maynard Keynes and the beautiful deficit spending (bonus, overseas war = even more deficit spending!!). Small post war recession then the baby boom, suburban America boom (god bless the levittown), and the 1950s. Cold War looms, but White Americans keep building houses and buying TVs. Everyone acts the same so they don't turn commie. Commies are so scary Americans start playing dominoes in Vietnam. Civil Rights movement ramps up too.    


Then in the 60s LBJ and Kennedy get us really into Vietnam. LBJ also wages a war on poor people, er, poverty, and builds his great society. But damn if that ain't expensive. In 1968 everyone dies. Then Nixon comes along and many Americans become disillusioned with society because wow the government (that had been helping since FDR and defeated the Nazis and faced down Stalin and put a man on the freakin' moon!) is actually bad sometimes. Disillusionment. Also detente and grain trade to China (yay for farmers!). Uh oh OPEC is a thing and all that CIA meddling and Israel support created some enemies. Inflation (damn you LBJ!). Production costs high. We produce less. Stagflation. Watergate, more disillusionment. A peanut farmer POTUS. A hostage crisis. Hippies. Soviets in Afghanistan. Grain embargo (uh oh farmers).   


Then suddenly, Reagan. Fed kills inflation with high rates. Deflation = recession. Its short. Except for farmers who get ass pounded and lose their land and those banks are in trouble. Mr. ""government is the problem"" uses government to solve the problem. Ag bills. More exports. NAFTA. ""It's the economy stupid."" The internet is a thing, then it isn't, then it is again. Hey do you want a house loan? Financial crisis. Don't we have an SEC for this? Keynes is resurrected. Bull market. Cough cough crash no jk recovery. You want some stimmy? Is this inflation out of control?   


Sorry I got lost in the sauce here."
2021-05-16 18:37:51,wallstreetbets,"**A lot**, but simply put? **Over-leveraged investors and businesses kicked the first domino and sent the whole economy into a spiral.** Also, farmers, but they're basically over-leveraged investors who sell corn instead of FDs... But that's not today's topic. 

Too much leverage and not enough capital is something we *definitely don't have to worry about today.* Banks **totally don't** have 3-4x more commercial loans than they did in 2019 with the same limited amount of capital. That is definitely not the same minuscule amount capital that had them fail multiple stress tests. 

Plus, it's not like commodities are being squeezed, lowering margins for businesses. Meanwhile, the government pays out obscene levels of unemployment which keeps laborers out of the market which can force these smaller businesses to reduce hours and make less profit... 

It's definitely not a perfect setup for businesses to implode and banks to be left holding a bill they can't pay. All while people FOMO into markets at ATH with money they can't afford to lose and buy homes for 50%+ more than they're worth. Oh, and don't forget Daddy Powell has a bloated balance sheet that he's desperately trying to keep from causing irreversible damage to our economic/banking systems. 

Oh, wait... I have 47 chromies, this is a perfect setup.

Just think about the GD banging the GFC and you'll have our next recession. I am calling it: **The Great REEcession.**"

2021-05-16 15:16:57,wallstreetbets,"At least u got mil to lose, please wanna flip 300 to make a mil"
2021-05-16 15:21:34,wallstreetbets,"I think your July calls might not make it. But your Jan 22 calls still have plenty of time, I would still hold. Dis isn't a meme stock like every other WSB stocks. You got this, just stay strong and üíé üß§"
2021-05-16 15:32:15,wallstreetbets,Did you double down after you already had a hard loss?
2021-05-16 15:37:47,wallstreetbets,I love how this sub proves time and time again that wealth is not indicative of intelligence.
2021-05-16 15:43:43,wallstreetbets,1mm worth of OTM calls? Welcome home retard
2021-05-16 15:44:57,wallstreetbets,Lot of money to lose.. maybe buy and hold next time. Buy shares and stop messing with options.
2021-05-16 15:45:05,wallstreetbets,Moin
2021-05-16 15:46:13,wallstreetbets,"You >Elon.

2021-05-16 15:54:08,wallstreetbets,Wsb has not had this kind of loss porn for a while
2021-05-16 15:54:59,wallstreetbets,Seems like you have way too much money to not be buying LEAPs
2021-05-16 15:55:22,wallstreetbets,You can afford it retard
2021-05-16 15:57:06,wallstreetbets,Congrats on your new flair
2021-05-16 15:57:35,wallstreetbets,"Probably hoping it goes up a decent amount to collect the premium. Let‚Äôs say it hits 250 in the next month or 2, he‚Äôll make some considerable gains. Disney is a juggernaut. People are fanatical about the park. You have to reserve 2 months in advance for Disneyland. There merchandise flies off the shelf. Movies are killing it. Streaming service on fire. Parks, cruises, they have ESPN, abc, Hulu and won an Oscar for nomadland."
2021-05-16 16:01:40,wallstreetbets,"IF you have a million bucks, wouldn't you rather buy the stock?"
2021-05-16 16:04:33,wallstreetbets,Disney be hittin with that reverse uno card all the time on ER
2021-05-16 16:05:09,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve been invested in dis for a while now seeing as they have 4 movies releasing in the fall and ticket revenues are going to skyrocket with the Mask restrictions being lifted
2021-05-16 16:08:45,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôll give you credit for betting on the mouse
2021-05-16 16:13:22,wallstreetbets,Dis guy
2021-05-16 16:14:29,wallstreetbets,I won't know what to stream once I finish watching all the Marvel content. It is not coming fast enough. I think people consume D+ content much faster than they release it. I think there is big retention in subscribers from families because we all know children can rewatch the same content over and over again.
2021-05-16 16:15:58,wallstreetbets,Sexy.  Very sexy.
2021-05-16 16:26:01,wallstreetbets,"While many here clearly seem to disagree, I don‚Äôt think dumping those calls was necessarily a bad idea. Doubt those July calls would make it in before the expiry. Not sure about January, but lots of doubt there as well.

Retarted play, nonetheless, sir."
2021-05-16 17:18:03,wallstreetbets,"Good for you getting out of these. Imagined it 200+ at this point already too, not crazy to get out now and choose something else.

Made big $ on dis puts early covid, lost nearly all those gains on too-early calls on the way up"
2021-05-16 17:25:07,wallstreetbets,Disney+ is trash... you woulda known that if you signed up lol
2021-05-16 17:33:53,wallstreetbets,"Is dis real?   Why would you toss away long dated calls like that.  Parks are reopening.  Shits gonna be a madhouse at the parks.   People want in to Disney so bad they can raise prices by 20-30 dollars a ticket and it will still sell out.  Charge 6 bucks for churros lol.  Over reaction I think, rage sold?"
2021-05-16 17:39:11,wallstreetbets,"Why did you bet on the mouse, of all things? Shit was overvalued on D+ hype."
2021-05-16 17:42:05,wallstreetbets,Did you close the position?
2021-05-16 18:56:58,wallstreetbets,Stock investing isn't about YOLO. It's about research. It's also undermining the geniuses of WSB when people keep posting massive losses (which people like myself predicted) for the apes who blindly followed the lead & had no plan. They are laughing at us & already have plans to take the rest of the wealth from us. The once good deeds that were going on here are long dead. It's nothing more than lemmings jumping off a cliff with zero investment knowledge.
2021-05-16 18:58:11,wallstreetbets,Where the fuck are people getting the kind of money for these ridiculous investments?
2021-05-16 18:59:28,wallstreetbets,Hindsight is always 20/20.  Smarter thing would be to buy 1M worth of DIS stock then sell covered calls against it.
2021-05-16 19:01:14,wallstreetbets,"I bought call options on friday, I still think Disneys an undervalued recovery stock. Once people are back to traveling and in theaters,Dis will rebound."
2021-05-16 19:04:46,wallstreetbets,I wish I was this stupid.
2021-05-16 19:11:22,wallstreetbets,We're proud of you son.
2021-05-16 19:23:32,wallstreetbets,300c for 7/16 is nuts.  200c will gigaprint though.
2021-05-16 19:24:10,wallstreetbets,Ouch. Funny enough I have the exact same calls lol so I‚Äôm with ya. Definitely not at all with that volume tho
2021-05-16 19:26:45,wallstreetbets,All I saw is 420. Nice
2021-05-16 19:30:24,wallstreetbets,"Anybody else think some of these are fake? He sold way too early with summer coming and parks fully reopening.

His story on how he made all his money on WSB doesn‚Äôt make sense either. I know some people have infinite cash to spend but some of these outrageous ones lately seem suspect like that two guys doing $800 call options on GME"
2021-05-16 10:44:52,wallstreetbets,"Yo, my dude.  
How old are you?  


Im just curious as to how fucked you are from losing a mil."
2021-05-16 10:09:03,wallstreetbets,You have what is termed 'big balls' to do this trade and realise the loss. No doubt you will turn things around on another bet.
2021-05-16 11:27:08,wallstreetbets,"You really really hate money, don't you? Like the very existence of the ""$"" symbol is highly offensive to you."
2021-05-16 13:58:07,wallstreetbets,"Betting on Disney isn't a good move imo. They seem to be bent on destroying all of their franchises to please very small but vocal groups. See star wars and the future of marvel. I think billion dollar blockbusters are a thing of the past for them until they course correct. 

Also Disney plus growth was as probably as good as its ever going to get with the pandemic, and I don't see the park traffic rebounding as strong as people forsee."
2021-05-16 14:41:58,wallstreetbets,"I dont like DIS. Thats like Nintento, ‚Äúold trash‚Äù doing good cause of high fanbase. DIS streaming the worst out there and not worth 5$ a month üôà"
2021-05-16 14:45:24,wallstreetbets,He's thinking Disneyland is reopening everywhere and will rocket back when people start throwing their money away at the mouse death cult again.
2021-05-16 15:32:10,wallstreetbets,"Someone forgot to tell the OP to Only YOLO on GME
So now Mickey gets 2 commas GME don‚Äôt. This is not the way.ü¶ç"
2021-05-16 16:04:24,wallstreetbets,"Get woke go broke is gonna hit Disney's bottom line, half the damn country doesn't like their politics.m. and maybe 1/4 of those actually afford and par take in Disney.  That's not a small number for a new streaming service

Just my 2 cents, figure your own as I am a certified fucking idiot"
2021-05-16 16:20:05,wallstreetbets,disney is hemorraging money because they jumped on the woke train
2021-05-16 19:23:51,wallstreetbets,Disney fucking up with woke sjw crap! That is why!

2021-05-16 11:54:22,wallstreetbets,"I am curious about the thought process : when people risk large amounts on Options , do they realise that 90% of options expire worthless ? Do they realise they are essentially gambling the money or do they feel they are making an ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù ?"

2021-05-16 13:07:29,wallstreetbets,"The 220 calls seem a little farfetched, but the 200s still seem like they would be possible. On expiration day, Disney would have to hit about 216 to break even, ~220 for a 40% profit. I would think that there are worse bets than 30% growth in 8 months when Disney is in a big reopening swing, but I guess you never know what the future will bring. It definitely seemed a lot more feasible when Disney was flying to the 200s months ago."

2021-05-16 15:23:35,wallstreetbets,Disney is a garbage stock.  It's way overvalued at $170-$180 and will be just bleeding over the next months.  I'd buy Disney at $120 but preferably less than that.  Below $110 is a good buy.

A month later it reported earnings and slipped below 180 with further to fall

There is no competitive advantage to Disney+ streaming other than the titles available, which earnings show isn‚Äôt enough to rear this horse into action

Future reopening potential has had no positive impact in stock price

TLDR I get it"

Disney retail store employees are considered stockholders in their books. My fianc√© who works at one said they plan to increase product pricing to be closer to park pricing, while also working towards closing retail stores and focus on eCommerce.
I‚Äôm about as smooth brain as it gets, but to me it sounds a lot like they are OK with the idea of liquidating that retail side with how much loss they had from parks being closed.

If someone could kindly correct me or add anything I‚Äôd much appreciate it!"

2021-05-16 15:37:26,wallstreetbets,"I mean, this is not a bad thesis.  In fact, it happened-- Disney literally jumped from ~120 to ~170 when the vaccine appeared.

Did you hold too long after the recovery bump?  I'm still confused how you lost money here."
2021-05-16 11:48:58,wallstreetbets,"Im long disney as well, I believe in them and personally feel they will be the first trillion dollar entertainment company but it will just take time thats all"
2021-05-16 14:38:24,wallstreetbets,"Just out of interest, what factors made you so sure covid would be done by now in order for you to wager such a steep bet on a favourable outcome?"
2021-05-16 12:02:31,wallstreetbets,"Trust the mouse but don't be a retard. 

Dude, it is a 300 billion dollar company that was built literally a century ago. Stupid valuation doesn't apply to boomer companies. This is like saying because GM or F touched EV so they might get TSLA valuation. You can't expect Dis+ to take on the DVD giant Netflix who has been sharpening their trade for close to decades in mere months. FUCK DIDN'T YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED TO QUILBI!!

But then again this is what your wife would tell you. I am just here to say, ""there there it's going to be okay."""
2021-05-16 16:17:27,wallstreetbets,"Am a Floridian, Florida never really shut down, no lockdown measures and still plenty of tourism. Disney parks are open. Sorry about the loss"
2021-05-16 12:45:48,wallstreetbets,"My dude, any reasonable analysis of Disney‚Äôs financials would produce an unquestionable fact: while Disney is a healthy company, their stock price is inflated beyond all recognition.  Price to average free cash flow  is absolutely off the charts.  Disney‚Äôs stock price had nowhere to go but down."
2021-05-16 15:42:12,wallstreetbets,"You should be fine long term I think 50% of tik tok is people at Disney this week or paid sponsorships with influencers and celebrities. 

The amount of Disney addicts that will go in the next few months will be record breaking"
2021-05-16 12:29:07,wallstreetbets,"You dumped the jan 21 calls? I bought some puts before earnings last week after seeing netflix puke (i wasn't convinced by dis+ subs and i  knew arpu would be shit)......that said, the jan 21 srike is 200....it'll be ITM by then"
2021-05-16 14:30:11,wallstreetbets,Dis will never be netflix's valuation when most of netflix's subscribers are outside of US and netflix is constantly making international dramas / films.
2021-05-16 12:48:45,wallstreetbets,"I used to think the same with my investing philosophy. However, it‚Äôll serve you well understanding that an overvalued company like Netflix (growth stock) can‚Äôt be looked at as a comparable when looking at another growth stock like Disney. Netflix may be overvalued and Disney fair value but undervalued compared to overvalued Netflix. This rally has been nuts and although it may work in the short term, not a good way to invest long term. 

Speaking of which, will be interesting to see how good of an ‚Äúinvestor‚Äù everyone will still be when equities cool down to something sustainable."
2021-05-16 14:01:36,wallstreetbets,"Assuming COVID would end only months after a vaccine rollout with prominent anti vaccine / anti mask conspiracies and most countries undersupplied is possibly the second most quintessential definition of WSB I have seen

And I realize the competition is fierce

Yes Disney is probably a good buy but calls inherently involve timing the market - even if you plan to eventually trade them

Also, Disney notoriety is incredibly high so you have to gamble that a majority of people participating in the market have not predicted the same growth

If you have this money to yolo hit me up in PMs and I‚Äôll do suggestions just for opportunity to prove myself"
2021-05-16 14:52:12,wallstreetbets,Proof: You can bet against the mouse
2021-05-16 15:06:29,wallstreetbets,Disney+'s growth isn't as organic as you may think. I recently stopped working for Verizon but I can tell you the disney+/hulu/ESPN subscription package is bundled into the plans they push on people (esspecially those who needed more data or better unlimited for covid) which gave disney+ a huge subscription basis coming out of the gate. If they had to do it the way netflix did they wouldn't be half of what they are.
2021-05-16 15:22:12,wallstreetbets,Dude for $100k I could have told you there was zero chance COVID would be ‚Äúover‚Äù by now.
2021-05-16 15:37:01,wallstreetbets,"Lol that wouldn‚Äôt happen in a year, if that was the thought process you have to wait like 5-8 years. You should have just bought stocks and waited.

Edit: the thing you overlooked about Netflix growth compared to Dis+ , is that when Netflix debuted, it was one of the only movie streaming sites of its kind. Dis+ launched at a time when the market is saturated and many options exist, the growth isn‚Äôt going to be as quick. 

I still think long term you are right, it will grow tremendously."
2021-05-16 15:47:08,wallstreetbets,"Numbers prob included all the free trials

And I‚Äôm sure many sigh up watch for a month and cancel with all of our streaming options we spend more time scrolling than watching"
2021-05-16 17:10:40,wallstreetbets,The calls were good till January right? They may not have been bad to hang on to but I get counting your losses at a certain point
2021-05-16 17:11:43,wallstreetbets,How much of that is priced in tho
2021-05-16 17:15:02,wallstreetbets,Yeah expiry was just off by a year
2021-05-16 18:58:08,wallstreetbets,DIS is already valued higher than NFLX...
2021-05-16 19:12:01,wallstreetbets,Now tell me how does this translate into a higher stock price.
2021-05-16 19:30:23,wallstreetbets,You may have been early but you‚Äôre not wrong.
2021-05-16 19:36:12,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs the lesson? Buy the stock because it doesn‚Äôt expire and you don‚Äôt have to pick a strike.
2021-05-16 19:38:51,wallstreetbets,"Btw, I too learned this lesson the hard way. Cost me $10k tho not $1mm."
2021-05-16 14:13:28,wallstreetbets,idiot not even realizing how overvalued DIS was lol
2021-05-16 14:11:05,wallstreetbets,"Tried Dis+ for free from a provider and stopped using within a few days. Just doesn‚Äôt have all that much, pretty nostalgic but I can‚Äôt see how it could‚Äôve overtaken the Flix"
2021-05-16 14:01:09,wallstreetbets,Idk I pay for Netflix and say fuck Disney. And I have a 1 year old. More room to fall.
2021-05-16 12:22:28,wallstreetbets,Have you ever used dis+? Never be at Netflix levels.  It sucks. Doesn't have crap on it.
2021-05-16 12:41:47,wallstreetbets,Disney is $100 billion more than Netflix
2021-05-16 13:12:26,wallstreetbets,You thought liberals would have ever let go of Covid? You think Gavin Newsom is the type of guy who would just hand back control to the people that quickly? You bet a million that? Man I wish I could have taken your bet.
2021-05-16 13:05:09,wallstreetbets,"If you still believe in the thesis, why don't you just reroll the calls, same strike, later expiration.  A $200 C, Jan 2023 is only a 10% premium over the current price."
2021-05-16 13:07:42,wallstreetbets,"Betting around DIS' all-time high in an already all-time high, propped-up market is one bold move.  I woulda wished you luck but you already sold them?


People will definitely be pouring money back into Disney this summer-- both the stock and the parks/products. They're already lifting mask requirements."
2021-05-16 13:40:16,wallstreetbets,Instead of YOLO! You could have paid for inside information on dis+ subscriptions raised or not! Which is exactly what investors were looking for. And then you should have YOLO
2021-05-16 14:15:24,wallstreetbets,"At&t deal with Discovery coming. Still I got your point but too much money on a single position, unless you're some rich dude n u got cash, otherwise just go n work for Wendy's"

2021-05-16 15:03:09,wallstreetbets,Shouldn't you have held? Since Covid will eventually end
2021-05-16 15:18:04,wallstreetbets,Couldn‚Äôt you just roll them in 2023 leaps?
2021-05-16 15:28:33,wallstreetbets,"The word ""eventually"" should never play into your short term options theses."
2021-05-16 16:46:32,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm with you here bud. I had the same theory when quarantine hit and Disney+ was launching. It was about 100 or so and I have thought for a while I missed the jump. Thanks for your input; now I know I‚Äôm not the only one this retarded!
2021-05-16 17:03:00,wallstreetbets,"You are forgetting that close to 30% of its profits are from cable , cord cutting is slowly killing its cable business and Espn cable revenues per subscriber (+ ads) is more than espn plus so it cannot simply replace them. Plus cost for tv contracts for sports are skyrocketing while ratings are sagging (see nba). 

Fact that it‚Äôs over 20% above its Feb 20 highs makes me think it‚Äôs highly overvalued. We will see a correction once we reopen and earnings start disappointing"
2021-05-16 17:04:42,wallstreetbets,"Why would you think the vid would be over now? The cdc predicted back in January 2020 that it would easily last into August 2021, and realistically into December 2021.

I'm just curious how you got to that conclusion"
2021-05-16 17:06:17,wallstreetbets,"I have the same thesis, but bought shares."
2021-05-16 17:07:42,wallstreetbets,">after Covid

I really hope you profit from this trade, but there is no before covid - after covid, is a gradual transition."

2021-05-16 17:16:23,wallstreetbets,Have you seen the shows they put out?  The Mandolorian was the only good show they had to carry the channel.  All this new Marvel stuff can't keep a retards attention and its all super woke nonesense.
2021-05-16 17:16:54,wallstreetbets,No one actually pays for Disney+
2021-05-16 18:31:27,wallstreetbets,So no math and just assumptions and hopes?
2021-05-16 18:37:10,wallstreetbets,I think Covid is over so Dis+ slowed is what happened
2021-05-16 18:37:58,wallstreetbets,From someone who lives in florida last night was the first night that felt normal since the start. Our local town center had a packed lawn for some cover band and not a mask in sight. Hopefully this is a glimpse of what is to come. Also orlando is lifting its outdoor mask policy. When we went there a few months ago they had employees everywhere ensuring everyone outside was masked.
2021-05-16 18:46:00,wallstreetbets,Can you invest in me? I‚Äôm a good analyst with backup setups.
2021-05-16 19:49:21,wallstreetbets,Ah.  I should have let you know we canceled our subscription because nobody was watching anything on Disney+.  Pretty much just the mandalorian
2021-05-16 13:44:56,wallstreetbets,Fuck your thesis bro. You lost a million dollars on a fuckin yolo. Daddys money?
2021-05-16 13:54:10,wallstreetbets,Are you saying you exercised the options? Trying to figure out the math on this and it hurts my head.
2021-05-16 14:47:32,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre a moron masquerading as someone capable of generating a real thesis
2021-05-16 14:57:49,wallstreetbets,"> I thought COVID would be over by now

You are retarded"
2021-05-16 16:38:38,wallstreetbets,"The problem with your thesis is that this stock didn‚Äôt take a hit due to COVID. The smart play would‚Äôve be when it dipped to $100 during March of last year. 

$170 looks good during a bull market. Everything looks good during a bull market. 

You‚Äôre now hedging that it will go above $170 price point? It‚Äôs already bloated. In a bear market this stock maybe sees $70-$80

It‚Äôs definitely overinflated."

You can collect between $15k to $35k per month on premium alone. Roll it over for more shares to compound gains, or use that cash for some fun money on your wacky far otm options. BABA is a top 10 hedge fund favorite for this, and top 10 hedge fund stocks return an average of 250% per 5 year range. Being rich doesn't mean it doesn't hurt to lose money, but OP YOU GOT THIS."

You want to recover these losses quickly and that means riskier positions. You do this and it‚Äôs all gone, odds are very much against you. Don‚Äôt do this. You still have enough left to profit from solid, conservative strategies. Do this immediately and even if it takes a year or more, you will end up recovering all of this loss.

2021-05-16 16:13:12,wallstreetbets,Bought in around 180 in February on the thought that COVID was about over and Dis+ was crushing it.  Went up to 200 then trading down 0.5% every day for 3 months straight. Decided I was going to hold through ER to see what the Dis+ numbers looked like.  Numbers weren‚Äôt as strong as I would have liked and COVID has a long tail so I decided to take the L.  I kept shares.  Probably will get back into 23 LEAPS when I see the momentum go.

2021-05-16 13:08:25,wallstreetbets,"Not going to happen. They have no solid ad revenue pipeline even after the Hulu deal (used to work at Hulu during the acquisition). Disney+ doesn‚Äôt have the long term content pipeline to support it, and user growth will eventually die down once people are back in the office. Plus they don‚Äôt have the back catalog of shows like Peakcock or HBOMax. Theme parks may do well, but it‚Äôs nullified by ESPN constantly hemorrhaging money due to bad sports licensing deals they‚Äôve overpaid for. 

If Netflix couldn‚Äôt do it with relatively low overhead compared to Disney and billions in content deals over the next 10 years, and an already established international content network, and tons of awards for their stuff, I don‚Äôt think Disney is going to pull it off.  Entertainment is an industry of diminishing returns over time. It‚Äôs just not mathematically possible.

ETA: so many salty Disney fuckbois in this thread. No wonder this sub has gone to the cunts."
2021-05-16 14:45:47,wallstreetbets,In February when I got these it looked like COVID was coming to an end.  I assumed the whole world had vaccine when in reality it was just ‚ÄòMurica.  Then India started getting obliterated.  I decided to hold because I thought Dis+ numbers would be redeeming.  Turned out I was wrong.  So now it looks like we are at the tail end of COVID but who knows it could keep going on and affecting the stock. I still have shares because I still think the thesis is intact but it‚Äôs going to take some time to play out.
2021-05-16 12:41:16,wallstreetbets,NFLX subscriber growth is already slowing. And Disney is at half their subs at a period of time when they cannot expand on their IPs. It's a matter of time
2021-05-16 12:17:22,wallstreetbets,"You're an idiot for comparing Quibi to Disney. Like you said, Disney was built a century ago, they have the one of the largest, if not THE largest amount of IP in the industry which they can immediately put on their platform. With all the new competitors popping up, Netflix is losing many of the shows that made them popular in the first place, and so are having to rely on putting out Netflix originals to hope to keep their base satiated. Disney has incredibly deep pockets, and support from multiple generations of consumers based on nostalgia factors."
2021-05-16 13:09:59,wallstreetbets,"> YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED TO QUILBI!!

what the hell is a quilbi"
2021-05-16 12:25:09,wallstreetbets,"That you're saying Netflix should be valued more than Disney just proves how retarded you are
Whole different target group - Netflix and chill ya for how fucking long ? Enjoy those 10years in your 20s where you binge that shit every day after already spending 20years crying about Mufasa dying and wondering why no Prince picked you up. After forgetting condoms in your Netflix and chill times it's also back to watching Cinderella for another couple years if you even have the time for it. Oh and by the way by the time you're 80 you'll also be happy you'll have a movie character you can relate to with your stupid Alzheimer potato brain üêü"
2021-05-16 13:52:40,wallstreetbets,I have f for the long term. TSLA shouldn't be valued as high as they are. As a company there actually piss poor. I can't think of another company that has not followed through on so many things and still had such a strong revenue.
2021-05-16 16:18:10,wallstreetbets,Still too many restrictions plus cruises need to come back as that‚Äôs a large part of their revenue
2021-05-16 16:01:05,wallstreetbets,Isn't it off the charts for every major stock?
2021-05-16 16:01:22,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm not holding these anymore.  It could continue to trade sideways for a while and there are probably better places for the money, like in the hands of my wife‚Äôs boyfriend.  Might get back into 23 LEAPS once I see some momentum."
2021-05-16 16:14:42,wallstreetbets,I have shares as well that I am holding long term.  I think dis is still due for a pop but probably closer to end of the year.  Might get 23 LEAPS after I think about it some more.
2021-05-16 15:52:13,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, got biffed by the initial numbers and now the hangover started to set in"
2021-05-16 19:33:36,wallstreetbets,I think so.  I‚Äôm keeping shares.  A lot of them.  I may get back into 23 LEAPS once I see positive momentum and/or COVID ends.
2021-05-16 16:47:15,wallstreetbets,Yeah wait until your 1 year old is 3 or 4.
2021-05-16 11:56:07,wallstreetbets,"So let me get this straight...

You got really lucky and went from making $17/hr to being a millionaire inside of a year, and instead of saying ""yeah...that's probably good enough"" and...I dunno...going to school, or traveling, or sticking it in some Boomer shit and taking $50k+/yr for free forever...you...YOLO'd it on DIS?

And I thought I was retarded...you truly do belong here! I hope your luck included another million or two."
2021-05-16 13:26:12,wallstreetbets,Shut the fuck up you lying bastard.
2021-05-16 11:48:39,wallstreetbets,So you have a gambling addiction is what you‚Äôre saying.
2021-05-16 13:06:09,wallstreetbets,Liar. Shame on you for pretending to be a front line worker.
2021-05-16 13:15:59,wallstreetbets,Are you really from New York and have a couple millions of dollars? How can I do that as well ?
2021-05-16 12:15:15,wallstreetbets,If you head across the street to the Wendy's I'll reserve a spot for you at the dumpster and take you under my wing
2021-05-16 14:48:07,wallstreetbets,Yeah no.

2021-05-16 13:10:13,wallstreetbets,"Probably the same behaviour but it was successful lol. YOLO'd stupid amounts into options while the market was at an all-time low, or maybe on GME or another meme stock before the premiums were driven up"

2021-05-16 12:23:36,wallstreetbets,"Why does everyone believe OP works at Arby‚Äôs lol. Look at post history, he‚Äôs said he owns multiple properties in NYC and makes high income. This was definitely money he made off wsb last year and didn‚Äôt care too much about."
2021-05-16 11:23:28,wallstreetbets,You guys are close.  Started an options account last year and traded based almost solely on the DD here.  The account made 8 figures.  Looks like I‚Äôm giving some of that back.

2021-05-16 11:49:10,wallstreetbets,Yeah listen to this dude - you work at Arby‚Äôs but have 300k available for investing. Use that money to change your life by investing conservatively - don‚Äôt waste it all & live with regret
2021-05-16 11:46:09,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs worked very well in the past

2021-05-16 19:34:40,wallstreetbets,Problem for me is 50% down is still 300k which is good money
2021-05-16 14:06:11,wallstreetbets,Really depends on how many mills you have to begin with
2021-05-16 14:27:04,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôd bet that there are equally as many professional traders here as there are GME yolo‚Äôers. Jim Cramer himself reads and reacts to WSB. Not everything is as it seems, my friend. Some of us actually win more than we lose."

2021-05-16 14:13:56,wallstreetbets,"All this talk about Dis+ subs and nobody mentioning the Mandalorian. That was easily it's main driver in recent past. They have to keep up with that or else people won't give a shit. Their other content on there, a lot of it is mostly niche to Disney obsessives, which we can all agree are a weird and small group of people"
2021-05-16 14:08:12,wallstreetbets,"There is already a million companies and small businesses ripping off Mickey, Goofy, Donald, etc. Go to any community surrounding one of their parks and you will see millions of dollars in unlicensed merchandise in every souvenirs store, gas station, Food establishments.....they all rip off Disney and they are still huge. They make wayyyy more dough off the new features like frozen. Check etsy as well and tell me the thousands of mickey and Minnie shirts on there are officially licensed."
2021-05-16 13:15:03,wallstreetbets,I disagree. Theres a reason Disney isn't lobbying to extend the copyright protection laws anymore. The amount they make off the mouse is dwindling quickly. Its such a small part of their brand these days its not worth fighting over anymore imo
2021-05-16 14:27:27,wallstreetbets,"It's a lot more complicated than that.

The copyright protection on the derivative works continues from the time such works were written. So Steamboat Willie can enter the public domain, but Goofy, Donald Duck, Minnie Mouse and others don't spring into public use at the same time. Likewise the Fantasia story and other famous stories will still be protected. And frankly Mickey and Friends are a modest part of Disney's IP portfolio (compare, Star Wars, Marvel, all Disney produced Pixar properties, all Disney-Princesses).

Disney also maintains trademarks on all these characters, so while you could tell a Mickey Mouse story in 2023, you couldn't use the three-circle Disney mouse head to market it. On top of that, ""famous"" marks, like Mickey, have brand-tarnishment protection, so no legal production of Rule 34 Mickey Mouse art can easily come into being (there are some untested legal defenses here, but litigation would be very expensive)."
2021-05-16 15:13:58,wallstreetbets,"Don‚Äôt worry, they will still find ways to sue Instagram bootleggers that make a few thousand bucks a year."
2021-05-16 13:04:43,wallstreetbets,How would they lose that copyright?
2021-05-16 14:09:42,wallstreetbets,"I think if Disney lost that protection it might be an amazing opportunity to buy after the panic

It depends on WHERE that protection is timed

Mickey going to the public domain might arguably be a net benefit and free advertising.  Unless he got Peped.  Some other properties no."
2021-05-16 14:57:54,wallstreetbets,Isn‚Äôt that for just the Steamboat Willie version of Mickey though?  I thought I read the current iteration still has decades of protection.
2021-05-16 15:09:09,wallstreetbets,U can‚Äôt Fcuk w/ da üê≠ Walt will rise from his grave
2021-05-16 16:29:17,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs never going to happen.
2021-05-16 17:49:57,wallstreetbets,"No they can't? If they lose copyright on steamboat willie, this does not mean that Mickey stops being a Trademark. Trademarks have protections as long as they are being actively used by a company. People will be able to distribute steamboat willie for free and openly, but everyone being able to make mickey mouse cartoons is highly in doubt"
2021-05-16 18:15:15,wallstreetbets,">hat forever++ sweetheart protection in Congress for Mickey Mouse and other ancient IP

Just taught a class on public domain and creativity. Those laws are written so well, that once they are done screwing over the original creators, they can unscrew their heirs and have even longer.

They are never losing. It's fucked up, but Disney is a prominent part of my portfolio, so..."
2021-05-16 19:45:22,wallstreetbets,You have proven to be a retard. Welcome.
2021-05-16 14:55:52,wallstreetbets,I hope that this happens for sure just because f us copyright law
2021-05-16 18:43:12,wallstreetbets,I think there are better trades out there.
2021-05-16 13:13:10,wallstreetbets,yeah the only way it makes that valuation is if inflation forces it and you wind up not even being able to buy a soda for what disney is going for now.
2021-05-16 12:51:31,wallstreetbets,Within 5 years
2021-05-16 13:48:04,wallstreetbets,2024 if hyperinflation hits.
2021-05-16 13:46:56,wallstreetbets,They have Fox and Marvel. They have more content then they know what to do with.
2021-05-16 13:35:50,wallstreetbets,"We also need to take into account, with covid, people couldn‚Äôt travel, they could buy a camper and go places though, in my area it‚Äôs very hard to find a good used camper, or a brand new one that isn‚Äôt bought the day it‚Äôs delivered to the dealer. People get out more now than they ever have, and they do things as family, leaving the tv behind at home. At least here in the Midwest this has been happening, covid sucked but it brought a lot more families together for activities. I just don‚Äôt think that travel and tv will ever be the same again..... not financial advice, just an opinion"

2021-05-16 13:10:48,wallstreetbets,"In 25 yrs, we can be certain Disney will be a major conglomerate of entertainment. I am not confident Netflix will be as big a player in the market as it is now. 

Almost every entertainment company is starting their own service. Netflix could be left with little content outside their own library and small independent studios. It‚Äôs why they are spending so much on original content. They see that writing on the wall and are adjusting to their credit. Disney could operate D+ at a loss to kill off competitors. Netflix can‚Äôt. We are just now entering the streaming wars and Netflix isn‚Äôt in the strongest position, but not the weakest either."
2021-05-16 16:44:57,wallstreetbets,It's hella inflated because of 2 shows
2021-05-16 12:23:05,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. That is all the reason why Disney is a boomer company, stable revenue, strong portfolio, etc... 

Netflix is a tech company and disruptor and that is what commands its huge valuation.

The difference is quite stark and that is why you cannot apply this logic."
2021-05-16 13:47:17,wallstreetbets,that's the point
2021-05-16 16:22:49,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôll get in with 100k either this coming week after the feds, or wait till they release the next inflation figures. I‚Äôm prob gonna hold onto it for 10 years."

 ""I live in NYC as well, have very high income, and bought a couple properties in gentrifying areas in BK. I intend to buy a vacation home upstate most likely before I even consider buying a condo in manhattan. While I can afford to buy something in NYC, to me it seems ridiculous that I would pay a few mil and not even get anywhere near my dream property."""

2021-05-16 17:40:57,wallstreetbets,"Given the Mando is probably one of the only new things Dis has dropped lately that was genuinely good.

I wouldn't touch that company with a 10ft pole. They might be getting kudos from various little niche groups for being 'diverse' and 'inclusive' and all that -- but fundamentally, most of their new projects are failing because they still haven't figured out that character growth is necessary for a good story. and if your boilerplate approach to diverse and female characters is that they aren't allowed to fail... those characters have no growth potential.

this single point is exactly what ruined star wars, captain marvell, the mulan remake......  and I see no clear signs that this tone-deaf titanic of a company will stop being offended long enough to realize what they're doing wrong.

as such, i have low expectations. the only way they maintain worth is by already owning a bunch of popular content they bought. like the MCU. if you think they're going to turn around and keep making the kind of content that made the MCU a success in the first place, you're more optimistic than I am.

HBO, Netflix and even Prime have far better original content pouring in, and they're making it faster than Disney. I see a lot of D+ cancellations in the future. Mando is probably the only reason a lot of subscribers are still hanging on, and if the company execs get their way and neuter the mando creative team, it'll tip over faster than Doctor Who.

Thems my reasons. Nope. 10ft pole insufficient."

2021-05-16 14:47:51,wallstreetbets,"Sure, that's the big ""recent"" offering and one of their biggest new IP. How they handle Star Wars movies and spin-offs will be a huge focus for sure and I'm guessing they're calculating and maximizing merchandise and box office returns.   


And the next season will be episodic and likely lock people in for a good \~3 months who want to see it.   


I have a subscription but cancel it each month then renew when I want to watch again, saves some money if I don't use it for a week or whatnot.   


The thing Disney+ provides and arguably their market is the obsessives (but it is flat per month) and parents with kids. There's no way they'll reach Netflix level coverage with their vault offerings + Mando alone so they're fairly capped on subscribers.   


Now that's really not a huge issue because they have a ton of different income streams: release movies, merch, the parks and now the digital side (but they were making money licensing before so.. not sure if that's a net gain but likely smart for the future)."

Netflix could add Mickey as a main character in a more than satirical role for a kids show. Actual major toy manufacturers (that are making those official dolls) can make and freely import them and they're no longer subject to seizure.   


They'll be on Amazon legally without Disney lawyers going after them like wolves. Not a giant overnight change but certainly something they'd rather not have happen."

Disney probably won't fight it this time, now that they're so much more vertically integrated and in danger of getting treated like a monopoly, but there will  be some kind of dirty trick in the next decade when Superman and Batman start going into public domain."
2021-05-16 13:15:53,wallstreetbets,It falls into public domain. They keep lobbying the government to push back public domain time frames and the government keeps complying. Eventually it won't get pushed back any more and will become public domain.

2021-05-16 15:58:17,wallstreetbets,"But the problem is they don‚Äôt own a lot of original property. What may have been broadcast on fox doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôll be able to stream it unless it was produced by fox or they‚Äôve bought the rights. And while they have marvel that‚Äôs a pretty niche subset of the viewing audience. Just because endgame and infinity war blew it out of the water box office, that doesn‚Äôt always translate into continued streaming success. And since churn will continue to grow as more people end up back in the office, people cut down on their steaming services."
2021-05-16 15:59:48,wallstreetbets,"Agreed (not sure why you‚Äôre getting downvoted). Getting people back into a theater is going to be a tough thing and going to the movies is ingrained in us.

The tyrany of a la cart will have already been realized. In that time, people will have grown tired of maintaining 15 different accounts and apps and setting up all the sub-accounts and content filtering for their husbands/wives/children, as well as the platform compatibility limitations (oh the Logo app isn't available on the new Playstation 77XL yet, we'll have to use the iPhone stream-through so you can watch Drag Race: Elderly Edition - Season 4 on the Samsung 32K Holojector), and the companies will have realized that maintaining the dev teams and infra seems needlessly expensive when we can let this 3rd party that other people are using do it for a fraction of the cost. Nevermind the fallout from data leaks and hacks that will eventually come out of the woeful security practices currently in place.

I am not saying DIS is a bad company. Not at all. But DIS is a late bloomer. You can say, DIS took NFLX as a proof of concept for the streaming business but they acted too little too late.

Lol.     
      
Edit: downvotes lack perspective. Without that copyright extension, DIS would have Winnie the Pooh, Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Calvin and Hobbes, Curious George, Mr. Rogers,...thousands upon thousands of IPs. They lose a mouse that everyone already associates with their brand. Oh, no üò±üôÑ [Also, the original trademarks on Mickey and all of those expire soon anyway.](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/01/a-whole-years-worth-of-works-just-fell-into-the-public-domain/) Disney isn't doing anything about it for good reason.

The semiconductor shortage will work itself out in due course, so that‚Äôs a non-issue longer-term.

And a lot of the time when you buy movies or rent say Redbox or so you just wind up annoyed when you see it was on a service and you paid for nothing. Like i still have guardians of the galaxy 2 sealed cause i liked it enough to buy it then pissed when Netflix got it so fast anyway i guess.

2021-05-16 18:28:50,wallstreetbets,"They have a niche for tv viewing audiences, which is what I‚Äôm talking about. Comic book shows, as a genre, have a niche audience. Movies are an entirely different audience model altogether. 

Further while the shows may have high viewership from their audiences, there is no guarantee these shows produce greater subscriber signups, and in fact subscriber growth has underperformed in their last quarterly earnings, and international subscriber valuation isn‚Äôt at parity. The revenue generated between a US subscriber and one in say India will be drastically different. 

You can misconstrue what I said all I want, but the fact is their longterm subscriber growth and viewership is going to continue to contract. They have too many liabilities on the books to make anything they do continually profitable. I‚Äôve worked in this industry between film finance and OTT advertising for over a decade now, one of those stints at Hulu for almost 4 years. It‚Äôs a model that will show diminishing returns over time and isn‚Äôt sustainable in a fragmented media marketplace."

2021-05-16 12:22:14,wallstreetbets,"Its tricky with legacy content on streaming - my understanding is that most of the traditional tv industry is built around keeping the production side at arms length from the distribution side, with profit participants in between.

In order to repatriate Friends, HBO Max had to outbid Netflix for its own content, with the stars continuing to get paid out.

When Disney bought Fox Family, they mistakenly thought they could reair ABC content gir cheap, but those kinds of deals weren't in place. Source: Disneywar

ABC ended up getting sued for Who Wants to be a Millionaire reruns and for generally underpaying for the hit show through self dealing. They had to pay out millions of dollars is my understanding. 

Similarly, AMC is currently being sued by several of the producers of The Walking Dead in at least two lawsuits, although the preliminary judgements seem to be going in their favour on that front.

Most streaming shows are being produced on the basis of paying out the backend up front, aka the Netflix model, which has also been the norm for Canadian television for quite some time if not forever.  Hence, CTV/Bell owns the backend on Corner Gas.

In the case of Viacom, my understanding is that the Redstone family through National Amusements owns the majority of voting rights for Viacom, so any takeover would depend on what Shari Redstone wants to do.

We'll see what happens."

2021-05-16 11:57:53,wallstreetbets,"Firstly I wish you luck. I dont want to sound pessimistic but the largest owners of single family homes are hedge/investment funds. They are keeping retailer buyers out of the market and driving rents upwards. They usually buy 100s of houses from a builder in one fell swoop and there are no mortgages written for said properties.  Given where inflation is going,  no doubt property is the place to be. I myself received a letter recently from an investment company wanting to give me a lump sum with no payments for 17% of my property. Their fees were 8k and I'll be their free caretaker,  dont think so. 
  What im getting at is your investment in a residential mortgage related business,  in my opinion is a risky investment giving the trajectory of inflation/ interest rates which might climb rapidly within the next year. Commodities are surging,  precious metals are starting to climb, if this inflation gets out of control we could be in a recession within 2-3 yrs. 
  I've been on the wrong side of a trade many times and my biggest mistake was not taking small losses. Be nimble and dont let small losses grow, good luck"

2021-05-16 01:57:04,wallstreetbets,"Catalyst is that a $300m buyback was announced last week at Earnings. The stock has been rising since... and so has the short borrow fee rate.

It‚Äôs true that the company has been posted about on WSB before, but that‚Äôs part of why we‚Äôre getting a squeeze now. 

WSB posted about the stock, and it was relentlessly shorted as a result. This created an opportunity to squeeze the shorts. 

Yes, it‚Äôs the same play. Shorts doubled down, but now it‚Äôs way more expensive to short and there are no shares left. Don‚Äôt believe me though. Look at the shorting numbers yourself. 

It was beaten down way too far. The company is a buy from every article with PTs all above the current share price. Safe investment with a dividend and the CEO announced a buyback last week just to fuck with shorts. Which brings us to Monday."

It appears to me that it is the actual average interest rate on any given day for borrowed shares. It says CTB, Cost To Borrow. Not *change* in CTB.

The following is the same tab they demonstrate on the website but for UWMC.

2021-05-16 10:14:22,wallstreetbets,Just need to know what to buy lol. My car has almost tripled in price the past four years
2021-05-16 06:57:26,wallstreetbets,"Buy desirable models at bottom of depreciation curve, drive them for a little bit then sell for near, at, or above what you paid"
2021-05-16 18:38:19,wallstreetbets,"To summarize car hacking: 
Buy a desirable car (Mercedes, Porsche, even lambo or Ferrari, etc) at a low price. Drive it, keep it nice, keep miles low. Sell it within a year or two as optimal. Divide your total cost of ownership by the number of months you drove it and there‚Äôs what it cost you. Sometimes, not always, that number is a profit.

The point of a car hack isn‚Äôt to be an investment. It‚Äôs a way to drive a nice car either for free or for a very steep discount. The value of my car is actually up since I bought it, so if I sold it today and paid off the note, I will have essentially been paid (not much but still) to drive a corvette. Even if I lost 5000 on the car, that loss over 2 years means I will have only paid 208 bucks a month to drive a corvette. I know guys with a 400 dollar note on their Kia shitboxes. 

Again, car hacking was never conceived to be an investment. It is a way to drive a desirable, high-quality car either for free or for much less than you would pay for a car that depreciates badly."

I'm not just talking shares I currently hold 0 shares and haven't since eyes exploded (no options then). Argument still stands if your not taking profits at 100 percent your being greedy anyone that's been in the game long enough has lost  huge gains by holding and not taking profits."

2021-05-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UWMC is a powderkeg: low float, high short, huge buyback, unhedged options (Consolidated DD) I'm sure you've all seen some of this in various threads over the last few days so here is what I see as the complete short term case for UWMC in one place. Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor this is not advice don't listen to me etc.

Before the content let me say I'm not going to talk about the [fundamentals of this company](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/comments/n0414o/uwmc_a_fundamental_analysis_of_why_this_stock_is/) today (they're great), [the value even with no short-term price movement](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nd9hyr/uwm_holdings_looks_like_a_value_bargain_with_low/), [a super good dividend](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/ndc6pu/united_wholesale_mortgage_uwmc_is_the_most/), [the wild housing market](https://the1a.org/segments/housing-pandemic-market/), [the great strategic decisions the company has made](https://twitter.com/SleipnirPerkins/status/1378305915800186884), or anything other than strictly the stock. I like the company, but I love the stock.

&#x200B;

* **Low float, low volume**

UWM has 1.6 billion total shares, but 1.5 billion of them are owned by the CEO and not traded. The Class A shares outstanding are 103million, with \~13million owned by insiders. That's a 90 million public float, with another 25.5million in institutional ownership. Institutions can sell, of course, but a lot of this ownership is large conservative firms that aren't day trading this stock. (Pension funds, Vanguard, etc.). I would estimate the actual ""active"" float at less than 70 million.

Average daily volume is very low - volume Friday was 4 million, and there have been recent days with volume south of 2 million. The last time volume was more than 20 million was the first week of March, and look what happened to the stock. (Spoiler: it ran up to 12.50) If this stock gets real sustained volume, it can and will fly.

&#x200B;

* **Short interest, high short volume**

In the post-GME world we just aren't going to see short interests over 100% anymore - the highest on the market right now is 40-50% in Pubmatic and Root. But the shorts aren't gone, they're just more sneaky. The official Short interest over the last two months has been in the moderate zone, a bit below 20% of the active float. 

Short interest through May 15 won't be available until the 25th, but short volume has spiked since RKT's disappointing earnings took the stock down to ATLs. In fact over 50% of the volume on 6 of the last 7 trading days was short sales. ([Source](http://shortvolumes.com/?t=uwmc)) The shorts are here and they are relentless.

&#x200B;

* **Short Fee Spike, low short shares available, failure to settle**

Last Monday, there were up to 400,000 short shares available with about 3% interest. **Right now the short fees are around (or over) 100% with almost zero shares available to short.** ([Source](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/uwmc)) It's [over 300%](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_330645419.jpg) on Ortex. This is the same pattern that was seen in AMC last week, RKT in March, and other stocks that have had rapid runs.

Regarding naked shorting and FTS - It's happening, and it's significant. UWMC has been on the threshold securities list for 12 straight trading days. I'll [let the recent post on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ncczh8/uwmc_on_nyse_threshold_securities_list_regulation/) speak for itself and not explain this again except to say the official FTS data is only available with a 1-month lag so recent hard numbers aren't available.

&#x200B;

* **Huge Buyback**

Monday during earnings, UWM announced they will be buying back **$300 million** **in stock** over the next 2 years, starting this week. At the Friday closing price of 7.51, that's about 42.5 million shares, or **half of the active float** of the stock. Disclaimers: 1) they can only use about half the money (21 million shares) before the public shares become too low to be considered in the Russell 1000, which the CEO has said he wants next month. 2) They have 2 years to spend the money. But, they have every incentive to strike quickly due to the cheap stock price (and the CEO has said as much). 3) There are legal limits on daily buybacks equal to 25% of the average daily volume of the stock - 7M right now, so a limit of 1.75M shares per day. That's still a huge, huge potential amount though.

What does this mean, in effect? Besides the obvious buy pressure and lowering of outstanding shares, **incredible uncertainty and risk for anyone now shorting the stock.** It's tough to go heavily short when a million-share buy order could be coming in at any time. 

There's no way to know when buybacks are happening, but  there was a suspiciously big buy on Wednesday afternoon at about 1:45pm. Based on this and [public statements from the CEO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nclll1/uwmc_the_most_important_statement_for_all_shares/), It's safe to say that the buybacks are actually happening now and not theoretical.

&#x200B;

* **Options - Would you look at that**

This is where it get juicy. The options interest on this stock is massive, especially on next week's 5/21 expiry. **Between the $7.5 and $15 strikes, there are 205,500 open call contracts expiring next Friday. That's 20.5 million shares if they are all exercised. Most importantly,** the average delta of these options is currently about 0.1 **-** meaning the big Market Makers are only 10% covered on the shares**.** The 9, 10, and 12.50 strikes each by themselves all have open interest near to or greater than the entire daily volume of the stock on most days! 

As for puts, above 7.5, there are almost no (<5000) open puts expiring.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion -** What needs to happen

First, this needs to sustain above $7.5. The stock spent most of the day last Friday banging against a 300k share Ask wall at $7.5, and finally broke it at close (and climbed AH!). This was huge and encouraging, but I am 100% sure the shorts and option MMs will be back to try to pin it at 7.5 all week long. (Tangent: go look at what happened on April 16, the last options expiry date. it closed at 7.49 on the dot, wiping out everyone's options on both sides.)

Second this needs to get to, and through, $9. Once the price approaches and breaks $9, Delta is going to force the MMs to buy shares to cover their contracts. And once the price momentum breaks to the rapid upside through the $9, $10, $11, and $12.5 strikes, there are 12 million short shares that will need covering. 

It's not quite a pure gamma squeeze, and it's not a pure short squeeze, but there's elements of both here and it's all converging this week.

**TL;DR:** This stock has a low active float, a whole bunch of shorts, and a huge amount of unhedged calls expiring on Friday. All in the midst of a gigantic share buyback.  The conditions are perfect for a huge run."

2021-05-15 20:57:12,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt see how shorts get out of this one with the buyback. If we get to $9, the dominoes all go. Gotta buy shares to push the price though."

2021-05-16 09:52:12,wallstreetbets,"I work for a Mortgage Brokerage that uses UWMC and they are by far the best wholesale lender in our stable of lenders right now. They get it: Obsessed with fast processing times and almost exclusively work with Brokers. I‚Äôm bullish long. The only short term question I have is the impact their war with Rocket/Quicken Mortgage (RKT)will have. About two months ago UWMC sent a letter to all brokers that if they wanted to continue to use them they could not also use their competitor RKT because of shady practices of stealing business from their brokers for their retail (direct to consumer)business. All Brokers had to sign an exclusivity agreement. We went with UWMC but some Brokers took exception to the perceived interference in their lending processes. RKT didn‚Äôt take kindly to the declaration of war. Not sure what it is yet, but their will be a counter attack especially as loan volume drops with fewer and fewer re-if‚Äôs to fatten profits.

TL:DR - UWMC picked a fight with a gorilla in RKT and when revenue slows you‚Äôll see a counter punch."

2021-05-16 15:29:10,wallstreetbets,"It's not so much that anyone is ""trying"" to pin it at $7.50.  Is just a natural, normal, expected result of continuous delta hedging and high OI at a strike close to the current price, with other strikes being far away.

FWIW if you look through the UWMC sub you will see that last month I called that $7.50 close.

This time there is significant OI at the strikes above 7.50 but the strikes are so far apart that it will be hard to get there.  If the price is not above $8 by Thursday close you can pretty much call the 7.50 close on Friday,

I'm long over 32k shares but I'm patient.  If it happens this week great; if not, it's still undervalued and I'm happy to hold for months or years is necessary.  I view it as an easy double from current prices, even with no squeezes."

I‚Äôm highly considering holding onto my shares, even if they reach potential. The dividend is lovely... and I see very little to deter that from hovering where it‚Äôs at for quite sometime.

2021-05-16 10:50:11,wallstreetbets,"Market Makers have a delta-neutral hedging policy to manage risk. This means that when they sell calls, the Market Maker is supposed to purchase shares equivalent to the delta. Delta goes from 0 to 1, so 0.1 is 10% and 1 is 100%. As an option gets closer to the strike price, the delta increases. Since delta is the chance that the option expires ITM, the time before expiry and the volatility of the stock also affect the delta. That's why if the stock goes up and stay above 9$ until friday, those 9c FDs will have a delta of 1, and the market maker is supposed to have either bought the remaining 90% from the float or sold puts, which means that the sum of the delta from their puts and calls gets smaller since puts have a negative delta."
2021-05-16 09:03:24,wallstreetbets,"The buyback changes everything here.

That exchange effectively dilutes the economic interest of existing class A shares while increasing their voting power significantly."

2021-05-16 12:53:14,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, this whole bar thinks I'm psycho now for busting out laughing at nothing."
2021-05-16 11:59:45,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the reply. I guess maybe I was thinking about it backwards. I assumed from the OP that MM's buy/sell thus strongly affecting the delta (which I guess is still technically true) , but really it's that MM's are always adjusting their position based off the delta in order to remain delta neutral. The fact that we know MM's have to remain delta neutral allows us to directly relate the current delta to how much they've covered. I kind of get it now."
2021-05-16 13:53:31,wallstreetbets,"> Since delta is the chance that the option expires ITM, the time before expiry and the volatility of the stock also affect the delta.

My understanding is that delta measures the change in value of an option when the price of the underlying increases by $1. I know delta increases the further ITM an option is, but can it really be used to measure the probability that it expires ITM?

For instance, UWMC is at $7.51. Looking at 18 Jun calls, $7 strike has a .67 delta while $8 strike only has .42 delta. Shouldn't they both have similar chances of expiring ITM, since the underlying is right between them?"
2021-05-16 11:57:40,wallstreetbets,Yes but the bulk of their revenue the past 2 quarters was still refi. They could still see a huge revenue shrink
2021-05-16 12:07:21,wallstreetbets,Why are they predicting 46% less earnings for next quarter with a bunch of downgrades?  Yahoo finance quotes Simply Finance saying they predict a 46% decline in sales for the next quarter.
2021-05-16 17:02:39,wallstreetbets,"My goal is always to make money and I think this stock has potential, but it is not moving even after a good earnings report.

So I am selling short term covered calls, but I am picking out of the money strikes that I hope will not go off and are at or above my cost in case they do get exercised.  I sold June 4 - $43.5 and $42.5 calls and June 25  calls with a strike $45.5.  I  also sold some out of the money naked puts.  

I am trying to generate cash while I wait.  If I picked right, I will probably resell them when they expire at a higher price. We will see what the price is?

Maybe it will work.  Maybe not.  Either way, I am making money while I wait.

Good Luck"

2021-05-15 22:12:00,wallstreetbets,"To an extent.. but I was under the impression that it still very much can effect the russle inclusion. The shares they buy yes do get burned, but the % still gets closer to russle exclusion due to the amount of shares the ceo owns compared to the public float.. just not a double whammy where the company gains additional shares."
2021-05-15 22:18:36,wallstreetbets,"It does impact the float percentage. For example, say there are 1000M total shares and 100M are in the public float (10% float). If 10M shares are retired, then the percentage becomes 90M/990M = 9.1% public float."
2021-05-16 04:31:58,wallstreetbets,It's not about the price of the option...
2021-05-16 17:21:04,wallstreetbets,"Now you get the gist of it. It is however possible for the Market Maker to sell more puts, which counteract the delta. Sometimes a price spike happens two days after a rally if an option that wasn't itm or fully hedged suddenly becomes itm at expiry, because the Market Makers have two days to deliver shares when they get assigned. They can also delay them further with a Failure to Deliver, but they're not supposed to do that iirc."
2021-05-16 17:08:52,wallstreetbets,"The 7$ strike is already in the money, while the 8$strike is still out of the money. If the share price of UWMC were to stay flat until June 18th (though I personally hope it will moon this week), the 7c option would get a delta of 1 at expiry, while the 8c option would go to a 0 in delta eventually. For the 8c to be itm, the share price has to increase by about 8%, while the 7c already is itm and has intrinsic value. Therefore a 7c is seen as much more likely and will therefore have a higher delta. Ofc, if UMWC rallies this week, both calls will be itm and end with a delta of 1. Then the 8c will most likely have a larger % increase in price since the change in delta will be larger. It is true that delta reflects the change in price of the underlying, but that is because it reflects the chance of being itm at expiry and thus the option will have that many out of the 100 shares hedged for. This will show up in the price increase or decrease. 

Edit: typo"

My most interesting trade in this stock was selling 10 naked June 11 puts last Tuesday for about $3.8 with a strike of $41.  Those are already in the money over $600.  As the stock goes up, my gain should increase. a  However, the odds of my holding them to expiration is pretty low. In fact, I will probably be out next week if I can make a quick $1,000. Depends on the price action and what else is going on.

I am not on margin like some of these apes.  That can be really dangerous if the market turns.

2021-05-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Comprehensive Guide to EV companies Electric vehicle stocks are down across the board since January, from the biggest Tesla down 33% from its peak to the smallest Canoo down 70% from its peak (on Apple acquisition rumors). 

Here is a guide to the EV landscape today.

tesla =  comedian nerd,
Makes a scene, looks like an idiot, does better than you'd expect with the ladies

Rivian = Wyoming rancher,
Looks like a Ford truck for the most part, just costs $80k, bought by Amazon

canoo = pretty girl, 
Gets great press for its Apple like designs (the ""cutest pickup"" was a CNN headline) has the lowest market cap, gets picked on by the jealous uggos (the shorts) and tried setting up an only fans letting Hyundai take a look at the goods cheap before spac funding

Arrival = sexy accountant,
Small practical British company that has practical designs and has small trial contracts with ups/hyundai. This is the same Hyundai deal that canoo backed out of because Hyundai kept trying to grab its ass. Arrival isn't as pretty so she puts up with it.

Lucid = my dad is rich 

Sleek, expensive, refined. The full blown blue chip factory right from the start. A bit on the bland side, but make no mistake driving a lucid  is  sure to put the riff raff on notice that your daddy can buy his daddy.

Fisker = the Donald of electrics 

Went bankrupt the first time when their Chinese funder had capital issues for their bold design , they are back again for their second try.

Nio = Chinese exchange student 

Pretty bland, doesn't say much. Just an average car that happens to be electric.

Bollinger = big dumb guy 

It's a big truck that doesn't look good that costs $125k. Shrug. You do you.

Lordstown = unemployed guy in fancy suit

Being investigated by the SEC. Testing prototype burned to a cinder, car entered in a race dropped out because it couldn't finish.

Nikola = your wife's boyfriend

They rolled the truck down the hill because they didn't have a product. Still not the lowest market cap of the bunch, company fired the old CEO because they said he misled investors."

2021-05-15 22:15:37,wallstreetbets,"Nikola Motor Company (NKLA) makes me think of ""companies"" like Bre-X Minerals & Theranos.

This is a company that mislead investors in an (IMHO) criminal way.

The founder has from multiple sources a long history of scamming people by selling businesses under false pretenses and information.

He took capital money and hired his friends and family who have no experience or expertise.  His brother was in the hydrogen technology department despite being a basic home repairs guy laying concrete driveways his whole life...

The only money on the books for the company was the founder (who as you mentioned got kicked out of his own company) putting money on the books for sales to him...

The company and old founder first lied about the technology existing, then promised huge rebuttals on social media.  Then made all the social media private, then ghosted social media all together...

It has went back down to IPO price only this time all the hopes and promises that made it launch at around $9-10 a share don't exist.

No one in any formal business sense wants to touch this company with a 10 foot pole.

They offered free cash and free stock to GM and even GM after discussion realized the association was so bad for business they turned down free stock and free capital....

For the investors that were in NKLA before all the lies and in my opinion fraud came out they should join the countless class action lawsuits, write to the DOJ and SEC to continue their investigations, and write to their local and state representatives to push for investigations as they people were taken advantage of and this business and those at the executive level failed in their fiduciary duty to the shareholders.

The people investing since the news broke and riding it all down to IPO price from around 70-80 are beyond cult kool aid level.  Lol it says something when even WSB gamblers mock a bunch of people for being ignorant.

If the executive team cared at all about the shareholders they would take the remaining capital and assets and merge with a respectable company pursuing hydrogen tech (if you agree with it or not) and lose the name and the history and give the shareholders a chance at some future or at least tech development.

Regardless this is a meme of the decade for one of the worst companies on the market.  It is Luckin Coffee level but without even the coffee.. üòÇ"

That is the bear case but I actually think with the ME tensions flaring, this stock has room to run pretty nicely in the next few months (at the very least swing trades I expect a few profitable rips to take advantage of).  As OP has said, the biggest risk is not the comp it's the macro market condition and fear of inflation / interest rate general distaste for forward earnings (and resulting devaluation of them)."

Execs get most of their comp in equity.  If they actually want to live like rich people and not just be rich on paper they have to sell some shares.  It happens at every single company.  And doubly so for early investors.

Pay less attention to supply and demand of shares and more attention to what the company is actually going to be worth.  Shares don't really follow the rules of supply and demand because they are not a commodity that people need and consume.  The buyers and sellers are usually the same people, at different prices.  The only ""demand"" for shares exists because people think that they will be worth more later.  It's not like something like food or housing which people are forced to buy regardless of the price."

2021-05-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$X might mark the spot on a 2X-3X The entire steel sector has been on a tear the past 12 months, with companies like US Steel moving from approximately $6 to $25, and I believe there is plenty of room left to run.  Given that steel prices have been at all time highs, the steel producers have relatively low valuations, and other macro factors, the stock value for companies like US Steel could double or triple this year.

**High Steel Prices**

One of the reasons steel producers have flown under the radar and maintained low valuations has been analysts expectations that steel prices wouldn't achieve the levels they have and that they wouldn't stay at these high levels.  *See examples:*  [*https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/steel-price-rally-seen-under-threat-on-global-supply-revival*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/steel-price-rally-seen-under-threat-on-global-supply-revival)  *and*    [https://www.barrons.com/articles/u-s-steel-stock-got-a-rare-double-upgrade-why-it-will-end-in-pain-51610139992](https://www.barrons.com/articles/u-s-steel-stock-got-a-rare-double-upgrade-why-it-will-end-in-pain-51610139992).  

However, prices have risen over the $1,000/ton peak that some analyst called for at the beginning of the year and touched above $1,600/ton his month.  The price has pulled back a little to closing out at $1,505 on Friday.  However, looking at forward contracts for steel, the price is not expected to fall below $1,000/ton until August 2022.  

To better understand how high the price of steel currently is, see the 10 year chart below:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4ngegkdxucz61.png?width=796&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac2e3239d6127c1b08471ff1946c0f6098a554a7

In 2018, X share price almost reached $50/share.  Given where steel prices are now, I would expect it to touch that again.

**Low P/E**

The rise in steel prices have caused analysis to raise their earnings forecasts for the steel producers, but the stock prices do not appear to fully appreciate these earnings projections.  For example, X is expected to earn approximately $7.95/share in 2021.  At a current price of $25.5, X could earn 1/3 of its current share price in 1 year.      

**China Is Curbing Production**

The largest steel producing country in the world is China.  China's steel production growth over the last 15 years has been one of the main reasons for the demise of the US steel production industry.  This is why I don't compare what X's steel price was in 2008 when steel prices were 1/2 of what they are today.  Its just not the same company with China being the biggest player.

However, China has started trying to curb its production with its new green initiative.  [https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3132666/china-targets-air-pollution-steel-overcapacity-new-curbs](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3132666/china-targets-air-pollution-steel-overcapacity-new-curbs)  Time will tell whether China keeps to its climate change goals and cuts its steel production, but if it does, then we can expect steel prices to remain elevated for a longer period of time.

**Spending Seems To Be Under Control**

One of the disappointments in the steel industry has been poor management.  People who have been investing in X in the past remember Mario Longhi and the destruction he did to this company.  Longhi cut spending when he shouldn't have, he rejected new technology upgrades to produce steel, and he was in charge while the company's intellectual property was stolen by Chinese companies who now produce steel at a much lower cost.  Overall, Mr. Longhi's destruction caused the company to lose its top spot as a steel producer.  

X has a new CEO, David Burritt.  Mr. Burritt seems to be doing a good job turning around the company.  Instead of wasting money on money pits within the company, Mr. Burritt went out and acquired a new  technologically advanced steel mill in Big River Steel.  The timing of the Big River acquisition has played out to be a very well time investment as steel prices were close to their low at the time of acquisition and have tripled since then.  

Overall, the Big River acquisition shows that Mr. Burritt is willing to move away from outdated blast furnaces and into lower cost methods of making steel, which will help US Steel's future earnings.

**Tariffs and Potential Infrastructure Play**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, etc.  It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support.  The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

In 2018, President Trump placed 25% tariffs on steel imported from China.  Contrary to what some believe, Biden has made it clear that he is not interested in removing the steel tariffs placed on China.  This should also help keep steel prices higher for longer.

**Conclusion**

Overall, for the reasons stated above, I believe X has the potential to climb 2x-3x within this year, if not more.  There are other companies in this space that I will write my opinion on and explain why all are good investments.  For example, Nucor ($NUE), which I also own, is best in class when it comes to steel producers.  I believe NUE represents a great investment, but it has already doubled in the past 3 months.  I think X has the most room to run and is worth your consideration."

Futures aren't showing cost spikes into next year.  Looks like it might see some sticky pricing if the infastructure bill passes and American made demand goes up...

2021-05-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UWM Holdings Looks Like a Value Bargain With Low PE and Attractive Yield UWMC stock is worth $10 per share, 36% over its recent price at 8 times forward EPS UWM‚Äôs new buyback program. On May 11, UWM said it would repurchase up to $300 million of its shares over the next 24 months. This is a sort of dividend to shareholders.

With its $12.8 billion market cap, the $300 million represents a 2.34% buyback yield to shareholders (i.e., $300 million/$12.8 billion) over two years. This is also worth 1.17% annually, or 13.6 cents per share.

Add that to the 5.25%dividend yield (i.e., 40 cents annually divided by $7.68). So the ‚Äútotal yield‚Äù as I call it, is worth about 6.42% (i.e., 53.6 cents divided by $7.68). At $10 per share, the total yield is 5.36 % annually more appropriate valuation.

As there are about 1.605 billion shares outstanding, the adjusted EPS will be $1.16 per share. At the recent price of $7.38, this puts UMVC stock on a forward P/E of just 6.4 times forward earnings. That is very cheap.

My estimate of $1.16 is close to analysts‚Äô estimates, as seen by Seeking Alpha, of $1.14 per share. They also estimate $1.23 for next year. That puts UWMC stock on a forward P/E of just 6 times earnings.

I believe a more appropriate valuation is 8 times earnings. That puts the value at $9.84, or roughly $10 per share. This is a potential 36% gain for UWMC stock."

It's so shorted the borrow rate is 93%-300% (depending on which site you look at). Shorting drives the price down, but shorts can (and often are) very wrong...just look at GME.

Its rev grew 42x yoy. Not 42%...4200%. It's one of the largest mortgage companies in the US and has a 5.5%+ div yield at current price. It's a cash flow cow and I don't see demand for housing and mortgages decreasing any time soon, even if rates/inflation go up.

But just here , within a month,  rates in real estate went from 1.84 % to 2.30%. Okay its a different market in Canada but i really see it slowing down in the us aswell. People will be so fucked here with our bid wars and our 5 years mortgage terms. Some bad surprises for people  at their renewal at new rates, with new evaluation cycle, higher evaluation prices.. I think shits going to hit the fan here when all new buyers cant pay the with the new rates on higher prices.

2021-05-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"What's your strategy? The economy is opening up again and apparently masks are off the table. Kids are getting vaccinated and Tinder swipes are increasing. My local restaurants can't find people to serve me my favorite hamburger and Chipotle now wants to charge me more to make me a burrito.

I used to save all my paycheck that I used to spend going to the bar and picking up 8's that turned into 5's in the morning. I also saved the money I would spend going out to breakfast with said 5 in the AM drinking enough alcohol to turn them back into a 6.5 before we said our goodbyes.

Sometimes I would go to the mall and buy an Orange Julius or a Hot Dog On a Stick. Sometimes I would go see a movie or play paintball with some randoms just to pass the time. And other times I would just go to the local track and play the horses.

But during the pandemic all of that spending turned into gambling on stonks. Waking up early in the morning to read the message boards to see the next hot stonk. Buying calls on BJs and NIOs. Riding OSTK and GME to the moon. And spending hours on end reading Reddit posts.

But now that the economy is reopening I want to do all of that stuff again. Hopefully that 5 is still a 5 and not 300 lbs from binge eating while watching Netflix and Marvel movies on Disney +. Maybe I'll be able to find a mall that has most of its stores in operation and a movie theater with actual real good movies to watch. I want to go to the beach and get a tan. $#@& do I need one living in a cave during this last year.

This means I'll have less time and money to yolo on stonks. And since Biden and others want to stop the stimmy by the end of the summer. I imagine others will have to get a job too. Which means they won't have as much time to yolo as well.

What do you think will happen? What do you plan on doing? Why does everyone think this could all continue if the world is getting back to normal? And given your perspective, what are you doing over the next 3-6 months to take advantage?

TLdR 

Economy closed. Everyone yolo-ed their money on stonks. Now that the economy is reopening people want to do $#@& again. Are you going to sell some of your stonks and gamble less on them because you want to do $#@& again? If so, how much and when?"

Now there's another way. Hi, I'm u/Flying_Madman, here to offer you financial advice. Introducing standardized options by CBOE, your go-to source for derivatives trading instruments. For years options trading was limited to market makers and large institutions but now you too can swing with the big boys!

At the CBOE we believe that you, the retail trader, should be empowered to make irresponsible financial decisions and blow up your account just like the professionals. With their wide array of strikes, expiries, and underlying securities, there are options to fit any trader's financial goals and personal risk tolerance. 

Standardized options are highly leveraged derivative instruments that amplify your buying power to never before seen levels. Going all in on just three 0 DTE SPY calls a week have been mathematically proven to make you a millionaire in less than one year\*.

What are you waiting for? Ask your financial advisor if standardized options trading is right for you today, then disregard their dumb advice and do it anyway!

2021-05-16 00:34:52,wallstreetbets,I like BB but their stock is too heavily manipulated. I also really like Nokia but until the heavy HFT and algo trading stops I don‚Äôt feel confident in owning either. It sucks but until something happens stay away from the algo stocks. You‚Äôll get burnt.
2021-05-15 20:28:26,wallstreetbets,Bad news is the stock is down

2021-05-16 09:42:28,wallstreetbets,Then why did this non car company decide to go with them.
2021-05-16 00:17:04,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs not bad. $BB is still up by almost 100% from a year ago. 

What‚Äôs bad is that $BB made less money this quarter than they did in the same quarter in 2020.

Same company with double the market cap. How does that look to investors?"

2021-05-16 09:54:38,wallstreetbets,Because they are Canadian would likely be reason #1 in my mind. Likely a home court advantage. Beyond that tools like CrowdStrike and SentinelOne continue to develop for and solve business challenges. Blackberry has for the most part taken Cylance a different direction.
2021-05-16 16:34:53,wallstreetbets,Buy the rumor; sell the news.
2021-05-16 00:26:23,wallstreetbets,I don't trust the short% numbers.  I'm guessing like GME and AMC it's a lot higher than reports.  We will fly at some point this year.
2021-05-16 12:17:29,wallstreetbets,But what makes it different in that regard than any other stock. Why doesn't it move on good news like most? Simple valuation? Trying to understand.

2021-05-15 22:58:48,wallstreetbets,That would be an excellent publicity stunt. BB -69%

2021-05-16 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"C3.AI time to load up for a short term trade C3 Ai ( $AI) is near IPO lows ( 52) with high of 180 . This would be a good time to load up for a target of 90-100 for a short term trade

Upcoming Catalysts :

- Earnings June 2nd . Lot of their clients had Covid impacts which reduced revenue last quarter . I expect a good bounce with realized gains this quarter based on how the billing is structured

- Rumor about potential buyouts . We already know Microsoft tried to buy them out pre ipo but CEO declined which eventually turned into a $50 million investment from them . At these lower prices , it can be attractive.

- Beaten down tech / growth stocks are poised for a recovery looking at last Friday‚Äôs action / C3 AI would benefit as peers like PLTR recover

- No. of shares Short is around 16% of float which can always create a mini squeeze as it recovers

- lockup expiry is on June 7th but they had a clause which let early investors sell prior to lock up if price increased by 30% after IPO. Most investors used this so lockup expiry would most likely would be a non event considering the stock price is not that attractive to sell

Disclaimer - I shorted this stock from 120 and recently covered at 54. Now long with an avg price of 51"

Mvis: 35% short interest, 120% fee borrow, 16 shares available(month ago)

Clover: 35% short interest, 1% fee borrow, 1.5mill sbares available. 

I personally don't think a squeeze is happening untill there is more risk associated with lending. As those rates come up and less shares become available that is an indication the squeeze is nearing. That's how I understand things. I am a retard though"

So if your option is out of the money at earnings it will tank regardless of how good earnings are,""

this is all completely wrong.

earnings doesnt make the volatility drop to zero, it all depends on what happens.    If the price shoots up during earnings then volatility will increase and the calls will be worth a lot more.  they dont have to be ITM 'at earnings' to be affected by volatility, that only matters at expiration if they are ITM, as long as the price action is strong on monday there wont be IV crush here, IV will just go up.

read up about Vega and Implied Volatility if you want to know how earnings actually affects options, youre confusing earnings with option expiration."

2021-05-15 20:44:07,wallstreetbets,"this.

 volatility/vega/implied volatility are affected by share price, and to some extent, options trading at that price. It's why $GME options went thru the roof and were ridiculously unprofitable when GME was soaring/falling. as a price evens out over time, the volatility and implied volatility drops - which is why your options lose value (and can quite quickly) depending upon where your strike price falls relative to the current price and price movement of the stock."

>*There are more than 617,000 bridges across the United States. Currently, 42% of all bridges are at least 50 years old, and 46,154, or 7.5% of the nation‚Äôs bridges, are considered structurally deficient, meaning they are in ‚Äúpoor‚Äù condition.*  
>  
>*A recent estimate for the nation‚Äôs backlog of bridge repair needs is $****125 billion****. We need to increase spending on bridge rehabilitation from $14.4 billion annually to $22.7 billion annually, or by 58%, if we are to improve the condition. At the current rate of investment, it will take until 2071 to make all of the repairs that are currently necessary, and the additional deterioration over the next 50 years will become overwhelming.*

So ignoring all other types of infrastructure in need of upgrades, $125 billion is needed just for bridges alone. 

Now according the White House face sheet, the $621 billion from 'The American Jobs Plan' that is allocated to infrastructure also includes roads, public transport, passenger and freight rail services, building electric vehicle infrastructure (charging stations), ports, waterways, and airports.

So that means only a fraction of the $621 billion will get allocated to bridges. The cost of replacing/rebuilding an existing bridge from scratch is a freaking nightmare - not only the logistics but the cost - and this option would only be considered in extreme cases. So the main headache would be how to spend the money they get allocated - fix thousands of minor repairs before they get worse? Or replace a handful of bridges that are over 70 years old? Some serious optimization of budget allocation will be needed."

2021-05-15 20:29:11,wallstreetbets,"Engineering is all about optimization - meaning spend as little as possible to do the minimum needed to meet design and safety requirements. If the cheaper option does the job then that will be chosen over replacement. Of course if it's a safety issue that old steel **should** come out to be replaced. 

That's why I think (in my humble retarded opinion) we shouldn't be focused on certain materials like concrete or steel as an investment play for this. If Biden proposed $621 billion allocated to *new construction* then yeah maybe, but repair and upgrading infrastructure is more about expertise in diagnosis and smart budget spending so a better bet would be on Contractors and Engineering Consulting Companies. Unfortunately the list of these companies is too long to mention so some serious DD would be required to identify who would be the frontrunners to pick up this type of work.

After looking at CX again - it has a large focus on concrete materials (cement + aggregates) but also other construction products like asphalt, pipes, precast products for culverts, bridges, basins, drainage, barriers etc. so actually doesn't fit the Contractor category."

2021-05-15 21:27:04,wallstreetbets,"Can you explain this arithmetically? if you take publicly available shares out of circulation, without decreasing the corresponding private shares as well, then public ownership has to go down. I think someone else put it this way, Current 6/100 public, 94/100 private (6% public float), after 1% buyback 5/99 public, 94/99 private means it's a 5% float and no longer a 6% float."
2021-05-16 00:44:24,wallstreetbets,"Suppose UWMC has 100 shares only for the total company 94 (94%) are held by Ishbia et al, 6 (6%) are held by the public.

2021-05-16 01:36:04,wallstreetbets,"This just doesn't seem right... You would expect that in this scenario, the total after those 3 shares are retired would now be 97 and the public float would then represent 3/97 = 3.1%.

2021-05-16 04:52:30,wallstreetbets,"No. Steam doesn't buy games. You're right. It's strictly retail storefront (which supports your GME idea but I doubt that's in the works).

No. They don't develop games. And it's not a development platform. (but one could consider mods a form of creation)

But no one seems to have made a viable commerical space for games to be sold online. We're still dealing with ancient stuff like disc media. And yeah, there is PS Store and XBox store and a couple other online retail attempts but that could all be integrated into one platform -- but no one has been able to do that.

It's weird to let a brand name hardware dictate software availability and pricing. There's not a lot different between consoles or PCs. 

So many of the component guts are the same or provide the same function  (yeah, there are significant differences - don't want to fight about it - talking generals here).

The point is: were talking graphics card, CPU (motherboard, blah blah - you know what I mean - the engine in general terms), ram, ssd or HD space.

It would be like saying everyone needs a specific hand to grab toilet paper. It's toilet paper. We can all grab it.

Someone needs to unify software to have the same (or more) power than hardware.

If youre looking for the same set up as the GME squeeze, you dont realize how rare those are and are just bandwagon trading since Feb.

A classic undervalued and oversold stock who has only increased future holdings and licencing is just as good of a reason to put money down as a squeeze that comes once a decade.

Look at what 1 Superbowl did to its earnings. They have 3/4 in the next 4 years and a brand new streaming service.

Alright, all you have to hope for is that MSFT at least stays at $250.70 and hope they don‚Äôt tank once 4pm hits that day

By that time, both IV crush and theta won‚Äôt even matter to be taken into account

If anything, your best bet is to simply sell anytime before 4pm on 5/21, cuz exercising calls will actually net you less potential profit, since you lose the premium ($3.20 per share x 100 shares per contract x 25 contracts) unless you plan on holding 2500 shares of MSFT long into the future, which *can* be a good thing since it is MSFT"

Don't forget they're beautiful vehicles with solid reviews for such a young company. People compliment the vehicles characteristics. Top gear complained about the heavy driving feel but that's not something most people care about and it can be ironed out in future iterations. It's spacious, beautiful, well built and offers a novel solution to a huge problem with the technology. They have a good product.
They are proving that with racing development as well.

They have solid branding and as stupid as it is to say, NIO is much more pleasant to say than Xpeng or BYD. I think that matters."

I think there will be a surge of movies goers, movies being exclusive to movie theatres, the attention that this situation has gotten could potentially shift the balance in movie theatres favour for the future. They are also looking into new innovative ideas to bring in revenue. I hope it has a bright future as going to see a movie was something I grew up with and have fond memories of.

2021-05-16 00:45:44,wallstreetbets,"Due to local fluctuations in the tropopause, the jet stream has been shifting rapidly in a counterclockwise vector, causing a rapid disincorporation of the Hadley vortex cells in the lower ionosphere. 

Because of this, the geostrophic solar wind balance has deteriorated rapidly in the northern hemisphere. 

In essence, autumnal weather patterns in the western United States will lead to the biggest ornamental gourd yield in recorded history. 

Investing in gourd agricultural futures could likely produce up to $1600 per day in passive income. 



However, investing at the apex of the curve would be the most conducive to profit as the arbitrage (particularly 12b-1 fees) will develop at a market share higher than the back-end load. 

Basically, no one will be able to buy the stock at a higher price than you, and all value invested will be retained. 

A preliminary market penetration investment of $50,000 would be most efficient in generating this revenue."

A few days after the whole squeeze started to get absolutely out of control and there were like 200k comments, the mods put up an unpinned thread during the night shift. Only the regulars found it amid the chaos and there was this beautiful 3-4 hour span that felt exactly like how you feel reading the epilogue of a great epic book where everyone comes together one last time to reminisce, realizing that we‚Äôd never be back.

2021-05-16 15:00:15,wallstreetbets,"Fed recently decided not to extensively concentrate their regular asset purchases at the short end of the yield curve. Rather, they are now distributing the purchases throughout the curve - more towards the longer end. This will make the long end less prone to spikes as we have recently seen. Also explains why it has been falling the last few days. On top this, even the bond market is now legitimately participating in LT bond purchases, given that the recovery hasn't been as explosive as it was initially expected.

This will make the dollar fall and real yields fall. Good for equities, especially QQQ. In commodities, should help gold experience an uptrend.

These taloned, tusked, and single horned beasts emerge every Zerl, specifically when the three moons of Remulak align. When his turn comes to enter the arena Beldar doesn't know what to do, so he does what he's good at it. Golf. He strikes the ball into the Garthok's throat, choking it to death.

This is an allegory we can all relate to. You have to step into the arena, and you should do it fearlessly on a foundation of skills you believe in. If you believe in yourself you can slay any beast. Be like Beldar."

2021-05-16 13:27:33,wallstreetbets,"You look up from weed eating, through grass-covered clear goggles, and notice the riding mower your dad is on isn't moving. You approach him from behind and ask, ""Out of gas?"" But as you come around and look him in the face, you find him crying. In 34 years, this is maybe the second time you've seen him cry. ""Whoa, what's up?""

He doesn't know where he is, he says. He doesn't remember getting on the mower; he doesn't remember you coming over to help him around the house. He's had another ""mini stroke."" Such a cute name for such a torturous thing. Since he got diagnosed with cancer, you've learned a lot of terrible things about what it does to a body, like how it ""thickens the blood."" He's been having a lot of these mini strokes. The doctors *think* they won't do lasting damage to his brain, but they don't comment on the lasting damage that you'll have from finding your father--the strongest person you've ever known--crying like a baby.

You help him off the mower and ask him if he wants to go to the hospital. He doesn't. He just wants to go to sleep. So you let him. You don't know if that's the right choice, but you decide to let him do whatever the fuck he wants.

As you close the door to his bedroom, you open your Robinhood app. Down again. New all time lows every day. You sigh at the cancer in your portfolio, the cancer that is SPY options. But what choice do you have? Your family can't afford his treatments--each pill, taken once a week, is $2500--so you're trying to get lucky. You're trying to buy his survival.

You casually notice United Health is up again. Why wouldn't it be, with what you pay for coverage, and with how little they actually cover?"

60F Mildly Cloudy

[The French Laundry](https://imgur.com/a/Q8Pe9Mc) is truly the absolute pinnacle of American cuisine. With Thomas Keller at the helm, he has transformed what was once a modest kitchen into the single most recognizable restaurant in America, with his masterful display of cooking with only the finest of ingredients, and illustrating the true beauty of what farms can produce in terms of both produce and meats. 

We begin our meal with appetizers - his salmon cornets basically savory ice cream cones with salmon. Followed, the first dish is his one true classic dish, Oysters and Pearls - essentially the plumpest beau soleil oysters with a sauce of hollandaise and tapioca, with caviar spooned on top to create richness and fresh salinity on the palate.

It is followed by one of the stars of the show, his chilled garden carrot soup - with young coconut puree, shisho, and mint infused olive oil. It demonstrates his mastery over the art of raising crops for his own restaurant, with the punctuality of the mint piercing the richness of the coconut combining with the sweetness of the carrots in order to bring our palates to orgasm.

The next dish consists of the Hawaiian big eye tuna ""A La Plancha,"" a dish comprising of a pan seared round of big eye tuna, with egg mousse, celery, deviled quail eggs, and nicoise olive oil, which really didn't inspire, but was a good experience, with the flavors balanced perfectly and showing off the fickle seasonality of fishing.

Desserts for each one of us consisted of a raspberry roll cake, strawberry and chocolate gelato with a wild berry jelly, beignets, macarons, toffee, and an opera cake with cacao nibs and toffee stripes, as well as a delectable foamy hot chocolate.

This entire experience has only reinforced my love for Keller's cooking, and I only wish I could have experienced it with my knights and men at arms /u/memetron9000, /u/angrysc0tsman12, and u/slugk0."

She would analyze all my picks and call me retarded. I would exit the room and sit on a bench, sobbing. She would finish her weekly update video and come to me after . She would laugh at me and call me a sorry loser. She would tell me to apologize to her for wasting her time. I would mumble 'sorry' but she would push me against the wall and slap me in the face. I would say 'sorry ma'am Woods'. She would instruct me to get on my knees and kiss her shoes, and I would oblige. After kissing one of her shoes, she would kick me in the face and step on my head, pushing my face towards the floor. 'You're pathetic' she would say. 'You're beneath me, boy'. 'I'm beneath you, ma'am', I would reply. She would go around me and sit on the bench. She would take off her shoes and wiggle her toes. She would instruct me to get up on my knees and face her, and then she would throw her shoes at my face. She would straighten her legs. 'I want you to kiss my soles, boy'. I would oblige and kiss her tired heels first, then go up the sole and end with the toes. 'I want you to lick my feet'. I would run my tongue on her salty, earthly-smelling soles while she would giggle. 'Come closer' shoe would say. Having me come closer to her, she would spit im my face. 'I thought you'd like the taste.' I would reply 'I do ma'am. It's heavenly ma'am.' 'Good boy'. I would go back and continue licking her feet for a few minutes. 'Alright, boy, that's enough.

2021-05-16 02:45:37,wallstreetbets,"This speaks to me, as i work for a restaurant under a very intense hospitality oriented individual that had a tenure under Thomas Keller. He told me that Keller's intensity was unmatched.

 He taught me that Keller created a dining experience that incorporated the law of diminishing returns. That is, Keller would create a dish with such concentrated fervor, that 3 bites would leave you wanting more, but the fourth bite would be superfluous, and at the end you would be 'just eating.'  Keller knew that we all can appreciate a bite, but once the meal got going we would turn the experience towards each other. Toward our community. So to keep the patron focused on the food, Keller would pull the small plate to entice us with another meme-potential dish, so the whole time we would be pulled into the culinary experience.

Anyways, you understand the paralells that i'm making with our everyday relationships with the economy and the things that we value. Keller was able to enrapture us by providing us with new compelling dishes over and over again."

Went home, pet my dog. Walked my dog, called him a good boy. 

Started drinking, made and ate 3 BLTs, downloaded Subnautica Below Zero (which is excellent) played that for a few hours, continued drinking. I have 3 beers left which I plan to smash in the next 20 minutes,  then I'll probably poop, wash my hands, and pet my dog some more.

2021-05-16 12:47:52,wallstreetbets,Im reading on yahoo that only around 8% of current shares are shorted. Is this still enough to force a short squeeze of 30-60% like what people are saying?
2021-05-16 18:09:48,wallstreetbets,Tempted to buy a bunch of the 9$ or 10$ 5/21 calls...never really tried to make a big risky options play like this...
2021-05-16 18:39:32,wallstreetbets,"I'm really excited about the UWMC possibility which was outlined above. But in such situations i try to imagine what could go wrong.

  
So here's a possible worst case scenario:  
Good news regarding the business, a very nice dividend and an announced 300 mio. share buy-back-program push the price upwards (or at least stops the ongoing freefall a bit). Soon after the lock-up period ends (as far as I know during July), part of the until then locked shares (9 times the current float in total!!!) are brought to the market - on a very high price because of the facts mentioned before. After the price plummets (because of the sold shares and therefore increased float), the company begins buying back the shares at a very low price. The seller of the locked-up shares gets a great price, the company buys some shares back at a good price and all the others lose.  
  
What do you think about that? Could that really happen?  
  
This is NOT financial advice nor have I the knowledge or experience to really judge such situations. Do your own DD and go for the tendies everywhere you want."

2021-05-16 12:55:52,wallstreetbets,"If borrowing costs go up, the cost to short goes up.

The percent of short matters yes, but it's really the unheld portion of the free float that sets the price.

Market beat says 13% short interest but those metrics are dated 4/15 or earlier.

Short borrow costs are updated constantly while FINRA short reports are always delayed.

2021-05-16 00:39:15,wallstreetbets,"Yes, selling options is not for YOLO. But buying long dated options isn't getting you far, is it ? When you buy options you pay a premium over the actual value, over time this premium decays which is the main reason for your gigantic loss.
Selling options is not as hot favourite as I can see on reddit but if implemented correctly it can consistently make you 10-15%(at least) a month. The option buying; the way I've seen in reddit, is like taking a lottery ticket. You won once, that's crazy and exciting but you can't expect it to happen everytime. You'll just burn through your entire earning. There are a lot of strategies for option selling, consider them.

Do all failures to deliver reflect improper activity? After adoption of Rule 204, why are there still failures to deliver?

A failure to deliver occurs when a broker-dealer fails to deliver securities to the party on the other side of the transaction on the settlement date. There are many justifiable reasons why broker-dealers do not or cannot deliver securities on the settlement date. A broker-dealer may experience a problem that is either unanticipated or is out of its control, such as (1) delays in customers delivering their shares to a broker-dealer, (2) the inability to obtain borrowed shares in time for settlement, (3) issues related to the physical transfer of securities, or (4) the failure of a broker-dealer to receive shares it had purchased to fulfill its delivery obligations. Failures to deliver can result from both long and short sales."

I no longer host on vrbo because of this but also their customer service is just not as good. 

I bought more when it dipped back in the 180's, more again in the 170's, 160's, and again now in the 130's. The pent-up travel demand is real and enormous. I simply can't keep up with the demand and volume of messages and have been able to increase prices substantially as have many other hosts."

2021-05-15 22:00:13,wallstreetbets,Cmon man don‚Äôt just say stuff. There aren‚Äôt so many houses that can be bought dirt cheap. Inventory is the lowest in recorded history. The middle class is literally being priced out of buying homes.
2021-05-16 17:37:11,wallstreetbets,Your not factoring in all of the homes that are going to be foreclosed when all this COVID shit is over. It‚Äôs a sellers market right now and it‚Äôs only gonna last till every state removes the no foreclosure and eviction bans
2021-05-16 17:45:00,wallstreetbets,"I guess I‚Äôm just betting that a housing crash doesn‚Äôt happen though. Plenty of states have removed the eviction or foreclosure bans and have had no negative impacts. The housing shortage continues to get worse and worse. I personally think it could be years before things turn around. While many who lost jobs may lose homes, there are simply too many investors snatching up homes because the wealthy continued to make lots of money during covid"
2021-05-16 17:54:14,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that‚Äôs always my like hypocrite point. Like free market 100 percent, but for fuck sake like can we limit the amount of houses a mother fucker  can buy. I‚Äôve made 34 offers on houses and then some dick comes along and offers 20k above asking."
2021-05-16 10:48:01,wallstreetbets,Most people don't buy and sell at the peak dummy. That's not the same as market cap
2021-05-16 18:00:46,wallstreetbets,I felt your pain. I hope you can get one though. I made so many offers too and I think the only reason I was able to get mine was because the listing agent accidentally listed it as a two bedroom when it was three
2021-05-16 14:21:35,wallstreetbets,What the hell does people selling at the peak have to do with market cap. If you had an IQ of over 50 you would realize I meant AMC‚Äôs market cap would be more then the world economy if the share price hit 500k. Market cap is outstanding shares times the share price.
2021-05-16 10:49:07,wallstreetbets,This won't age well
2021-05-16 18:04:44,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs not a good sign lol guess I‚Äôll be scouting out possible listing mistakes. My problem is I have 3 kids so I don‚Äôt have a huge amount of wiggle room on what I want and need. I fully plan on my purchase lasting minimum till kids are grown and gone so I‚Äôm being very particular in a market that‚Äôs not allowing it.

But we have no idea how they get paid by sales tier. For all we know, the sales tiers could be very large. This deal is probably good for Pfizer because they only pay once it is successful and if it‚Äôs not, their loss is limited. I don‚Äôt think this is comparable to a straight equity deal. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong."
2021-05-15 22:14:31,wallstreetbets,"Pfizer didn‚Äôt pay 4.5 billion though. They‚Äôve only given them 500 million to date that isn‚Äôt cost related. Do you have an idea on what the total payout has been from Pfizer in similar types of arrangements? Just to play devils advocate, I could come to an agreement with you to get half of the revenue from some useless widget and agree to pay $1 now and $1 billion dollars if we ever sell a billion of these. We wouldn‚Äôt say the fair value of the company selling the useless widget is 2 billion. So why are you using the 4.5 amount?"
2021-05-16 01:07:33,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre devils advocate argument is fair. To provide more clarification, the milestones are really not that difficult for the company to hit. In multiple conference calls the senior management has called them ‚Äúmanageable and attainable.

You‚Äôre right, it was very smart for Pfizer to protect themselves by making these milestone payments. It also helps them not have to pay everything out in one sitting making this a much easier cash situation for them to manage. 

I‚Äôm not asking you to blindly invest. The 10k is loaded with amazing details and they have a very transparent IR team that responds to investor inquiries. 

Last but not least on the Pfizer note, Pfizer is rooting for them. Their drug rugolix is sold either in support (with) their drug in the case of prostate cancer. And in a combination tablet for endometriosis and uterine fibroids. It makes so much sense they are putting 100 of their already trained urologist sales team on this. 

It‚Äôs a win win for everyone. Pfizer still stands to make a a lot of money as well."
2021-05-16 01:09:59,wallstreetbets,"You really do bring up some great points and I appreciate it! I doubt Pfizer would put up half a billion cash without any confidence in these guys.

It‚Äôs also worth noting Pfizer was an early round seed investor who used to have a right of first refusal (expired). They have been helpful and involved from the start. I imagine they have seen the potential since day one."

Over 100% detaches you from fundamentals and it becomes strictly supply and demand. If they get margin called it will keep rising until people sell and the short % goes below 100% THEN you can start drawing your triangles from there.

2021-05-15 22:05:04,wallstreetbets,"Not 100% on Canadian law so grain of salt but usa/most sane places I've lived, any stock held longer than a year is considered an asset and capital gains tax applies to the sale instead of income tax.

This is super important if you live/pay tax somewhere like Denmark where the income tax ceiling is greater than 50% and capital gains is a neat 22%

Picking the right stock and holding for the right amount of time isn't the only thing to consider when liquidating

If you're curious and want an end to end example feel free to reply here asking or DM me and I can take some time to further break down how to take advantage of a capital loss. If you like self research just investigate the term ""Negative Gearing"" most examples are situated around property flipping but the principal is applicable to all capital assets, eg sell a house (capital gain), liquidate some old FD's (capital loss) less tax payable on the house sale as your total capital gain/loss for the period is reduced.

Or the reverse, bought some land that turned out to be worthless due to contam? Sell it for a complete loss to offset the initial capital price on the land against your GME earnings that you diamond handed to 2023"
2021-05-15 22:22:52,wallstreetbets,"If he sold the whole asset at once yes its one fin year. You don't pay capital gains tax until you realise the value of the asset (aka sell it) at which point you pay tax THAT financial year.

2021-05-16 01:10:11,wallstreetbets,"although I completely agree with the sentiment that GM and F may have caught up to the EV game, I do believe FSR's business model does set them apart from their competition. As a designer for the vehicles, they're less liable to litigation and manufacturers are the ultimate executor for faultiness on the vehicles.   


Now, when accidents/faultiness do occur on their vehicles, the stock will still take a hit, but I don't see it as big of a concern as there has additional cushion for pushbacks... Additionally, by the time the FOXCONN plant is built, EV technology may very well be rounded out and companies like TSLA, NIO, CCIV, have already worked out much of the kinks for FSR to incorporate into their design."

Buddy you‚Äôre not a subject matter expert, have a seat and watch the market but don‚Äôt act like you know anything because you bought some shares that you have clout like a hedge fund manager or some wolf of Wall Street BS. 

Fisker is a great company model for America, period. You small minded pea brains are putting down American Company! Really!?! You put down an American company willing to create American jobs and plans for environmentally sustainable practices to to help pioneer preservation of our world for the next generation of Americans. Fisker gave it all and lost everything about 10 years ago. His previous model required lots of capital given liability of owning all manufacturing responsibility. That model was unable to absorb the cost of research and development and manufacturing product. Fast forward to today, Fisker is the American comeback story to never give up and to overcome challenges. Fisker learned a valuable lesson in his journey (I‚Äôm not talking about his last venture, I‚Äôm speaking to his entire career). I‚Äôm rooting for him because he is focusing on providing a real product to Americans that is innovative, sustainable, affordable. Don‚Äôt be surprised if EV makers start teaming up with Fisker or Tesla or GM. It will happen. What matters most is that we take care of American people, our environment, and deliver a high quality product to show the world that America is the best at everything we set out to do and we don‚Äôt give up.

2021-05-16 02:12:57,wallstreetbets,I [fucked around and lost it all](https://www.reddit.com/user/_Mosquared/comments/mxdonn/hahah/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). Back to the drawing board.
2021-05-16 16:00:36,wallstreetbets,You lose when you give up. Don‚Äôt get emotionally attached to positions and keep searching for truth.
2021-05-16 19:36:56,wallstreetbets,"Strange reality, where truth is seemingly elusive. Less so than prior generations, yet still even now the availability of the firehose of information can be a conundrum in itself, for the modern truth seeker.

Intrigued and grateful at your GME history. Thanks for the early heads-up!"
2021-05-16 02:31:22,wallstreetbets,Steve Jobs was lambasted in media for years. It wasn't until the ipod came that the apple cult really became a thing.
2021-05-16 02:30:27,wallstreetbets,"Most of the groundbreaking stuff was under the hood. Steve Jobs got rid of a lot of baggage and focused on really good core technologies. Oh, and also they went full Unix, which Windows pretty much couldn't so at that point."
2021-05-16 07:42:40,wallstreetbets,"Definitely feels far away, I‚Äôm not looking at it really as an investment just as something I really want for humanity. Of course some reactors for nuclear medicine will still be needed, but the main reason Nixon steered us toward the light water reactors and breeder reactor was to make weapons grade plutonium (and they were developed in his home state of CA). I happen to be registered with the NRC and am responsible for the administration, preparation, storage, and disposal of radio pharmaceuticals. The really cool ones are made in cyclotrons. Not too many people realize that PET scans rely on antimatter emission and annihilation events."
2021-05-16 15:53:04,wallstreetbets,What do you think of palantir ?
2021-05-16 19:31:28,wallstreetbets,"I only stop on day trades as I‚Äôm afraid to losing to a momentary gap.

On the day I was down 20k, so I doubled down. Then I failed to take my defeat and walk. I couldn‚Äôt stomach it. Went from bad to worst everyday."
2021-05-16 19:35:10,wallstreetbets,This is why I shared and why I joined this thread
2021-05-16 19:36:12,wallstreetbets,I have 1
2021-05-16 06:49:31,wallstreetbets,"Long time lurker. Just recently found your dds. Really appreciate all your ideas!

After doing my own dd, opened some positions this week in CLNE, did some scalping on the KMI calls and PLTR. Looking to open on BE this week. Curious if you‚Äôre staying short on DASH since they went on a tear Friday after earnings?

Also, seems like you have a lot of stocks you‚Äôre tracking, saw your comment above about what goes into some of your dd. How much time do you typically spend researching a stock before diving in?"
2021-05-16 08:28:29,wallstreetbets,What time Periode ? Thinking about buying some puts but I‚Äôm not sure for what time period. 2 months?
2021-05-16 12:44:44,wallstreetbets,"If you go back in his comments there is a chain where he goes into his process in detail, from the stocks general story to technicals. I‚Äôm a newb so most of it goes over my head but still very informative"
2021-05-16 11:14:06,wallstreetbets,"Im looking at the July 125 puts, still trying to find a good entry though. If it starts heading down Monday at open or if it rises to test 145, I'll grab them. Right now Im worried after there guidance from earnings that people will see this as a good play even with reopening post covid and might pile back in, so waiting for some confirmation"
2021-05-16 13:05:57,wallstreetbets,"Thanks! Did see that and have it saved, was more curious about how much time he spends going through all of that. He‚Äôs got much more experience at it than I do so I expect to take more time, but would be nice just to have an idea"
2021-05-16 13:31:30,wallstreetbets,Lockout is on Tuesday 5/18
2021-05-15 21:04:59,wallstreetbets,"Not an assumption. Been together for 37 years, married 34. Discussed it during the Reagan presidency.  It's what we want. Some people actually keep commitments. 
The women that I have known, not just romantically, family, coworkers, would get out the long knives if their monogamous man came home smelling like sin and told them I'm committed to you but I'm polyamorous. 
People like to parse words, and redefine them. I prefer to leave words as they have been traditionally defined, that way there is clear understanding. Perhaps we are from different generations, I'll be 60 soon. Gl to you."
2021-05-16 03:01:23,wallstreetbets,"In case you didn't notice, the entire market retracted last week particularly tech. Already back up to $4.90"
2021-05-16 06:20:35,wallstreetbets,That's ain't 7 though is it?
2021-05-16 06:30:13,wallstreetbets,LOL only in WSB do we expect shares to always double in value in a week
2021-05-16 14:32:35,wallstreetbets,I wish you good luck with Nokia.
