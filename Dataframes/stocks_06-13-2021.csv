2021-06-13 19:58:01,stocks,"I would expect deflation at some point but not this year, it's just physics when the economy is overheating and people are spending and borrowing like crazy it's bound to end at some point, what goes up comes down there is not infinite money in the system, however I wouldn't expect it soon, maybe end of Q3 at the earliest. So as for investing in treasury bonds I think it would be a good hedge against deflation if you are worried about it."

2021-06-13 18:27:46,stocks,Check out VTI
2021-06-13 18:15:04,stocks,May want to exchange some of them for vanguards lower fees overtime time
2021-06-13 18:52:52,stocks,"Firstly, I would use https://www.etfrc.com/funds/overlap.php to check if they overlap with each others. 

Secondly, how high/low are their fees? How much would you be paying fees wise for the 10 years you’re planning to invest? Have you considered Vanguard ETFs? (VOO,VTI,VT) extremely cheap with so much diversification. 

Good luck mate!"
2021-06-13 18:24:06,stocks,I'd run these through a comparison and see how much overlap there is. This will be helpful so you can clearly see the tilt you're going to have owning these many ETFs.

2021-06-13 17:28:44,stocks,"While you don't know what to do, put it all in VOO. Diversification into the safest market around. 

Next, get off reddit, all they do is pump highly speculative stock based on nothing but hope, and it's an objective certainty that is not if you lose everything, but when. 

Now, I advise investing in knowledge. You can start for free by reading investopedia. Purchase The Intelligent Investor and Security Analysis, both by Benjamin Graham.

Stay away from YouTube, it just peddles pump and dumps and uses its audience for liquidity. There are an ultra small handful of quality channels I like, but you need to know what you're doing before looking at them.

Honestly, the answer is in the first paragraph. Buy VOO and chill. Go check out r/ETF if you need to learn any more. Just don't be dumb and chase money."

2021-06-13 17:56:54,stocks,"Before allowing everyone here to “help” you trade your money. Take this advice… “Trust no one but yourself. “ In life you take advice from others. What works best for you you use the rest toss away. Same here but this has a caveat. If someone says that you should invest in stock “x” do your own research. So before you go head first into a stock at $10k understand that all money is a lot of money for many. Learn some basics about how to read a company from the [Motley Fool](https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/www.fool.com/amp/investing/how-to-invest/beginner-stocks/) has some good reading. In the meantime I want you to grow your money so find a basic index fund by Googling “US index funds” and put your money there for the meantime. This way your money grows while you educate. Next play the stock market with virtual stock. This is a good method for learning without losing your money if you make some mistakes. Lastly, start small with one stock. Losses of 10% on $100 is $10 but a 10% loss of $10,000 is $1,000. Good luck and happy investing."
2021-06-13 19:10:19,stocks,Fidelity and VTI.  Maybe put 20% in MSFT GOOGL and AMZN.
2021-06-13 17:32:42,stocks,"I agree with the jd’s comment, but also look at different forms of investing. Do you want safe holds, riskier growth, dividends, and fir how long can the money sit. Secondly, educate yourself on market trends and sentiment, currently covid recovery is big and mid process, things like travel, oil, etc are in growth periods. Ignore any statement claiming shorts."
2021-06-13 19:54:37,stocks,Pick only companies you know well and use in real life. When you learn more you can begin to invest in things less visible to the everyday consumer.

2021-06-13 17:37:12,stocks,"Buy US Steel companies. Couple of reasons steel has increased in value 4 X over the past year. There is a supply issue because China is hoarding and taking away VAT incentives for exporters. There is a shipping issue a container shortage containers are not where they should be and transportation costs have 4 X as well. The demand is at a point of paying above spot price and still having to wait for orders to be allocated. This is a case of supply and demand the supply is low and demand is at an all time high which makes for crazy prices.

I don’t think this will resolve anytime soon at least until end of 2021 but more like mid 2022.

Visit Vitards to learn more."
2021-06-13 19:16:56,stocks,Put a small amount in higher risk companies. Check out GLSI - it’s pretty volatile but it’s been carrying my high risk portfolio.
2021-06-13 18:43:59,stocks,This advice is invaluable. I'd literally have 100k dollars more to my name if I had received this advice when I opened my brokerage account and listened to it. Hope OP is a wiser man than I was and follows this recommendation.

Voo is the best bet if you are brand 🆕"
2021-06-13 18:19:27,stocks,"This. Also avoid meme stocks (GME, WKHS, BB, I’ve lost track of all the others at this point). A lot of people jumped into, I wouldn’t say investing, but trading since January and think they can get rich quick. They don’t bother to realize that they need to pay capital gains on all profits. There are also a lot of posts that people claim to put their own DD, but are really just trying to pump the stock. Any advice you’d get from someone else on a particular stock might not meet the same criteria for you. Everyone has different goals for their money. 

Buy VOO, it’s a safe ETF and it can sit their an grow."

2021-06-13 17:56:43,stocks,">Buy US Steel companies. Couple of reasons steel has increased in value 4 X over the past year.



Ah yes, buy high. A great strategy to get broke quickly. Also investing in one commodity, that's also a very good way to get hit hard when things turn. Sorry to say but anything going up 4x means you missed the train, it's mor eliekly yto go down then increase again especially a physical product. They always go in cycles"
2021-06-13 19:45:24,stocks,Tho I agree with your advice the capital gains thing is dumbest thing ever. Oh I paid 60k in taxes this 40k I didn’t have before is dumb. If you have to pay taxes it’s bc you made money not lost.

2021-06-13 18:04:25,stocks,"The Steel companies have yet to release their earnings with the inflated prices. Once estimates for the quarter is matched most likely passed. We will start seeing $CLF $MT $NUE and several other steel companies dramatic rise in price.

I have compared companies that have similar Revenue and EBITDA they are trading 20 X $LULU for example.

Steel companies are way undervalued atm. And steel companies are much more strategic than a overpriced sweatshop brand. But this is a cycle and eventually it will fade once demand is met. But like I said I can't see that happening for a while."
2021-06-13 19:47:53,stocks,"To any normal investor, yes. To those that don’t understand it will most likely take the money and blow it rather than set it aside."
2021-06-13 19:56:24,stocks,I guess but I see that reason for not investing in something a lot and I just think it’s horsecrap. Lol but like you said I don’t think about the person who got the 100k and buys a car
2021-06-13 19:57:34,stocks,"We’re on the same page, my example was more a specific few. But you’re point is valid. If you take a big profit, it’s still a profit even after taxes."

I'd suggest you research the previous industry leaders and their current stock prices before deciding things are safe. You won't find many stock that dropped over 60% that didn't look awesome at the high."
2021-06-13 17:14:39,stocks,Over time you are right (at least with leveraged S&P500 ETNs) but leveraged ETNs go down at the same multiplied rate so it takes some serious conviction. I’m no expert though. I bet there’s more to it than that.
2021-06-13 16:48:43,stocks,"I think a few of these are overpriced, but not necessarily bad positions. For example, I think XPEV is worth about $24/share right now. With that in mind, I think it's fairly obvious it's the best EV player in China, and by extension one of the best globally. If you're genuinely in this for 10 years, I think price is more negotiable, but I'm not buying at this price.

I'll say, 90% of my portfolio is currently in commodities. Mining, PMs, and oil. Barrick is a not  insignificant portion of that. So you can guess my opinions on that holding.

I think all together, you don't have fantastic deals, but they're well thought out, and for long term investing, I think you'll leave happy with the outcome. Sometimes fair deals are all you get, and there's nothing wrong with that."

2021-06-13 16:55:07,stocks,Thanks. Yea I think XPEV is a good choice but I intend to hold for quite some time. I'd say 10 years I could deal with. I'm not to bothered about making insain gains. But as long as after 5 - 10 years I come out with a fair profit I'll be happy.
2021-06-13 16:57:00,stocks,Thanks not heard of aso will research.
2021-06-13 16:58:32,stocks,"At the end of the day man, I'm just a guy with an internet connection. I believe in my evaluations because they're mine, but if you like something, don't let me sway you. I've missed plenty of bull opportunities. I do think that you'll end up happy with the outcome of XPEV over the next 5-10 years, even if I think it's a few dollars over priced. Profit is profit, and I think it's smart to not try to squeeze out every last percent gain, and just buy quality positions. Good luck friend!"
2021-06-13 16:09:25,stocks,"I've not had the others, but Bloomberg is absolutely worth the subscription. I stream Bloomberg TV pretty much 24/7, get daily briefings before market open and after close, breaking news usually an hour or more before other places pick it up, and dozens of market specific articles daily. It's not going to give you any ratings or analysis or tell you when to buy, it does require a little thinking, but I've learned more from following them over the years than from any other information source.

2021-06-13 18:18:02,stocks,"You could just set it up in an account and then gift it to them in a year, provided the total is less than 15000$ at the end of that year there shouldn't be any tax implications there."
2021-06-13 18:44:22,stocks,"UTMA/UGMA. It’s a custodial account that would be in your name until he turns 18 or 21 (depends on the state you live in as to when it officially becomes their property).

I’d personally suggest Fidelity or Schwab (rather than RH or Webull), but that’s just me.

Could check out Fidelity as someone else mentions, but if it isn’t an option to get him his own account just yet the UTMA/UGMA option is likely the easiest way to get there."
2021-06-13 17:39:57,stocks,No point of stock trading at your age. You should just buy and hold.

2021-06-13 17:27:13,stocks,"Yes tax free, just don't daytrade. There is no official term on how CRA defines daytrading.

2021-06-13 14:34:03,stocks,"I guess it says it's the problem that I'm having overall


I just bought a few grand worth of AMC inside that brand new tax free savings account, so nowhere near my contribution limit nor will I ever contribute enough to get near it.


But you're telling me if somehow AMC puts tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars in my pocket it can all be sold back into that account and I don't get taxed a penny!?!? 🤔


That just can't be right can it?"
2021-06-13 17:25:08,stocks,"1. Correct.
2. Yes. If your investment goes up and you sell, the growth does not change your contribution room. HOWEVER, if your investment goes down and you sell, you do not get that contribution room back.
3. I feel like this is the same as question two or I'm not understanding your question. After you sell your shares, it's not growing anymore (for you). The difference between what you sell the shares for and its book value (what you paid) is your profit and it is not taxed, ever.

Important to note there are many trading methods that are not permitted inside of the TFSA, such as options trading. Also look up the rules on day trading or professional trading within your TFSA as you could lose your tax free privileges if they think you are doing this. Look up these important questions for yourself [here](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4466/tax-free-savings-account-tfsa-guide-individuals.html) because I could be wrong on something."

2021-06-13 14:28:08,stocks,"Just to piggy back on OP question, what about non registered accounts — what if you make a bunch of trades and end up with a $1000 profit, do we only pay taxes on that amount? Or is it possible to end up getting screwed from the number of trades"
2021-06-13 15:47:23,stocks,"Careful though, the CRA says TFSA should only be used as investments and not for trading. 
There is no hard rule what differentiates between the two, just a general guideline. So you may want to avoid swing trading and definitely avoid day trading in your TFSA. 

Again no hard rule, but if the CRA determines you are using your TFSA for trading, expect to pay taxes and a penalty. Kind of annoying there is no clear cut way to know if you are breaking the rules, but I would stay on the side of caution.

I personally use my TFSA for long term holdings and the meme stocks in personal since I am in and out of them frequently."
2021-06-13 15:06:00,stocks,"It can, and it's why TFSAs are literally the only thing our country has going for it at this current point in time."
2021-06-13 17:35:40,stocks,I could be wrong but I think if you invest in American companies and sell you’re automatically taxed on gains. It is only tax free if you’re investing in Canadian companies (tsx)

You make $60k this year and profit $1000 from stocks. Now your yearly income is $60,500.

There are capital losses, too, which you can subtract from your income to pay less taxes, but I'm still learning how they work."

The IRS will automatically take 15% (this includes Canadian etfs that hold American companies). I can’t find any articles about being taxed when selling. Sorry for the confusion
2021-06-13 17:48:53,stocks,"Thanks


My real problem is that I have a bunch of my portfolio in a personal account because I fundamentally misunderstood what a TFSA did. Now the only way to get into the TFSA is to liquidate and then rebuy inside my TFSA :/




Needless to say every penny of stock investment going forward will happen inside my TFSA right up until my max contribution"
2021-06-13 19:18:24,stocks,"Day trading is buying and selling in the same day. If you swing trade regularly, that will also be considered business activity and your account will be audited and you’ll have to pay income tax on your gains."

2021-06-13 16:44:56,stocks,"Do you have a job?  Roommate? 

Do you want to live comfortably now, or invest in the future? 

There are also multiple wide-ranging ETF which pay nice dividends, like 8-9%. 

$12k at 8% would give you $80 a month to help with living expenses. 

Since you are here asking for  advice, and not on WSB, you likely have a long-term goal of income. Look at FIRE strategy. Go cheap. Really cheap. No alcohol, tobacco, restaurants, do -ride a bike, get a job (especially if you can get a job at the school or something connected to your degree), eat beans, fruit, vegetables at home (potatoes, carrots, onions, garlic makes a nice dish). Cut back on mobile phone, don't buy a new one, cut out all of your expenses - pretend like everything is 10x the actual price since it actually will (at retirement). 

You can do like others and get the student loans, and buy those ETF and pocket the difference in interest (e.g. dividend of 9% and loan at 6%)."
2021-06-13 13:59:15,stocks,"Sell a covered call every week/month for income. You will also collect dividends on your shares every quarter. Don’t cash out of the market unless you absolutely have to. I wish I had started investing in college! You really don’t need to be worried about diversification at your age either. Of all companies, AAPL is one of the last I’d be worried about being consolidated in right now due in part to the massive amount of cash they have on hand. It may not make massive gains like the current meme fad but you won’t lose it overnight either."
2021-06-13 15:45:47,stocks,"Keep the stock. Get a student loan or get a job at Wendys. Once you are out of school, you might need the financial cushion the stock gives you, or use the proceeds as a down payment on a house."

2021-06-13 19:41:19,stocks,"Because of the short time line i would not recommend selling to reinvest in something else. If possible -get a job and keep the shares. 
If you do need to use the shares for bills- you will pay capital gains tax. There are lower taxes if you can hold them for a year. I believe it would be holding for a year after they were gifted. But talk to your dad ( or mom) who may well know about how you would be taxed on them."
2021-06-13 15:47:57,stocks,You could sell the shares and buy one option contract about 580 days out and it will only cost you about $1930 in extrinsic value (if you buy a strike at the current stock price… ATM).  That gives you about $10k cash while still holding about 50 shares out of the gate (delta hedged).
2021-06-13 14:13:41,stocks,"I assume these are in some kind of long-term acct like a Roth IRA?

If So. Yes. You would have a tax and penalty to withdraw on any profit/income (which, depending on age of the shares, could be quite a bit of it.). 

It’s likely not worth it to consider touching it right now. If you want to diversify WITHIN the account, fine, but don’t take it out. 

Selling covered-calls is not a bad idea IF you are comfortable with that. Just don’t price it in a way you risk losing the shares. 

Loans are probably your best bet. 

Avoid the temptation to borrow more than you need. Look for general scholarships, housing grants, or housing programs for students."
2021-06-13 15:45:19,stocks,Yes definitely this. Don’t sell your only appreciating assets just to pay rent. Manage time better and get a job
2021-06-13 14:13:27,stocks,"No, frfr, OP I am a 2nd year Sr. And I invest 20% of my student loans every semester and I live off of them. Plus, I work side jobs. If I was you I would leave those shares alone. Invest in some safe ETF’s like the ones you mentioned was great. I would never get rid of an asset to cut a longterm expense. I would generate a new asset however to cover that expense. For every expense you have try to have an asset to pay for it. This is the best way to stay debt free! 

Best of Luck"
2021-06-13 17:27:26,stocks,Can you give me some good examples of ETFs that pay 8-9% dividends?

They should sell what they need for rent and let the shares rock IMO."
2021-06-13 16:37:05,stocks,Sell monthly CC. Weekly nets too little premium
2021-06-13 14:14:08,stocks,I was thinking about a covered call but never thought about a weekly one. I think my main goal is to persevere this money because it is literally my rent and living. So that’s why I wasn’t sure having 100% portfolio in AAPL is a smart move
2021-06-13 14:17:26,stocks,This is the way!
2021-06-13 14:13:58,stocks,Isn't getting assigned on those apple shares the equivalent of cashing out of the market?
2021-06-13 17:11:28,stocks, I believe taxes will be due when you decide to make any change of stocks into cash (paper hands).
2021-06-13 15:41:57,stocks,Sounds like a bens IRA or UTMA account but not sure unless OP clarifoes

I think 200 or 210 is a good entry point if it goes down again. Its being going up after the inflation scare. Every time there is a sell off, SQ will normally go down 2-3%. And recover around 4-5% in the following days. So I feel like a lot of the other tech stock that got gutted last time, there is a huge increase recently.

Im bullish that it will keep up going up. But I think a better play is to wait for a selloff, normally SQ will drop around 2-3% in any sell off or inflation scare."

That's not how turnaround stocks work. Turnaround stories are about recognizing a beaten down company at the beginning of it's rebirth. Usually it takes years for these investments to pan out, and a solid analysis that the company truly is revaluing its fundamentals. 

GME is already way past a turnaround story valuation, and has exceeded fantasy. Fuck the Moon, GME is in stonk heaven ATM. But it can't stay there, because everything seeks it's fundamental value in the stock market."

To be frank, I got in back in January for the squeeze 100%. I knew absolutely nothing about stocks or the stock market. In 6 months, I've learned about as many aspects as I can, including ways that stocks can be manipulated. I've poured through SEC filings, broker check filings, news articles, etc. I'm coming from a place that if it is to be considered a gamble, it's the most asymmetric I've ever seen. I'll remain in GME after too.   


That sub might come off as cult like or a bunch of dumb people, but I'd argue that some of the research coming out of there will be studied for a long time after all this."

&#x200B;

You're completely right, the whole situation is irrational, but we didn't start it or break laws, they did. If the US has any hope of keeping the stock market with any sort of credibility, then game already over and it's just a war of attrition. Costs retail nothing aside from the entry ticket to hold. Costs them more and more to keep shorting the stock and digging their hole deeper.

How do I know that I won't be holding? Because as a group, we've been through days/hours that it's gone up $100+ and then dropped in half within a half hour (March 10. Marketwatch accidentally posted the hit piece a few mins too early). 

Because the shareholder meeting confirmed that 100% of shareholders voted (there was a LARGE campaign to vote early and votes can't be over 100% so they're trimmed. A lot of people couldn't vote through brokers either).

 I've had days when I've been down hundreds, but I've been green for a while now and many days up 100% of my investment. I just know what I have and so does that sub who probably own at least one copy of the float. I know and many others know that when you take a short position, you're exposing yourself to infinite risk. I know and many others know that the only way that they can close is to buy the shares back. 

&#x200B;

In order to get the price where they did last year, it requires more than 100% of the company's shares to be shorted. Rather than cover and take the L, they disabled the buy button and lied about covering. The absolute worst fight they could've picked was against gamers. We're petty, vindictive, and we go for high scores no matter how many times we lose. 🤷‍♂️🤣🤣"

It's currently listed as $ACTC, but the merger vote passed overwhelmingly on Friday and it'll be de-SPACed and listed as PTRA on Tuesday. Here's another comment I wrote about it a couple days ago:

>A lot of things, but to keep it brief: they’re selling shovels (batteries and charging stations) in a gold (EV) rush. Unlike the majority of SPACs, it’s already a functional business with a steady stream of revenue. Commercial EV represents a vast untapped market — estimated $260b right now — and Proterra currently serves HALF of the market (front runner status). 

> The Biden admin has already made it very clear that investing in this sector is one of their central priorities — Biden had a virtual tour of Proterra HQ to promote the infrastructure bill not too long ago. Commercial EV has been largely overlooked in favor of flashier companies like Lucid or Tesla, but it has the potential to be really big. American-made definitely helps with Proterra too.

> I think a large reason why this stock has been overlooked in recent months is simply due to SPAC hate, which is understandable with so many bad ones abound. However, I believe th****e stock has real potential of taking off once it officially is de-SPACed on Tuesday and becomes Proterra (PTRA).

PSTH: Bill Ackman’s SPAC hybrid that will be buying a stake in Universal Music Group. Very profitable and established business. The kicker is that you also get shares or warrants in Bill’s next 2 mergers. So potentially 3 stocks for 1 SPAC. Complex deal, but could pay off big. Research the details before jumping in.

Personally, I’m banking long term on genomics. There are a bunch of companies dealing w MRNA and CRSPR. Some already have the hype price built in.

Why im bullish? Governments are rolling out carbon pricing on all industries, but also temporarily offering carbon credits to businesses that attempt to offset their carbon footprint. This carrot on the end of a stick is getting companies to allocate a small amount of the budget to replacing emitters, improving efficiency or developing carbon capture. 

I see the first area to improve is short point to point transportation. Think low millage daily users such as busses and delivery trucks. These vehicles are used alot in cities which are also the best place to develop electrification infrastructure near term. Cities will fast track these projects in an effort to clean up smog and attract outside investors.

Cant say RMO or FCEL or CHPT or whatever will end up being the biggest gainers but might be worth making a small bet on."

In terms of UAL as a recovery play, it still has a good amount of room to grow. It remains down about 40% from their pre-COVID price. I’m not sure about any additional share issuing though.

My wife has an account and use to be bought into a Canadian silver mining company (OTC-AVLNF). $AVLNF did a mandatory buy back a little while back for all their paper and non-brokerage shares. It was clearly stated that the buy back was optional for shares owned through a brokerage. When time came, all of a sudden her shares were gone and she was hit with the $38 fee. We called and asked WTF, but nicer if course. The first and second level of support gave us the same answers ""We don't read the release the same way so your shares are gone"" ""As far as we are concerned it says you have to sell"" 
If I could have reached through the phone and beat the shit out of the second guy, who was super smug about it, I would have.

Only two minor issues I've ever had: One failed bank transfer resulting in a cash call (new account that connected fine, but fund transfer failed, likely due to bank's 2FA process), and a delay in Level 1 Options trading (which I probably fat-fingered during the application process, so that one's on me).

Overall good experience so far.

You have to append your auth code to your password in the same box.  This is really annoying if you have a password manager, because it will always think you've changed your password, and also pasting a code into the end of a filled password box is kinda glitchy.  Fidelity doesn't have quite as good a UI as E\*Trade, but as an actual broker their order fulfillment and fees are slightly better, and they implement 2FA in a sane way, with its own box after you've entered your password."

They made me sign an affidavit… They made me get a police report… I wish I didn’t even go to them for help. That’s all I did. I went to them for help. The man who is helping me told me there were three red flags on my account. Whoever logged in had four failed logins… They looked at my profile for some reason. He said that was a red flag.

They kept coming up with bullshit excuses that made 0 sense on why ""they couldn't proceed with the request"". Literally spent 8 hours on the phone to hear customer service reps contradicting themselves from one call to the next. I started having serious concerns about them being a scam company during the process. 

On top this horrible experience, they told my partner she would need to open a new Etrade account to be able to actually trade stock (i.e. the account my partner has is only allowed to keep her employers' stocks paid as part of her benefits - said stocks cannot be sold or traded...). Meaning, the idiots at eTrade care so little about business and clients that they are not even making it easy for someone that was forced into using the platform to stick with it ... no big surprise we decided to move all mature shares to another, serious, broker.

2021-06-13 12:33:54,stocks,Buddy of mine used E*TRADE but only because the broker he started using in the 80s got bought by them. They gave him a shit ton of perks like free trades.
2021-06-13 13:17:25,stocks,Was super stoked with the web based trading platform until it shit the bed for thousands of users one morning due to an “upgrade”. Ended up costing me money because it was right at market open when I was planning to exit a trade. I called customer support and was on hold for 13 minutes. Needless to say I moved everything to TD and haven’t looked back. Customer service is night and day. I went from being on hold forever and talking with people that clearly hated their job to short wait times and pleasant/helpful personnel.
2021-06-13 12:41:14,stocks,"I’ve used Robinhood, Webull, Ameritrade, fidelity, and E*TRADE. E*TRADE iOS app is excellent and I prefer that to all the other apps I’ve tried. Also, there are a few otc stocks that I can buy there that I can’t on webull. Great for looking up option prices too."
2021-06-13 15:23:10,stocks,"Used E*TRADE since roughly 2013-2015. First and only Brokerage. They have been there for me as a broke college kid trading 300 dollars to a professional with a hefty chunk tied up in them and I feel confident leaving it there. I’ve never paid fees for trades unless they were silly Chinese companies or something and I do get the $38 SPAC fee but come on, I’m hodl my SPaCs anyway so I just charge that to the game. So in nearly a decade I have nothing but good things to say and I do trust them. But I’ve never had an issue and had to go through customer service and I recognize that can be the downfall."
2021-06-13 11:43:32,stocks,I use E\*TRADE & IBK for stocks on the Australian and London exchanges.
2021-06-13 19:40:52,stocks,Fidelity blows.  Their app is basically a mobile website.  Go with Webull.
2021-06-13 12:25:58,stocks,"i use webull. i never see us mentioned anywhere but after i learned the app, i liked it better than fidelity"
2021-06-13 13:00:46,stocks,">the the UI is good

DISAGREE!

I have used it for years and I HATE the UI.  It looks like it was made in 2003 and hasn't changed.  The mobile UI used to be pretty good but now it's shit!"
2021-06-13 14:09:07,stocks,I use etrade it's ok
2021-06-13 14:40:14,stocks,"It’s UI is also very ugly on all platforms, fwiw"
2021-06-13 14:57:51,stocks,They are just overall terrible too.
2021-06-13 15:29:59,stocks,"Horrible website, like it’s from the 90’s"
2021-06-13 17:12:41,stocks,"It comes and goes, so it don’t matter.  Fidelity is the Go!"
2021-06-13 17:22:40,stocks,Because it sucks ass
2021-06-13 19:59:12,stocks,"I use ETrade. Very happy with it. Handful of trades a quarter, almost all fee-free these days."
2021-06-13 12:43:50,stocks,"They are terrible for day traders because their execution is slow 

Terrible for short sellers as you dont have control over your borrowed locates, and you get a hefty bill end of month

Terrible for customer support, last time they went down cost me a lot of money, took them 4 hours to restore

It's a dinosaur system run by old school leadership"
2021-06-13 12:55:39,stocks,"Etrade is like the older and outdated modest brother. He's not flashy and doesn't have super cool features - just gets the final job done with non existent ""nice and flashy"" features"
2021-06-13 14:14:37,stocks,"RH has the best ui, simple, easy to use."
2021-06-13 13:51:52,stocks,Morgan Stanley bought ETRade recently as MS wanted to have an online platform. I am sure the integration will go smoothly....................................................................not.
2021-06-13 11:57:30,stocks,How is the mobile app? 🤔
2021-06-13 12:21:45,stocks,I've heard and experienced boomer brokers with comparably bad UI's to be much more reliable idk
2021-06-13 13:03:59,stocks,Etrade is fantastic
2021-06-13 13:07:48,stocks,"I have both E*Trade and Fidelity. E*Trade has easier and more friendly interface, plenty of resources and Pro is great. Fidelity gives you better price for purchases when it can and it credits your account. I have had no issues with either. There are many stocks that you can buy on Etrade that won’t show up on Fidelity. Options fees are about the same in both."
2021-06-13 13:29:23,stocks,"1. I like TD because they have brick and mortar locations Were I can address issues.  I use think or swim on  the PC and tablet and tds app on my phone, both have advantages for certain task.    I have thought about opening a fidelity account as well were I will establish long holds and use TD for short daytrading.  What my biggest concern about what I call candy trading apps like robin hood  Is they sell real time data to the people betting against us and even using our assets to play against us if you don't turn off the sharing or if you use margin."
2021-06-13 13:58:08,stocks,Thinkorswim is actually a good tool!
2021-06-13 14:18:04,stocks,I love fidelity use it for brokerage and accounts for my nephew and nieces and IRAs. They always show you if there is a fee when you make a trade and only happens if the fund you are buying has one.
2021-06-13 14:19:21,stocks,What about Ameritrade guys??
2021-06-13 14:29:00,stocks,"They are one of the brokers that takes the highest amount of pfof from citadel, etc for options and also don’t tell you price improvement like fidelity or Schwab for stocks as it’s probably way less"
2021-06-13 14:36:26,stocks,"I use two platforms, etrade and TD Ameritrade. While I am happy with both, I think TD's Think or Swim platform blows everyone else away...once you learn to use it, which does take some time."
2021-06-13 14:41:52,stocks,"I use Sofi and Fidelity. Sofi has a really nice interface, incredibly user-friendly, great customer service and tons of financial products that you can access through one app. Disadvantage is that you cannot trade options. I don’t think the Fidelity interface is nearly as intuitive, but no other complaints."
2021-06-13 14:47:23,stocks,I use it and have been enjoying it.
2021-06-13 14:53:45,stocks,"they were mentioned as one of the brokerages (others being rh and schwab) in the current collusion legal investigation with citadel. i’m really glad fidelity and webull weren’t a part of this. the DTCC knew abt this, making them culpable as well.

allegedly, a member of the DTCC is on the board  of directors at citadel, but the person who posted that info showed no dd or his/her source for that info. i wouldn’t be surprised though, but take that as a baseless claim.

sure, i miss the sleek and easy to use UI of rh, but fuck vlad and those guys. i only trust fidelity 100% with my gme/amc assets regardless of its prehistoric boomer UI. i hold some shares on webull and they just updated to their beta UI. not as good, but being able to trust your brokerage trumps anything else."
2021-06-13 14:58:12,stocks,Because it’s not that great. I have an account with some google and amazon shares and still keep it there but it’s nowhere as nice as Schwab or even Robinhood imo. It’s not bad it’s just not anything special.
2021-06-13 15:06:11,stocks,"I think part of the reason (as someone who has never used E\*TRADE extensively, so no knowledge of customer support, etc.) is that E\*TRADE *was* once one of the highest-fee brokers. There were simply better, cheaper brokers to use, so E\*TRADE was one of the ""expensive"" brokers. Ever since most trading went commission-free, the playing field leveled a bit, but at that point people who are already at other brokers and avoided E\*TRADE due to fees in the past are going to continue recommending their own brokers."
2021-06-13 15:08:13,stocks,I use E*Trade by default because that’s who purchased my previous broker. Now E*Trade has been purchased by Morgan Stanley. Who knows how long Morgan Stanley will keep things status quo. Keep in mind that all brokers that don’t charge fees get paid by someone. That someone are companies like Citadel that pay for the knowledge of everybody’s trades to help them manipulate stocks. E*Trade was suspending trading of meme stocks during the GME volatility. I stay because I know how to use it and  it works for me.
2021-06-13 15:10:55,stocks,I like SoFi and webull
2021-06-13 15:22:23,stocks,TD and thinkirswim are the best
2021-06-13 15:23:11,stocks,"Can someone provide a link to all the hidden fees broker charge?

These would be very helpful to know about and avoid"
2021-06-13 16:01:31,stocks,"E*Trade just hit me with the $38 corporate action fee. 

IPOE bought SOFI 

So I need to pay $38 each time one of my SPAC successfully purchases a business. 

Looking for an alternative. 

Have active accounts at IBKR and WeBull"
2021-06-13 16:20:56,stocks,I'm liking schwab.  Its free trades and good service.  There platform is easy to use.
2021-06-13 16:21:40,stocks,Fidelity
2021-06-13 16:31:31,stocks,I have etrade and have no issues with them to date. Not to say I never will but do far smooth sailing for me
2021-06-13 16:34:47,stocks,You could switch but Robinhood is still best
2021-06-13 16:35:21,stocks,I have used E*TRADE for years and have never had any issues. There could be better options but I do enjoy using E-TRADE. I used it even back when it was a fee for every transaction like $9 or something.
2021-06-13 16:52:21,stocks,I hope the otc of $6.95 gets reversed soon
2021-06-13 16:58:31,stocks,I use it still. Nothing wrong with using multiple brokerages.
2021-06-13 17:06:16,stocks,"I use etrade primarily and I like it generally. For OTC, it is usually 4.95 per trade. RS does bring major fees, as others have mentioned, but that's usually the least of your worries at that point... The UI isn't as good as others. The big advantage of etrade is that my orders always seem to go through quick and easy compared to other brokerages like webull. It can take several minutes for an order on webull to fill while etrade always works instantly. Not sure if this is just coincidence or if etrade is wired better."
2021-06-13 17:20:54,stocks,I have etrade and webull but I heard that because TD ameritrade has Trillions in assets under management AUM that it is the best. Can someone comment on this?
2021-06-13 17:29:02,stocks,They also shit down trading during the meme stocks craze in January.
2021-06-13 17:31:07,stocks,Those fees aside ( which I have not experienced yet) I would highly recommend E*TRADE Pro. I think it’s one of the best platforms out there.
2021-06-13 17:44:21,stocks,Tda is nice as well
2021-06-13 17:46:28,stocks,"I really like power etrade UI on my desktop, but I'm not a heavy mobile trader so not much to speak of there. Like others have mentioned, I do wonder why these financial companies can't make badass UIs.

People were recommending Fidelity & Vanguard because of that fiasco with GME, AMC, etc. for awhile. Some of that is still lingering imho."
2021-06-13 17:51:53,stocks,"the TD iPad app UI is great, sucks it doesn't translate to the mobile app"
2021-06-13 17:54:30,stocks,I switched from Robinhood to E*TRADE and regret it completely. The mobile interface is awful and dated compared with Robinhood.
2021-06-13 18:00:49,stocks,"If you Google best online brokers... E\*Trade will almost always be top 5.

I've had Fidelity and E\*Trade  for over a couple of decades. Still use them both and no issues and have recommended both equally to anyone. 

You'll probably see the nod to Fidelity or Vanguard because Fidelity has a ton of Fidelity funds you can put money into that I believe you could only have access by having an account with. I've actually never heard of people recommending Vanguard as an online broker. Their funds are well known but I believe they can be bought through most brokerages."
2021-06-13 18:04:35,stocks,"They halted buying just like Rh and others , Fidelity and Vanguard did NOT!!!

2021-06-13 18:05:26,stocks,"They don't offer fractional shares, that's about the only con I can think of."
2021-06-13 18:08:20,stocks,"I have both Robin-hood and E-Trade.  However, I think that Robin-hood is more user friendly."
2021-06-13 18:20:26,stocks,"Td Ameritrade though is by far the best in terms of speed and interface and overview of all your positions , in my humble opinion, have used all these others too and Charles Schwab"
2021-06-13 18:24:42,stocks,"My buddies started out on etrade and always had issues. I avoided it. Tried out TD and they were pretty decent. Tried vanguard and HATED their boomer interfaces (they do have the best investment veicles).

Wanted to go over to schwab but my workplace stuff was at fidelity, and they are pretty good, although they could do some modernizing."
2021-06-13 18:32:53,stocks,"Became an ETRADE customer back when they acquired OptionsHouse.  The old OH platform is now Power ETRADE, and I find it a great and powerful mobile app for options.

They also grandfathered my rate, so will probably keep it there for a while, as it’s a pretty solid rate.  Also I like the idea of multiple account types to try and simplify my life some (regular brokerage, robo-account, checking/savoy, etc)."
2021-06-13 18:35:53,stocks,"Same question, but referencing Charles Schwab. I’ve yet seen a recommendation to use Schwab. Reason?"
2021-06-13 18:37:25,stocks,Never had a problem with etrade
2021-06-13 18:40:20,stocks,Etrade is amazing. I use .25 options through a site I am on and everything else except OTC is free.
2021-06-13 18:40:50,stocks,"WOW, I read way down and never saw a mention of IB.  I use it mostly for trading options.  I admit their account management is bad and the screens have a learning curve.  I also trade on my laptop.  There are minimal fees.  Still for real time data and adaptive order entry they seem to be the best.  To me it's results that count. So do you guys hate em or just hate doing research?"
2021-06-13 18:48:30,stocks,"They suck, that's why. Horrible UI. Had them for years but the service isn't competitive anymore, basically no user platform innovation in like 6 or 7 years. Pick another broker."
2021-06-13 18:49:06,stocks,"What about ameritrade,?"
2021-06-13 18:57:23,stocks,I use RH and Etrade. I basically use Etrade to look through stock reports.
2021-06-13 19:00:13,stocks,Anyone with experience using Webull? I'm thinking of adding it
2021-06-13 19:03:05,stocks,I use E*TRADE and have yet to have any problems with it
2021-06-13 19:32:33,stocks,I've thought this too. I've had etrade for years and have zero complaints. I recommend them often.
2021-06-13 19:32:35,stocks,What about stash for trading. The interface is easy to use and their debit card has many pluses on cash back.
2021-06-13 19:41:51,stocks,"E Trade is very good. Use Power E Trade. Like everyone other outlet, it has some serious downsides but I’ve liked them overall for a very long time 

(Side note-I trade everything on cash, no margin, so can’t speak to that aspect)"
2021-06-13 19:46:14,stocks,I am not familiar with E*Trade but they are mentioned in this [June 4 SEC Filing ](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001834518/000119312521183297/d121216ds4a.htm) (page 186) and it doesn’t sound great. I use Fidelity and their customer service is fantastic!
2021-06-13 12:08:42,stocks,[deleted]
2021-06-13 12:51:29,stocks,I use cashapp
2021-06-13 13:27:48,stocks,Why ditch Robinhood? So far I like it a lot. It’s really easy to use and haven’t read anything about extra fees
2021-06-13 13:30:26,stocks,"The name alone sounds like a scam. Like someone in the 90s thought you can just slap an ""e"" in the beginning of any word and now you are a tech company."
2021-06-13 13:27:43,stocks,"They are horrible and I’m learning by personal experience unfortunately. After the GME fiasco in February I transferred from Robinhood to E*TRADE and I regret doing that now big time. As soon as the GME MOASS ends, I’m transferring to Fidelity and leaving E*TRADE. 

They shady
They have tons of hidden fees as the comment above said too. 
Their customer service is horrible, unprofessional and inexperienced. 

Then I went to the rabbit hole to learn who the owner of the company is and I was like 🤮 

So yeah I won’t recommend E*TRADE to No one! I just wish I had chosen fidelity back in February instead."
2021-06-13 13:13:04,stocks,🤔 bc of the bs they do to customers maybe?
2021-06-13 14:05:43,stocks,"Actually, don’t use Fidelity either. I just left them for CenterPoint."
2021-06-13 14:09:39,stocks,I use ETRADE and think it's great. I'm not at all familiar with OTC markets so the fees aren't a big deal for me. Most other trading is free of course
2021-06-13 14:29:05,stocks,I have used Etrade for decades and never an issue at all. I always get customer service on phone pretty quick. Never any outages or delays
2021-06-13 14:52:18,stocks,"Etrade customer for many years here. It's a pretty solid brokerage. Pre-covid the customer service was excellent, but now not so much. I'm hoping they go back to excellent before long or I might leave.

Power Etrade is a good, no-frills tool for basic trades up to and including options spreads. I would never in a million years use Etrade Pro - it's almost as bad as Interactive Brokers' Trader Workstation.

If you trade a lot of options then you might get a better fee structure from TastyTrade (I have an account there too). But for basic stock buying and selling Etrade is just fine. Having a larger account and/or making a lot of trades will also likely reduce the fee structure at Etrade and elsewhere."
2021-06-13 15:44:31,stocks,"I love E*TRADE. They’ve pissed me off minimally in the ~ 7 years I’ve been using them. Not seeing many comments about their price execution.. which IMO is amazing. Most times my limit orders fill above the price I entered, especially on a highly volatile ticker. Customer service is very slow, but I get a quality response/ answer most times. I pay $4.95 per trade on OTC and everything else is free (besides reorganization fees, foreign dividend payouts, couple other things that you’ll rarely run into). Level 2 isn’t as good as TD (which I use on a second device day trading). They have my favorite charting I’ve used too, super intuitive and easy to adjust sizing/ zoom in certain time periods. I always recommend E*TRADE to anyone thinking of getting into stocks."
2021-06-13 15:58:08,stocks,"I use Etrade there are no fees, I have multiple accounts, and there is a free DRIP system it’s awesome and underrated! They even have etrade debit cards you can used for your E*TRADE cash balance if you’re living off dividends.

No fees for buying and selling, there are fees for OTC and options. I don’t utilize those features that often so practically free!"
2021-06-13 17:26:37,stocks,What’s the consensus on Webull?
2021-06-13 12:04:09,stocks,Happened to me too with the 38$ fee. Pissed me off. But was that an E-Trade thing or something with the security or clearing firm etc?
2021-06-13 11:58:09,stocks,holy shit that's horrible
2021-06-13 13:51:48,stocks,Fee for a reverse split or share buy back…I’ve never hear of that wow
2021-06-13 12:21:48,stocks,"The reverse split thing was annoying recently.  But the OTC thing is dependent.  For example, I made a Fidelity account specifically for avoiding those OTC fees.  That's when I realized that certain OTC stocks that aren't up to date on their paperwork aren't even purchasable on Fidelity when they are on ETrade.  

Then I also found out that international OTC stocks like EEENF have a $50 fee on Fidelity but it was only $5 on ETrade."
2021-06-13 13:59:43,stocks,"I'm not sure why you see $6.95 fees on share buy/sell orders. I pay ZERO with eTrade. I place 30-40 orders a month and have no fees. Now, I know they USED to have fees about a year ago but not anymore. I am in the US, buying stocks listed on US markets. So if your refer to options, or something off US markets, then I have no idea. But I have paid nothing for my last 50+ orders.  I've just gone into my eTrade statements and see no fees.  My balances show no fees taken."
2021-06-13 13:36:20,stocks,"Yup. I got screwed on the split fee. Had like 2 shares of Aurora cannabis I forgot about for like 2/3 years. They sent me an email saying I owed them like $30. It was wack as hell.

Immediately closed my account after that"
2021-06-13 15:49:15,stocks,"Are you talking about the reorganization fee? At least for me, they charge you $38 and then refund you the $38 once it is done."
2021-06-13 12:40:58,stocks,"So basically, they robbed your shares to rob you of the profits of the price spike from the buyback and took it for themselves AND slapped you with a fee as an insult to injury.  Got it."
2021-06-13 13:57:44,stocks,"Fidelity is decent, though they dont like letting people trade options, other than covered calls. Customer support just says ""oh well"". I think I might switch to TD but not sure yet."
2021-06-13 13:01:13,stocks,"Schwab does not have hidden fees! NVIDIA splitting close of June21. Think 4-1 begins trading
on split basis July 20."
2021-06-13 12:24:13,stocks,"Hm, I may also move. Never saw the fees. So it sounds like Fidelity is the move?"
2021-06-13 13:33:01,stocks,I’ve had a really good experience thus far with TD ameritrade and love the thinkirswim platform for my iPhone and desktop. Customer service has been good when I have dealt with them which has been probably around 10 times ranging from questions about a hypothetical situation to placing a opening trade on GME due to trading restrictions. They were as accommodating as possible over the phone for making a diagonal open/close trade on GME and they always waive the fees in those situations. Honestly I really like this company and their trading tools and education. The instructors are awesome and they have tons of resources for improving your knowledge. I’d give it a try.
2021-06-13 13:00:58,stocks,"I have etrade and have never been hit by any of these fees or had any of these problems.

Just saying, your mileage may vary. And a lot of the guys getting pissy over OTC fees are gonna lose their shirts on shitty OTC stocks anyhow lol."
2021-06-13 17:23:48,stocks,"If you go paperless with Vanguard, transactions are almost all free."
2021-06-13 12:26:33,stocks,Yeah the fees are well hidden. I'm pretty sure OTC is $4.49 a trade but the worst is when you buy a SPAC as there's a $38 fee when the shares get converted to the new ticker.
2021-06-13 13:58:09,stocks,"Schwab it up. You’ll never go back. I transferred everything to them and couldn’t be happier. (Had RH, Fidelity, & E*Trade)"
2021-06-13 16:28:15,stocks,A fee for buybacks?!  You mean like when Apple buys back shares Etrade literally charges you a fee for it?
2021-06-13 13:35:28,stocks,Paying them a fee for losing money in a reverse split? Thats horrible
2021-06-13 12:58:44,stocks,how could they fuck you for board decisions?
2021-06-13 12:07:09,stocks,"They charge those because they manually have to adjust your account (that part of clearing is not fully automated). Not a reasonable charge, but they're is a valid reason behind it. I think $10 would be fair."
2021-06-13 12:28:07,stocks,Well put. Nothing to add.
2021-06-13 13:03:01,stocks,Using Webull. I’ve found it good so far.
2021-06-13 12:36:24,stocks,"Can confirm customer support is bullshit. I accidentally entered the wrong kind of routing number when I added my new bank account and there is no way to change it. They told me I had to make a new account and sell/buy shares to ""transfer"" them to the new one..."
2021-06-13 12:29:03,stocks,Etrade just sucks!  I speak from experience!!
2021-06-13 14:25:58,stocks,"Sounds like my grief w/ tda, hence my slow migration to fidelity."
2021-06-13 14:37:45,stocks,"They aren't the only ones doing that. I just got hid by the same thing on TD Ameritrade, lost 15 shares of something because it did a 20:1 reverse split and ended up losing 36 bucks due to the processing fee."
2021-06-13 14:55:53,stocks,"On the flip side, I've been using them as a brokerage/IRA for 15 years and as a checking/savings bank for 4 and had zero issues. Used to have commission fees but they got rid of them when everyone else did as well"
2021-06-13 16:12:53,stocks,"Might be better off with robinhood over e*trade, with those kinds of fees?"
2021-06-13 16:24:08,stocks,"Etrade was so bad in so many areas, I was with them for 7 years. I transferred my account to TDA. It's been nothing but good with TDA."
2021-06-13 18:12:57,stocks,"> There is also a $38 fee if a stock you own does a reverse split, share buy back, and a couple things

Wtf

Does anyone else even charge on stock splits?"
2021-06-13 19:38:54,stocks,"Doesn’t make sense if they were mandating buying back all their shares. No offense, no brokerage account would have been able to hold those shares and you should be pissed at the company. 

Coming from me as a licensed rep at another major brokerage it’s your job to sell those shares before the buy back. E*trade basically didn’t earn that $38, it was a charge the company of the stock enacts on the broker/dealer. This is the way those OTC stocks f*ck small investors during mandatory reorganizations"
2021-06-13 14:11:27,stocks,"Those fees are perfectly reasonable.  You’re dealing in OTC and reverse splits stocks, you should pay more than someone investing in McDonalds."
2021-06-13 13:28:27,stocks,WHAT?! Nah that too much for me to ever touch Etrade now
2021-06-13 14:07:36,stocks,"Avoid Merrill Lynch, they are worst than this guys, I moved to TD Ameritrade and so far is amazing, I love their thinkorswim app"
2021-06-13 16:51:12,stocks,doesn’t apply to new accounts
2021-06-13 12:01:29,stocks,Yeah. How hard is it for a billion dollar company to create a competing UI to Robinhood?
2021-06-13 12:07:07,stocks,"I think a lot of it just has to do with significantly different technologies and complexity. RH was a late entrant into the field and benefitted from having a modern infrastructure. They don’t have a lot of the bureaucratic overhead that the major institutions have grown over the years, and (correct me if I’m wrong) RH doesn’t have numerous different types of accounts (401k, IRAs, college savings accounts, etc) all having different infrastructures all synchronizing into a mobile app. I imagine if you looked at diagrams detailing the systems designs between RH and the big guys (Fidelity, Vanguard, Schwab, TD, etc) you’d see that they’re way more complex and also old.

Not that it’s an excuse, just my best guess. RH is probably just smaller and able to really laser focus on UI while the others have way more components for their tech teams to work on."
2021-06-13 12:07:33,stocks,Etrade just revamped their Android app. The UI doesn't look like a hold over from 2007 anymore.
2021-06-13 12:29:08,stocks,"This is true to an extent however UI is not as important as reliability,etc."
2021-06-13 12:19:58,stocks,I prefer the ThinkOrSwim ui
2021-06-13 12:42:26,stocks,Didnt fidelity announce a new ui similar to robinhoods?
2021-06-13 12:22:03,stocks,Think or swim has a pretty decent UI (though it’s not as accessible as robinhood).
2021-06-13 13:31:28,stocks,TD UI is way better imo and their desktop platform is 100x better. But for the average trader it is likely a bit confusing. Fidelity's app is pretty awful if you're daytrading but Fidelity was not designed for daytraders and they make most of their money off managed funds and managed accounts. Robinhood wants their app to be designed like a casino since they make most of their money off of trading fees.
2021-06-13 12:04:14,stocks,Im on Webull now and i like it a lot. Ive mostly pulled all the way out of RH.
2021-06-13 13:14:02,stocks,I will give RH that. They do have a fantastic UI.
2021-06-13 12:51:54,stocks,"I use TD, but the funniest shit is how everyone was saying to leave Robinhood due to their sketchy practices during the GME run, yet you see everyone clearly still uses it when they post their screenshots lol…. 

Clowns."
2021-06-13 12:37:44,stocks,Looking at you vanguard
2021-06-13 12:21:45,stocks,"That's what these old boomers at the bank don't realize. We just want a decen't UI, give us stocks,  and leave us alone."
2021-06-13 12:52:23,stocks,THIS. I’ve tried leaving RH but every other UI looks like it was designed in 1995.
2021-06-13 12:59:28,stocks,Exactly. It is so easy to use RH and every other platform I try it’s a headache to buy and sell quickly.
2021-06-13 12:48:10,stocks,"You see, how it works is the billion dollar company makes you suck their dick on the corner and charge you for the privilege."
2021-06-13 13:01:46,stocks,I have always used Ameritrade and I really don’t think they have that bad of one.
2021-06-13 13:11:53,stocks,"Fidelitys app is a bit cumbersome but once you get the hang of the layout its fine. Definitely not user friendly, especially not for a beginner. Their customer service is top notch though."
2021-06-13 13:42:02,stocks,Fidelity just released their new beta UI and it’s very close to RH. Still not as streamlined and easy but it’s a huge step better
2021-06-13 13:43:46,stocks,I moved to fidelity but I still pop open Robinhood if I just want to look at something quick
2021-06-13 13:53:35,stocks,I switched to ETRADE after the whole robinhood shitshow earlier this year and then switched back after about a week or two. Except for a few penny stocks I can’t get on RH. Everything about ETRADE seemed so much worse to me and sometimes I make trades that only amount to $30 or $40 so why should I pay a $6 fee to buy and sell when RH doesn’t charge that?
2021-06-13 13:59:24,stocks,Don’t have an address for that corner do you?
2021-06-13 14:16:20,stocks,"Yeah Fidelity keeps trying to add on to their current app but honestly they need to hire a new team to do a complete refactor with talented UX designers. Spend a good amount of time on it, then eliminate the previous app entirely & launch the new one. Their beta trading experience still isn’t very good for whatever they’re doing with that."
2021-06-13 14:34:42,stocks,Fidelity is the bwst and there is no comparison.
2021-06-13 15:01:22,stocks,Because no serious trader trades on a phone
2021-06-13 15:27:19,stocks,Public.com seems to be a good alternative.
2021-06-13 15:43:34,stocks,"Seriously - I don't understand how RH is still in business, fuck their UI - and when you guys eat shit next time, I'll be laughing my ass off.   Listenting to Vlad was all I needed - I've never even fucked with Robinhood and I was in disbelief that people would trust that piece of shit."
2021-06-13 16:09:05,stocks,"I agree RH was a superior UI but that alone shouldn't be enough given their shady businesses. I'd not trust them with a cent, I'd rather use a Windows 95 UI and know my money is safe then a flashy UI belonging to them"
2021-06-13 16:17:51,stocks,"Money in E*TRADE, pocket change in RH for checking stocks"
2021-06-13 16:18:00,stocks,"Agreed , I moved away from Schwab but still I come to RH for price analysis . 

RH UI is exceptional, but those guys are shady ."
2021-06-13 17:56:44,stocks,"Etrade updated their app a few months ago and it's really good. The only complaint is how overly complicated it is. If they had a ""simple"" mode it would be nice"
2021-06-13 18:14:50,stocks,"Yeah, I wanted to move off of RH, bit thwur UI is fucking amazing. All the other options are hot garbage"
2021-06-13 19:47:45,stocks,"For real. They could even do something like coinbase and make a separate app and call their original one pro, and make a simpler more streamlined platform for RH traders to flock to.  Although I think RH is a bit too simple in some areas, especially in charting.  If there was a more feature rich broker app that could make a UI as simple and functional as Robinhood while also adding additional optional functionality, they’d dominate and blow up big time, especially with all the new traders in the past year or so."
2021-06-13 17:46:26,stocks,I agree. If you day trade penny stocks fees would add up fast but they don’t charge very much for options  and nothing for US stocks. Good for 6 month+ positions.
2021-06-13 18:38:58,stocks,"I’ve contacted CS several times, always great service!"
2021-06-13 16:13:22,stocks,whoa whoa whoa.. where is that sir? I like active trader pro but the normal fidelity app isn't great.. what is the new one called? I'll start googling though..
2021-06-13 13:21:43,stocks,"Yup, etrade here too. Over 200 trades in the last 30 days alone and never had a fee they wouldn't waive. They help process paper shares I sent in, worked to receive shares direct from transfer agents at companies, and helped straighten out some basis values on shares I received as comp where the basis value had to be inferred from 1099s. Very happy with etrade."
2021-06-13 12:06:58,stocks,"Can you expand please? Looking to switch to etrade but want to know the fees. When I google things everyone says it’s free, but is it?
Like for example is there a commission fee for selling options?"
2021-06-13 15:42:48,stocks,MFA on E*TRADE is garbage.
2021-06-13 12:20:57,stocks,I'm in this boat as well. I'm not doing anything too complicated though so YMMV
2021-06-13 13:13:19,stocks,Same
2021-06-13 12:13:46,stocks,So fidelity did not freeze during that gme and AMC fiasco?

I wouldn't ever recommend E-Trade, I just don't see a benefit."

The actual message someone posted in screenshot showed they required GME buys to be done via voice trade (presumably to cover their rears with a recording in case people were claiming they didn't send the order or that the pricing wasn't what they expected).  I consider ""must use voice to order meme stocks right near close"" to be a lot different from Robin Hood and others closing down trading entirely for days."

It's a really good app if you're just using it to buy and hold (and don't plan on needing to sell something at a moment's notice — they only have four trading windows per day IIRC) and I like that you can invest on a schedule. If you plan on daytrading or options trading though, you'll need to look elsewhere; there's no way to do those things with Stash.

I use E*TRADE for those things and have no complaints."
2021-06-13 12:41:37,stocks,"> the employer selected it as broker for their employee stock plan

A former employer did this. Anytime I wanted to sell a vested stock grant, they charged me $20 and there was no way around it. This was when the standard charge for a stock trade was $6.95. And all grants were treated separately, so I got hit with $80 (4 x $20) one year. I've heard it's still $20/trade, even though the industry standard is now $0. And as other have said, their customer service was garbage whenever I had a minor question or problem.

In summary: Fuck Etrade (and my employer for choosing them)"

2021-06-13 12:21:29,stocks,It's .....okay. takes some time getting used to and still kind of clunky and confusing sometimes. You definitely have more control but it's not intuitive. I honestly still use robinhood to look up options and stocks then trade on etrade.

2021-06-13 13:47:33,stocks,Lmao they cut off peoples ability to buy certain stock because they couldnt cover their own order flow. Also they make their money selling your order information (PFoF) so bigger fish can see where retail is moving their money. Thats just a few reasons off top of head. I would get out immediately. They have millions of clients in the last 6 months.
2021-06-13 14:10:06,stocks,"Beyond the resentment that people have over Robinhood's poor handling of the meme stocks debacle, RH has far fewer investing tools than any other broker, and worse execution of orders. Market orders typically fill higher, not at best available execution -- for which the [SEC issued a $65M fine](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321) this past December. 

Likewise, Limit orders take longer to execute, because Robinhood routes orders to its preferred market makers -- the ones who pay them the most.

As for the issue of tools -- Robinhood's charting is so primitive, that people have to look up historic info on other sites. And they have a complete lack of stock screening, individual stock news, earnings calendar, etc. 

Robinhood also has a very short pre-market (30 minutes, 9AM eastern) and post-market (2 hours, to 6PM) extended trading window. WeBull in contrast extended trading starts at 4AM Eastern, and ends at 8PM! 

The one area that RH does shine in, however, is making options orders very easy. But that's also what has gotten them into trouble, as they have allowed unsophisticated customers jump in over their head, without providing accurate information-- sometimes with catastrophic results, such as in the case of a 20 year old who killed himself when Robinhood incorrectly showed he had a negative balance of $730,000. They are now being [sued over that by his bereaved parents](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alex-kearns-robinhood-trader-suicide-wrongful-death-suit/).

EDIT: added extended hours window info"

I've never complained about the quantity of OTC stocks available for me to buy — E*TRADE always seems to have everything I've wanted to buy. 

The main thing I *can* complain about is their customer service. While they've always solved my issues no problem (unlike OP), the wait times have often been pretty long. Though that has seemed to get better once I was eligible for the ""Pro"" service or whatever; again, (IIRC) you need a certain amount of money in your account to qualify.

Other than that, I'm pretty satisfied with it. The Power E*TRADE online trading platform is great for my purposes (some daytrading & options trading including more complex strategies, mostly buy and hold though)."

2021-06-13 14:05:15,stocks,I don't trade enough on eTrade to get the reduced rates. To get a reduced or no fee OTC trading on eTrade you have to have over so much invested in your eTrade account or do something like 40+ trades a quarter. I don't hit either if these. Once this incident happened I almost quit completely trading with them. I have very little to do with that account now other than sit and wait.

I know there's a bunch of Robinhood hate but they also were the first to offer commission free trading with no minimum portfolio size. There was a long period of time where you needed a few thousand minimum to start trading stocks.

2021-06-13 12:38:37,stocks,"It is surprisingly hard for large companies to do this.

When you look at all of the large banks, almost all of them are heavily investing in UX talent right now. Seriously, look at their job boards... they're trying to hire lots of UX designers (and researchers, interaction designers, etc). But, that shit takes time, lots of time. You wouldn't believe the amount of work that goes into making something more simple and less confusing. Making big dumb confusing shit is fast and easy!

The problem they all have, that robinhood doesn't have, is massive legacy systems in areas or features that Robinhood will not touch. It's the same advantage Tesla has in the car market. Not having a bunch of old shit to deal with is a huge moving advantage.

Having a moat is usually good, but it can be bad when it limits how nimble you can be when market winds shift. That said, the other car companies are slower to pivot, but when they do Tesla is going to have a tough time competing on things like quality, parts distribution, timely repairs, etc and they'll be the ones playing catch up for awhile.

It's probably going to be 2+ years before many of the big banks have a trading user experience that is half as svelte as Robinhood, and even then it will probably be a new trading product and not a redesign of an existing one.

Since Morgan Stanley acquired eTrade last year, I think eTrade has a good shot at being one of the first to receive a big UI overhaul."
2021-06-13 12:22:43,stocks,You'd be surprised. I've asked RBC twice and they just came out with an even shittier UI. Moving to Questrade soon.
2021-06-13 13:09:54,stocks,"one thing might be just to keep millenials off, younger generations need more minimal and intuitive  UX. So they use robinhood, who fcks them in da a$$"
2021-06-13 12:26:34,stocks,"I think you have the answer.  The other sites have been built on older architecture and become bloated as thing were added along the way.  It’s hard for them to completely revamp their sites for optimal interface, and that of course is a difficult term to define as the array of users want different things.  It’s like you want to build an eco friendly off the grid house.  What’s easier, starting from scratch or retrofitting a place from the 70s."
2021-06-13 13:46:15,stocks,Or Robin hoods business model is to profit from your data and their ability to sway your decisions.  And they have gamified the app to remove caution.   I can't believe  they continue to have users after Jan stunt.    I will not be surprised when it comes out they had been in collusion with the hedges from concept of the app.
2021-06-13 12:30:16,stocks,"Couldn’t be more accurate. I always compare it to road systems in major American cities. Fidelity / Vanguard = Boston in that any significant change to UX or infrastructure is like the Big Dig. Takes 5x as long, costs 10x as much, and people die (kidding)…but all because they’re building on centuries (in the case of Fid or Van, decades) worth of infrastructure. You take Robinhood, which id compare to a beautifully simple grid out in the West - they built their app from scratch on top of nothing AND, like you identified, they offer a fraction of the products that the incumbents offer. Their entire business is predicated on simple, clean UI that offers lower functionality. Vanguard and Fidelity are trying to pare down excessive functionality into modern experiences now - they’re starting to work with new customers (think Robinhood, WSB, etc.)"
2021-06-13 13:43:54,stocks,"iPhone too. And its dark mode looks quite good.

The Power E\*Trade platform is pretty good too IMO, web app & phone app alike. It's not *as* intuitive as RH, but it's definitely up there."
2021-06-13 17:52:00,stocks,Why?
2021-06-13 13:04:15,stocks,"I’m in the beta mode for their new UI and I really like it. I do think it’s pretty similar to Robinhoods and if they put more effort into it, it will definitely be getting better than Robinhoods"
2021-06-13 12:14:09,stocks,I like Webull a lot for my “stupid money” account. I use TDA for my real account that I hardly do any transactions in. But Webull works great for me for tracking stocks and buying and selling options.
2021-06-13 12:07:54,stocks,Webull is what I mostly use for non-retirement investments too
2021-06-13 12:07:24,stocks,Same here. Only thing left in Robinhood is my fractional shares that didn’t transfer to Fidelity.
2021-06-13 12:14:17,stocks,Same here. I'm mainly in fidelity at the moment but am planning on moving some funds over to webull for day trading.
2021-06-13 13:03:43,stocks,"I really enjoy webull, only using it for a tiny option account. Doesn't seem to be highly recommended though either."
2021-06-13 14:13:17,stocks,I looove their price alert feature holy moly.
2021-06-13 13:15:39,stocks,"I almost exclusively use Robinhood to check the status of shit I bought on another platform.

Because I don't necessarily need all the information all the time, and Robinhood pulls up the info in my watchlist into the first screen you see."
2021-06-13 14:24:09,stocks,"I have my <insert coin that’s illegal to say on here> on it, so I’m literally stuck there until I cash out. But I’ll continue to keep it on my phone to monitor my stocks that I have in Fidelity because the UX is 5000000% better. I don’t blame people who still use it, they should be more than aware of the risks and sometimes moving a position is riskier than just staying put."
2021-06-13 13:59:57,stocks,"Vanguard has a new app in beta call beacon, UI is not as good as robinhood's but it's better than their old app. Plus they seem to be slowly improving their web interface, their buy/sell interface is more modern looking than their older one."
2021-06-13 12:49:41,stocks,"I literally use RH just to watch the stocks I hold
through Vanguard. The vanguard app is a hot mess and it only updates every 20 minutes. 😐"
2021-06-13 12:40:31,stocks,"When you wake up and go to work, do you do your job for free?"
2021-06-13 19:48:04,stocks,"Look for ""Fidelity Spire"""
2021-06-13 12:13:52,stocks,"It’s free to set up. There are no fees to maintain an account, no monthly payments. Just when you buy or sell there can be a $5.99 fee.  I would go to their website and read the FAQs there. If it’s still unclear they do have live customer support."
2021-06-13 12:16:28,stocks,"$6.95 for OTC trades, which drops to $4.95 after 30 trades (Any trades, OTC or not) I don't mess with options so can't speak to that."
2021-06-13 12:17:13,stocks,It's free for stock buys/sales unless it's an OTC stock. Those are $6.95 per trade I think. Options are 50¢ per trade.
2021-06-13 13:51:20,stocks,Live market data is $130 / month
2021-06-13 17:31:00,stocks,".50 cent flat rate for options, buy or sell and $4.95 for OTC buys and sells. Bigger stocks are all free.

Also before you complete any trade it will show you total price of the transaction and include the fee if there is one."
2021-06-13 13:50:09,stocks,Fidelity and vanguard both saw 0 interuption in trading (website lag issues aside anyway). Almost every other broker you can name disabled at least buying.
2021-06-13 12:27:54,stocks,I think Fidelity did freeze GME. A lot of brokerages did.
2021-06-13 12:09:26,stocks,"They may not of halted but TD Ameritrade did act wonky. Couldn't log in, froze and glitched during January squeeze."
2021-06-13 12:08:58,stocks,[deleted]
2021-06-13 15:20:49,stocks,"I use TD, it was halted for me"
2021-06-13 17:53:13,stocks,[deleted]
2021-06-13 12:12:35,stocks,"Stopped it on the margin though, which is just as bad in my opinion"
2021-06-13 12:33:40,stocks,"Vanguard is not a not for profit company. It is a quasi-mutual company; the Vanguard funds own Vanguard in proportion to their net assets. This means, in non-technical terms, that any Vanguard profit is actually just returned to the funds."
2021-06-13 12:20:41,stocks,Who told you this?
2021-06-13 17:49:56,stocks,Schwab is nice. I have gotten really comfortable with Streetsmart Edge.
2021-06-13 14:37:05,stocks,"They're one of the big 3 along with Vanguard and Fidelity, they just aren't recommended as much since the former 2 cover most uses very well already."
2021-06-13 12:46:34,stocks,"You can transfer. Most brokerages charge a fee to do so. RobinHood for example charges $75, which is fronted by the new brokerage, who you then pay back. I know Fidelity will waive the fee for transfers of assets in excess of $25k"
2021-06-13 12:53:59,stocks,I’ve actually transferred with them and it was fairly easy. Even had to transfer some paper stocks (that was more involved and kind of annoying but it worked). I’ve also had pretty good experience with their customer service so sucks hearing a lot of people haven’t. I’ll keep using them till I find a reason—personally—not to.
2021-06-13 18:19:01,stocks,"I have tried e-trade but I prefer TD. Mostly because I didn’t have instant settlement with them. I don’t use TOW though, I use the TD ameritrade mobile app."
2021-06-13 12:50:56,stocks,"Someone told me best time to call was on a Saturday.

I'm trying to access my old account that I haven't used on etrade in like 20 years. One of these days I'll get around to trying to call on a saturday, the couple times I tried during the week the wait was like an hour... ain't nobody got time for that...

I use Fidelity, it's not the snazziest interface but it gets the job done. The ActiveTraderPro program is pretty decent."
2021-06-13 13:34:59,stocks,"Its not very different, their call center couldnt handle the surge and many people couldn't buy at the time they wanted to."
2021-06-13 12:52:27,stocks,"That has nothing to do with Pinks, click the link before commenting."
2021-06-13 16:35:07,stocks,Yeah I have stash and do pretty much what you said. I’ve just never heard anyone mention it on Reddit. I’m pretty happy with it.
2021-06-13 13:31:06,stocks,can you give me an actual reason as to why i shouldn’t use webull instead of “its parent company is chinese and the china is communist” ?
2021-06-13 14:00:41,stocks,"Definitely agree with this recommendation. It works well as both a web and phone app.

I no longer use E*TRADE's default UI anymore so I don't even remember how well it does (or doesn't) work."
2021-06-13 15:31:24,stocks,"Thank you! 

I just downloaded it and tried it, and wow it is ***so much*** better!"
2021-06-13 18:35:14,stocks,"I'm using TOS, Webull and TradeZero and I've had abetter experience with all aspects. Execution speed being one of them"
2021-06-13 12:15:31,stocks,[deleted]
2021-06-13 15:41:14,stocks,Moved from E-Trade to fidelity and there's a couple things I miss but overall very happy I switched! (I hear android getting huge app update this summer on fidelity and can't wait)
2021-06-13 14:46:21,stocks,"I'm currently using td ameritrade, i didn't know they have hidden fees.
Can you recommend a better broker?
 Thanks 😊"
2021-06-13 17:27:25,stocks,"I chose fidelity not even knowing they have three branches in my area. 

Don't know how that will be a benefit for me but was cool to see one on a drive."
2021-06-13 13:27:39,stocks,Sounds like Roger's wireless
2021-06-13 13:31:11,stocks,Yes.
2021-06-13 15:24:35,stocks,I got nailed with 6.95 fee. Stupid me didn't notice it on preview screen. Now I know.
2021-06-13 13:10:03,stocks,Do you know how to tell in advance of trading them which specific foreign stocks will carry that fee? I looked into it a while back when I first heard of the issue but I couldn't seem to find a straight answer.
2021-06-13 13:39:33,stocks,It was pointed out to me recently that td bank charges $6.99 to buy PONGF..... or another overseas purchase. I’m considering them when I switch.
2021-06-13 15:14:09,stocks,"I got hit with fees on bfarf.  I was only buying a small amount, wasn't paying attention, and oof!  Stupid mistake."
2021-06-13 14:24:21,stocks,They recently announced you can’t trade the caveat emperor (or whatever it’s called when they’re not up to date etc) otc also and put out a list of a ton not supported anymore but still probably the best cuz 0 fees only other one is fidelity and support a lot still
2021-06-13 13:31:43,stocks,I wasn't paying attention and got fucked by the $50 fee on Fidelity.
2021-06-13 15:15:00,stocks,[removed]
2021-06-13 16:15:16,stocks,"I guess I must be lucky: [https://imgur.com/fuBWSqH](https://imgur.com/fuBWSqH)

Happened both times I was charged one"
2021-06-13 16:31:49,stocks,"I've never heard of fees for buybacks.  Do you mean when Apple or someone buys back shares, eTrade literally charges you a fee?  That sounds horrific, lol."
2021-06-13 15:03:58,stocks,Could not care less.
2021-06-13 13:27:46,stocks,TOS all day long.
2021-06-13 17:06:18,stocks,"That sounds like just about the shittiest policy I've ever heard, lol.  I'd get the hell out of eTrade real fast."
2021-06-13 14:04:42,stocks,I'm glad you highlighted this because no one should ever do business with them lol
2021-06-13 13:45:38,stocks,Lol. I have 2 chase credit cards. The second one I got has my middle initial wrong. I contacted them to try and get it fixed but they said I need to submit proof of identity. I am just going to cancel the card. Makes no sense that I have two cards with different names and they aren’t at all worried about it.
2021-06-13 18:41:19,stocks,"i meant accounts made now, how did you think i meant that, why would having a recently created account change anything, think about it"
2021-06-13 13:31:13,stocks,Their app is likely written in an ancient tech stack and upgrading the UI portion with modern JavaScript would be a Herculean task.
2021-06-13 12:28:21,stocks,"Why don’t they do it? I’m not a stock guru. I work long hours and don’t have a lot of time to figure out all the little details, but I still want to invest. RH’s UI is perfect for someone like me. It’s straight to the point and easy to follow."
2021-06-13 13:48:24,stocks,Mind if I ask what language that’d be written in? That’s something I’ve been wondering for a while.
2021-06-13 13:18:13,stocks,"Yeah I was at a research and advisory company and the consistent vertical that was constantly trying to innovate and throw money at the future was financial services. 

But like you said, making complicated shit simple is what makes people rich, it’s definitely not as simple as it seems"
2021-06-13 12:44:00,stocks,RBC always has problems with their tech. Their banking app didnt work properly till like the 4th serious overhaul and still has major issues on a regular basis.
2021-06-13 12:59:15,stocks,"Last I heard, Vanguard was still running some of its core functionality on 1980s mainframe code."
2021-06-13 18:16:38,stocks,Mostly the way everything is grouped on the opening page.  The account chart Robinhood shows when you open the app is fairly useless.  I'll have investments up and down every day who cares about their daily whole account gains?  People that only own shares in one company? Haha they know their customers at least.  But what i really like is their desktop app with backtesting and analysis built in.
2021-06-13 13:54:43,stocks,You can’t go through the charts though. That’s one of robinhoods best features. I think it’ll be better once it’s officially released though
2021-06-13 16:02:46,stocks,"I’m on the beta too. Big upgrade, but I’ve already submitted feedback asking that the charts get better."
2021-06-13 14:14:08,stocks,"What, is my beta experience super different or something. I mean, it’s better I guess but it’s still garbage compared to RH."
2021-06-13 14:44:50,stocks,How does the options trading on WeBull compare to Robinhood? Can you do stop limit orders and maybe even trailing stops?
2021-06-13 12:18:26,stocks,Have you checked out fidelity’s new UI coming out? Is currently in beta and isn’t bad at all.
2021-06-13 13:59:13,stocks,"Well, my biggest problem is it’s based out of China. It’s not the best UI or anything either but it does have a lot of data compared to rh"
2021-06-13 14:01:36,stocks,Give their beta app a try! It's called beacon.
2021-06-13 13:13:59,stocks,"I’ve been pondering this exact scenario. I use E*TRADE, and except for the absurd surprise fees at times (I’ve also suffered from the reverse split fees, and I believe the trade fees occur if you don’t trade enough, essentially benefiting day traders). 

I was thinking I could create a paper account on RH and follow my positions better"
2021-06-13 12:15:20,stocks,"Oh so it’s for particular things, got it.
So basically it’s great, I just need to read the ‘terms and conditions’ of the fees part to avoid unwanted fees."
2021-06-13 16:28:06,stocks,Options are 50 cents per contract each way so $1 round trip. Though if you sell an option and buy it back for 0.10 or less I believe they waive that fee.
2021-06-13 17:18:53,stocks,Thanks for the response. Much appreciated. I have to check them out. My current brokers is td Ameritrade I think to crossover to fidelity. I haven’t done any trading since all that has happened. I’m just worried about not being able to invest because of the restrictions that’s broker enforce once a company because popular.
2021-06-13 14:14:53,stocks,They did not.
2021-06-13 12:19:44,stocks,"Fidelity did the same in jan on the big gme days. Couldnt log in for first 15-20min of the day let alone make a trade. And we all know if u dont get a sell in at open on some of thosr days then u got smoked, esp if u held options"
2021-06-13 12:12:15,stocks,"Server problems due to volatility, but hey, that's all of them. Keep in mind tda had a lot more clients than vanguard or fidelity."
2021-06-13 12:11:33,stocks,"It did not. It restricted derivative trading but it NEVER restricted share trading. Even the derivatives were mostly traded, just couldn't do complex option trades."
2021-06-13 12:53:34,stocks,No it didn’t. Get your facts right before commenting
2021-06-13 13:45:23,stocks,"They restricted GME (and I think a few others) on margin trading, which seems like fair game since you’re using their money.

They never restricted it for cash accounts"
2021-06-13 15:22:12,stocks,It was not halted for me. They wouldn't selectively do it. Did you call in?
2021-06-13 18:10:41,stocks,They have never had trading restrictions on any meme stock. Google it. They restricted particular trading in derivatives and margin leverage. They have never had trading restrictions.
2021-06-13 18:11:27,stocks,"And RH was the first one, followed by IBRK... Because their revenue depends on order routing so much."
2021-06-13 12:15:56,stocks,"Why is it just as bad? Why would they let you risk THEIR money on a ticker that can move up to 100% per day? You think a lot of people who pass the point of no return pay off the money they owe to a broker. No, they probably disappear."
2021-06-13 14:16:44,stocks,That's kinda cool actually. Are any others like this?
2021-06-13 13:02:38,stocks,"ah good to know, thanks"
2021-06-13 13:06:32,stocks,"I had the $38 hiccup others have mentioned, but emailed them and rather than them fighting the fine print, they just refunded the $38 back to my account. Otherwise, I haven't had any problems. I kinda fell into an etrade account because of my bank, but have a separate vanguard one for IRAs. It would be nice to consolidate to one company, but don't really have a real reason to. Good to know in case I change my mind down the road. thanks"
2021-06-13 13:41:54,stocks,"Gonna want a citation on the survey you're using :)

I trade with etrade, over 200 trades in last 30 days for example. No problems here at least."
2021-06-13 14:21:05,stocks,I don’t care about that.
2021-06-13 13:36:27,stocks,I was simply giving you a possible reason as to why you never see WeBull mentioned anywhere. And I believe that is enough of an answer to be at least extremely cautious if you’re trusting your money and sensitive information with a company which is almost guaranteed to be somewhat overseen by an international criminal organization.
2021-06-13 12:23:51,stocks,">It must be fairly new

Sorry my dude but no, It's been in there... I have fractional drip tracked back to '06 on one of my forever plays"
2021-06-13 12:28:05,stocks,Definitely was.
2021-06-13 12:39:12,stocks,"Well E\*Trade still doesn't have it, but you should be happy to know that Fidelity now allows partial stock purchases.

[https://www.fidelity.com/trading/fractional-shares](https://www.fidelity.com/trading/fractional-shares)"
2021-06-13 16:02:16,stocks,Sheesh I hope so! The fidelity app is so cluttered compared to something like Robinhood. I've gotten used to it now but it needs some tender love and care hahaa
2021-06-13 19:33:03,stocks,"I have their new app for iPhone and I’m not a fan. It’s too dumbed down like Robinhood. Sleek and nice for new investors, but it takes longer to switch between stuff like market orders and limit order (requires going into a separate menu vs just a button before). There’s sell overall info on individual stock pages. It definitely looks nicer though"
2021-06-13 18:29:59,stocks,same same
2021-06-13 15:41:57,stocks,Fidelity seems to be the best.
2021-06-13 15:40:46,stocks,Fidelity is what I use.
2021-06-13 19:19:00,stocks,Telus gave me back over $1000 in dees that some were my fault and most werent . Great service for someone who was with them for 10+ years
2021-06-13 17:47:21,stocks,"Yeah those fees really start to add up if you're buying/selling a lot of OTC stocks in larger volumes. I tend to limit myself to buying/selling at least $500 of an OTC stock so I'm only spending 1%/2% on fees, but that's more difficult to do if you don't have much cash.

What you can do to at least get the fee down by $2 is just buy/sell a small quantity of some stable ETF every other day (if you're on a cash account). Within a few weeks you'll have executed the 30 requisite trades. It's even easier if you're on daytrading with a margin account — you can go through 30 trades in an hour if you want."
2021-06-13 13:44:12,stocks,It will tell you if there is a fee on the 'preview order' screen - but I don't know of any other way to generally see it
2021-06-13 13:53:14,stocks,This is the one thing I do like about eTrade. On the web interface it will clearly state exactly how much you are about to spend prior to buying it selling. My problem with them was not so much the OTC trade fee but the $38 fee she was hit with with no warning until it was done.
2021-06-13 14:36:05,stocks,I do the same as slut does. I do a fake transaction of 1 share and see if it added the $50. I don’t know if there’s another way to do it either.
2021-06-13 18:16:58,stocks,So what's the best for otcs like this then?
2021-06-13 15:00:38,stocks,I just switched to Fidelity. What is this $50 fee and how do I avoid it?
2021-06-13 15:20:44,stocks,"I just realized I missed the mention of ""OTC"".  My bad, sorry:

""The retail online $0 commission does not apply to Over-the-Counter (OTC), foreign stock transactions, large block transactions requiring special handling, transaction-fee mutual funds, futures, or fixed income investments. Service charges apply for trades placed through a broker ($25). """
2021-06-13 16:55:30,stocks,"Agreed, but true"
2021-06-13 18:54:02,stocks,"How else am I supposed to take that? All you wrote was ""doesn't apply to new accounts""
That can easily be taken as you don't believe me. Sorry for mis-understanding but I didn't have a lot to go on."
2021-06-13 12:30:25,stocks,"I have no idea, they clearly have the data to display their shitty charts so I don't know. With software companies, especially filled with older people, it can be hard to get people to replace systems they might have an attachment to, even if they are dogshit.

I bet we'll see it soon to be honest."
2021-06-13 12:33:15,stocks,"Thats where the bear trap lies though, they use simplicity to bait you in. Bigger brokers arnt as interested in giving you simple to understand charts as its not in their benefit to do so.

Robinhood literally makes money on every trade so the more you trade, the more the make. It doesnt help that they are also just creating a paper account for you and never actually acquire shares for you until you leave and a ""real"" brokerage needs those shares"
2021-06-13 13:34:44,stocks,"if i had to guess, last i heard RH was around #3 or #4 in total number of users, but wasn't even in the top 10 in AUM. I believe AUM was under $20b last i checked brokerage-review.com

So basically, the etrade being the baby of the big brokerages has an AUM of $300B+. the rest of the big dogs are in the trillions.

It seems like the investment in **hopes** [keyword] of pulling people away from RH just wasn't worth it to the big guys"
2021-06-13 14:04:41,stocks,Assambler

2021-06-13 14:19:20,stocks,"How are you more fearful of the US government than the Chinese government? The US does not put people in concentration camps, forcing abortions and sterilizations. Nor does it force organ harvesting upon its prisoners of conscience. Of course the US has done some bad things, but I would never feel safer trusting the Chinese government than the US government.

With regards to brokers, yes I agree so far Robinhood has been a terrible platform for users with all of its crashes, derivative glitches, and trade halting, all within its short existence. Because of that, I would also avoid giving any trust to Robinhood.

WeBull has halted trading on some stocks as well, so that is something to consider. Like other people are saying, Fidelity and Vanguard are two American brokers who have a long history of being reliable and safe. WeBull has had relatively no history at all, so it is impossible to say whether it will behave like another Vanguard/Fidelity, or if it ends up like another Robinhood.

The CCP enforces a law that large companies must be partially run by members of the CCP. They also enforce a law that states that any company based in China or foreign companies operating within China must give any and all data regarding its Chinese operations (client and company data) to the CCP at any request. Since using an exchange like WeBull requires giving your full name, date of birth, Social Security Number, home address, mailing address, email address/phone number, possible information regarding being or being related to a person on the board of directors of a publicly traded company, and anything else gathered, like recorded phone calls made to the company, I can guarantee that the CCP has a detailed profile including some, and possibly all of the information about you. Seeing that the CCP is and always will be an international criminal organization, I find it hard to believe that any reasonable person would feel comfortable with them gaining and storing that type of information."

I’ve been with TD Ameritrade since it was just Ameritrade (17 years now). The website has had a single major refresh in that time span (several years ago now), and their older users flipped out on them. Nothing was in the same place and it confused and frustrated them. 

But the thing is, younger users almost exclusively use the app, not the website, so you’d think they would target the app to one demographic and the website to another. But the app is very similar to the website in many respects and is not remotely as polished as Robinhood’s."

They've got billions of boomer dollars so they best be listening to what boomers feel about their app. Most older folks don't have the same intuition about technology as us so learning a new interface could be a very daunting task, and I imagine a lot of that would fall on TD's customer servic.

I work in utilities as I mentioned before and some of our systems are exactly the same. We've got brilliant ui designers that could throw up beautiful charts for the users to monitor the energy grid. Instead we show a hyperlink to an old school static page with 512*512 pixel charts that are png files retrieved from a serverof the latest chart. This is simply because those are the same charts these boomers have been checking at this company for decades and because of it the users are happy. Everything else is modern and sleek but it was a sore spot for them to picture themselves checking different charts. We will probably add the fancy charts later but you bet those hyperlinks are going nowhere."

2021-06-13 14:38:40,stocks,"While the US has a lot more power in the world than China does, I would consider that to be a good thing since in the US there is a lot more freedom, both for yourself and an American based exchange when it comes to forfeiting information to the government. In America, companies have the right to put up a fight against any seizure of information that may be deemed unlawful. Whereas in China, people can get killed if they even bring up the idea of contesting the CCP on any issue.

While on the grand scheme of things, the US has more power than China, on a personal level, the US has much more freedom for individuals than China. It's unfortunate but very possible that the US and China go to war within the next 10 to 20 years. If that happens, I am sure China will not be very forgiving to the assets and information of Americans that are controlled by Chinese companies. It is likely that they will use what they have as leverage against the US. That is why regardless of how nice and reliable, compared to Robinhood, Webull or any Chinese controlled company or broker may seem, I would completely avoid them if possible."

Oil companies that have gas stations just need to start offering charging stations and they'll automatically become the largest charging network in most areas.

2021-06-13 10:11:03,stocks,"My personal opinion is that oil in general is in trouble. Some companies are hedging their bets by including carbon capture (still way more expensive and less effective than trees) or diversifying into renewables but for the most part oil transport, refining and production companies are counting on continued subsidies from governments and high cost lobbying to keep them above water. Any diversification moves they make now actually leave them behind the curve in competing with companies that have been working on it for decades even though they have considerable cash advantages.. To me the real bet is based on survival. At some point, unless we accept destruction as a species, oil has to be let go. Undrilled oil will stay in the ground because it's no longer profitable. (Interesting side note: a deposit of any mineral or.resource is only consider ""ore"" if it is profitable enough to bring to the surface).  Pipelines that abuse indigenous people's land rights in the US are losing in courts (surprisingly) and as the cost goes up for internal combustion engines goes up even more capital will be allocated to renewable at a lower cost to consumers. This trend is being embraced by many auto manufacturers due to loss of sales to the ev market. I believe the table is tilting. Planes and fleets of trucks that don't use gas are already in development and in theory one could power the US with 1/8 of Arizona being covered in high efficiency solar panels. 

Caveat: I primarily only invest long term in technologies and industries necessary for survival currently Water tech and renewable energy. Im also very interested in recent advancements in cooling paints and carbon capture but to my knowledge neither are being developed by public companies. If we stay on current course then the market and perhaps money in general won't matter.. We'll be too busy warring over water and habitable land. I think a lot of investors don't care much about this because they believe all the adverse effects will happen after they're gone and it is therefore someone else's problem. Again this is my personal opinion.

Edit: it's not just as fuel that oil is losing ground. Another primary earner for them is in the production of plastics which is also under fire as the world struggles to find a use for all the generational plastic on land and at sea. Virgin plastic, which is the income source, becomes increasingly unpopular.

Also, I think you could make the argument that since oil companies are reliant on government bailouts and subsidies for a while now, they are already financially unsustainable."

Cars built today and in the last 10 years can last quite a while.

However, oil *stocks* may not fare just as well. Oil is perpetually becoming more expensive and difficult to source and extract as we use up the readily accessible reserves. Oil producers already fight eachother badly on margins, and I really would not expect for OPEC+ to maintain the already birderline fragile agreements in place in 20 years when oil

So if I wanted to check any sector performance I go to finviz and check sector charts. That's convenient, however there's only SMA50 indicator, I would like to take a more detailed look. If I go to my charting platfrom (I'm using IBKR mostly and tradingview) and check that sector performance, what ticker/symbol should I check?

2021-06-13 00:00:00,stocks,"Chevron/Exxon Mobil Short Strategy Chevron and Exxon Mobil, two of the most historically profitable companies in the world over the course of their history. Exxon Mobil in particular delivering trillions of dollars in shareholder value over the years. The two companies are also notoriously controversial. In addition, the industry overtime will decline as solar companies win government subsidies and more oil sanctions are imposed overtime. I feel like this, combined with the controversial histories of the companies creates a great short selling opportunity in the near future. Before I explain this strategy in more detail, I will detail the most significant controversies of these companies

Chevron: Chevron is perhaps most notorious for causing billions of dollars worth of oil damage in Ecuador in 2003, due to alleged mishandling of oil waste causing over 28 billion dollars in environmental damage. After years of delegation, and dodging international courts to avoid paying out damages. To this day, Chevron has still gotten around paying its share for the damages

Exxon: In the 70's and 80's, Exxon conducted extensive research to determine the long term implications of fossil fuel burning. They determined conclusively, that burning fossil fuels warms the planet long term, were aware of the long-term effects of global warming with continued fossil fuel use, and buried these findings to get ahead of them, launching a decades long disinformation campaign against legitimate climate change science that allowed things to get to where they are today.

The Short Strategy: Since these companies are both highly controversial, and in industries that are long term going to be driven out by solar subsidies and a shrinking pool of competitors, I have significant short interest in these two companies. Chevron in particular, in my opinion, is highly overvalued as it is, and only relevant because of its dividend yield. The strategy would be to wait for major protests against these companies to correlate with mediocre/poor earnings, and short the companies after. If the shorting gets caught in the news, regular investors will likely join in and accelerate the decline of these stocks.

Chevron: Headquartered in San Ramos, California, Chevron is surrounded by opponents on the political left who would be quick to protest the company in its headquarter city if it does anything controversial again. Chevron would be the heavier target for this strategy due to the fact that I believe they are more overvalued to begin with. Chevron is inconsistent with earnings, in an industry with limited long term potential, in an industry that isn't popular politically, and will likely downsize in the future. The company has a large dividend yield, but has already reduced it recently (edit: this is not true, disregard this), and the company would not be able to even honor its dividend if its stock were to rapidly decline. The risk of this backfiring is also reduced due to the fact that the stock price is close to it's all time highs. Timing a short around a political event against this company and during a time of mediocre earnings would be key here.

Exxon: Shorting Exxon would be a longer-term play, as I believe shorting Exxon would be less profitable. I would argue that Exxon is a more attractive valuation currently than Chevron. Exxon is actually consistent with earnings, has an even higher dividend yield, but still has similar weaknesses as Chevron. Controversial af, in an industry with limited long term prospects, will likely downsize overtime. Again, timing controversy with mixed company performance would be key to maximizing the short, but I feel that Exxon is less overvalued than Chevron to begin with, making Chevron the main target for this strategy.

&#x200B;

Edit: I want to be clear, that I am not attempting to short the oil industry as a whole, just Chevron and possibly Exxon at a future date. I think that smaller oil competitors will be able to suffocate the big giants for market share, and I am invested in a different oil company myself personally.

2021-06-13 09:26:24,stocks,"How do you define long term? Electric cars are starting to gain market acceptance, but they won’t replace ICE’s overnight. And, gasoline is far from the only use for fossil fuels.

To replace gasoline, electric cars or hydrogen cars still need an entire supporting transportation infrastructure to be built not just in the US, but all over the world. While electric cars work just fine on the current US power grid with their current market share, the grid can’t support electric cars for everyone yet. And what of other countries that lack robust and reliable electricity? Supply chain issues with batteries and electronics need to be worked out too. 

Petroleum still goes into a wide range of petrochemicals, plastics, pharmaceuticals, and fuels (kerosene, jet fuel, cooking and heating gases, marine fuel, etc.) Natural gas is still a major source of electricity too. It will take time and money to displace natural gas from the power grid with renewables and even then there will be reliability questions. 

Then there’s the fact that many of the IOC’s are making moves to expand into renewable energy. Right now those moves are mostly PR stunts, but they are beginning to build foundations to expand into that market. They have the money and resources to make that move, it’s just a question of how many make the transition successfully.

At a certain level, public opinion of these companies doesn’t matter because they are a necessity for maintaining the society and technology level we have built up. We are starting to transition to alternatives, but replacing entire infrastructures takes time and won’t gain 100% coverage for a very long time. So larger oil companies that have access to the best oil and natural gas plays, can produce those resources more cheaply than smaller companies on more marginal plays. Guess who will survive industry downsizing? 

I suppose as a long term strategy shorting oil companies may be a good risk to take, but I think you’re looking at 5 years at the closest before things start to turn around, and more likely 10 years."

2021-06-13 10:24:10,stocks,"Once you initiate the short position, 


1. What would your position size be? 


2. How long are you willing to maintain the short position? 


3. How much % would the share price have to fall for this to be worth the risk you are taking & make it an attractively profitable trade? 


4. At what % would you exit the trade?"
2021-06-13 17:11:33,stocks,"For at least the past 7-10 years, oil & gas companies have been downsizing. Global demand for oil is projected to peak sometime around 2030, driven down by developed countries' transition to renewables, but bolstered by demand from developing countries.


This is not to say that demand will fall to 0, but the other uses of fossil fuels (plastics, chemicals, etc.) will not grow to compensate for the falling demand of ff-derived energy.


A further concern is the amount of proven oil reserves worldwide are projected to last ~50 years at current consumption. There is certainly more oil around, however, the largest and most easily accessible will be the first to be consumed. Currently, around ~20% (rough quick google search) of oil is produced through unconventional methods (sands, shale, fracking, etc). 


The largest oil companies grew to their size in the past by aggressive resource acquisition and heavy investment in production capacity, all with a very easy method of oil extraction. With the demand curve decelerating, business will favor specialized and highly-efficient companies. The largest companies do have the advantage of possessing the largest amount of oil rights, but they will certainly have to reduce capacity, increase efficiency, and begin selling off their less-productive assets, benefitting smaller companies that may predate them. Also, as they downsize and their power diminishes, I foresee the largest companies will begin to face greater (rather than lesser) government regulation worldwide.


There will likely still be a Chevron and Exxon around in 20 years, but at a greatly reduced size from where they were. The outlook doesn't look good and the process has already begun. If they do start operating in renewables I think they are behind the curve, which they potentially could compensate by pouring money into it...but I think those already operating in that space with government subsidies already secured are operating at an advantage that increases over time.


As far as shorting goes: if you have the time, money, and nerves for it. The long-term downtrend is likely negative, but people are still throwing their money at oil. Especially coming off the back of the pandemic, so caution would be wise.

2021-06-13 09:31:38,stocks,"This position is not just based on demand for EVs. Chevron as I stated in my OP, I believe is already overvalued in spite of its controversy. Exxon Mobil is a more long-term play, as I think their stock price is more justified currently, but I believe that these two companies are too controversial long term to rebrand and gain public acceptance. 

Since Chevron's earnings are also inconsistent, my strategy is to short this stock around earnings, or when it attracts controversy."

I feel that once the oil prices peak ( and I don't see them going much high than 70 a barrel tbh, Airplane and recreational travel won't return to peak demand for years, governments are looking to begin solar infrastructure projects), it will be a King of the Hill scenario amongst surviving oil competitors. In this scenario, I believe the oil companies with the largest cost advantages will prevail long term."

I feel an attempt to transition would be too late by them."
2021-06-13 09:35:58,stocks,"A big part of my position is also that I feel that there are stronger oil companies that can compete for market share.

A company like this will easily be able to pick off oil giants like Chevron while they are scaling down and diversifying into renewable energy (credit to Flakey\_Felatio for some of this information).

Controversy doesn’t matter for these companies. They sell a necessity, not an optional purchase. How much money they make is dependent upon market conditions, not public opinion. This isn’t a meme stock filled with first time investors. They’re heavily invested in by long term investors who are looking at market fundamentals, not public opinion. The people who find XOM and CVX objectionable to invest in have already self selected to not invest in them.

If you want to talk about EV’s, renewable energy replacing natural gas, biofuel sourced jet fuels, plant based plastics, or other petroleum replacement products I think you’d have a leg to stand on. If you wanted to speculate about what level of market share the Saudis would decide to tank the market at, you would be making a good point. If you thought denouement with Iran would lead to a major reshuffling of oil supply and distribution I could say yeah that will affect share price.

I think you’re barking up the wrong tree. But I am a petroleum engineer, not a finance whizz. So I’ll cop to knowing a lot less about the stock market than about the industry. This is after all a casino, and the last year proved pretty conclusively that in many cases fundamentals don’t matter."

If Blackrock helped make this happen, a company that prioritises money, thinks its beneficial to have activists on XOM's board, I think we're going to see this kind of activity become a lot more prevalent.

2021-06-13 07:22:07,stocks,"I’ve certainly looked at the R&D budgets of Tesla’s competitors vs Tesla. VW and Toyota both spend over $10B a year vs $1.5B for Tesla. Ford and GM also spend 3x as much. 

Tesla’s value assumes both that the majority of cars will eventually be electric and that Tesla will maintain the market lead, although its 30% dip from its peak recognizes that competition from larger and better funded automakers is heating up.

At Oatly’s current value, similar assumptions are not fully priced in for their industry. They might not ever be, who knows. In this case there are many other plant-based milks besides oatmilk. The bet is not just that dairy will keep declining (despite being healthier and perfectly sustainable) but that soy milk or other alternative will not have a resurgence in popularity."

Edit. I'll also add that I'm very bullish on vegan stocks, I hold BYND myself (and TTCF but not all their products are fully vegan), I think they'll do really well once all the vaccines are finally out."
2021-06-13 12:09:36,stocks,"Well I take the ""invest in what you know"" intensely and criticize the quality of products in that space.

I never considered Beyond Meat to be particularly good and was never excited about the product. I believe the key metric in the plant-based market is **repeat** customers, rather than consumers trying things out as a novelty. This is why I think some investors are wrong to consider that the majority of Beyond meat consumers are not plant-based consumers. To me, Beyond meat seems like a product that's pushed by investors and  competitors that aren't fully knowledgeable about the plant-based market.

I was excited about Impossible some time ago, when I first tried it and they were closer to establishing a proper moat around the meat substitute market. However over the years my excitement has decreased. It's pretty easy to cook Impossible meat incorrectly resulting in an even worse product experience than Beyond.  So getting Impossible in places like Burger King and Red Robin results in an absolutely terrible and expensive experience. The room for error in Impossible is its biggest problem.

My experience with plant-based milk has been a gradual one. I absolutely love dairy and cheese and my consumption of dairy has remained stable throughout the years. Almond milk, soy milk, etc; it was good but it was not enough. I would have it if there wasn't milk around or I would use it to cook some vegan plates. If it makes sense, I found it totally lackluster to use almond milk in a core ""milk"" dish like cereal, so I just stuck to typical dairy.

Oatmilk consumption was very similar to my consumption of Impossible beef. It excited me genuinely and I felt compelled to tell people about (word-of-mouth is a true human phenomenon). Over the years, my consumption of dairy has decreased for the consumption of plant-based creams and oatmilk.

Plant-based cheese still has a way to go, but the cream and milk quality is there. I have a strong preference for it these days which is abnormal consumer behavior choice. I was motivated to go plant-based on my own accord, but my motivation to stop consuming dairy was motivated by the quality of the alternatives. Cashew products are what I use for heavier creams, and oatmilk products are what I use for more liquid uses.

On that note, I read through Oatly's S-1 in its entirety because I always believed that plant-based dairy consumption would eventually find its way and I was happy to see that Oatly also looks forward to integrating into pea protein, which is found in meat subsitutes like Beyond or Gardein, and potato starch which is found in many fermented vegan cheeses. Pea protein is also a common alternative in health markets for exercise where Whey is unavailable for some plant-based diets and Oats are quite common in health drinks that want to boost their protein/calorie intakes.

The quality of ingredients is also excellent. They use oils so that it could be partitioned for cooking purposes or to add a similar fatty flavor profile to dairy milk. I could go, but I think you get the point, Oatly is the real deal IMO."
2021-06-13 12:12:44,stocks,"Key metric is repeat customers. Too many people on a  regular diet are unaware of the quality of chicken products  and experience a failed beef products. They may try it once, say it's pretty good, but never return for more.

So the chicken game is mostly a partnership and marketting strategy. Beyond failed in 2019 when they discontinued that product."
2021-06-13 11:28:52,stocks,"Yes. Obviously there are some special considerations, lactose intolerance, vegan diets and so forth. But generally the idea that milk, eggs etc are unhealthy comes straight from the sugar industry. The whole point of pushing plant-based milk on people is to get them to consume more processed foods, especially sugar. This is evident at places like Starbucks that sell “healthy” egg-white bites and Impossible sandwiches, and Oatly; meanwhile one medium Frappuccino has 150% of the daily recommended sugar.

Likewise, focusing on methane emissions from cattle is propaganda from the fossil fuel industry. Fossil fuels are 90-95% of the problem. Beef is a different issue, but you don’t kill the cow to get the milk."
2021-06-13 07:34:09,stocks,"It’s impossible for Tesla’s competitors to lure employees away from Tesla for a substantial pay raise?

Clearly Tesla was a better buy than the big automakers for years but that has totally flipped.

Right now BYND and OTLY are clearly better buys than K or DANOY but that will probably flip too."
2021-06-13 12:19:07,stocks,"Fake chicken is usually the entry point for people trying fake meat. I think its because they are aware of how much filler and yuck is in normal chicken nuggets, and figure that fake couldnt be worse, or may even be healthier. Its also the easier taste to reproduce. I have chicken salt that tastes like chicken but is vegan lol.

I imagine Beyond and Impossible will move back to chicken or pork after they perfect beef."
2021-06-13 07:41:47,stocks,"Yeah that's fine if you think that I won't try to convince you, I think time will prove me right on Tesla (or maybe you who knows), I guess we'll see in 5-10 years. 

My average price on BYND is $115, which was something like 7-8B market cap wise I think? I like that valuation much more, 17B for OTLY however?, I'll skip, I'm sure there's profit to be made long long term but not enough for me I don't think."
2021-06-13 12:27:06,stocks,"Yeah that's my thesis with chicken and Oatmilk, it's how you gateway into the industry and give it multiple chances.

Beyond is back on chicken, I believe through KFC this year in select locations. I find beyond sausages currently far better than their beef products. Beef IMO is going to be the hardest to figure out and have stick at a quality level."

2021-06-13 06:41:53,stocks,The main point of difference for us little retail traders is that OTC is not transparent. Futures deals are done on an exchange and all transactions are disclosed to all participants.

We are already editing genes on humans to cure diseases so gene editing might blow up if it proves to be an ethical treatment in the long run.

People keep saying 3D printers are going to be a big thing, but it still feels like you won't see that be common for a long time. However, by the time you realize it's here, it will probably be too late to invest.

EV is an interesting play as we still need to drastically build infrastructure to handle all those cars, plus battery technology needs to improve; stuff like graphene is hard to scale up.

Everyone is doing subscription services these days. Whether it's netflix, discord nitro, or my mom's onlyfans.

With all the recent attacks on businesses, governments, and individuals by hackers, cybersecurity is going to be popping off as we realize that we are all vulnerable and a single hacking group can literally hold an important corporation hostage; hell, they could cripple hospitals, police departments, or even brokerage firms and ruin the lives of countless people.

Space is stupid. Fuck space. Although if we can do space mining, the possibilities are so fucking endless. I would be over the moon if we advance to the point of being able to mine asteroids or even other planets.

Meat alternatives or even lab grown meat might end up becoming a popular choice for people. Politics aside, it looks promising and it seems to be a decent solution on reducing animal suffering.

Not sure if there are any battery recycling companies that are public right now, but with all this renewable energy stuff going around, and the EV craze, we will need a way to keep these batteries from polluting our environment. Plus most of a battery is reusable, and that slows down the need for more mining."

Even if it’s as simple as a “proactive camera,” where instead of just recording footage to review later, it can detect suspicious behavior and issue warnings and star running through a playbook of planned actions. It opens the door for cheaper security monitoring, especially in places that would benefit from it that don’t current have a permanent solution, like convenience stores or ATMs.

2021-06-13 16:49:28,stocks,"Well, if you look into actual benchmarks and comparisons, the chinese alternatives (roborock, viomi, xiaomi) kinda blow roomba out of the water. I had a second-hand old roomba (865 or something), was neat for a first robovac, but it would get itself trapped, was noisy, the good thing was a massive litter bin.

Last month I've got myself a roborock s7. The comparison here is unfair, because it's like the old, CRT iMac, vs the M1 one, but still. This thing maps the house, recognizes floors, you can precisely configure where and what it should be doing, and if fucking efficient with time, because it knows how to navigate and create patterns. Roomba was just randomly bouncing around. It also mops stuff.

That's $620 for a top of the line gear. Roombas with the same featureset are 30% more expensive.

Both iRobot and Dyson need to rely more and more on marketing to get their stuff sold. Chinese are selling the (improved) copycat stuff by the truckload, and the consumers will go with price if there's no (visible) quality difference."

2021-06-13 12:26:01,stocks,"The biggest obstacle to Mindgeek is cultural. They eventually nuked unverified content on Pornhub because of the recent crusade against them. It wasn't worth the heat. But any site which allows the public to upload videos freely runs into similar problems. Youtube and Twitter have been plagued by graphic videos of execution, torture, child abuse, etc.Twitter, especially, really struggled to take down ISIS and Al Qaeda propaganda. 

What really made Pornhub change was advertisers and the banks threatening to boycott. In a way it was similar to the adpocalypse on Youtube. Except Youtube kept all of the content that advertisers complained about, whereas Pornhub/Mindgeek deleted it. And then they restricted who could even upload videos in the first place. 

Porn is viewed differently. And I wouldn't invest in it, because you never know when there will be another moral panic. Unfortunately, well-meaning liberals are often taken advantage of by religious anti-porn activists. 

TL:DR; Porn is a risky investment in the US because of Puritanical cultural baggage, which allows for moral panics to cripple parts of the industry."

Tesla’s choice to now only use visual cams and get rid of LIDAR will prove fatal to their efforts."
2021-06-13 10:12:14,stocks,"Nah you're wrong there. If it were true then it'd apply to Toyota or Chevy today, which it doesn't. 

Battery technology was inefficient and cost prohibitive. There's a reason Toyota isn't where Tesla is today despite having the Prius very early. There's a reason Chevy isn't where Tesla despite having the Volt early. And it's the same reason why GM wouldn't be where Tesla is today had they just stuck with their 90s piece of crap. 

Tesla. Made. EV. VIABLE. They are the only reason why batteries are cheap enough, powerful enough, and last long enough for an EV to even be a viable alternative to standard cars. Tesla designed the batteries from scratch to perform well enough and last long enough to be a true and genuine alternative to gas engines. GM/Chevy/Ford would never have gotten to this point because they source batteries from others and therefore played no role in advancing battery technology. They just looked at what batteries were available on the market and tried making the best out of it. Essentially they were chronically a few years behind where modern tech should've been. 

Musk designed Tesla to be vertically integrated specifically so they'd be making their own batteries to reduce cost and allow them to maximize the efficiency as much as possible. On top of all that, they created a national infrastructure of charging stations.

Before Tesla there were way too many obvious disadvantages to owning an all-electric car for your average consumer to even consider it. Without Tesla, there still would be. They single-handedly pushed EV technology forward by at least a decade"

Only reason I keep the account open is because it was my first credit card in college and don’t want to close my oldest account. That being said, fundamentally from an investment standpoint, WF crushed it from an investor standpoint. Consistent gains, more accounts opening every year, etc. Unbeknownst to everyone the numbers were skewed from the fake accounts the tellers were opening but nobody would’ve seen that coming. They also paid a good dividend at the time so that was another factor. They dropped WF and since then  the stock has taken off. Went from the teens to mid forties since their ban got revoked."

As for supercruise vs FSD, there is no way supercruise wins because a) it requires massive investment of money GM does not have to keep adding lidar mapped roads and further develop the software b) supercruise only handles lane changes on-demand, nevermind unprotected left turns and c) GM has less than 10 million miles of supercruise data to work from.  
I don't understand your comment about lidar, Tesla never had a lidar in their cars nor do GM. Tesla removed the radar, which i concede GM still has. I've driven multiple EVs and I have been following the EV+AV space for a long time now. I work on autonomous vehicle tech and I currently own a Chevy Spark EV. I hope GM improves its products and does massively shift to EVs but I'm doubtful."
2021-06-13 09:36:39,stocks,"Feel free to tell me I'm wrong as I don't want to put words in your mouth, but when I read ""SuperCruise will win vs Tesla"", all I hear is a hate-boner for Tesla (or is it Musk?),  because I hardly see how that can be a rational argument (especially if said person thinks they use LiDAR, hard to believe there is any substance behind the opinion)."
2021-06-13 10:12:02,stocks,"Come on, you can't possibly believe that. Tesla is already playing chess with autopilot systems, while GM is still deciding on the color of checkers."
2021-06-13 11:49:37,stocks,"""Tesla designed the batteries from scratch to perform well enough and last long enough to be a true and genuine alternative to gas engines.""
This is not historically accurate. Tsla has used commercially available batteries for most of its existence, and has only recently started designing batteries, none of which it has yet put into production."
2021-06-13 11:19:22,stocks,"You’re making some key mistakes in your understanding of history.  The battery technology was absolutely good enough to make a decent daily commuter.  NiMH batteries were good enough to do this.  And new technology was on the horizon.  How do I know this? I was making lithium ion battery cars in the mid 2000’s - and it wasn’t even a particularly new technology then.

I still scratch my head as to why the big car companies didn’t figure this out faster.  Many of them sponsored electric car teams and their execs were well aware of the technology.  

I think it comes down to flaccid corporate leadership that is afraid to take any risk, goaded on by pension funds and Wall Street types who wanted to treat their dividend as an entitlement program.

GM and F are probably going bankrupt.  There’s no way they can save themselves now-other than perhaps some kind of merger. The faster people realize this, the less painful it will be.

Anyone who is looking at this industry should be terrified of the risk of investing in stagnant value traps."

2021-06-13 12:23:06,stocks,I feel like Ford has had a better vision than the other Detroit 3 for better part of the last 20 years. Their issue for too long has been execution: poor quality control and bean counting that ends up costing them more in the long run. If their new leadership can figure that out (and maybe they have/will with these new models) I think they’ll be in great shape.

A third but separate way amazon can go to hell, is that as a company they are not making any friends while amazon in the past has benefited from increased regulations. There will come a point where they will pose a serious issue and start to cost them money. 

Plus in regards to AWS more and more net admins are growing concerned about vendor lock in can't find the survey but if memory serves it was 48 concerned and 52 not concerned. There is a non zero chance over the course of the next 10 years that alot of small and larger companies will start moving away from the vendor lock in industry.

The rated range is probably about 2x the practical range, even worse if towing something large.  

Also their production schedule is slower than they are advertising, and you likely won’t be able to get your hands on one of these for years. 

They’ll certainly sell some electric trucks but I am just not seeing how this saves the company from impending bankruptcy as demand for their gas cars trends toward zero.

2021-06-13 00:00:00,stocks,"How do you analyze growth stocks? Still a decently new trader, I’ve been getting into more serious fundamental analysis to determine the stocks I want to hold in my portfolio.

I mainly look at companies from a free cash flow perspective and compare EV/EBITA to the industry to look for undervalued stocks.

But how about growth companies? Most of these companies are trading at much higher multiples, a lot of them are not profitable and have negative EBITA. For example, RBLX jumped from 60 to 90 a few weeks ago, while having a EV/Revenue multiple of 36x. How do you even go about figuring out a good entry price for some of these stocks?

I want to know because I’m young and can take on riskier investments into some of these high growth companies, but being the logical person that I am, I at least want some way to mathematical reason a fair point of entry!"
2021-06-13 07:30:53,stocks,"For a quick and easy glance, take P/E and earnings growth rate / percentage and compare them to other companies that do the same thing.  Take Two at one point was trading at 45x earnings versus 33x earnings for Activision Blizzard despite the two having very similar growth characteristics at the time.  Take two later pulled back roughly 20% falling closer in line with its peers because the valuation wasn’t lining up with the real company.  You want to (if possible at any given moment) ideally find stocks with P/E’s well below their peers, but with similar growth prospects and equally good fundamentals.  This way instead of a backwards correction you are looking at a forward leap to reach the industry average.  The best opportunities for things like this happen when a company gets dumped too hard from headline risk or news coverage.  People see bad news and don’t typically know how to value it so they just sell.  Facebook for example could have been bought for a P/E of 18 and a share price of $135 if you were willing to buy during the Cambridge Analytica scandal.  Always always always use peer comparisons.  In the end most companies will fall in line with their peers in terms of valuation, and that natural force can either lift you up or cut you in half.  Good luck!"
2021-06-13 01:43:09,stocks,"I'd say you're on the right track. IMO people get too caught up with having a certain percent of their portfolio in 'growth' stocks and 'value' stocks. There are quite a few companies out there that have aspects of both. Try not to 'aim' for having a certain amount of either - you'll miss out on a lot of great opportunities. 

I would start with a top down approach. Look around you and keep up with the news. Create a list of 5 or 10 tailwinds that you think will define the next 5 to 10 years. Maybe you think FinTech will replace traditional banking, maybe you think autonomous driving will replace the trucking industry, maybe you think cybersecurity will play an ever increasing role as we further digitize modern society, maybe you think most general healthcare will be done digitally/through telehealth. Once you've organized the industries/tailwinds you believe in find data to back that up. Analysts think the telehealth industry will grow by a 35+% CAGR to reach ~190 billion by 2025, for example. Now look into the market leaders riding these tailwinds that you have identified. This is the time to break out the EV/EBITDA, FCF, and comparing these with others in that company's industry. Making sure you're also looking at total assets vs liabilities, current leadership, etc. Market leaders will naturally trade at a premium. The stock market is an exercise in price discovery. It is up to you to determine whether the premium these sector leaders trade at is justified based on current and projected revenue growth rate, total addressable market, etc. I may be willing to pay 82 times EV/EBITDA for $TDOC or 261 times EV/EBITDA for $CRWD but you may not think that is justified based on all of the factors discussed before

Edit: Just realized I didn't address your question of how to find a good entry price. Short answer - a good entry price is one that you can live with. Long answer - be patient, wait for bad news/negative sentiment. Ex. ILMN dropped to ~$260s Sept 2020 because they wanted to acquire Grail and the market thought that was a bad move. But if you had bought then you'd have almost doubled in less than a year. ""Be greedy when other's are fearful"" but within reason. Also, consider learning Elliot Wave. I'm not big on technical analysis (still think it's a load of hooey) but it may help you time your entry points. Best piece of advice I can give for this is average in to the position, especially stocks with extended valuations as they tend to be very volatile. Start out with 1/3 of what you want your total portion size to be and then accumulate over time"

2021-06-13 06:05:27,stocks,"hm well for growth stocks, first thing to look at is income statement, balance sheet and cash flow. u can use morningstar or look at the company's 10k. essentially ure looking for weird and irregular numbers. eg sth like tsmc having very little property or sth along those lines. see if they have alright cash flow. if they have bad cashflow, they may need to issue shares or bonds or sth which generally isnt good as it will weigh the stock down. take into consideration future growth in revenue profit etc etc.
essentially, make sure the company itself isnt too weird in terms of assets and make sure they dont havr too much debt. take into consideration future growth by using pe ratios and eps and stuff, and if u r feeling up to it give ur stock a discount rate to identify fair price.

If you see gross margins in negative while revenues are growing at fast pace, it means that they could be struggling with scaling the business.

I don't really bother with multiples early in the growth phase either. A 36x could quickly turn into a 18x if the earnings double (or even be a 72x).... I would suggest that you should use EV/EBITDA instead of EV/sales too."

2021-06-13 13:11:46,stocks,I like to look at ROCE to see how efficiently they put capital to work. Then i look at the debt load to see how much growth they are able to leverage. Some growth companies already pushed their growth potential to the max by leveraging their balance sheet to the max. Then its important to understand the customer aquisition cost and the lifetime revenue per customer. This screens out the growth at all costs companies. Finally keep a list of companies that fit your criteria. Look for entry point during temporary price dislocations for example around the Q's. Sometimes a small temporary decline in growth can have a severe impact on the price. Growth investing should be long term oriented but there is a lot of short term investors in it
2021-06-13 13:57:56,stocks,"It’s easier than you think. If you invest in growth here’s what you do: take most of your technical and financial analysis and dump it in the trash. It feel stupid to say this, but honestly it’s kinda sentiment and forward thinking speculation. There is some amount of balance sheet analysis but it’s more just to acknowledge that the company knows what they’re doing to some degree. For the most part when you look at a growth company’s balance sheet it looks like they’re taking bundles of money and lighting them on fire to run their heat. You can’t really tell tbh. It can be as simple as the board deciding that they don’t need anymore “growth” and flip the switch and start becoming profitable. It’s BS I know, but that’s my honest opinion. Financial analysis is for value investors which will be disappearing in the near future as those companies begin to fade as products and services. The new value will be the growth stock of today which will cool off as valuations settle and they turn off the growth.

If that burst of success for instance took this company from a P/E of 30 to a P/E of 60, but the industry average is only 40 presently, you have your first red flag (valuation has raced ahead of its peers).  Next how does the coming guidance or growth prospects look?  If their guidance for growth is the same or less than the industry overall as a percentage, that’s red flag number two.  You now have a company trading at a 50% premium to its peers that is only growing at the same rate (or less) as the competition (ultimately you are making a case now that there’s no reason they should be valued differently).

_

Tl;dr - CTS grew a lot but also has a lot of debt. 

_

Currently, it is priced at 8.78 CAD (CTSDF $7.19)
- market cap 1.6bil
- P/S 1.6
- forward PE 17


_

Bull case:
- improving economy, especially for smaller businesses
- greatly improved revenue YoY ($310mil in 2021 vs $ 241mil in 2020)
- positive net income acquired this year ($5.1mil vs loss of $1.6mil in 2020) 
- cash flow of $68mil (increase from $26 last year)
- became profitable in latest quarter 
- increased need for cybersecurity and cloud adoption with remote work; on the flip side, companies that had to cut back due to inability to make revenue in quarantine/resistance to remote work are expected to increase spending again as restrictions ease up
- cloud adoption is a trend that is expected to continue increasing regardless of the pandemic
- plans to expand into European market


_

Bear case:
- stock price already saw an impressive 76% increase since January (and 575% increase YoY); may be overbought
- increased borrowing ($142mil vs $139mil last quarter); concerns about ability to make interest payments
- aggressive acquisition spree and heavy share dilution.
- trailing P/E is very high
- inflation

2021-06-13 00:00:00,stocks,"Honest discussion about Lordstown Motors (RIDE) While big media has been relentlessly attacking the stock, I continue to be bullish on LMC. Sure they've been burning cash, but that's expected from a an EV startup (during a pandemic nonetheless).

The recent 10k filing identified the  hypothetical risks (going concern) of the cash burn and the need for more capital to ramp up production. The filing included several ""risks"" and pointed out worse case scenarios using legal terms.

Bottom line, they have no debt and many options to raise capital (ATVM, asset backed loan, share offerings, etc). Saying they are near bankruptcy is a huge hyperbole.

The Endurance truck (flagship vehicle) has almost completed safety crash testing (2 of 3 tests completed) with 5 star rating. On track to being the safest pickup truck ever tested. They are almost done tooling the plant (with 600k vehicle per year capacity) and on track to begin mass production in September.

They have an open house for investors and fleet managers June 21-25.

They have actual reservations (and deposits) of roughly 30,000 trucks.

There are over 35 million shares shorted, why? I genuinely can't see the bear case? 

Why isn't the media talking about all the accomplishments that LTM are making? Why does it seem like everyone wants them to fail? 

Full disclosure, I own 10,000 shares of RIDE.

Edit: it baffles me that we can't have an honest discussion about this stock without downvotes, the media has really brainwashed the masses into hating RIDE

2021-06-13 02:22:44,stocks,"Let’s ignore for a moment the fact that the company is probably a fraud (even early on, insiders selling large amounts of stock before a company has generated any revenue was a red flag). Let’s ignore for a moment that no one is likely to give them any cash after blatant dishonesty in their last round (previously claimed that no more financing is needed for a full production run)… I still don’t see what the bull case is. The company is valued at, like you say, ~1.5billion… how many trucks do they need to sell to come even remotely close to that valuation? What advantages do they have over competitors, and are those advantages sustainable over the next 4-5years? There’s a reason that very few automotive companies actually make it - you have a ridiculously high capex requirement and fixed running costs, and need to move substantial volume to make it work. RIDE has to convince a fuckton of fleet managers to take up its new, kind of expensive, unproven truck over the trucks they’ve been using for years; what’s the value proposition? Especially when the established guys are following up with their own electric trucks in a short period of time? And EVEN IF THEY DO ALL THAT, they’re still way overvalued.

That’s why the current market cap is so low compared to other companies in similar boats. When you dig deeper into each negative claim or action, there’s either a reasonable explanation or a clear path to turning things around. It comes down to whether you want to see the glass half empty or full. 
In my opinion it’s reasonable to assume that they’ll produce some amount of vehicles in 2021 if they’ve produced Betas as stated, passed the most challenging crash tests, and while under an SEC inquiry and battling claims of misleading investors the CEO restated, multiple times, that they will produce vehicles this year. As far as going bankrupt, that’s always a risk with pre revenue start ups. LTM’s situation is that they are very close to their proclaimed production date and they have over $1B in assets. In this yield starved environment it’s unreasonable to think they couldn’t obtain asset backed debt. Also, it’s a positive sign that the reason they are in a cash crunch is not so much due to preventable or foreseeable conditions but an investment in bringing major part production in house. Shows they can make smart long term investments to bring down margins and control the supply chain. There are too many all or nothing claims in my options by bears. The market is so large that you will find enough customers to have a sustainable business. They already allege to have 30K orders with deposits. The hub motor and low maintenance from few moving parts is going to be attractive to several tens of thousands from a market of millions. I also think GM has more reason to support this company than kill it. Ford has enough of their own problems that they won’t need to put themselves at any risk to squash what it essentially a fly in comparison. Idk I can go on and on.

2021-06-13 12:38:02,stocks,"Instead of looking at the company let’s look at the product.

1) it’s a standard look pickup truck. 3 years ago if this was released it might have made it. But Ford next year will have an identical product on the market.

2) Ford has $B to spend on marketing

3) if you look at 2 identical products that cost so much money and you had to buy and also resell something that was $50k would you buy Ford or an unknown brand. Like wise, people probably also have a relationship with a sales person that they like and can give them a discount or that vip service.

4) Ford is already producing the cab + deck. So they already have unit of economics and no how on this.

5) they are already mass producing the motor and electronics at mass for the mech-e which people are raving about.

6) let’s put it another way. If this was a 4 seater up against the model s what would you say!

This will go to zero very soon."

2021-06-12 20:31:18,stocks,"The fire was a man made error on a prototype. All trucks are now fully assembled by robots. What ICE truck has not caught on fire at one point or another?

They had non binding pre-orders, and now they have real reservations (with deposits), 30,000 reservations as of the last earnings call.

CEO Is fine, they are still collaborating with WKHS (who own a 10% stake in RIDE). His reputation was smeared by Hindenburg which is riddled with provable lies.

Pre-orders are not actual orders, that's why they are not called orders. He's right, nobody thought they were real orders.

It's an automotive EV startup, tooling a plant and programming robots is expensive. They are also vertically integrating themselves (chassis, batteries..) more up front cost.. more long term profits. They have in fact produced 50 or so trucks (as betas, crash testing, validation, marketing vehicles)

They still are on track for September to begin producing vehicles, this is a huge milestone, what does it matter if that's 1,000 or 2,000.. it's a proof of concept. The largest hurdles are done (crash testing, tooling, validation)

Some insiders are selling, but most of them are keeping a lot (the majority) of their shares, including large investors (like GM). 

The stock is down because the stock short interest is 35 million (31% of float) and the media fud.

You may want to go balls deep in RIDE."
2021-06-13 07:05:05,stocks,"The insiders sold some stock when it tripled in a few months during an ""EV euphoria"". Most insiders kept a huge portion of their shares. I would have done the same thing after realizing the prices went up too fast too quick.  Just have a look at how much those insiders still hold vs how much they sold. They still believe in the future of the company,  they just made a smart financial move.

They have several options and strategic investors to raise capital. They are just waiting for the government to announce if they have secured the ATVM loan.

They had cost overruns due to raw material costs and shifting to being more vertically integrated (chassis and batteries). They weren't being dishonest with their financial situation, it just changed. 

The factory can make 600,000 trucks a year at $52k each. You do the math.

The hub motors (fewer moving parts) is a huge advantage. The only thing that requires maintenance for the first 5 years are the wipers and tires."
2021-06-12 22:35:24,stocks,"Fair points,

LMC will need to earn their stripes, totally agree.

Ford is a good brand, totally agree.

The main problem with Ford is that they've waited so far to enter the arena that by the time they release the Lightning,  LMC will be on version 2 or 3 of the Endurance. Ford needs to continue to make the ICE trucks for their loyal customers who won't consider electric (and this includes servicing them too). They won't be able to focus on the electric offering. I don't think they will be more reliable either, since it will have many more moving parts and yet still their first all electric truck with tons of unknowns.

The maintenance cost of the Endurance  is touted to be significantly less than the average ICE truck and still less than traditional EVs (such as Tesla's) or what the Lightning will be.

As far as styling goes.. they went pretty safe (non flashy) if you compare to the Tesla CyberTruck or the Rivian R1T. I like  it, but I get what you're saying.

Agreed, the CEO can come off as a little offputting, even some big RIDE investors I know don't like him.. but I think he's fine... not great... just fine."

2021-06-13 01:01:17,stocks,"I wouldn’t say it’s due to the media.

We’ve been down the pre order road with this company before…and it didn’t turn out well. The CEO shot himself in the foot on that one on live tv, and also doesn’t have the most trustworthy background. The media has nothing to do with their truck exploding, not finishing a race, and definitely not RIDE being behind production and out of cash, despite being a newly public company. 

How much is a deposit for a pre order and what’s the likelihood they will result in an actual order?

Probably the most important question, why should investors trust anything that the company is saying given the track record?"

2021-06-12 22:18:47,stocks,"Plenty of room for everyone. I like Ford and GM (have owned both), but I like LMC's fresh take (hub motors). They have no ICE DNA, which can be a double edged sword."
2021-06-13 06:14:05,stocks,"There's nothing ""bad"" about them they've been dragged through the mud by Hindenburg and the media, and the majority of those claims have been proven false yet never rescinded. People continue to believe those lies.

The chance of going to 0 is minuscule, they have zero debt.

During the last earnings report Burns was clear that they were looking to raise capital from assets backed loans or the ATVM loan first (which they are in advanced talks). Non dilutive solutions are being looked at first and foremost. 

The biggest competitor Ford is at least  a year away from releasing the Lightning and the fleet model won't be out until 2023. That being said, there is enough EV demand for both to thrive.

I like the stock"

2021-06-13 12:55:42,stocks,"1. Look under the hood, this is not your ordinary truck (hint, there is nothing under the hood). Saying the products will be identical is a categorically false statement.

2. They are selling to fleets. The advertising argument is pretty much invalidated. The selling point to fleets is the zero maintenance for the 1st 5 years (except wiper blades and tires)

3. Again, products are not identical. Ford is advertising a ""maybe"" price for a future ""maybe"" release date and vague specs. The Lightning fleet model will be a budget trim with crank windows and no Nav (not the XLT model which is more expensive but more in line with the base model endurance).

4. Ford trucks have ICE DNA, this is a double edged sword. It's not optimized to be an EV truck (it's just an electric motor in a traditional truck) so although they may be ahead of LMC on the OEM parts, they are also sacrificing efficiencies.

5. The hub motors LMC are using are made from Elaphe (exclusive agreement). These motors have been around since the 80s.

See here for more accurate facts on LMC and Elaphe:

It's very hard to believe anything the company says because they've been caught in so many mistruths.

It's ironic that you start a thead asking for ""an honest discussion"" and info on the company and then rebut every negative point anyone makes ???

Fleet trucks typically have service agreements. Who is going to service the trucks ? They have no dealer network.

2021-06-13 08:03:35,stocks,"1. Fair enough, no use speculating over why, yours is a perfectly reasonable explanation.

2. ATVM loan would be big but otherwise I expect it to be incredibly difficult to convince investors or creditors to put up the cash. There is little in the way of valuable collateral expect the facility which is far from fungible.

3. This is true but the strategy switch is nonetheless disconcerting

4 and 5. “The factory can make” (which is itself an unproven claim) does not equal “the company can sell”. Fewer moving parts will be true for most EV trucks from competitors. In regards to valuation, margins will be tight, possibly negative until they reach substantial size. I’d be shocked and happy to be proven wrong if this company ever manufactures that many trucks.

I will admit to viewing this from a bearish lens but I’ve seen this movie too often in the past. No position anymore so I wish you the best of luck, but I wouldn’t dismiss the bear thesis outright."

Guaranteed these will roll out before Lordstown does en masse. September will be a huge fail where RIDE investors will need to find more excuses why this truck isn’t reaching consumers.

Two months ago, Lordstown was singing sunny songs about production, now the company—not Hindenburg, not the media—is saying they don’t have enough money to make the trucks they claimed they could make. Meanwhile, Ford will have zero problems producing 100,000+ trucks for customers rolling out in May. Lordstown has, at best, 8 months to prove itself before the F-150 smacks it across both cheeks. I have zero confidence Lordstown will rise to the occasion given that the company itself—not Hindenburg, not the media—has made every indication they’re in serious financial trouble."

3) this is Ford, they already have the manufacturing capacity and will produce this. This is what they have done for 100 years.

4) true, I’m not sure Ford will be the big EV player in the future. But they will be around a long time. Look at IBM and computers.

5) inhub  motors are really bad for cars. As you have stated they have been around for 40 years. Why do you think no other car company uses them in production. From Tesla the king so interaction (look at large casting) to supercar companies with no expense spared. Will give you 2 reasons. 1) unsprung mass, 2) complexity with regard wires, cooling, Centre of mass. Compared to a simple drive shaft and central motor.

They have partnerships with GM and Camping World.

They've tested the truck in the Baja race, the betas are being road tested now and collecting data. They are also almost done crash testing and validation  (so far 5 star crash test, on track to being the safest truck ever tested).

I think what they've said has been twisted to sound like lies and mistruths when in fact they are being unfairly targeted by the media. (This one is hard to debate)

Why is it ironic? Isn't that what a discussion is all about? If the points I'm making are not valid then tell me why? I'm not attacking anyone, I'm genuinely just interested in an honest discussion.

Lordstown Motors and Camping World unveiled a deal that has big implications for many electrical-vehicle startups: The seller of recreational vehicles will provide service for the Endurance. (Btw they are also working with them on an electric RV, being unveiled soon)

The accusations have been (for the majority) been proven false, they've got actual reservations, not ""3 to 4 years away from production"" and are building a battery plant as we speak. Those were the biggest accusations. 

Asset backed loans, the ATVM program, strategic investors, share offerings (last  resort). My guess is a combination of all of these to really secure their financial situation and set them up for success."

They have spent more cash up front due to the cost of raw materials (inflation due to covid) and vertical integration (chassis and batteries)

They also have several ways to raise capital, the whole bankrupt thing is blown out of proportion.

They have tons of cash left too, so they will be able to make trucks (albeit not as many as they anticipated.

They have no competition right now, they are literally first to market.

I'm not selling."
2021-06-12 21:02:37,stocks,"1. They missed the filing because the SEC changed the requirement (for spacs) a few weeks before the deadline. They were granted until July to file without penalty.




2.. The whole pre-orders vs. Actual orders debate is the biggest nothing burger I've ever seen. They will make trucks people will buy them.. they won't be able to make them fast enough. They currently have 30,000 actual reservations (with deposits)

3.GM has a stake in LMC, and agreement to buy carbon credits and building a battery plant next to their factory. Ford is at least a year away from producing the Lightning (2 years away for the fleet model). It will have way more moving parts (vs. LMC's hub motor designs) and cost way more to maintain. No doubt Ford will make a nice product though. I like Ford.. I just know the market is big enough for both companies (and others) to thrive.

4. They are not ""broke"". They are spending cash at a rapid pace and have zero debt. They do need to raise capital to meet their production target, and they can raise that capital very easily (they can do asset backed loans, ATVM, etc.) They clarified during the earnings call that they were looking at non dilutive solutions, and were in serious talks with various investors.

Ask myself if it's easy? I know it's not, yet they are doing it! They have over 50 beta's, some are being road tested as we speak. Everyone (big money) wants them to fail. There are no red flags just nothing-burgers wrapped as red flags.

2. It'll come down to the total cost of ownership, there is plenty of room for both companies to sell a lot of trucks. 

3. LMC has a tooled plant, they have the backing of several smart industry managers (from GM and Tesla). It's truly unbelievable that a startup is ahead of Ford in this market segment. Embarrassing for Ford really.

4. I think Ford will do fine, they are just going to have to focus on EVs and sunset the ICE models...sooner rather than later.

5. The technology has been refined over the years. Remember 20 years ago how efficient solar panels were? 
The hub motors eliminate gear boxes, drive shafts, U joints, etc. Much simpler and easier to fabricate and maintain.

Imagine the pricing power Ford has in 5,000,000 tires vs. Lordstown producing 2,000 trucks and buying 10,000 tires. Apply that to all purchasing and materials.

The reality is that Ford and VW have moved quickly to close the gap. Some companies, such as Rivian, have manufacturer backing. Lordstown has nothing.

Add that to the questionable statements made by the CEO and you arrive at the current predicament. RIDE has become a short/MEME play. I'm not saying it's right or wrong, but it is what it is. If you're not currently invested in RIDE I'm not sure why you would."

2021-06-13 05:19:20,stocks,"I know Lordstown has some affiliation with GM but to say they get to piggyback on GMs vendor pricing is a bit of a stretch. They're still a competitor. 

They say they're primarily selling to fleets. Fleet buyers/managers are ruthless negotiators. They're not average Joe tire kicker buyers. Every $100 matters when your buying 100+ trucks. 

If GM and Ford beat Lordstown by just $5000 per truck on 100 trucks, that's a $500,000 price difference. Or even $1000. What company is going to go for that from an unproven startup no less? 

Fleets also negotiate extended warranty and service agreements. Lordstown has no dealerships. They will be paying a third party to honor any of those agreements.

Not sure why they think the fleet business is their focus. It's the lowest margin business available. Yes, you sell/lease 10's of trucks at a time but the margins are smaller and potential ongoing warranty and service contract costs will be higher. 

Again, Toyota has been trying to break into the Fleet truck business for a decade plus with little to no success. How is Lordstown going to do it?

Are they working with anyone to beta test the trucks ? AEP in Ohio ? Or AT&T? Or Comcast ? If so, I didn't see any news on that. 

Ford and GM will outcompete Lordstown at every turn in fleet. Maybe if they establish a consumer business through someone like CarMax or Carvana, I just don't see them competing in fleet. 

If anyone is going to challenge Ford and GM in fleet it would Tesla. And it appears they've already thrown in the towel on that. The CyberTruck is obviously not a fleet vehicle. 

The stock chart is scary and during a historic bull market. It will get much scarier when we have the inevitable correction or downturn. I just see a very struggling company everywhere I look and for a very long time."

LMC will be on the 2nd or 3rd version of the Endurance by the time Ford is even ramping up production on the Lightning.

The company is competent. They have accomplished a lot with the money that they raised at IPO... for example they've retooled the old GM plant (reprogrammed the robots). Vertically integrated the production (with chassis and batteries) and crash tested (5 stars) and validated their truck. 

They also have raw materials and enough chips for 1 full year of production... more money now means they can meet production goals and stay focused on growth.. which is bullish for a growth stock"

Burns said he wanted the fleets to collect a few billion miles before offering it to individuals.

the maintenance schedule for the first five years includes only windshield wipers and tires, which as a result, could reduce the total cost of ownership for fleet operators.

Ford hasn't been exactly honest with their pricing and comparison. The price for example doesn't include freight and delivery and the Lightning model for fleets doesn't include any of the features in the XLT model (which is standard on the Endurance). My guess is this $40k number that Ford thew out there will increase over the next year or two as it becomes available. This is exactly what Tesla did recently. Saying the Lightning will cost x and be ready by spring 2022 is something that can't be disputed in the present, but you gotta realise that this is subject to change (and likely will). What is being presented   now by Ford is just a sales pitch... that being said, I'm a big fan of Ford and I'm sure it'll be a nice product when it comes out.

2021-06-13 00:00:00,stocks,"$TIGR UP Fintech Holdings DD **Tldr**; 256% YoY revenue growth, analysts raising rev forecast (still too light), PROFITABLE with $21M 1Q21 net income, 448M cash on hand, 54% - 174% potential upside. 🐯

**Who are they and how do they make money?**

With one of the sexiest tickers on the NASDAQ, TIGR (rawrrrr 🐯) or UP Fintech Holdings operates a rapidly growing online brokerage in China with [nearly 800 employees](https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/TIGR:US) and growing. TIGR’s trading platform went live in Aug 2015 and their target market includes both retail and corporate clients in China as well as other parts of Asia. They have a “mobile first” business strategy. So how’s their mobile app? It currently has [4.7 rating on both the app store](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/tiger-trade-global-invest-save/id1023600494) and [google play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tigerbrokers.stock&hl=en_CA&gl=US) as of June 11 and users are generally happy with their experience using the app.

**Growth strategies**

* Expand internationally – highly scalable trading platform, primed for roll out; TIGR has licensed operations in the US, Singapore, New Zealand, Australia, Hong Kong, and of course China
* Broaden and capitalize on customer base – Continue developing their online investor community and add services as customer needs evolve
* Extend breadth/depth of offerings – Think investing tools like robo advisors and such
* Continued development of their platform

**Financial highlights and KPI’s**

Revenue breakdown:

* Commissions: Based on transaction volume or quantity of shares
* Financing service fees: Earned from Interactive Brokers (they have a partnership with IBKR to support trading US and Hong Kong stocks through TIGR’s platform) for margin financing and securities borrowing and lending transactions 
* Interest income: Margin financing, securities borrowing and lending etc (just not going through IBKR)
* Other revenue: Mainly from corporate services like facilitating IPO’s, advertising and promotion services, and ESOP’s to corporate clients

TIGR’s growth is very strong:



Revenues| 1Q21	| 1Q20	| YoY %| FY20	| FY19	| FY18	| FY20 YoY % | FY19 YoY %|
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
Commissions	| 52.9M| 14.0M | 277%| $77.6M| $26.7M| $26.0M| 191%| 3%|  
Financing	| 2.2M| 1.6M| 36%| 6.6M| 7.9M| 6.4M | -16%| 23%|  
Interest	| 15.6M| 4.8M| 229%| 31.8M| 16.5M| 0.1M| 93%| 16400%|  
Other	| 10.5M| 2.4M	| 331%| 22.5M| 7.5M| 1.0M| 200%| 650%|  
Total	| 81.3M| 22.9M| 256%| 138.5M| 58.7M| 33.6M| 136%| 75%|
					

1Q21 revenues are almost as much as FY19 + FY18 combined of 92.3M! On May 27 [analysts raised their FY21 revenue forecast for TIGR to $299M \(from $270M\)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-revenue-estimates-fintech-holding-072438256.html). This would translate to 116% YoY increase and 64% ttm increase. But in my opinion TIGR will blow past that. If Q1 revenue is flat for the rest of the year they will hit $325M, except TIGR is growing like crazy. 4Q20 revenues were $47.2M, just to add another reference point for how explosive their growth has been. They’re going to blow past $299M.

Main revenue growth drivers:

* Expanding geographic footprint – As mentioned, US, Singapore, New Zealand, Australia, Hong Kong, and of course China (Canada next plz?)
* Corporate business – ESOP clients increased to 165 in 1Q21 (+41 new / 33% QoQ) and TIGR participated in 14 IPO’s (underwrote 8 of them)
* Sexy platform attracting more investors – Customers love their platform as noted earlier in their app review scores and they continue to add more features and products (US OTC, The Fund Mall which helps investors locate mutual funds based on their investment goals, and more)

Further supporting the revenue growth, here’s a view of customer accounts:



 | Mar21| Mar20	| YoY %| Dec20| Dec19	| Dec18	| Dec20 YoY %| Dec19 YoY %
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----
Total accounts| 1400k| 743k	| 88%| 1104k| 649k	| 502k	| 70%| 29%
Customers with deposits| 376k	| 134k	| 181%| 259k| 113k	| 82k	| 129%| 38%
Total account balance| $21.4b| $5.5b| 289%| $16.0b| $5.1b| $2.4b| 214%| 113%
Trading volume| $123.8b| $44.1b| 181%| $219.1b| $99.8b| $119.2b| 120%| -16%

						

Now coming to the best part. You know how growth stocks usually run at a loss because they need to scale up to start seeing income? TIGR is past that stage. They are already profitable AND putting up stellar revenue growth. 

1Q21 income = $21.1M (1Q20 – $(0.5)M loss)

FY20 income = $22.0M or a 15.9% operating margin (FY19 - $(15.9)M loss, FY18 - $(46.2)M loss)

They've scaled their business incrediblly well and income growth will continue.

**Competition**

FUTU Holdings Limited (FUTU) is their main competitor. They are an online brokerage based in Hong Kong, also servicing Asian investors. The Futubull app has a [4.7 rating on app store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/futubull/id592031984) (same as TIGR) and a [4.4 rating on google play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cn.futu.trader&hl=en_CA&gl=US) (TIGR 4.7). General sentiment when reading written reviews is that FUTU's app and user experience is not as good as TIGR’s. They are bigger in terms of market cap (21.3b vs 4.0b TIGR), revenue (1Q21 $284M vs $81M TIGR), and income (1Q21 $150M vs $21M TIGR), but their [P/S is sitting at 31](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=futu), while [TIGR is at 19](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=tigr). Also, FUTU derives its revenues primarily from commissions/fees from trading securities (50% in 2018, 48% in 2019, 60% in 2020). TIGR also derives a large percentage of its revenues from commissions (65% in 1Q21, 56% in FY20). The risk here is fee compression; as competition heats up there is pressure on fees to stay competitive. TIGR is seeing rapid growth in other revenue streams (namely IPO’s and ESOP’s), so I believe the impact of fee compression on commission revenues would be less hurtful for TIGR than for FUTU. Both companies are growing rapidly, but I see more upside with TIGR. 

**Partnerships**

TIGR has an agreement with IBKR to execute, settle and clear most of the trades of US and HK stocks and other instruments (2018 = 97% of trades, 2019 = 78% of trades, 2020 = 75% of trades). [IBKR is also a shareholder of TIGR](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001381197/000138119719000031/ibrk-13d_ufhl.htm) owning a [7.6% stake](https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/05/21/why-up-fintech-holding-stock-popped-today.aspx). 

**Share dilution**

On Apr 5 TIGR institutional investors subscribed to purchase convertible notes for $90M maturing in 2026 on Apr 5 (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fintech-holding-limited-announces-us-080000194.html). I can’t find any info on which institutions or that the notes have been issued, but I will assume they have been. 

On Jun 11 TIGR closed an offering of [6.5M ADS’s at a price of $24.50](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fintech-announces-closing-public-offering-080000241.html). Underwriters had a 30-day option to purchase another 975k and they exercised it; certainly because they see continued upside in the stock. 🐯 Lock-up is 90 days expiring in Sep. I don't expect a large sell-off given the growth potential.

You would naturally be wondering “will they dilute more?” I don’t see a reason why they would given their cash position. On Mar 31 they had $175M in cash + 90M convertible notes in Apr + 183M share offering in Jun = $448M, **AND THEY ARE PROFITABLE** ($21M in 1Q21) so I don’t see much reason for them to need more cash. 

Why did they raise more cash?

1. expand customer base and drive engagement, 
2. invest in expanding products, services and technologies to enhance the user experience, and 
3. expand international presence. 

Personally I am ok with this, and it seems the market was too because the price has fully recovered from a close of $26.79 on 6/7 and then bottoming out at $24.49 on 6/8, the first trading day after the share dilution announcement. 6/11 we closed at $28.56 (+11% on the day).
 
From their FY20 financial statements: “Our growth strategy includes expanding our international services and customer base. Expansion into new markets will require significant management attention and financial resources worldwide.” They further say “We will opportunistically evaluate and pursue licenses or acquisitions to enhance our offerings and accelerate growth objectives in existing or new product verticals.” I am hopeful this is where a good amount of this cash will be deployed, push globally! 

**Bear arguments**

* The investing market has picked up steam across the globe lately with meme stocks and all the news that Robin Hood generated in 1Q21; TIGR is certainly a beneficiary. These levels of growth may not be sustainable and business could stagnate as a result.

* Given they are valued as a growth stock, their valuation is closely tied to the rate of inflation. If inflation rates go up, growth stock valuations will drop because they are often valued using a discounted cash flow method.

* P/S of 19 is actually too high. Valuing a growth stock can be difficult. As I mentioned, FUTU's P/S is at 31, another growth stock like SKLZ is also roughly 30. But SQ, another growing fintech company, has a P/S of 7.5. PYPL is more mature but also in the fintech space and has a P/S of 13.7. So, there is a case that 19 P/S for TIGR is actually too high.


**One other note**

They are a Chinese company, but they’re audited by a big 4 firm (Deloitte). Previously they were audited by KPMG until they changed in Dec 2020. 

**Price targets**

The 52wk high for TIGR is $38.50 on 2/19 which is a 34.8% upside. 

If we assume they hit the FY21 analyst revenue target of $299M, using their current P/S of 19 puts the market cap at $5.7b, which is a 42% upside or a share price of $40.69. 

I think a P/S of 19 is light, especially with FUTU being at 31, plus that revenue forecast is wayyyy too small. TIGR is going to destroy it. Every single quarter they are adding more customer accounts, more deposits, they’ve got nearly half a billion dollars in cash on-hand, and they are profitable. 

Quarterly rev growth has been 2Q20 -> 3Q20 = 26%, 3Q20 -> 4Q20 = 24%, 4Q20 -> 1Q21 = 72%. 

* **Conservative PT** = $81.3M Q1 rev x 4 = $325M FY 21 x 19 P/S = 6.175b mkt cap = **$43.91 SP / 54% upside**.

* **Neutral PT** = 25% QoQ rev growth for remainder of FY21 = $470M x 19 = 8.93b mkt cap = **$63.51 SP / 122% upside**.

* **Bull PT** = 40% QoQ rev growth (avg of 26%, 24%, 72%) = $580M x 19 = 11.0b mkt cap = **$78.23 SP / 174% upside**.

2021-06-13 00:39:19,stocks,"TIGR has a bright future, don’t get me wrong, but COVID, stimulus, and zero interest rates have brought everybody out of the woodwork and into the markets. It’s a phenomenon all over the world and comparables will not be easy in some months, especially as the markets will inevitably get a big correction at some point in the probably not so distant future. 

As for fundamentals…I took a position in TIGR when it dropped down below 13 all of two months ago, and sold out a couple weeks ago. Long term the stock will probably be fine, but in the near/medium term it is substantially inflated and imo the risk/reward is much more geared to the downside."
2021-06-13 00:42:43,stocks,"There is more to a company’s performance than just revenues. As I mentioned, TIGR, like many companies also had huge COVID tailwinds that are not sustainable. (It’s the same for eg for Robinhood).

A p/s of 19 has never been considered cheap until 2020 and onwards, tells you how much the goalposts have moved in the market of late."

And Tigr doesn't benefit from COVID tailwinds what are you talking about. You have to read what I wrote. TIGR benefits from the CCP opening up capital account convertability."
2021-06-13 12:53:38,stocks,"FUTU's growth has been excellent too. 



Total Revenue| 1Q21 | 4Q20| FY20| FY19| FY18
---|---|----|----|----|----
HKD| 2,205M | 1,186M| 3,311M | 1,062| 811M
USD| 284M | 153M| 427M | 137M | 105M
% Increase| 86%|  | 212% | 31%|  


Also 1Q20 revenues were 491M HKD / $63M USD, so 1Q21 is a 349% YoY increase. My concern with FUTU is that valuation right now, and I like TIGR growing its corporate client base. FUTU also had a share offering in April; 10.925M shares at $130/ea (FUTU trades at $145.45 currently) with a 90 day lock up. 

In my view FUTU's stock price will not perform as well in the short to mid term as TIGR.

EDIT: lock up is 90 days not 30"
2021-06-13 01:10:38,stocks,"Earnings growth of 353% from what to what? Less than 50m? And you think that this is sustainable? Keep in mind that they just diluted shares yet again. 

TIGR certainly benefits from Covid tailwinds. I encourage you to look at how members have increased for all brokerages in the past year. I’m talking everyone, including schwab, ikbr, Nordnet, Robinhood, you name it. How many friends do you have that are newly into the stock market? In a year like 2020 when the market is red hot and everybody makes money, then everybody joins the market.

You may be right that China is opening up more, but I wouldn’t ignore how much of the growth is from the hot market rather than the country’s policies."
2021-06-13 00:00:00,stocks,"My experience with the Moomoo app/brokerage firm and why I wouldn't use it and left. I wanted to post this in case anyone is researching the Moomoo app later before they consider opening a brokerage account on it and depositing money. Hopefully this will come up on a search and they'll be able to read about my experience, because not much comes up searching this app now. It's very frustrating to open a brokerage account and deposit money only to discover the app does not provide the services it advertises and claims to do. It turns into a mistake that takes almost one month to correct and get out of and get your money back. You're looking at 5 business days for an ACH deposit to clear. If you want to withdraw, that deposit has to sit in the account another 5 business days (plus a 3 day settlement time if you bought and sold stocks). Another 5 business days for the ACH withdrawal to clear and hit your bank account. And finally another 5 business days to deposit the funds and clear into a new brokerage account. 

Tldr - there's an imgur link in the comments to screenshots of the customer service chat and my options Level. 

	1. Orders do not execute properly, explained below. Notifications for orders don't always work, even though the slightest move for anything in your watch list sends multiple notifications. 
	
	2. They have no phone number available for customer service. Only chat or email with very inexperienced reps and takes a while to get a response on. 
	- Update on this, I actually talked to someone at Finra and found out brokerage firms are not required to have working phone number available for clients or customer service, which is frankly ridiculous IMO. Someone told me RH doesn't have a phone # either but I don't trade with them for other reasons so can't confirm that. If the internet or app or whatever goes down, or you have a problem difficult to explain via chat/email, you're just stuck. Can't call anyone or access your account in any way.
	
	3. Can't trade options even though they advertise you can and my account was set to Level 4 for options trading, explained more below. Customer service literally told me their system does not support covered calls. They claim to only support long calls or puts but I never could place those trades either. Definitely can't trade any advanced strategy either, spreads, strangles, etc. and I had nothing on margin even though I don't think that should matter for those trades. 
	
	4. No desktop option or interface.
	
	5. Their PDT system doesn't appear to work correctly, never counts or recognized day trades, but that may be a plus for some folks.
	

The Moomoo app is part of Futu which is appears to be an established, reputable, and successful large company. I recently signed up for an account because I really like their UI and the way it's easy to navigate through the stock data, especially the options chains, and you can change the name of the stock shown in the watch list, where I add my basis, which is very handy when selling covered calls and that basis is constantly changing. So as far as using the app for a watch list, that's the only thing I recommend and will continue to do.

	1. Orders do not execute properly. I purchased XX shares of AMC a few weeks ago. I set a stop limit order on Friday, May 28, and have modified it several times to increase the stop and limit prices. The last time I changed it was around closing on Wednesday, June 2, when I increased the stop to 55.50 and limit to 55. Luckily I checked it around 6pm the same day, and I saw the order executed at 5:39pm for 65.36. I did Not get a notification for the trade. I checked the charts on Moomoo, Schwab desktop program, Fidelity, and by tick on Webull, and never see it drop anywhere close to 55.50. I bought back soon after I so I still have my position. But the point is, it shouldn't have executed. Screenshots on imgur link. Please note the time stamps in those are CDT times and the times I reference here are EDT. 
		a. First, I've had accounts with several brokers and have never seen stops trigger after hours. In fact the order instructions on all of those other brokerages stated their stop-loss and stop limit orders would not apply to or be placed during after hours. I could be wrong on that, if anyone has experience otherwise, please let me know. That's actually a feature that I wish was offered. 
		b. When I talked to customer service they didn't even understand what a stop limit was. First, the rep told me I placed two separate orders. Then they told me the stop price of 55.50 was hit at 2:11 pm and the order didn't execute until 5:39pm because I ""had to wait in line behind all of the other orders that were placed before"" mine. On AMC, when the volume that day was through the roof, over 760 million. Obviously I wouldn't, definitely shouldn't, have had to wait hours for a limit sell order under the market price to fill. Plus, the stop wasn't set to 55.50 at 2:11pm, it was at 50.50 And I didn't change it to 55.50 until right before 4:00pm.
		c. I waited hours to speak to a supervisor, and never did, but finally got an email from someone after 3pm the next day. The email included a screenshot of the order book that supposedly shows a sell of 506 shares for 54.54 at 17:39:16.
			i. Note the previous transaction was for 65.36. The 54.54 transaction is red with a down arrow, as is the following transaction for 65.35, even though that's an increase from 54.54.
			ii. Also note, while my sell order filled at 65.36 at 17:39:17 (verified in his email and my trade confirmation), there is no transaction for that amount at that time. The last trade for 65.36 was at 17:39:15. So did my more execute before the supposed 54.54 transaction or did it execute for 65.38, 2 cents more, but I only received 65.36?
			iii. This transaction is marked with a ""U"" while every other one is marked with an ""I"". I'm not sure of the meaning or significance of this letter code. If anyone knows, I'd appreciate the insight. 
		d. Like I mentioned, notifications for order execution don't always work, even though the slightest move for anything in your watch list sends multiple notifications. Get bombarded by those and don't have many options to limit them to the ones you really do want to see.
		
	2. You can only speak to them through chat or email and they refuse to give a phone number. And they give different customer service email addresses. 
	
	3. Can't trade options even though they advertise you can. I wasn't aware of any broker that does not allow covered calls. Customer service told me I could trade long calls and long puts, but the app would never allow the order to to be placed, always giving me an error. 
		Update: After I originally posted this I looked at my account and saw that Moomoo had my Options Level set to Level 4. Yes that's a 4, not a 3. I've never had an account above a 3, and honestly didn't know what Level 4 was or that it existed. According to their definitions, Level 4 has all the permissions/trading ability as Level 3, plus it allows selling uncovered calls and naked puts. Here it is copied straight from the site. 
			Your option level:  Level 4
				Buying calls
				Buying puts
				Combinations (Coming Soon)
				Selling uncovered puts
				Selling uncovered calls
	
		Of course the last two on the list are trades I would never make, selling naked calls or puts, as those have got to be arguably the riskiest types of trades. But I tried to put in an order anyway to test it for a very cheap option on a very cheap stock, and of course it didn't work. And, I still can't even sell covered calls or buy calls or puts. Go figure. 
	
	4. No desktop option or interface. Self explanatory 
	
	5. PDT - not entirely confirmed, but on the plus side for some people maybe, their PDT count system doesn't appear work either. The system always showed me with 3,3,3,3,3 even after one instance where I sold, bought, sold, bought, sold, bought the same stock in one day.  
		a. I monitored this for several days ago and the counts never changed. Not sure if maybe that's because a couple of those trades were executed in extended hours. I need to learn how the PDT requirements apply to trades executed pre and post market hours. Still, the bought, sold, bought, was during normal hours. The first sell was pre and the last sell and buy were after hours. But all on the same day, it should've at least has one marked off and gone to 2,3,3,3,3.
		b. I still never made 4 day trades in 5 days out of fear that it would start working or was working and their system was incorrectly reporting the count in the app.

That's the gist of it. Sorry for the long post but I hope this helps someone in the future. Happy to answer any questions or hear any explanations as to whether there are legitimate reasons for why I encountered some of these issues."

2021-06-13 00:00:00,stocks,"$BCC Boise Cascade Potential M&A Target 25% - 30% upside *This is not financial advice*  

**Background:**

Boise Cascade, located in Boise, Idaho, has had a long tenure in the wood products industry. In the early 2000’s Boise Cascade had a frenzied period of M&A, acquiring OfficeMax and going through several corporate carve-outs and restructurings. However, since 2013 when the company most recently IPO’d, Boise Cascade has shown steady growth in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.

With a market cap of $2.4 billion and $5.5 billion in FY 2020 revenue, Boise Cascade is a notable player in the wood products industry but considerably smaller than some peers like Louisiana-Pacific (LPX) and UFP Industries (UFPI).

**Boise Cascade Today:**

As any market participant would be aware, lumber prices through the past twelve months have been rising quickly as demand spiked post-covid.  This is, of course, to Boise Cascade’s benefit with 2020 revenue up 18% y/y and a forecasted 26% rise in 2021. This has led to a rather phenomenal spike in profitability which has resulted in a historically strong balance sheet with far more projected cash than the company can prudently invest in operations leading to speculation of distributions to shareholders and opportunistic M&A.

Given the nature of the increase in revenues, the entire building products along with the homebuilder sector have moved to extraordinarily low valuation levels relative to historical norms. The general consensus being the spike in demand and pricing is relatively transitory and as supply chains normalize, labor and COGS inflation weighs, and revenues come back down (street forecasting 2021 – 2022 revenue growth to be (13%) for BCC) valuation metrics will normalize. Put differently, the present value of future cash flow yields a lower share price than would be implied by a TTM or NTM EV/EBITDA multiple at historical multiple levels arguing for a return to mean in operational performance resulting in a reversion to average multiples rather than a price rise with sustained operational performance.

Personally, I believe the street projected decline in revenue and profitability is overly bearish. Focusing on BCC in particular the company has taken 3 price increases in their engineered wood products division (21% of sales but 43% of EBITDA LTM Q1 2021) since August 2020. Due to the price guarantees in their channels, these price increases take nine to twelve months to fully filter through and for BCC to see the full benefit. Additionally, there is anecdotal evidence of pushed demand, which could drive higher revenues for longer as pushed projects come online. Headwinds on input pricing also appear to be overdone with management commenting on their most recent earnings call that while they are beginning to see some uptick in log pricing rumors of log scarcity is generally overdone and constrained by region. 

Regardless of my personal biases on the future financial performance of the company relative to the street the company’s performance over the last twelve months coupled with the historic lending environment has created a compelling takeover opportunity for a financial sponsor or strategic partner in an industry going through a period of significant M&A.

**Leveraged Buyout Feasibility:**

Using the street's expectations for significant margin pressure in 2022 with 13.5% sales declines as a base case I’ve modeled a 5-year hold with a 22% IRR for a financial sponsor. This assumes 4.5x leverage (3.5x L400 bank facility, 1x sub-debt at 6%, and a $200 million revolver undrawn through the prospective period) and a purchase price at $78 per share or a 25% premium to the current market price. 

A large assumption of this base case is an exit multiple expansion from the transaction 6/30/21 TTM 4.8x multiple to the historical average of 6.7x. While typically a dangerous assumption to make for a base model, the base case operational performance has EBITDA contraction over the 5-year hold at an 18% CAGR. Therefore, the multiple expansion while a notable driver of exit returns reflects generally stable DCF drivers and therefore seems reasonable in a base case model.

Sensitizing operational performance to the upside of course yields an extremely compelling return profile and is largely driven by broader US housing starts. A financial sponsor or strategic acquirer who has a strong view on the direction of these figures would no doubt be motivated to transact at current levels despite the 30% YTD total return for BCC.

**Conclusion:**

Supportive debt markets and historic financial performance have created a unique situation that makes BCC a compelling M&A target for a financial sponsor. A strategic acquirer may be even more motivated given possible synergies and multiple arbitrage as BCC trades at a notable valuation discount to peers.

I believe there is 25% - 30% upside from current levels within the next 6 months should a deal get done. If not, downside is limited by possible shareholder distributions from the historic operational performance resulting in excess liquidity."

Like if you ask “what’s the meaning of life?” and it answers: to live well, or just explodes. It either can’t answer in a pragmatic format or simply can’t answer the possible obstacles it calculates.

2021-06-13 03:42:45,stocks,"I find the idea of this fund pretty bad overall, especially in a taxable brokerage account.

When selling covered calls (or really any options position), there is an aspect of active management there. No option strategy, blindly and mechanically applied, has ever backtested to beat a buy and hold strategy over the long term. This fund is completely mechanical and takes away your control around timing, duration or strike price of the covered calls.

It gets even worse when you consider how much regular income this thing is kicking off for you. For many in higher income tax situations, way too much of this return is given back to taxes. Definitely consider your tax-adjusted yields before buying this fund.

The worst part? You keep all of the downside. A CC strategy is fully exposed to downside in the underlying. QQQ could easily drawdown 30%+ and then suddenly your great yield also contracts once the next set of calls is sold on the against the lower underlying price.

Overall I would MUCH rather hold QQQ and sell my own covered calls when I thought it might be an appropriate market condition."

You need to include this in your DD, otherwise not to sound harsh but it seems like you don't really understand how these things work and its potential risks. It's because according to the ETF prospectus, they write **ATM covered calls**. If you write ATM covered calls as opposed to OTM ones with higher strikes, it means you will get a higher yield but you will actually bearish on the underlying. Covered calls can be a tool to add income, but you need to know how and when they should be used. You can't write an ATM covered call at the bottom of a crash, otherwise you are going to lock in large losses. And that is exactly what QYLD does, which is a huge problem. You simply have no control over when the ETF will write these calls and they do in fact have to write them when corrections happen to NDX, otherwise they won't attract investors looking for ""high monthly yields"".

At any time, the yield can change. The returns I wanted to to show are the actual historical returns of QYLD if you had bought it at that point in time, specifically 07/30/18. -25.2 are the actual values of the period between 07/30/18 and 03/20/20. I chose this period because NDX was mostly flat and which you can compare to something that uses covered calls on NDX. If you bought and held 10000 dollars of QYLD during this period, you would have 7480(-25.2%) of QYLD on 03/20/20. Of course you would also get 1580(15.8%) in yield, resulting in 9060(-9.4%) during this period. If you use morningstar's return which reinvests those dividends during this period, this return is worse than if you hadn't resulting in a -12.29% return. This compares to NDX return of -2.78%. I don't know how you can dispute this, the data is all available. The result is that there is no doubt QYLD underperforms even during flat periods. You need a long term bear market and NO recovery for QYLD to actually outperform NDX."

>The first was our sale in May of 517,500 shares of Class B Common, which generated net proceeds of $565 million.  As I have told you before, we made this sale in response to the threatened creation of unit trusts that would have marketed themselves as Berkshire look-alikes.  In the process, they would have used our past, and definitely nonrepeatable, record to entice naive small investors and would have charged these innocents high fees and commissions. I think it would have been quite easy for such trusts to have sold many billions of dollars worth of units, and I also believe that early marketing successes by these trusts would have led to the formation of others.  (In the securities business, whatever can be sold will be sold.) The trusts would have meanwhile indiscriminately poured the proceeds of their offerings into a supply of Berkshire shares that is fixed and limited.  The likely result: a speculative bubble in our stock.  For at least a time, the price jump would have been self-validating, in that it would have pulled new waves of naive and impressionable investors into the trusts and set off still more buying of Berkshire shares.

As I said, quite different, nonetheless your broker will make money some way by selling you fractional shares while you can simply buy B shares and scrap the middleman. Besides, fractional shares seem to be only a US thing as of yet (AFAIK, being from Canada)."

Therefore a 3M holder gains more value from the change in the share price then they do dividends.

The term “growth stock” is used to describe a company that prioritizes free cash flow for expansion of top line (through capex, r&d, m&a, etc) whereas a value stock places a higher priority on returning shareholder value (share buybacks, dividends, or cash retention).

You can have a “pure” value stock that issues zero dividend but prioritizes all free cash flow into share buybacks. In such a case price appreciation is the only return shareholders receive and cash flow back to investors is identical."

2021-06-13 00:45:33,stocks,"> Other than the dividend is there any access to those assets/earnings for the investor

Yes. The value of the company, which divided by shares, equals the price. 

If the company becomes more valuable, because of more valuable assets, higher earnings, then the stock price goes up. The investor benefits from that. 

Amazon has never paid a dividend. Must be worthless right? But if you bought it when it was $5 a share, as an investor, you definitely benefitted from their growth in assets and earnings."
2021-06-13 05:48:40,stocks,"It's understood that an investor can buy shares and sell for a profit. That's obvious. The question is - why does society give value to a stock? Why does society pay more money for a share of a company that has more assets, even though the company will never share its assets with the investors? Just like how we all came together and blew up meme stocks to the moon, society could randomly decide to crash amazon and google. Share price and market cap are based on supply and demand alone. We decide if we want to demand a certain stock. Why as a society should we demand a stock when the company stated that out of principle they will never share its assets with us?"
2021-06-13 10:11:07,stocks,"You’re missing a fundamental understanding of what stocks are, which makes sense if you only started to pay attention during the recent meme stock explosion. 

Stock is ownership. When you own stock, you own the company. If you were wealthy enough to own 51% of the stock, you would be a majority owner and could bend the company to your will. In reality, 5% owners do this, often exerting control through board seats or influence over proxy voting. 

Maybe think of it this way. You own a lemonade stand. The lemons, the stand, and your profits add up to $100. You can take your profits out of the business (dividends) and use them to buy yourself a nice video game. Or you can plow your profits back into the business, maybe open another lemonade stand. Now let’s say the value of your lemons, stands, and earnings are worth $200. If someone offers to buy your lemonade business, are you still going to sell your business for $100? No. You have two stands now and twice as many profits. Maybe you even have a good replicable model that will allow a third and fourth stand to be built cheaper and easier, so you value yourself at $350. That increase in value accrues to you because you can sell your company at anytime for a profit. “Society” didn’t decide your lemonade company was worth more—math did. 

Same rules apply if you divide your ownership, sell only a portion of the business. You might structure the deal so the other owners receive a share of the profits, or they may buy because they see the potential growth in the company’s value as being worth more than the quarterly earnings. If they bought in when the company was only two stands, and then the company expands to have a nationwide presence and millions in sales, they’re not going to sell their stake for the same price they bought in—the company is worth more. It makes more money. It’s assets are more valuable. Hence the stock price will be too. 

You seem to be hung up on the fact that cash flow from the business aren’t going straight into the shareholders pockets. But this isn’t true. The cash flows from the company could go anywhere, it’s just the owners of the company decide where they go. Either back into the business to fuel growth and higher future cash flows/company value, or into Joe Shmuck’s pocket who owns 2 shares that he bought on robinhood. For various reasons, majority shareholders usually believe putting capital back into the business is a better use of earnings than giving a retail investor a few pennies per share to spend on hookers and blow. In any case, owners are receiving the cash flows, the votes have just decided to spend that money on more lemons and stands instead. If the lemonade company gets sold to Pepsi for cash—every stockholder gets paid out in cash. And if Pepsi is buying, you’re not selling for that original $100 value. Get it?

This is why meme stocks are such a risk. No one honestly believes the assets and earnings are worth this much. Amazon isn’t going to buy the Stop de Game for its current valuation. And basically everything needs to go phenomenally right for that particular
Company to ever be worth that valuation (though there are believers). So the price is mostly supported by speculation, not fundamentals. Millions of Joe Shmucks, manipulated by warring hedge funds and trust fund babies doing it for the lols. At any moment, a large holder could say, “wait, someone is offering me a million dollars for a $100 lemonade stand?” And choose to cash in. And when there’s no one left to buy from you, you’re left holding bags."

The S&P 500 represents real companies that control, run, and operate real assets. Not paper dollars. We're talking the 500 or so LARGEST (big angry letters) companies in the entire world with only a few exceptions. These companies produce and manufacture the majority of the common and essential goods within the United States and also provide the majority of essential services that you buy if you live there (in so many words) inside of the largest consumer economy on the planet Earth. The little rock we live on and also where all of human history has taken place. Again, with only a few exceptions.

Owning these companies represents ownership of actual real tangible stuff. Shit that is actually valuable to own. When paper dollar buck bills with no real tangible value beyond representing potential stuff purchase you less stuff...well, what do you think smart people would buy?

The machine that makes the stuff! The dollars are only a metric for valuing the stuff. The currency itself is worthless beyond being simply a means of exchanging STUFF!

2021-06-13 02:19:05,stocks,"When interest rates are low, bond yields are low. That includes the ""risk-free rate"", which is the return you can get on an asset with negligible risk such as a US Treasury bond. Since the risk-free rate is low, risky investments like stocks are relatively more attractive, because you're getting a greater increase in expected return in exchange for the risk. Current valuations reflect, in part, that we're in such a low-rate environment. They may also be pumped up due to over-buying, but that's harder to quantify.

""Money-printing"" will (eventually, probably) lead to higher inflation. One of the things the Fed does to reduce inflation is raise interest rates. Higher rates lead to bonds having higher yields, which makes risk assets less attractive, which brings their valuations down. Higher rates also make debt more expensive, which hurts companies that rely heavily on debt such as early-stage growth companies, and reduces consumer spending because they have to spend more of their income on interest payments.

Higher rates bring down bond prices because new bonds will have higher yields, so old bonds with lower yields become less valuable. The old bonds still pay the same; it only matters if you want to sell them before they mature."

Many people who have been vaccinated and some who still insist it is unnecessary to be vaccinated.

“Where can they travel to?”
Is there any limitation? Unlike airlines which can, do, and are traveling between countries now, most cruise lines are rather limited on where they go. Any international airport was a more dangerous place to be than a cruise line, before vaccinations were available."

When it stops working on the cruise ship you're fuuuuuuucked. I don't go on cruises because I don't see the point - you hang out on a boat (basically a hotel) for days on end and then pop up in a generic beach town that's completely oriented around a generic tourist experience and has nothing (really) interesting to do.

Those Viking River Cruises did always look interesting to me. Less pre-fab and with a better overall experience. And I'm guessing they make more stops and you have far more good options than an ocean cruise."

Here's the real world for you.  I am vaccinated. My wife is vaccinated. Nearly everyone I come in contact with is vaccinated.  If any of us were to come in contact with someone who is not only not vaccinated but actually sick with the virus, we for the most part, don't care!  Why? Because we are vaccinated!

Before you make other stupid claims.  When I say ""don't care"" what I mean specifically is that we are not worried for our own safety anymore.  We do care that people are sick and dying. But nothing we can do personally will change that.

This isn't a thread about whether or not people are still sick, or even dying.  This is a thread about whether or not the cruise lines will be able to get back to business again soon. And the answer is YES!  If you aren't on the boat, nobody cares.  Those countries that have very few people vaccinated have even less people who ever spent a dime on a cruise ship. Regardless whether people are still sick and dying of covid, the boat will still sail on, with paying passengers excited to get back to living. The pandemic does not need to be completely over before millions of people will get back to living their lives the same way that they used to.

Again, airline travel is almost back to normal. Why wouldn't cruise line travel also be getting back to normal?"
2021-06-13 09:17:13,stocks,"How the hell could you come up with that question?  I am vaccinated.  My wife is vaccinated.  Why would we do such a thing if we ""doubted the existence""?

I asked a question as to where the claim that thousands of people are still dying everyday comes from.  It is an easy thing to say, but without some clue what the person is talking about it is impossible to relate that statement to the topic on hand which is about cruise lines.  I have seen the news about far away countries that still have a real problem on their hands.  I don't think that impacts the cruise industry.  Canada even appears to still have a lot more trouble than the U.S. That might impact the cruise industry a little.  But it also might not.  

As cruise line start operating again they are going to have trouble requiring proof of vaccination.  That has already been made clear.  So it is still quite possible for people to board the ship sick.  Those people could make other people sick, especially some of the few who are not vaccinated.  But most people on the ship will be vaccinated because, well, they just wouldn't come on that ship unless they were. They had a lick of common sense and just happen to think that way.  Those people will probably still be somewhat careful even though they are vaccinated.  And if there is a small surge of new covid cases while on their cruise they will simply shake their heads at the idiots who were less careful and try to enjoy themselves anyway."

2021-06-13 10:04:04,stocks,">You asked for proof of people dying. 

Nope! I did not do that. I asked where the statistic that thousands are dying everyday came from. 

Here's the funny thing about statistics. You can prove just about whatever you want if only you leave out details.  In this case, key details like:

* Where did those people live?
* Is the source for that data a reliable source?

The fact that many have died is unquestionable and there wasn't a shred of that in my question.  But this is not a debate over whether or not the virus is still out there and still killing.  It is about cruise lines and whether or not they will start making money again soon."
2021-06-13 13:36:29,stocks,"It's a matter of fact that thousands of people are dying everyday. Millions have died since the pandemic started. I don't understand your contention.

People say to buy the dip during a market correction, but I’m young and don’t plan on keeping very much of my portfolio in cash and thus won’t have much money to buy dips. I would rather keep my money in the market rather than lose its value to inflation. 

So I was thinking, is a correction the right time them to buy 2-3 year in the money leaps assuming you have a sizable enough portfolio to be able to absorb the losses in case you are wrong or horribly mistime then bottom? I mean, I see the obvious downside of using leverage to catch a falling knife, but it seems worth betting that recovery will occur within a reasonable timeline rather than be the start of a depression.

I have returned to playing Cyberpunk 2077 of late.  That is what I have been mostly playing of late.   But when I really want to zone out I will play Doom Eternal.

> Are you telling me you can't feel an input delay at all? 


I can't tell any difference from playing on local console versus playing using Stadia.   I have set things up to help.

So we also have Google WiFi with the Stadia optimizations.   There is a puck in me and wife's bedroom.    The puck uses wired backhaul.  I then use wired ethernet with a CCU that is connected to a 4K 80"" TV.  This is how I play most of the time.   You want to use wired ethernet when possible.

Otherwise I play on a Pixel Book when I am out and about.   

> You sound ignorant and childish.

How so?  I am actually really old.  In my 50s.

> Latency between server and client, your ping, will never reduce to 0 or anything close to it

Our ping to Google averages 13 ms.   Google has extended the edge and connects directly to our ISP instead of using a tier1 or tier 2.

>  in fact they are a measure of distance, not technological progress. 

There is tricks you can do which I guess would fall under ""technological progress"" that helps improve.   It is why Google not using Windows is a big deal.

The others used Windows.   Which is a big blob in the middle and removes a lot of opportunity to do the predictive aspects.

But it is also infrastructure and that is what makes the most difference with latency.

Google now has over 50% of mobile Internet traffic with a destination of Google.  That has enabled them to invest into architecting their network to extend the edge instead  of using interconnects.

2021-06-12 23:56:43,stocks,"Can you point to where exactly it shows that Sony has relied on something more than Playstation or it's financial serivces in recent history? I looked at your link and still cannot see anything that shows you to be correct. A simply search shows what Sony has really been relying upon. And I'm not saying they're doing a bad job simply because of the fact that they're relying on these divsions, but that they would be in serious trouble if one of the other would happen to tank within any given year, especially Playstation. I can see Sony getting into a situation where they will need to allow Gamepass as an app on their devices which will not turn out well long term."
2021-06-13 15:59:57,stocks,What percentage of Stadia users will have 13 ping?

2021-06-13 00:01:36,stocks,"I can’t believe we’re still having this conversation. All I’m going to say is to look at the revenue mixes for different departments from Sony. And I’m done. You believe whatever you want, but it’s clear that they’re not wholly dependent on Sony Life."
2021-06-13 14:23:48,stocks,"When your country brings anything meaningful to the world stage in terms of wealth, then you can pretend to be important. For the indeterminate future, Microsoft is probably going to be looking closely at the north american market, and secondly at the south american and western european markets.

Sorry to inform you that you aren't important to market metrics, but I'm surprised you couldn't figure it out on your own bozgor."
2021-06-13 13:43:57,stocks,"Yeah, and you come off as a sad fuck who has to resort to pointing out a typo, since you have nothing intelligent or substantive to add to the conversation. Half of your comments have small grammatical errors. Go fix them or you're just a hypocritical bitch."
2021-06-13 13:46:48,stocks,"Nah, you just come off as a douche, so I had to post. Cry more. 

Grammar. You fucking imbecile."
2021-06-13 00:48:08,stocks,"I never once said they were dependant upon Sony Life. Nor did I even say they were dependant upon their financial services division. In fact I say that their financial services divsion is the second second most important division to them and that the most important part, by far, within this divsion is Sony Life. You keep putting words in my mouth.

So no, Sony isn't dependant upon solely life insurance sales in Japan but it is one of the largest portions of the Sony company. And the only reason this is true is not due to amazing insurance divisions of Sony but the fact that Sony has been going downhill elsewhere."
2021-06-13 17:45:37,stocks,"Thanks, it's really entertaining watching your inferiority complex unfold just because I ""insulted"" your internet and chimed in with my own experience about another game streaming service. Apparently it's very important to you that people know Microsoft cares about you. Well, you might be right about Microsoft's plans, I don't really give a fuck, because I'm perfectly happy with Geforce's service, and my high speed internet. I didn't even say anything about Microsoft, it was you who felt the need to prove it to me that your country is more important for them, like it's cutting edge insider info that a US company cares about US customers. Whatever makes you happy."

2021-06-13 14:06:09,stocks,"Oh my god, that's actually a hilarious response. Exactly what I was waiting on

2021-06-13 13:58:27,stocks,and you also somehow don't.  You are a peach!  I'm sure you are having a great day :)
2021-06-13 14:13:15,stocks,Keep telling me about your finances. It has a lot to do with your use of grammar I'm sure. I'm so interested to find out where that non sequitor came from lol

2021-06-13 14:23:53,stocks,"Hey buddy, if you're going to criticize people's grammar, you should at least back it up. That's why I looked at your comment history. It turns out you have about an 8th grader's writing comprehension. It's nothing to be ashamed of, just don't act like a total bitch when you get told you're pedantic. Advice for next time.

If you're trolling and I'm trolling, who's actually getting trolled? Probably the guy who starts randomly spouting about his financial situation in an attempt to brag to the other, who doesn't particularly care if you're rich or broke."

2021-06-13 14:32:26,stocks,Well I can look at your post history too and based on that... you are a sad loser with no money.  Hence hitting you were it hurts or I could of commented on drug abuse but that seemed low.  Advice for next time.

2021-06-12 23:00:35,stocks,A newer article I read stated they plan on being connected to an already existing network and plan on storing carbon underground. Pretty much cut and paste carbon capture as used by oil companies it seems.
2021-06-12 23:01:31,stocks,Is that an OTC ticker? Not sure what that is. Couldn't find anything besides high tide which doesn't seem to relate at all
2021-06-12 23:07:41,stocks,That doesn’t sound like carbon capture it sounds like enhanced oil recovery which is a (bogus in my opinion) form of carbon sequestration
2021-06-12 23:12:55,stocks,"You may be correct, the original Washington post article did cite carbon capture, the article I previously read that is newer did not use that term. But nonetheless, APD is investing in the hydrogen space and it does not affect my opinion. I think this is great for the long term value of the company.

I originally bought APD because of their investments in green hydrogen in Saudi Arabia. They have amazing growth prospects nonetheless. I am also a big believer in the oil trade right now, so perhaps that biased is coming into play, Exxon is big on the carbon capture initiative.

Edit: I also like that APD is connected to Canadian energies and the synergies that are going to present once the project is finished."
2021-06-12 23:21:56,stocks,Yeah I don’t have an opinion on any of that I’m just really interested in carbon capture technology and was wondering if they were doing direct air capture or something futuristic like that!
2021-06-12 23:25:33,stocks,"It's definitely very neat In my opinion. And APD seems to be the only public company investing in that space at the rate they are. I think they offer a very good risk/reward based on the price and P/E that they currently trade at (probably Tok high for true value investors imo.)

I'm currently pretty large in a swing trade with oil, so when I read about Suncor going net zero by 2050,  this seemed to have various synergies with their goals and at the heart of it all, I truly do believe in hydrogen energy. I think APD is going to be a slow steady mover and my opinion is that by 2025 they will double. It is NOT a get Rich quick scheme though, which right now on this market cycle, does not appeal to many. So I see it as a slow mover."
2021-06-12 20:24:51,stocks,"Your comment is super confusing to me. I am all in on gme, I'll say that first. I am also not being rude at all here, so I hope I do not come off as such. I agree with some of this and disagree with other parts. But I am curious, if you state you would rather own TTWO over GME. Then why not sell you GME and buy TTWO? As much as I would 100% love to NOT see anyone sell any gme! I wholeheartedly want to see what I believe to be a free and fair market one day and if you see value elsewhere. Smart investing would say put your money there, no???"
2021-06-12 21:53:25,stocks,"I'm replying to someone commenting about fundamentals. As such I've provided a very small piece of the fundamental analysis I've done on GameStop. Fundamentals would not include a squeeze or an attempt to create a fairer market. That is what I'm referencing in the very last part. Whilst the fundamentals are weak but improving there is something else clearly going on and I'm encouraging others take a closer look at the situation as a whole. 

I'm presenting the argument against its current fundamentals by drawing a contrast to much more fundamentally sound firms like TTWO. I own GameStop regardless because I've taken a closer look at the data and at the very least a blind man could see something is wrong with the way the firm is trading. I believe that if most investors would take the time to look beyond the fundamentals here they would see what has pushed me towards an investment even though I can recognise the fundamental flaws in the company.

Edit: one of the best ways to form a sound thesis is to recognise and address the shortcomings of it. That's what I've done for the GameStop thesis in very short form."
2021-06-12 20:13:42,stocks,"Before the January runup, but close."
2021-06-12 22:46:22,stocks,"Hey, fair enough. Thanks for the very legitimate reply! I would completely agree that what you have stated is enough for you or anyone else to make a currently sound investment decision on GameStop, and come out on top. I do still disagree with your statement about poor fundamentals but can happily agree to disagree considering your reply. I believe I can understand the view which you are choosing to gauge the company's fundamentals and realize I am more heavily weighing them being currently cash positive, registered to release another 5million shares, trimming expenses and growing yoy sales revenue. They still have many things that need to be implemented but I'm super excited at what appears to be a wonderful master plan falling in place. Anyway, best of luck with gme and all other investments you hold! ✌️"
2021-06-13 17:29:46,stocks,another idiot who thinks he can time the market perfectly lol
2021-06-13 12:54:27,stocks,I’m wondering if there’s a leveraged etf for the whole market.  I looked around and haven’t found one yet.
2021-06-13 04:26:43,stocks,oil is dead.  just like was said last year.  got it.
2021-06-13 00:39:24,stocks,Definitely use stop losses. Risk management is Job #1.
2021-06-13 00:41:07,stocks,"In a liquid stock you’ll get close enough. If it’s so bad that it still blows right through, you’ll probably want to get out with whatever you can get anyway."
2021-06-13 13:35:06,stocks,"A little off topic but I really need help here. Let’s say I have a few grand in one stock on the verge of a SS and it’s in RH, and I just opened a TD account that is waiting to be funded. Should I transfer said stock from RH to TD asap and risk missing my exit or wait to exit said stock before transferring gains? Basically, is my money safe in RH for now? I know it’s not much money but it may be in a short time and I just want to make sure my money will be secure"
2021-06-13 17:01:45,stocks,"No wonder so many people there lose money. The ""mods"" permit posts that drive weak individuals to bet their savings in things they shouldn't."

2021-06-13 09:32:03,stocks,"Canadian Solar builds and manages large solar projects. They don't necessarily have to be in Canada. I think some of their recent large projects have been mostly in Australia and I think they just started work on a big Arizona plant, that's why I put money in with them."
2021-06-13 05:04:37,stocks,How’s the squeeze working out for you! Sure glad 6/9 was a big date
2021-06-13 12:45:56,stocks,"I'm more into a debt free company with growing revenue and a big pile of cash putting together a pretty impressive group of executives to transition from a brick and motor company to an e-commerce company with a somewhat established distribution network that can provide same day delivery.   Having a few hundred thousand people super excited about it all doesn't hurt either.

I piled on pretty big in the 40s so if you wanna call it a squeeze I'm doing OK."
2021-06-13 14:08:05,stocks,Ahahahagagaggagagahahahahahahahahahahahaggayaya I can smell your tears from here
2021-06-13 18:08:35,stocks,"Ok.

Last week I kept the same amount of shares and its worth about 55k less.   Is that what your getting excited about?   Because I'm pretty ok with it.

My trucking company and my rentals are still doing fine.

I just backed my boat into a big flower pot and I guess I'm down about 200 on that.   Wanna get excited about that?

On the other hand... a week later you came here to ask about a squeeze and a date I dont really care about.

So I mean did you just win the internet?   Because on my books I'm up what I can guess is an easy 3 years salary for you on gme alone.   You're up some comment I guess.


How are your life choices working out for you?"

2021-06-13 18:27:03,stocks,"Haven't cried once.    Pretty ok with my knowledge of how the stark market works.

Just wanna point out that you're on here getting excited about how other people are doing.   Nobody at all anywhere cares how you're doing.

Think about that.   Seriously let that thing in.    Nobody cares what you think."
2021-06-13 19:23:46,stocks,"Oh yea I do want you to know that I’m getting immense pleasure from seeing you guys fail every single time, you Q Anon nuts make me happy when you move goal posts. And I’ll be here for next time it doesn’t squeeze as well. See ya!

2021-06-12 20:32:43,stocks,thats true just a matter of time before coin hits $70-80 10 for 1 split adjusted 😎

2021-06-13 14:19:56,stocks,"Elastic Elasticsearch is a tiny part of Elastic's business. Elastic is doing really well with Observability and Security. Their competitors are Datadog, Splunk, and so on. AWS Elasticsearch competes with Elastic Cloud but not 100%.   
This year Elastic was named visionary in the 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Application Performance Monitoring (Observability): [https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-named-as-a-visionary-in-the-2021-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-application-performance-monitoring](https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-named-as-a-visionary-in-the-2021-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-application-performance-monitoring). IMO Elastic can really grow in Observability and Security. Also, they hiring a lot of product designers and managers so that these solutions can have better UX and compete better with Data Dog and Splunk.  
Other companies like Algolia are taking the search space, even though Elastic has an Enterprise Search solution IMO they more focused on Observability and Security. 

I own $ESTC and I truly believe this stock will reach 200$ easily."
2021-06-13 07:33:23,stocks,One of us will be right. I guess we will have to agree to disagree. However i wish you good luck with everything and all the best dude. We all deserve to make our money out the stock market in whichever stock we love.

2021-06-13 07:22:39,stocks,"I agree with Disney being pretty overvalued right now. With that being said though, how do you feel the opening/loosening up of the COVID restrictions is going to effect their stock, if at all, when full capacity comes back to Disneyland parks. I don’t know about you, but I feel once Disney opens up to max capacity everyone and their grandmas are gonna go to the parks, ESPECIALLY if they get rid of mask rules (still up in the air I think if they are going to do that as well as opening up capacity restrictions.) Surely their next earnings report will be pretty good with the (potential) large influx of park comers starting next week or so."

A nonsense stock for the sake of it is honestly the dumbest advice people give here to kids. We all know the stats these days.

2021-06-13 12:10:33,stocks,">Kids who invest in risk averse allocation outperform speculative kids. Put it in apple at 18 and take your annualized twenty percent.

This is untrue.  Also, AAPL has been a growth company for quite some time, for a pretty hefty portion of the last 20 years it has been a growth stock.

I'm not talking about buying nonsense stocks.  I'm talking about real, solid companies.  Growth =/= meme.  You are not very intelligent if you can't tell the difference.  It is a little like saying a car and a kangaroo are the same thing, because you could technically ride both and they both move on land.

I'll play with some meme stocks, but I wouldn't put more than a tiny position on, and wouldn't encourage anyone else to do so either.

>Help a kid grow inter generational wealth, not handicap it because you think “haha go moon”

I have dozens of messages/comments from people thanking me for changing their lives permanently because of comments I made last fall.  Pretty sure I've done that."

1. Record high number of IPOs in 2020-2021 and most of them surged with 0 reasons
2. Many life-time ""short squeeze"" stocks including GME, AMC, etc,
3. Bankrupt companies stocks surged with 0 reasons (ex: Hertz)
4. Fundamentals do not work
5. A lot of stupid posts ""xxx to the moon!"" made by new investors who do not know anything about investing
6. So many speculative stocks surging a couple of hundreds %, including TSLA.
7. Record high PE in a lot of ETFs/stocks
8. Cryptocurrency market going crazy
9. A lot of ads about trading"

2021-06-13 05:05:03,stocks,"Not following?  Why does it matter if they generate revenue from ads or subscriptions?

In both cases it is the same dollars.

Where you worry is when there is just one asset able to generate ads.  Then you have a concentration issue.   But Google has it nicely spread across a number of properties and YouTube in particular is just killing it.   YouTube 50% growth YoY !!
