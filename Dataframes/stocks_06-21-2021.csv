Once rates get raised and the easy money faucet gets turned off we’re looking at a massive asset bubble that’s been building since 2008 exploding. 

So the fed will continue to kick the can down the road because inflation doesn’t exist."

2021-06-21 19:41:42,stocks,"Yeah that's a bad idea. The reason stocks are up so much is because people are moving money from the bond market into the stock market to make money. The bond market is way bigger than the stock market. 2020 and 2021 have become a self fulfilling prophesy because money goes into stocks, stocks go up, people make money and invest it in the market again, it goes up, and the whole thing repeats. The issue is that eventually we will have to combat inflation with increased interest rates. People are so on edge that they hang on every single thing Jpow says. If the market was actually robust, we wouldn't be paying as much attention to Jpow as we are. It wouldn't surprise me if we're at a new ATH and we see a gradual decline in the coming years.

Edit: I would like to point out that if OP were to dump his savings into SPY right now and an event like 2001 or 2007 were to occur, it would potentially be 10 years before he sees any gains. Just a big FYI."

One of my earliest ETF investment was VTI at 30k. I've never added to it since. It's worth 75k now.

SPY doubles in value every 6.5 to 7 years.

If you're not a stock picker, buying an index fund goes up slow and steady. No tremendous gains or losses. 

I'm a gambler now, i like to pick stocks. But 40% of my portfolio are index funds.

2021-06-21 18:02:23,stocks,"I’ve been investing and trading since 2007. The biggest thing I’ve learned is to buy or sell the hype/news and not wait for the actual event. Example, the news about a merger happening and not waiting for the actual merger. My best early trade was Sirius XM and I waited for the merger but the news of the approved merger was when I should’ve sold and I thought I had a great profit but it will be even better when they get operating. Wrong! But my research was correct about that trade in the first place. Learned and moved forward. Next. Resist the temptation to trade!! This is really hard. I could’ve bought Goog, Netflix, FB, Apple and held all of that time and made tons more than what I did as a trader. Maybe separate the two and open two accounts. The “I never sell account” and the “trader account.” Buy dividend stocks or change the game companies in the I never sell account and reinvest the dividends into more stock and wait for stock splits. I’ve tried to have them both in the same account but when you stare at it everyday and some news about something big comes, I cut myself off at the knees and didn’t see it thru because I wanted to reallocate those dollars. Next, Don’t be afraid to cut your losses and move on from a stock. Also, don’t be afraid to take small profits all along the way. A win is a win! Sometimes taking a loss can be a win because you move on and in hindsight you find you could’ve lost even more. Hope this is what you guys are looking for! Hope it helps!"

If you would've told me 5 years ago I could get almost anything I wanted delivered to my house on the same day I placed the order, I wouldn't have believed you.

That would have given me 793,650 of this sneaky currency in 2008, sold at 18k, which would net me $14,285,700,000. Bought again at 4k giving me 3,571,425, and sold at 60k for 214,285,500,000

Assuming my buying and selling of that currency didn't drastically change how the market reacts (which it certainly would at that volume).

Probably would have been happy with the first $14 billion.

If you do have a theory on this, please share because I’d love to know your thoughts. 

With that being said, the federal government can’t even pass bipartisan infrastructure legislation. How worried do Amazon shareholders need to be about meaningful antitrust legislation being passed? Personally, a bigger concern to me is the apparent mistreatment of their warehouse workers."

Morality aside, they know how to make money and are insanely good at marketing their product.  3)  Poised to dominate, and I mean DOMINATE, the Marijuana business if it gets legalized.  They have a ton of cash just stockpiled waiting for weed to be legal, and then you'll see them own that market too because they'll buy up every weed company from California to Canada."

People in tech love building PCs and playing video games. They typically earn more than other industries, and thats where the money will come from (both investments & consumer spending). A dedicated retailer for that industry (in my opinion) will be a goldmine for the next 50 years."

2021-06-21 19:56:09,stocks,When you work for a tech company you naturally have a huge amount of exposure due to equity compensation being near 50pct.

It will be a slow death of a thousand paper cuts over time."
2021-06-21 18:26:24,stocks,I like that they have decreased spending on other bets. Decreased spending equals margin expansion. Combine that with stock buy backs and you get projected 50 - 100% yoy EPS growth in 2021. Pretty incredible for a 1.6 T company

2021-06-21 16:11:46,stocks,"If you're selling you wanna do the opposite of buying.

So if you believe the stock will go down, sell a call. If you believe it will go up, sell a put."
2021-06-21 17:10:39,stocks,"Right. As long as you sell at a strike above the cost basis, you'll make a profit. Beware of exercise/assign fees from your broker (if any) that might eat into profits.

Note you can still lose money if the underlying tanks though. If you're bullish on the stock that's not a problem because you'll just hold until it rises again."
2021-06-21 16:15:32,stocks,"That much i understand, rn I’m hoping the price stay where it is for the next few months so I can keep selling the same strike priced options so the premiums cover my losses in the stock.

Edit: i just wanna make sure if the calls are exercise that I technically wont be at a loss."
2021-06-21 16:29:31,stocks,"You are correct, long as the strike price is above your break even you will not lose money if it gets exercised. You lose out on gains if it goes past your strike and you still take losses if the stock goes down."
2021-06-21 16:06:05,stocks,"r/valueinvesting

I think many value investors agree that the most important value is free cashflow.

As a value investor you want to invest in profitable companies with a moat.

A moat is a **lasting** competitive advantage. This can be a brand, a patent or even cheap production costs.

Ok then you want to look at P/E ratios. You want a low P/E, cause then your starting yield is better.

Then you want a high ROE.

Warren Buffett for example says that the company should have a P/E of 10 or lower, but he's an OG so it doesn't necessarily mean that he's right or wrong.

I think it's crucial to invest in solid companies as a value investor!!!

You want to be in a solid industry that doesn't get disrupted.

Value is pointless without quality!

Like you don't buy ANYTHING 'cause it's cheap, you buy cheap QUALITY."
2021-06-21 19:10:45,stocks,what are stock fundamentals?
2021-06-21 16:29:11,stocks,"It doesn't work like that. It's a daily copy times 2 or 3. Not some kind of compounding thing. SPY lost almost exactly 1/3 in March 2020, SPXL got the shit kicked out of it but only went down to about 25% of it's peak value. Expenses don't mean anything, they will just crank up their leverage if they need more juice, they have plenty of ability to do so. I guess it's possible someday the financial markets could fail and the derivatives they use to get their return would become insolvent. But even then they would probably have a fair part of their assets that are solvent like the 95% of their holdings which is the underlining asset S&P 500 and T bills."

E.g. if you put $100,000 into SQQQ in 2011, you'd now have $10.  The asset price stays within a certain range via reverse splits.

AMD has so much going for them with their technology and chips in xbox, ps5, samsung phones, teslas. And if you know anything about cpus for computers the sentiment in the gaming world is intel=bad amd=good. Will reflect in market share in the long run."

2021-06-21 16:23:18,stocks,"AMD is my long term, favorite stock. I've been adding 1 share a week for awhile. I even started doordashing just to maintain my ability to comfortably buy a share per week.

I've been around computers for awhile, and I remember when AMD & ATI were separate companies. While Nvidia has no doubt pulled away in the GPU market, ATI at one point made the best cards.

AMD as a company now is like if Intel and Nvidia had a child. Now, that child is finally maturing to a point at which it has all the opportunity in the world to keep growing."
2021-06-21 16:09:05,stocks,"Long term hold for me.

2021-06-21 16:59:39,stocks,It's the only red stock in my portfolio. But will continue to hold as their products will continue to be in demand in the future.
2021-06-21 15:44:55,stocks,I like AMD.

2021-06-21 16:06:02,stocks,"I like AMD long term, but after last year’s tremendous run, it’s been cooling off some and there’s a strong ceiling at 90ish. My plan has just been to add a little whenever it dips into the 70s and to be patient."
2021-06-21 19:02:59,stocks,I walked around best buy this weekend and more than half the laptops on display had amd stickers.

They have also announced a $4 billion share repurchase program to increase returns for shareholders.  It’s also a good sign, they have reached a deal with Google.

I think once the merger with XLNX goes through to help meet their ever increasing demand.  I think we should see triple digits on the share price fairly soon

Disclaimer: not financial advice"
2021-06-21 16:28:38,stocks,I think it's a GREAT BUY. I've been a holder since $14
2021-06-21 17:40:52,stocks,"I have been slowly gathering it. 

I started buying a lump at around $45 a share and am currently buying a few more shares every so often it dips to the mid 70s. 

I'm up to 75 shares now and plan on holding for a while. I eventually see this hitting at least the 100-110 price point over time.

More:

They are absolutely dominate in the cpu market right now. They own both playstation and Xbox (many year cycle) and are finally starting to make inroads in the data center CPU game. Nvidia is still dominating in GPUs, but AMD is starting to make some plays and recently his impressed with some upcoming features."
2021-06-21 17:03:13,stocks,"Great company, great products, terribly overvalued stock."
2021-06-21 18:50:23,stocks,"If the EU Antitrust Organization ok's AMDs merger with Xilinx in the next 3 weeks, and it's popular belief it will, the stock should flirt with its ATH around 100 pretty quickly. The real challenge comes next summer to push it past that level when the Chinese antitrust makes their ruling on it. 

If EU denies the merger, look the fuck out because this baby's going down, and fast.
It's a high risk, high reward situation at this point. AMD posts great profits and gives good guidance on earnings and the stock has a tendency to dip anyway. It's maddening.

It's the most frustrating stock I've ever owned because of the vast difference between what I see in it and what the market seems to see in it. Make no mistake though, I will cut ties completely if the merger is denied by anyone."
2021-06-21 19:17:49,stocks,I like amd

2021-06-21 17:53:39,stocks,"Xilinx could be a very big deal. The whole world is looking for FPGAs right now and can’t get them, and most of those people are looking for Xilinx fpgas. FPGAs aren’t consumer products generally so most people don’t understand just how important they are.

With that said, I don’t know enough about how supply chain issues affect stock prices to tell you anything"
2021-06-21 18:02:25,stocks,"Well it has done great for me since I bought it close to $11 just a bit over 2 years ago.

My decision has been to hold and not get taxed on the gains, but I haven't increased my position.

I think AMD is a long-term buy. It is priced a bit high right now as investors are expecting growth and more revenue in the next couple of years, but that growth in the share price. If they beat expectations it will go up more. If there is macro-economic instability or other market problems, it might be prone to more volatility and greater decreases in value.

If your looking for short-term purchases, it might face some volatility at times. It is definitely a high growth stock and the market is pricing that in. Any small thing puts future gains in jeopardy will lower the price."
2021-06-21 15:55:47,stocks,I also entered last week. I'm excited about the q2 results and I am hoping the stock hits 95 next quarter. But this is just my two cents

2021-06-21 17:36:52,stocks,"Forget the gaming market, they are absolutely creaming Intel in the server space. Intel is atleast competitive in price for gaming but the server space is another story. Not only did it take them 2 years to offer a single socket 32 core CPU, but those cores are plain 10-16% slower than AMDs. The only reason to use Intel is for specialized workloads at this point. The enterprise market is where the main money for these companies is at and AMD is eating Intels market share as it stands."
2021-06-21 16:19:29,stocks,I wonder if XLNX has more potential to grow with the merger announcement if it comes. It seems more volatile

2021-06-21 16:12:40,stocks,"From what I understand. Intel did very well, got complacent, perhaps too greedy. Got their ass kicked by AMD. Decided to clean house and shifted strategy. I like the new CEO so I think it'll recover.

2021-06-21 17:49:55,stocks,The US is so dependent on chips from Taiwan (an island right next to China) that from a national security point of view Intel is a strategic resource.
2021-06-21 17:10:48,stocks,“But paying such amounts of dividend when the company has such a huge debt is questionable.” You see I cant take anything in your post seriously now. I mean like just by that sentence alone I can tell you have done no serious research in this company and just spouting garbage and have no idea what you are talking about.
2021-06-21 16:12:29,stocks,"I thought HP would be about the last company to ditch Intel chips because but even the last elitebook I got issued at my job had an AMD processor in it. For what I actually do with it the newer Intel's were fine and from what I understand you can get new elitebooks with either, but was kind of eye-opening to me in how they're losing marketshare for even mundane uses.

That said the interviews I've heard with the current CEO he's saying all the right stuff."
2021-06-21 16:41:39,stocks,"I'm not sure why someone would pick Intel over AMD if they wanted to invest in this space. Sure, Intel is still a good company and I don't believe that they are going anywhere anytime soon.

I hope that Pat Gelsinger does a good job and makes Intel competitive again. Competition in the processor space is good. But (all memes aside) I wouldn't pick Pat over mama Sue. Look what she's done with the company over the past few years. AMD used to be a joke. Now it seems foolish to choose anything but AMD if you're buying a CPU! That didn't happen by accident. Brilliant innovation and leadership."
2021-06-21 15:52:53,stocks,"Intel was on their high horse for many years as they marketed themselves as a superior chip maker.  Unfortunately for them when your on top there is only one way to go . Simply put , they are trash. I would short it or just buy puts if you want to to touch it at all. Apple is well on their way to fully ditching them, and if my suspicions are correct Microsoft will be developing their own chips before we know it. Leaving intel and their inferior products in the dust."

2021-06-21 18:20:26,stocks,There IS a tech threat. And it already won. ARM based chips will rob most of intels core markets in the next decade and it already took ALL of mobile chips.

2021-06-21 18:07:44,stocks,"OP: Why is Intel so apparently cheap?

also OP: Intel is pretty trash

I mean, you essentially explained your own opening curiosities as it pertains to, ""Why is Intel priced like it is?"" It's got flaws. It has slipped up and let its competition gain significant ground. It has no charm for retail, who are more likely to be attracted to products they use for their high-end gaming PCs.

That's not to say INTC is radioactive. But it's a clear-as-day value option, which has its pros and cons. I'm long on INTC because I think it'll round the corner eventually. I could be wrong. I'm OK with that."
2021-06-21 19:13:03,stocks,Yeah I would say I have to agree. Future prospect looking good with the shifted strategy although it will take some time for these changes to materialize positively which I think they will. In the mean time you will get some dividend and I feel like the stock won't be dropping belows 50s unless it becomes clear they won't be able to execute. Planning on opening a position relatively soon when I clear some funds.
2021-06-21 17:27:13,stocks,"I can tell you why someone would choose to invest in Intel over AMD: valuation. Based on the comments in this thread and on this sub in general, you'd think Intel was on the brink of going under or about to be swallowed by AMD. I'd strongly suggest having a look at both companies' financials to get a better understanding of the situation.

Here are some numbers (from 2020) to put things into perspective:

Free cash flow (FCF): INTC $20 B - AMD $0.77 B
Revenue: INTC $77.7 B - AMD $11.4 B
Oustanding shares (last 5 years): INTC -14% - AMD +52.8%
Price to FCF: INTC 15.5 - AMD 290

If the immense differences in revenue, FCF and valuation weren't enough, AMD also managed to dilute its shareholders by a whopping 53% over the past 5 years, while Intel actually bought back shares and thereby increased the equity per share. If you don't know what this means, I advise you to learn more because this severely impacts the returns you will see on your investment. It's about more than just the movement of the stock price."
2021-06-21 18:47:29,stocks,"You should care because monopolies are bad for consumers—look at AMDs pricing, it’s only gone up."

2021-06-21 17:35:44,stocks,"This person gets it, couldn’t have said it better, recently bought my first intel shares"
2021-06-21 17:58:34,stocks,"I don't think that Intel is about to go under, and anyone who does think so is foolish. I hope my comment above didn't give that impression. I also never mentioned the movement of the stock price.

The fact that AMD has been innovating and producing a better product than Intel has recently is undeniable. If that continues to happen (and who's to say it will), AMD will continue to creep in on Intel's market share."
2021-06-21 18:54:03,stocks,intel market cap is 3\* the amount of AMD and is still making way more profit. Monopoly is the least of my concern
2021-06-21 15:03:04,stocks,"My brother in law came into some money and decided he was gonna buy a house with it but in the UK prices are very high so he's been waiting for almost 2 years while prices have continued to soar. If they eventually correct they might only come back down to where they were 2 years ago so he would be no better off. And that's if they correct at all.

Same with stocks, they could rise for a few more years and then correct back down to where we are now.

I bought my house in 2011 after the market crash so I got lucky with the timing, it's more than doubled in value since then but only part of that is because I got lucky at the time, most of it is due to undersupply in the UK housing market and that isn't going to change, if it's the same where you are and there's more demand than supply then you should buy now IMO."
2021-06-21 15:07:53,stocks,Real estate is always going up.  The market crashed in 2008 and look at where we are now.  Buy something in your price range.  Consider it an investment and not your dream home.  When you decide to buy the dream home you will get that money back plus what you have paid off plus the difference of the increased value.  Buy a condo someplace desirable sell it in a few years.

A house can grow in value if the town grows. Sometimes they don't. My parents place over the last 30 years has flatlined while the surrounding cities grew. It's not like they lost value, just didn't really get anything.

There's finally more building in the area, but now they complain of traffic. This is exactly what they should want if they want property values to go up for them.

People can keep getting loans for .7% APR (if you’re rich and have access to PALs) otherwise you can get a 2% APR 15 year mortgage. You only need the real estate to increase by a few % to make a killing, since you’re leveraged to the tits. Basically, this show of borrowing and increasing the price of real estate through borrowed money will keep continuing as long as rates are near 0%. We’ll only see the music stop once interest rates increase."

2021-06-21 15:24:38,stocks,I learned in the last housing bubble that my house was a place I could live in and may make some money if I sold.  It is not the best investment because it was  easier to unload my stocks than unloading my house when the markets fell.

isnt it better to hold cash then? but then again inflation.."
2021-06-21 16:00:52,stocks,But the only way you get your profit is if you can unload the house that is highly leveraged.  If everyone is wanting to unload at the same time..... you'll have to sell for a loss or just walk away from the mortgage.... repeat of 2007/2008.... and the funny thing is mortgage rates are even lower now than they were then.

It’s inevitable that we will go into a recession, wether it’s tomorrow or 5 years from now we don’t know, so it’s just best to get into the market and stop worrying."
2021-06-21 16:09:35,stocks,"Absolutely, it’s basically just timing the market. Real estate as an investment is not very liquid, so the illiquidity risk is very real. We’ll see how long this goes, but most markets are not being driven by fundamentals imo."

2021-06-21 14:56:33,stocks,"My problem with GM and other traditional automakers are EV plays is this question: How will shifting their entire automaker lineup over to EVs help them bring in more profits in future years? I've yet to hear a convincing answer to this question.

People have Tesla's price up so high not because it's about EVs, but because they're delivering rapid growth year over year. They're expected to continue growing 30 to 40 percent year over year for a number of years as they continue building more gigafactories. I see little chance of established automakers like GM ever putting up those kinds of numbers no matter how successful their transition to EVs is.

GM's best hope for growth quite frankly is if a number of other automakers fail to make the transition to EVs and go bankrupt, allowing the survivors like GM to cannibalize their market share. But there's a problem with making this into your bullish thesis for why GM will grow a bunch from EVs. If a lot of other automakers can't transition to EV's then chances are GM will run into a lot of the same troubles that prevented those automakers from transitioning to EVs. So what's your explanation for how GM will overcome those problems and thrive while other automakers will fail to overcome those problems and collapse?

Realistically I think the best case scenario for GM is their sales numbers stay roughly where they are today after an expensive transition to EVs."

In the post ICE, EV World, there will be 65-70 mm cars sold worldwide each year.   Now the EV % of those sales without a doubt will rise rapidly but if you run up the stock price on every manufacturer all you get is margin expansion with no hope of actual sales growth.   Now there are likely to be some winners and losers, so if you can pick those you may have a chance to make some money."

If anything both GM and FORD are the ones who are highly over valued as the both are sitting on a huge industrial complex that will soon become worthless and/or costing them billions to get out of leaving Tesla the Lions share of the future car industry with little real competition."

I feel like making these sort of long term, speculative plays in Ford, GM, VW, etc. is expecting the EV revolution to cause a major upheaval such that these companies ultimately end up pushing each other out of the way, securing larger shares of the existing auto market in the process. 

Basically, you're spot on. These plays are just betting on the other companies to lose just as much as they're betting on others to win. And with the amount of money these big manufacturers are putting into the EV movement, I don't know how likely that is to happen."

And as far as quality goes... yeah Tesla might have a lot of cool tech, but the build quality is trash. (From what I've read/heard, I don't own one.)

2021-06-21 18:24:55,stocks,">  How will shifting their entire automaker lineup over to EVs help them bring in more profits in future years? I've yet to hear a convincing answer to this question.

I think this isn't a good question.  EVs as a sector, especially outside of China (but also including China), have been and will continue to be an extremely high margin product.  The Bertrand trap that ICE autos fell into on account of their dominance took a long time.  So, as traditional OEMs shift their existing supply chains and expertise into EVs, they should be able to maintain as good or better margins due to economy of scale and their expertise in the sector, not to mention existing networks and relationships up and down the chain.


So while yes, there may be some costs to switching, they're really not that significant since EVs are so simple to make.  The software and tech expertise they already have or can acquire.


Your take on the need for other automakers to fail is pretty ludicrous.  Consolidation in the industry may happen, but probably around 2030.  Right now the market's wide open and there's basically unlimited money out there flowing into the space."
2021-06-21 15:03:05,stocks,"> The problem with GM is that US consumers just don’t really like them. They’re not struggling as hard as Daimler-Chrysler, but they’re not doing great.

I think this is part of why GM is struggling right now in the EV market. Most of the people buying EVs today are still early adopters, and early adapters don't have a good opinion of the GM brand. Early adapters want all the latest tech and gadgets, which is why Tesla does so well with them, GM isn't exactly known for being first at bringing consumers the latest car tech.

When EV's become more mainstream I think GM will have an easier time selling them to the people who are typically interested in buying GM vehicles."

2021-06-21 16:48:55,stocks,"A ton of what you said is simply misguided and shows a lack of knowledge.Tesla produces EV batteries at a cheaper price than their competitors. That's why their cost will be lower than other EV makers while having equal or better performance. A large percentage of EV vehicles will be the cost of batteries. GM is expected to reduce the cost of battery cells to $75 per kilowatt hour by 2025 while Tesla is already targeting a $50 per kilowatt hour by the same timeframe.

You also need to convert your factories. ICE vehicles cannot be constructed using manufacturing designed for EV's and vice-versa. Tesla is fully EV so there is no conversion process that GM will undoubtedly have to face as a learning curve.

Tesla is expected to produce a $25,000 sedan by late 2022. My assumption is mid 2023 is a better estimate. NOTHING GM is expected to produce will beat that value.

You also completely ignore the beauty of a Tesla... their autopilot system is designed for the future. GM's Cruise is severely underwhelming and unlikely to be anywhere close to what Tesla has. Tesla's autonomous driving already logged 500 million self-driving miles during year 2018. GM only logged 447k miles. GM is way behind in terms of research and development.

Your regulatory credits is a terrible argument. Is it helping Tesla? Sure. But the fact that the regulatory credits continue climbing show that plenty of other auto companies are still lagging behind which means Tesla's lead continues to grow. Companies also plan their spending based on what they expect to receive. If regulatory credits didn't exist, Tesla would change other parts of their business. That regulatory revenue just means Tesla has more money to play with but it doesn't decide the fate of their business. It's just what novices like to point to when they try and discredit the sustainability of Tesla.

The government rebate, which I believe you are referring to as tax credits, already expired for Tesla years ago during July 2018... The individuals purchasing Tesla's right now are not receiving a federal tax credit. GM also doesn't have any federal tax credits as well. If this isn't what you mean by government rebate, please tell me which one you are specifically referring to.

My relatives own Teslas. The build quality could be better but Tesla is still relatively new at the mass manufacturing part of constructing vehicles. Could they be better? Definitely. But the build quality isn't 'trash.' And it will improve as they gain more experience. Constructing EV's isn't cheap. That's why GM is planning to spend $35 billion. There will be a learning curve for GM just like there was for Tesla.

As for the labor claims, many auto companies end up dealing with labor claims. GM has one right now in Mexico. Stop acting as if these labor claims are going to defunct Tesla's business. They will be handled accordingly and your assumption that they will have a 'hard time' shows that you haven't really paid attention to numerous labor claims that have happened for auto companies for many decades now. They aren't new concerns.

Ask yourself why almost every Tesla produced is sold. They have very low inventory which is why they are ramping up factories with the Berlin factory being a huge gamechanger for Tesla vehicles in Europe. When the fed government eventually approves the $7.5k to $10k tax credit, you would be able to purchase a $25,000 sedan Tesla (expected release mid 2023) for around $12-14k after all incentives."
2021-06-21 17:21:51,stocks,That doesn't answer the question though. Shifting to EVs for GM means spending billions to make LESS money on their cars in the next ten years. I personally think the chance they don't go bankrupt is extremely small.

Like, a lot of car. As in, most of the vehicle, only need to change the power plant part of assembly line, the rest can pretty much still be used, with very little modification, and produce...millions... of vehicles year in and out. 

You're right, they no longer get the government ""rebate"", I thought that was going to be phased out soon, but it already has. 

The carbon credit... yes that expires soon. And selling those credits to other industrial facilities is what Tesla actually makes money on. They lose money with every vehicle produced. They can afford to operate that way, because of those credits. 

The labor issues...yes... all manufactures deal with them. The big three are union, and have a way to deal with them. Tesla just keeps racking them up, and sorry but the labor movement has been gaining steam, I don't see people, especially after the pandemic, slowing down on what should be the way to employ people. There's a funny correlation to companies constantly ranked in the best places to work also being the best gainers in the stock market long term. Not hype, not false equivalents, but actual sustainable gains. 

You even admitted Tesla can't produce top quality product at even 500k a year vehicles sold. 
Tesla isn't fighting only GM, who has a larger market share, supply chain, R&D departments, you name it, Tesla isn't going to touch just GM in those fields, and that's today, right now. Now add Ford, VW, Mercedes, BMW, etc etc who have all came out recently stating they will no longer even develope ICE engines for the majority of their product lines. Do you think they just up and closed that department? Those resources won't be used to further EV development? 

The autopilot? That keeps hitting things? That one? 
Still in its infancy, and it won't be a problem for any of the other manufacturers to open source that shit and get the best out there, when the time comes. 

That and Teslas are hideous. Each car maker has ugly ass cars that made it to development, but Tesla... just ugly. That truck is an abomination. Fords EV F-150 will kill that thing in sales, even if the range is lower, even if the truck costs more... thats the biggest selling truck ever. And the EV one looks just like a new F-150. What a way to convert gas heads into EV. Theres like 30 million plus people that are die hard ""ford"" and another 30 million die hard ""Chevy"".

So... just the first article that Google said:

""While Tesla is the leading maker of electric cars, it faces increased competition as virtually every automaker rolls out their own EVs, or plan to do so. Volkswagen has passed Tesla in terms of EV sales in most of Europe. GM said last week it hopes to shift completely to emissions-free cars by 2035. It’s a lucrative business for Tesla — bringing in $3.3 billion over the course of the last five years, nearly half of that in 2020 alone. The $1.6 billion in regulatory credits it received last year far outweighed Tesla’s net income of $721 million — meaning Tesla would have otherwise posted a net loss in 2020.""

2021-06-21 18:14:07,stocks,"firstly, GM is making money on their bestselling China EV. Secondly, if you really think their Sedan will cost 25k keep dreaming. It'll cost at least 40-50k or they'll be losing 10k each car they sell. eDuCaTe YoUrSeLf Or I wIlL"

2021-06-21 18:17:58,stocks,Their model 3 is below $40k but their new sedan will be $40-50k....? Do you even use your brain? GM isn't make money on their EV sales. That partnership they have in China is being subsidized by the other partner in China. The CEO came out in 2019 and stated that they were losing money on their Chevy Bolt. You're investing your few grand on a company you have very little knowledge about. I'm done having a discussion with you. You've got nothing factual to add.
2021-06-21 19:22:41,stocks,Im not even close to 14 where tf you get that from

2021-06-21 14:27:14,stocks,"So the price per share of an ETF can represent different number of shares of the underlying stocks in the ETF but they should all represent the same ratio of the underlying companies to get the same performance.  Some may want to buy a cheaper ETF per share but the most important factor are the expense ratios and the fact that one ETF is more expensive than another per share really doesn't matter much as you just own a different number of shares of each.

The actual value of an ETF is represented by the NAV and the NAV will go up and down with the value of the underlying securities even if the price of the ETF is not changing because no one is trading it.  If the price of an ETF gets too far out of sync with the NAV then authorized participants can create or destroy shares of the ETF, They will buy shares of the underlying companies to create new shares of the ETF that they can sell at a profit if the price is too high or they can buy shares of the ETF and eliminate them and then sell the shares of the underlying companies for a profit if the price of the ETF is too low.  This keeps the price of the ETF in line with the NAV no matter the inflows or outflows of the ETF.  Obviously the price will still stray a little from the NAV but never too far."
2021-06-21 14:25:18,stocks,"If I understand your question right, this is essentially the same idea as share price. Just because one stock's share price is $20 and another is $100, that doesn't mean that one stock is better/worse or will perform better/worse than the other. It only represents a ""greater"" ownership in the company. If the value of the company doubles, the $20 will go to $40 and the $100 will go to $200. Assuming you had the same amount of money in both, you will have doubled your money. The number of shares is arbitrary.

When it comes to ETFs, its very much the same deal.  They hold some percentage of a basket of stocks, and then based on percentages and the number of shares of their ETF that they issue, the initial price will be determined. SPY or VOO could essentially do a stock split however they want."
2021-06-21 14:59:52,stocks,"Market Makers (APs - brokers who are ""authorized participants"" to make markets in these products) price the ETF to represent fair value of the underlying constituents. So even a crappy ETF that isnt selling well still rises and falls based on the underlying value."
2021-06-21 18:29:12,stocks,"If I give you 100 dollars, would you prefer five 20 dollar bills, two 50 dollar bills, a hundred 1 dollar bills, or does it not matter..."
2021-06-21 17:46:16,stocks,OneQ did a 10:1 split I think last month or prior month
2021-06-21 15:10:15,stocks,"Only looking at the prices of ETFs that track the same index is essentially meaningless for most purposes, because like you said they track the same thing, which means returns should be equal if they track the same index using the same methods. You shouldn't be thinking of these price differences as if they are worth or cost more/less, think of it more along the lines of the minimum required to invest in a fund because thats all it is. If you only have $60 then you cant invest in the funds that have a minimum higher than that to invest, but if you have $100k then you can use other factors to decide which to invest in.

The price of an ETF is determined mostly by its Net Assets and its number of outstanding shares. Net Assets divided by outstanding shares = NAV, the NAV of a ETF should closely follow the price of the ETF, share price deviations from the NAV are referred to as Premium/discounts. 

The number of shares is also somewhat arbitrary, one ETF could for a simple example have 100 shares, lets call it ETF1, and another ETF, ETF2, could have 10 shares, now if they track the same index, had the same Net assets, and everything else equal, and net assets=X then ETF1 would be worth x/100 per share and ETF2 would be worth x/10 per share. So if no premium/discount exists then ETF2 (x/10) would cost 10x more than ETF1 (x/100) but ETF2 is not really 'worth' more more, because you end up owning the same amount of underlying assets if you put the same amount of money in either. The only difference would be the minimum required to invest in each fund, or in other words the share price.

Now why would someone buy an ETF that shares cost 10x more than another ETF if they are essentially equal? Well there could be a few reasons, volume of shares actively traded/liquidity, the premium/discount could play a role, as well as expense ratio or maybe there are minor difference in the way they manage the fund or track the index, this is just to name a few. But at the end of the day if they are putting in $X amount of dollars it wont matter much which ETF they chose because they end up with the same % of assets per $ either way. Expense ratio and trading volume are what I look for most when deciding between ETFs personally. (Not financial advice)

For your final question, this goes back to NAV, if an ETF's NAV goes up and no one is buying well then the share price will stay the same and the NAV will just continue to go up until people realize the discount that exists on that ETF by comparing its share price to its NAV. The market will eventually correct itself so the share price and NAV are near equal."
2021-06-21 14:18:40,stocks,"Excellent questions, looking forward to reading the replies."
2021-06-21 14:20:09,stocks,"No etfs and funds are priced at the value of their respective components, very little if any discrepancies between them. 

The prices of an etf vs funds vs underlying stocks are not relevant. If they hold same assets then their performance will be same in % terms altho different in absolute terms."
2021-06-21 14:44:17,stocks,"ETF's have the NAV (Net Asset value) value and they have the stock price value.

These are not always the same and that is called a ""discount"" or a ""premium"" to NAV.

For EX when I check the SPY NAV was 415.05 per share while SPY was actually trading at 420.45. You can see the difference between NAV and the underlying at any time

2021-06-21 14:37:40,stocks,"An important factor from one ETF to another with similar holdings, similar to stock, but different from Mutual funds is the demand for the ETF.  AKA - what will the market pay for this ETF?  Since it is traded on the market like stocks, the demand for the ETF can drive the price way up.  The difference from ETF to Mutual funds is that Mutual funds dont do that - so you dont get any demand factors into its price."
2021-06-21 14:07:40,stocks,Good questions
2021-06-21 14:12:10,stocks,I would like to know this as well.
2021-06-21 14:33:31,stocks,"i am assuming it's the total value of the stocks vs. the total amount of stocks of the ETF.

let's say i buy 10 apple stock and then create 100 stock of my ETF. each etf stock value is 1/10 of apple.if i do the same but create 200 stocks of my ETF, each stock owns 1/20th but the price is lower because i have more stocks circulating.

someone more expert than me can confirm?"
2021-06-21 17:11:25,stocks,Think I’m terms of percentages. VOO might $390 per share so a 1% gain would look like a gain of $3.90. If you buy a stock for $10 and it also goes up 1% then you would see it rise by only 10 cents. Both had the same relative (percentage gain).
2021-06-21 14:31:26,stocks,Thanks this makes a lot of sense
2021-06-21 14:29:08,stocks,"That’s what I don’t get. How do you even track the % performance of the underlying basket cus it seems like ETFs are just priced like every other stock in that it’s just however much people are willing to pay for it vs. being pegged to the basket of stocks.

If the Nasdaq is underperforming but enough people want to buy QQQ and have it “go against the grain” then what’s going to stop that?

If by logic QQQ should “go down” cus the Nasdaq is going down but people are like let’s just keep QQQ flat then it could theoretically not track to the Nasdaq

Edit: nvm got my answer from a different reply below. Thanks though!"
2021-06-21 15:04:55,stocks,Just a note so people don't think they are getting such a good deal.  Yahoo is not updating the value of the NAV intraday but you can still see the difference that SPY was 414.92 at close vs 415.05 NAV.  (The real price of SPY was 420.72 when I posted it so you can see the price went up but the NAV hasn't changed)
2021-06-21 14:53:47,stocks,Yes that is what happens.  The other piece of it is the expense ratio.  If the first one has an expense ratio of 1% then at the end of one year instead of 1 ETF share being worth 0.10 shares of apple it is now worth 0.099 shares of apple etc.  Except that the expense ratio is taken out in even smaller chunks a little bit each day.  This is why most ETFs that seem like they are almost 10% of an index like SPY and IVV are always just a little bit lower.
2021-06-21 14:33:38,stocks,"Etfs have to track the basket otherwise there would be arbitrage opportunities between them. 

Any that exist are closed up almost immediately by the market. 

If an etf was illiquid and the basket of stocks wasent then there could an opportunity there but again arbs would be in to close it up. 

Bottomline the only difference in % returns between a fund and an etf and the basket is the fees associated with the etf or the fund."
2021-06-21 15:07:43,stocks,Good call.
2021-06-21 15:36:27,stocks,How do you know your portfolio of 12-15 stocks isn't more risky than the index? How are you quantifying your risk? How do you know you're outperforming on a risk adjusted basis? How do your 12 stocks perform compared to the index under a variety of historical and hypothetical stress scenarios?
2021-06-21 14:29:44,stocks,How about do a real-world test? Would be willing to list your portfolio and compare against s&p 500 or other index based on the concentration after 1 year.
2021-06-21 14:05:43,stocks,"Can you please tell me what stocks you own out of curiosity? Here is why this strategy is exactly why people should stick to index funds, you assume past preformance will equal future returns, now In a super diversified index that is almost always true because there is so much diversification, however when picking individuals stocks assuming that the growth rate of those companies will continue forever is just not true, when picking an individual stock you need to really examine where that growth is coming from and how it will continue in the future. It's not as easy as just picking a company that looks good and just holding because while it's growth may continue for a few years, eventually most companies stall out a simple way to see this is to look at the top companies by market cap just 10 years ago and it will be wildly diffrent from now, and with an index fund since it is so diversified you don't have to worry if a couple companies stall out because you own so many. This is just a simple risk reward calculation, it is a far bigger risk to own a few companies vs 500, if you want to take that risk that's fine but your strategy better not be just buy companies that were good in the past and hold on forever."
2021-06-21 14:04:37,stocks,"I feel you. Even Warren Buffet has said himself that he doesn’t think he’s incredibly smart, he’s just tried to not be stupid.

But index funds are still an excellent pick for someone who doesn’t want to spend the time doing DD"
2021-06-21 14:18:09,stocks,"When I look at the holdings of some ETFs and look at those businesses individually, many haven't grown in years, some have shrunk, you're betting on a few of them growing while most of them remain stagnant.

So I'm with you, there's enough massive businesses about that are relatively safe and are almost guaranteed to grow, you can still invest in something like MSFT and forget about it."
2021-06-21 15:01:27,stocks,4) Don’t overpay.
2021-06-21 15:21:01,stocks,"20 years into this stuff and I concur! Truth is most people are not emotionally able to handle the markets volatility. The path to making more can be dead simple and understood by most. But when their funds drops even just a little they freak out and question their choices. Most people never hold long enough to have that experience of things going south but working out better over time so they have no confidence in whatever method is used to choose stocks.

I’ve explained the math in logical ways to many many people and most end up doing completely different moves (selling out of fear for example) regardless of a millionaire telling them this is how its done."
2021-06-21 14:00:05,stocks,"My take is it is much like cars.  I loved working on cars, so eventually ended up with 6-7 over most of my life, most heavily modified and raced extensively, so I ended up with a remote 40-50 ft garage with a lift and more tools than the average NASCAR mechanic.   My wife otoh wants something that she can get in and turn the key and go.

To me that is the difference between an investor created portfolio and a passive mix of ETFs.   One is not 'better' than the other, it is just different and totally depends on the desires of the investor."
2021-06-21 14:30:08,stocks,"I don’t think you give yourself enough credit. It’s not necessarily about intelligence, other people just aren’t prepared to put in the work and don’t have the temperament for it.

As you say in no.3, you’ve got to be prepared to hold on for dear life - to open up your account, see a 40% loss and think “oh cool, there’s a sale on”. Most people aren’t going to do that - they’re going to see that huge loss, freak out and sell.

I would never advise anyone else to do what I do - because I don’t want to do the work of picking stocks for them and I don’t want them freaking out on me when the first dip comes along. Better they stick to ETFs."

2021-06-21 16:00:59,stocks,"Just curious as a relative newcomer, what sort of things have you been investing in over those 20 years and how have your returns been?"
2021-06-21 14:58:38,stocks,"Yes you are right. I have seen a few of my own friends who used to own some very good stocks, which didn't change fundamentally but still sold them in the covid crash. Basically human emotions and the temperament, as you pointed out, ruins the game. If we are able to keep them at check and follow the sayings of Warren Buffet and more like him, we will come out at top. Again I'm just saying the ""rules"" are quite simple, it is still difficult. However it would be unfair to not even dable in it and not create patience over a long time."

2021-06-21 15:22:22,stocks,Didn't mean to be a challenge to you. I really want know if we can pick good stocks to beat S&P 500. Thank you for indulging.
2021-06-21 14:48:40,stocks,"Again what I'm trying to say is your oversimplying how easy it is to just pick a stock with good future growth prospects, just look at the top companies from 2015 or 2010 and it's completely diffrent from the top companies now, that's because the market and economy changes and so should your investing, this requires you to constantly do DD and sell and buy diffrent companies, the thing that almost always kills this type of investing is that people don't know when to sell, knowing when to buy is far easier than knowing when to sell and knowing when a companies growth prospects start to slow. this isn't an easy prosses at all and to say just pick a company and hold is a good strategy is a gross oversimplification of the work you should be doing to beat the market. Again this is just a risk reward calculation, of course many of us can do the work but it is far more risky and more time consuming."
2021-06-21 19:04:34,stocks,The legend in question said most investors would be better off sticking to index funds. Have you even listened to the guy?
2021-06-21 19:12:25,stocks,"Early 2000s it was big box stores, large commerce, and oil. Mid 2000s most good deals were tech and IT development, late 2000-2010 ecommerce - amzn!, 2010-present a mix of social media, financial tech, growing ecommerce, etc. These were the main themes which I invested in AFTER companies proved themselves profitable and continuing profit growth. Though I’ve always tried to find a diverse group of businesses across multiple sectors. The big winners are obvious - amzn, apple, and the like. And some loosers like cisco and being late on xom. 

Returns overall about 15% if we exclude covid era which skews the return higher and is a bit nuts. That also includes minor margin use and occasional options use but generally just buy and hold."

2021-06-21 19:07:39,stocks,"The reason algorithms (and therefore AI) perform by far the best on the market is that the market only works based on people. While an economy relies on everyone believing in currency, including the entire legal system and every single sector, the value of a stock is literally based on what people sell and buy for. In this very moment, if you get a large enough group, you could push down Amazon to 100$ easily (easily referring to your ability to do so, not how a real scenario plays out). 

This means that no matter what you orient by, in the end it only matters what people do. Just think of all the times negative earnings catapulted the stock up or positive earnings way beyond expectations caused it to tank for 10%. Or Tesla. 

80-90% of BEATING the market is also way too low. On CFD, 70-85% lose a majority their money. This means 30-15% are somewhere in ""made big losses, made small losses, no change, made small profits, made big profits, is rich"", though usually when one side is really strong the entire trend seems to go towards that, meaning you can easily expect 50% of the leftover at minor-big losses.

If you want share me your portfolio and I'll write it down in Excel, using Google finance to track your status and compare it to the SP500 grow. It's easy to beat the market short term, on average it should increase by less than 1% per month. The main issue is making it work over decades to come."
2021-06-21 19:07:43,stocks,"Lol no. You don't know the future OP, your ""strategy"" is extremely shallow and shows you've not even been investing for a few years. Have you even spent 3 years in the market?



Your whole post is flawed due ti *recency bias*. You'll buy expensive stocks at their top valuations and hold them as they bleed/crash/trade sideways. Beating the market means being better/smarter then the pros and, sorry to say, you're not."

Ibm looked great in 2013 and so did exxon and the other oil giants and banks were the hot thing in 2007, the point is to beat the market you need to be on top of the evolving nature of our markets and economy and that is extremely difficult.

2021-06-21 13:45:13,stocks,"While shopify is a good company I have a number of concerns, mainly being how shopifys valuation is justifyed only by insane growth. Shopifys growth has been amazing, but if it cannot keep up that growth which is currently at 100% the stock will suffer significantly. What normally happens before the stall point or when the insane growth starts to slow is the company starts making many aquatitions and asset sales to keep up the growth, I am afried this will happen to shopify, because to justify the valuation, shopify needs insane growth. I wouldn't call this stock bad however you need to make sure shopifys growth is organic and not from M&A and asset sales etc."

I don't love Pharma companies because I'm an idiot when it comes to medical science but I understand their Mino-Lok product has been fast tracked by FDA and all data that has been revealed so far has been positive. Currently, if a central venous catheter is infected, the standard is to remove and replace it. This has a high percentage of complication and sometimes leads to infections that cause death. Mino-Lok can clean the catheter and avoid this pretty common problem. Potential Global TAM of $1.8B. The product could be on the market in 2022. They have a decent amount of cash that should get them to market as long as things continue to go well with FDA. 

The President and CEO is Myron Holubiak who was the President of Roche which is one of the largest pharma companies in the world. The Chairman Leonard Mazur ran Cooper Laboratories which spun off a few successful companies including Cooper Dental which grew into Oral-B. These guys are serious and also have millions of personal dollars invested in Citius.  

After Mino-Lok, they're working on other products which I understand less.

Lord knows they could very well have a great earnings and the share price tanks,  or a flat or bad earnings and maybe share price goes flat or even up.

As for TA, I just don't rely heavily on words like resistance and support, because it sets limits to a range, when there isn't one, it's just the price of a share at a moment in time, and all it takes is one of a multitude of variables to quickly go outside of the set boundaries of resistance or support.

2021-06-21 11:23:34,stocks,"My plan usually goes like this:

Determine a good value price. Determine how much I want to invest.

Buy when price is < X. Initial purchase is usually 30-50% of my target holding. How much I buy on day 1 depends on how the market is moving. I add new shares when/if the new purchase would lower my cost basis.

Stop loss of 15% rolling with gains.

When total gains reach 25%, sell 25-50% if the stock outperformed the index. And judging the moving averages. If a good floor was established with an uptrend, I’ll only sell on the lower percentage.

If stock underperformed index, and is still underperforming, I exit completely.

By sticking to this, you won’t catch any 1000% gains. But it will allow you to take 2 failures for every win and still come out ahead."

2021-06-21 14:22:19,stocks,"Is it ctxr? Nvm: saw another comment. 

What I can say though is that im currently up 190 percent on CTXR which kinda puts me in the same boat as you. I think there are multiple things you can do and all have justifiable reasons.

First one is just cash out and take the profit. Let's be honest a big percentage profit is unreal. If it's enough to screenshot then it's probably time to cash out. However, I did this with my CHEK shares at a ~65 percent profit after buying in at 1.01 beginning of march. 2 weeks later FDA approval for a study came and it went as high as 4.50 intraday. Needless to say I was bummed out.

Second option: sell half the shares or a different portion and let the rest ride. This is probably the only option that let's you nibble the cake and have it too. Obviously you limit your upside but also your downside and profits are profits. 

Last option: don't sell. I'm honestly just going to ride my CTXR shares out since I am going to be long on this company anyway. I'm also waiting on some FDA related news and will definitely sell if there is a spike and buy back later may it drop to lower levels. 

Either way the choice is yours. All depends on risk-tolerance, level of conviction and let's be honest making the right decision also involves a bit of luck sometimes.

Either way gratz on the (potential) gains."
2021-06-21 12:23:17,stocks,"When taking profit.. I started investing in Tesla this hear before they had there peak, was pretty in green, didn't sell because i thinking the trend will continue also because of my initial reason, Tesla is a long long term investment.

I regret cause after, i could easily take my profit buy some more shares with that and still have money left.
2. Example bought GME, had a 80% return, was happy didn't sell because of the possible Squeeze. Could nearly doubled my money. (Before someone complain about selling GME Shares - Screw You)
Same with some other stocks, i decided for example Tesla is a long term play, but it still will be swinging around.
On small caps stocks, i will not risk my position for a quick dollar, they could easily take off, when the reasons are there.

Next time i hope will act different, take your money, wait for the dip, buy."

2021-06-21 16:53:28,stocks,"It is generally a good idea to sell some as the stock rises. Ideally your goal is to have taken your initial investment out and be holding some shares you can ride for free. How you get there is up to you but as anyone will tell you gains are gains and 70% is a very good win. I try to get doubles and sell half but to do that you need to understand the chances of your specific investment getting to that level (I invest mostly with pennystocks so getting doubles isn't realistic on most stocks so keep that in mind.). You can also look at just setting a stop loss or a floating stop on your investment so if it starts to pull back fast it will automatically sell for you. In this case you might miss the next leg up if it decides to keep going but it will also limit your risk in loosing it all. One big warning though. If your stock trades a lot pre/after market, it can blow past your stop and not sell so you will still need to check it in case it goes past. Good luck."

I also was holding some rocket since last december and sold 60 percent of my shares when it spiked to 40+ at 40.50 per share. This turned out to be a great decision.

Distributed ledgers are by definition resource intensive to maintain and slower.  Perhaps #2 gets address with some new coin but i don’t see how #1 ever changes

Given that, the use case remaining is “store of value” aka “digital gold”.  Currently the lead coin is of course bit coin.  Will it replace gold? Maybe. But this is a big maybe.

Both are completely valid ways to conduct yourself in the market, they just require different skills and risk tolerance levels. 

If you are trading the stock, then setting some stop losses could make sense to hedge against the market further moving against you!

If you are a value investor and think that the (higher) price you bought at last week still doesn’t reflect the long term value of the stock, then this could actually be a good opportunity to dollar cost average and bring your cost basis down!


If you’re chasing the price in the short term, this could represent a decrease in value for the trade;

So I will switch gears a bit and explain my thoughts on coinbase + the questions I used to make my decisions, rather than tell you what you should do. 

I think it’s important to remember that (based on their business model) $coin has a revenue case when crypto is crashing as well as rising-

Because they profit per transaction, not per profitable trade so panic selling can actually work in their favor, generative short term revenue. 
Plus the same emotional investors who panic sell are likely to fomo back in during a bull run, so they aren’t going to loose much in long term customer base. 

Additionally, long term investors who are interested in (for example) buying Ethereum and then staking it, and might view this as a time to do that on discount;
Given that COIN profits from long term Hodlers doubling down and from traders cashing out, Coinbase is within my personal tolerance as a mid to long term play. 

This will be COIN’s first earning report during a prolonged period of negative price movements, so investors haven’t necessarily seen proof that negative price action in cryptos can be profitable for them. 
I personally think that this isn’t priced in, and that the price going down reflects people thinking of investing in COIN as a way to invest indirectly in cryptocurrency as whole. 

What is your personal risk tolerance for this?
How in the red are you willing to be, and for how long?
Do you think there is a value you see that isn’t reflected in the current price? 
How confident in that value proposition are you?

Then it’s just a personal balancing act between your risk tolerance and confidence levels.

2021-06-21 00:00:00,stocks,"DD for Kinross Gold Corp - $KGC **Basics**

Kinross Gold Corp is a gold and silver mining and milling company based out of Canada. They have 8 active mines around the world, split into the divisions of Americas (58%), Russia (22%), and West Africa (20%). Overall, their 2021 gold production guidance is 2.4mil Au eq. oz.

**Bull Case**

* It currently trades at a discount. The P/E is 6.58, which is lower than most competitors. P/S and P/B ratios also indicate a discount.
* Plans to increase mining production by 20% from 2021 to 2022. Immediate increase comes from production increases at existing facilities. This could either offset a decrease in gold price, or it could be a win-win if the price of gold stays the same or increases.
* The company has been paying down large portions of its debt, indicating financial strength.
* The company restarted dividend payments in 2020.
* Analysts price targets are bullish. I see average targets of around $10.50.

**Bear Case**

* PEG is projected to be negative.
* Production increases for 2021 were expected to come from greater output from the Tasiast mine. See the ""Recent News"" section below for why this may not happen.
* Geopolitical risk. This case always seems like a catch-all, but instability in territory around the Russian and Mauritanian mines seems to represent risk in the portfolio.

**Recent News**

* There was a fire at the Tasiast mine on 6/15. Share price dropped significantly over the subsequent days.

**Analysis**

I am bullish on this stock mostly for the valuation metrics. With attractive P/E, P/S, and P/B ratios, this stock trades at a discount compared to competitors. Despite a negative PEG, I would anticipate positive earnings growth in the future for two reasons: expanded mining capacity and a price increase in gold. Whether or not one believes that recent trends are transient or persistent, I would imagine that any hint of short or long term inflation would create a reactionary environment where the price of gold would be pushed up, thus improving the revenue of the company.

The dividend payment was not a focus of my purchase, but it is a nice added bonus which I think reflects positively on the company's financials.

Additionally, I see little room for downsides. The company paying off debt is a good sign to me, which reflects an increasingly stable future. While I understand the geopolitical risk argument, it seems that the mines in those areas have ran without major political disturbances for their duration.

Unfortunately as I wrote this draft and bought my shares, the incident in the ""Recent News"" section happened. The price is currently sub-$6.50, which is an even better entry point then I was able to obtain. At the end of the day, I don't think that the Tasiast fire will indicate a long-term bust on operations, assuming only minor damages. If the damage is serious, then business interruption insurance could offset the hit.

Overall, I am predicting a price target of $11, in-line with DCF formulas and analyst's consensuses.

2021-06-21 10:23:22,stocks,"We got a small glimpse of how the market feels about gold as an inflation hedge. Personally, I can’t get on board with some of your bull cases.

>The P/E is 6.58, which is lower than most competitors.

For one, this isn’t a growth stock. PE should be low. Most people invest in miners as a hedge, to de-risk their portfolio. KGC is much more risky than competitors because their largest mine is located in Russia. That has likely detracted investors so they aren’t putting a premium on KGC over competitors.

>Plans to increase mining production by 20% from 2021 to 2022… This could either offset a decrease in gold price

Disagree heavily. This is the same thing Oil & Gas E&P companies face all the time. They get in this vicious cycle of having to ramp up production to offset falling commodity pricing. Any new production capacity is met with new capital expenditure thus making that new production initially cost more than existing production. Lower prices makes this worse. That’s why in the Oil sector, rig counts fall as prices fall.

>…restart dividend payments in 2020

Little bit suspicious. There was a money flow to dividend stocks and the thought that if the Fed didn’t raise rates, this was where you park your money for low risk low return. Last week saw a lot of that money leave. 

>analysts

Are generally useless. Hasn’t been any upgrades/downgrades since Jan. And there were 14 buy recommendations in May that fell to 8 in June.

The biggest thing for me is that KGC has underperformed the S&P 500 for over 5 years consecutively with the exception of the gold spike in 2020. 

TL;DR Highest risk of all competitors. Has consistently underperformed S&P 500 for years. Gold spike will help the stock but you’re better off being directly exposed to gold instead. Market is showing they are not retreating to gold through the current inflation fears."
2021-06-21 11:10:37,stocks,"Thank you for your response.

>For one, this isn’t a growth stock. PE should be low.

I agree. I don't see this as a growth stock - I see it as a value stock. By definition, the P/E will be low, and based on my analysis, I find that it is lower than what KGC's financials warrant.

>KGC is much more risky than competitors because their largest mine is located in Russia.

As of 2020, I don't think that this is the case. I believe that their largest mine by production is in Brazil. Regardless, the research that I've done shows little in the way of disruption in the Russian mine operations.

>Any new production capacity is met with new capital expenditure thus making that new production initially cost more than existing production.

Also, I agree with this sentiment. However, I find that the primary driver of increased production capacity for KGC will be increased production at existing mines. This will incur capex, but at a lesser rate compared to greenfield exploration."
2021-06-21 00:00:00,stocks,"Looking into copper and gold stocks that have potential Recently I’ve been looking onto some players in the gold and copper mining industry with promising projects. So far I’ve been focusing on two: Newmont Corporation and Solaris Resources. Both look pretty full valued too so it’s very encouraging.

&#x200B;

**($SLSSF) SOLARIS RESOURCES INC**

With Solaris Resources Inc (SLSSF), they mine both gold and copper which are really great assets to spend on. They recently started their project[ in Warintza](https://www.solarisresources.com/projects/warintza/) which is their first project acquired in 2020 where they hold 100% interest, but they are already starting to explore other regions specifically in Chile. It has been experiencing exponential growth when it comes to its value and continues to advance its portfolio in the Americas.

**($NEM) NEWMONT CORPORATION**

Newmont has the largest gold reserve, but their latest development would be their [acquisition of GT Gold](https://www.kitco.com/news/2021-05-17/Newmont-completes-GT-Gold-acquisition-expands-holding-in-Golden-Triangle.html). The latter has been exploring British Columbia’s Golden Triangle, and is focused on mining base precious metals. Now the location of their exploration is great, knowing how geologically fertile that terrain is. With the acquisition, Newmont also acquired the Tattoga project.

Regulus Resources is also an interesting choice, but they still have a lot of room to grow. But right now, for me it’s Solaris and Newmont that is getting my attention right now. I’m planning to invest, especially in Solaris, but a lot of peers have been telling me i’m a little too late."

2021-06-21 00:00:00,stocks,"Morning Update for Monday, 06/21/21 Good morning everyone, I hope you had a nice weekend.

*This list is geared towards day trading. With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account.

**Main Watchlist:**

Gapping UP:

* BHP: Showed weakness on Thursday and Friday, I'll be watching for opportunities to the upside if it shows more strength.
* CVAC: Provided good trading opportunities towards the end of last week, and worth keeping an eye on today as well. Potential resistance level at 70.
* ZIP: Gapping up over SMA(9). Possible trend reversal on the daily chart, worth keeping an eye on.
* AVXL: Daily chart indicating a possible breakout, but I'll want to see what things look like after open.

Gapping DOWN:

* MSTR: I'll be watching what things look like closer to open, but it'll be worth following closely. Will likely test support area around 600 this morning.  
* CPNG: Gapping down below relevant SMA's. Could see more downwards movement, particularly if it can't get back and hold above 38.75.
* TLRY: Broke down below SMA(50) on Friday, and gapping down below that level today. Could see more downwards movement, especially if it can't get back over 17.15.

**Market Outlook:**

After a few choppy trading sessions to end the past week, stocks are looking to open a bit higher this morning. SPY is trading just over 416. Things are still looking bearish for the immediate future, unless SPY can get back above and hold over the SMA(50) around 417.33. DIA is trading a bit over 334. It could see a rebound today, or it could still retrace down to the 331 area around the SMA(100). Tech stocks are somewhat mixed this morning, QQQ currently trading a bit under 343. It will be interesting to see if we see a pullback today, or a further push to new ATH. Gold, silver, and crude oil are all up a bit at the moment. EV stocks are mixed in premarket trading. Meme stocks are seeing a bit of strength this morning, and will be worth following closely this week. 

Remember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses). Happy trading everyone :)"
2021-06-21 00:00:00,stocks,"Noticing my same pattern, good advice? So I’ve been trading very actively these past couple years I can’t help but notice my same cycle. I end up researching and buying stock, get on a small bull run, then hold it so long that it drops back down and I end up only selling for a small gain. Then then in the following weeks another major bull run happens. 

With the recent drop this week I’m down about 5% on my etfs. But taking all emotions out I know they will recover. I’m trying to avoid repeating the same mistake and selling now once they recover for either no profit or a small one. Hopefully this time I’m able to break the cycle!"

For things you're holding, that's not a big deal. If you're trading, you need to think about sell rules that will work for you.

Personally, I'm not bothered by huge runs that happen after I lock in my target short-term gain.  If it's a volatile stock, I keep it on a watch list and buy back in later."

2021-06-21 13:08:37,stocks,Now I’ve switch to long term holding (at least a year) in hopes of about a 5%-10% gain. I’ve taken advice and researched what I feel are the best etfs but I did end up buying at peak in May because I didn’t want to try and time the market.

Other than the symmetrical triangle chart breakout a couple of weeks back, this is the only news I could dig up. According to the chart breakout, the expected target is $1700-1725, which is still a 16% upside from Friday's close. What are your thoughts?

Here's the news and the link...

E-commerce platform Shopify [announced](https://news.shopify.com/shop-pay-becomes-first-shopify-product-to-extend-beyond-shopify-merchants-soon-available-to-any-business-selling-on-facebook-and-google) this morning its one-click checkout service known as Shop Pay will become available to any U.S. merchant that sells on Facebook or Google — even if they don’t use Shopify’s software to power their online stores. That makes Shop Pay the first Shopify product offered to non-Shopify merchants, the company notes.

The earnings report could be in for a big surprise since this is the first quarter where we will see the full impact of the Apple privacy changes. We will have to see, but I would definitely hold off from buying at ATH's."

2021-06-21 10:02:52,stocks,"I’m pretty certain at this point that the “market” aka Wall Street is intentionally throwing these temper tantrums every time the yields go up by 0.1% (still all time lows). They’re intentionally throwing these temper tantrums every time JPow talks about raising interest rates, from 0 to still basically close to 0. They know that the public is dumb and they’re gonna blame the government for the market tanking, so they abuse that shit to pressure the fed to continue to lend them free money. 

And they intentionally throw these temper tantrums about inflation (let’s be real, going from 2% to 3% or even 4% isn’t really all that much in the grand scheme of things), but we all know that if inflation is high the best place to put your money is in the stock market.

This is what I'd like to see continue. Either way, growth/tech in my portfolio is working its way back to Feb levels or at least stopped bleeding."
2021-06-21 17:09:18,stocks,"Tech is at a better valuation and grows faster than the value traps right now lmfao and the last half of the year starting in July always belongs to the Nasdaq. Not trying to be mean but I don’t think SQQQ is going to print for you. Rate hikes or not, big tech is still gunna outperform BS like commodities, banks, and industrials. I’ll definitely take the faster growing big tech with the better valuations. Value dominated the first half of the year, that’s finished now"

2021-06-21 12:56:32,stocks,I don't think it will. I think both merged SPAC's happened in Feb. There was a ton of SPAC momentum at one point and almost all of growth stocks had ATH's in Feb.

I love my meme stocks, knowing you have an army of apes behind you as you ride the elevator up is a great feeling but we're about to watch a lot of young traders get burnt. I've seen the Matt Kohrs youtube channel where there was too much 'fud' in the chat so he set it to members only.

If we can only talk about the bull sentiment and never the potential downsides and real risks involved with buying into meme stocks then it's presenting the idea that there is no downside since all the media is positive."

2021-06-21 14:14:17,stocks,Growth is still growing. All my growth tech stocks are doing fine right now (thank god). Esp after they were battered down to nothing the last 4 months.
2021-06-21 13:34:48,stocks,"We did for a while, as we saw CPI data and were happy with it.

That was before FED scare which turned out to be FED greenligh to rotate into growth, another FED scare that wasn't even from the FED and now tommorow another FED scare.

Honestly creates all around huge mess. On top of that i honestly don't think USA stock market gives any damn about Europe or Asia, just because one thing happens and another thing happens doesn't mean they are initially linked, but some rare times its suddenly linked to Europe and Asia, its not, we had our own clusterfuck which it all can be linked to.

Growth will be fine, buy the dip if there is one and go to sleep for few years."

TGT has to be the safest stock to own in the world, as usual I do stupid things. That said, sometimes I sell and watch the stock later (like CAT or DE) and see that selling when it closed below the 50 MA on any volume increase was the right move, so far at least."

2021-06-21 09:24:03,stocks,What does it mean
2021-06-21 18:03:35,stocks,"Maybe... However, it's highly possible before a 10-20% correction it has already gone up at least that much and if you sit out now you will have to not only wait for the correction but also put all of your money in precisely at the bottom. GOOD LUCK."

2021-06-21 18:40:49,stocks,"There's nothing wrong with taking profit, but if you're thinking long term it's important to try to tune out the noise.  You can find ""financial news articles"" that will tell you whatever you want to hear.  A correction will happen at some point, so just be ready with cash when it does.  I'm 90% invested in ETFs and Apple so personally I'll be pretty happy to add to my positions if and when things dip."
2021-06-21 19:30:45,stocks,"Every market crash is unique in its own way. Just because situation is similar, it does not mean tomorrow's crash is gonna replicate the one that happened 10 or 8 or 50 years ago. With that said, nobody is able to predict precisely when the next correction or crash is. If those economists are able to predict precisely when market corrects, all of them make good money and retire already. Truth is, they are STILL out there making SHITTY articles everyday telling you market crashes tomorrow.

Think about it this way, market is presentation of such a huge # of collective decisions of so many groups and individuals, up and downs are imminent yet unpredictable. Ask yourself what the goal is for investing. Let me tell you. I sold good trunk of my portfolio in October 2020 and March 2021 when there were huge corrections and I regretted them. If you are holding a good and bright company and they are able to continue to grow and be profitable, hold them. Market goes up and goes down. Relax, walk away from your trading app and your gonna be alright"

They're also expanding into markets other than video games at a pretty high rate.  The number of customers spending 100k+ has shot up majorly in the last 2 years as well.  Super strong balance sheet to boot.

That's a lot of the bull case I put together before buying them.  There is a very real bear case too, they could get pummelled if they start to lose market share or if the monetization of casual gaming slows."

2021-06-21 13:49:11,stocks,"I’ll even do you a solid and explain why they want the shares cheap. They have multiple foundries that will be completed soon each of which will multiply their output and revenues. And every foundry has a growth rate of 25-30% a year so they are compounding that rate of growth and are basically about to get instant multipliers to sweeten the deal. So you will see the stock double for every foundry and continue those growth rates for basically as long as tech keeps staying relevant and requires chips, which is everything, so basically forever?"

Already have one dedicated to just ETFs. Willing to take the short term hit if a heavy dip comes because I think in the long run this thing will keep growing and I'm gonna average in so that if it does indeed dip I'll keep buying.

2021-06-21 10:45:59,stocks,"I dont understand this sentiment that selling on red days is bad. Seems silly, way to focus on what doesn’t matter. What makes the “day” timeframe special? What about a green/red hour, or minute? Is it ok if I sell on a red day but a green minute?

One may sell on a red day because he thinks upward momentum is lost. And waiting for a Green Day, when you already plan to sell soon, may mean riding the damn thing all the way into the ground in the hope of a tiny extra gain.

Kinda like the mentality to Buy the Dip when a stock is down 1% after a 20% run up. Focusing way too much on the short term.

I did buy the dip on BP today, increasing my existing position, but that was after a 5% drop in 2 days that I suspect was a knee jerk reaction to the market."

This right here is the part I didnt realize. 

I picked up BAC and BK at huge discounts last year, but sold them on Friday like a dummy. I was planning to hold them long term but thought I could just repurchase them in a couple days or weeks at a better price.

2021-06-21 13:58:25,stocks,">we havent had inflation this bad since 15 yrs ago

Sounds like ripped from some news headline. That is to be expected with reopening, we concluded that its transitionary and will go away, not here to stay, that is why CPI data was happy news for growth holders.

Inflation is not even end of the world to begin with, heck even more if its going to die down.

Short term could do just about fuckall, this short term made me increase my positions, sell for nasty gains and overall swim in money, but long term growth is going to be fine.

Following like day traders every sensational thing is just going to lead to a lot of pain for many people.

Big picture was quite clear a while ago, all the FED is doing now is swinging stock market like a drunk monkey.

If someone really is scared for growth, get FAANG(minus Netflix, plus Nvidia) and such, people acting like inflation is actually killing these stocks because ''everyone needs water and bread, the value things'' and actually forget that we used to laugh about new generations not being able to live without internet, Iphones, computers etc. these things are our water and bread as well.

It rose in value quite a lot in comparison to their peers because of what ? Stock split that doesn't change the business ?

My speculation is that i sure don't know where the top of this adventure is, i think its going to have some decent pullback and then stagnate and normally grow forever."

Almost the same as holding 100 shares for a fraction of the price. Look up a video of someone showing you the math and the relationship between your intrinsic and extrinsic value.

2021-06-21 07:53:58,stocks,"Choosing stocks on your own is already a high risk. Realizing profits early on is generally a good move. Most people work in percentages, that's also how I got introduced into stocks and how I still do it. So my max 2% investment of my capital into a stock 6 years ago would have been 52€ (would have because I started with options), today it's 3340€. This is of course circumstantial and depends a lot on many things, but whenever I go beyond the 2% for whatever reason, I make sure to realize a part of the profits, like 50%, the moment it hits my initial goal. After that I let it sit and either sell another 25% soon after (like a day or 2, again really depends on the stock and why I got in) or the rest. 

The main lesson I learned is to never sit around too long. If you feel uncomfortable, start selling or sell all. The moment you start having feelings means it might or already has turned emotional, which is a huge trap."

Create a trading block size (you're already doing that).

Hold for a year and you get an 8.1% bump in profit due to change to long term tax...

2021-06-21 00:00:00,stocks,"Bill C-218 Update: Reading Started with One Amendment Vote and a Final Vote to Pass; Then it Rains Gold for Gambling Stocks (ex. SCR) Hey folks!

Here we are.  One week left to get this done.

The good news is that C-218 was picked up in Thursday's session, and the most threatening amendment proposal, related to game fixing, was voted down with a majority.  The bill is now in mid-completion in the Senate, which means that one, they will likely get to it and two, they will not need as much time to go through it when it hits the floor again.  Also good news is that they have added an additional day tomorrow (Monday) to debate, and there seems to be a light agenda.  This sets the stage for final approval of C-218 by the end of the week.

The not-so-good news is that there is an amendment still in front of us at this point.  The Kahanawake are NOT happy that they will be losing their monopoly in Canada, and have been putting up a fight through the process.  (URL: [https://twitter.com/MCKahnawake/status/1405990929828388866](https://twitter.com/MCKahnawake/status/1405990929828388866))  The good news is that they have not been getting much support at all in relation to their cause, but it hasn't stopped a suggestion of an amendment in their favour.  The amendment was tabled in last week's session, but it was not debated.  Most coverage of this and social feedback has been negative, acknowledging the request but positioning it as an attempt to delay, block, or kill the bill through the cover of ""making it fair"".  No comment on the legitimacy of this claim, but the amendment request is likely to fail.  

As for the bill?  The first amendment was voted down with a majority, so it does signal overall support, but I can't say for sure that it's a done deal.  However, as a signal, the House of Commons voted for the bill with around a 90% majority.

As for price action, there was definitely a run-up on Thursday in anticipation of the success of the measure, then a sell-off on Friday when it didn't pass.  The run-up may occur again, albeit with more instability due to the final hour nature of the bill.  Overall, it is expected that the price of SCR and related stocks will rise as the market opens up over time, hopefully by the Fall.  A good time to participate, nonetheless.  Good luck out there!"

I suppose it depends on how good the public education system is in the area and also how popular said elective is since obviously you don't want to fund an elective people aren't signing up for. I imagine financial classes are generally popular though.
2021-06-21 06:44:53,stocks,"First, let’s make something clear: public school isn’t nearly as much about giving individual students the tools to be successful in their lives as they are about making useful and productive members of society. That is how you get the buy-in required to fund the program by all taxpayers, not just the ones with kids.

With that said, it has become painfully clear that financial literacy is a crucial skill for members of our society. A massive number of schools have offered some sort of personal finance class for a long time, but we’re starting to see a rise in places where it is mandatory. I just saw a headline where it became a statewide rule somewhere in the northeast. I expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future."
2021-06-21 16:12:48,stocks,"I'm a teacher, there are multiple reasons for this

1) many students won't care or listen. Everyone asks why we don't teach taxes and have never tried to teach taxes to a bunch of grade 10-12s. The majority don't care. Their comprehension of money at this stage is also low. It takes having a job or paying your own bills for most people to understand the significance of money.

2) It's based on math and really complicated. I would say only upper-level high school students would begin to understand it. They also come from a predisposition where they are told the market is unsafe. There comes issues when parents think the market is gambling. You may also be on the hook if your students start investing when they are clearly not ready.

3) We already do. Many teachers have beginner lessons for the stock market baked into their math units. (compound interest, financial literacy etc)

4) What qualifies someone to teach finances? I know that most teachers wouldn't be considered ""financial advisors"" so this topic is a bit difficult to teach freely."
2021-06-21 16:22:35,stocks,Because you need someone who understands it to teach the class.
2021-06-21 08:21:29,stocks,I believe the class is called‘Economics’
2021-06-21 03:07:21,stocks,"lol this thread becoming so cringe, holy shit. Yea blame the system, it’s never your own responsibility. AP economics was offered in high school. You can take business electives in college. You have google on your phone to look up anything. You can read about every option strategy on investopedia. The resources are endless. Your 5/6 digit stock account is not a “threat” to the rich, nor are you a couple trades from becoming rich bc you were exposed to stocks. Actual rich people didn’t make their money by yoloing into meme stocks either."
2021-06-21 00:33:50,stocks,"Because you’re not supposed to make money, you’re supposed to become a good employee"
2021-06-21 06:47:40,stocks,Maybe the parents shouldn't rely on the schools to teach everything. So much education can come from home life but too many parents leave them sheltered from it.
2021-06-21 13:41:17,stocks,"My teacher said “stonks only go up” and “buy the dip, f*****”"
2021-06-21 19:18:54,stocks,It’s because the government wants you to be poor
2021-06-21 19:19:27,stocks,"Because then you would know their game. Educate yourself by yourself and beat them at it. 

The government needs bodies to work off our national debt and keep the machine running. Not people who create jobs and avoid paying taxes.

2021-06-21 10:19:34,stocks,We don't pay teachers well enough in this country for them to actually put money into the stock market.
2021-06-21 04:07:43,stocks,I wouldn’t say JROTC or French are nonsense or useless.
2021-06-21 02:10:41,stocks,"I remember in middle school my teacher taught us about he stock market, looking up companies, and following them weekly to see how they did and what caused them to go up or down.  Currently at the High School that I work at the students have an elective class (economics) and are also taught about the stock market.  Maybe it just depends on each school.  I do have to say when I was in high school I didn't have classes on the stock market, but I wish it did."
2021-06-21 02:17:43,stocks,I went to a public school in 2015 and we did paper stock. And whoever made the most money didn't have to take the finals. But we couldn't buy gas company and other stocks i forgot but i didn't really get deep into stock until 2020 pandemic
2021-06-21 02:30:54,stocks,"Mine did, granted, it was my senior year when they introduced it, it was called Consumer Ed and it was mandatory. It went over basic stuff like what a credit score was, bankruptcy and how to manage your finances, the difference between APY and APR, how to file your taxes (we had a test that made us full out an entire 1040), and it did at least talk about stocks and the importance of long term investing. It wasn’t very in depth, but it was more helpful than a lot of the other shit I had to study while I was there. I do think that all schools should have some form of this in their curriculums because a lot of people end up learning basic money principles way too late and have either already missed a lot of time in the markets or are in financial trouble due to debt or poor understanding of credit scores. It wasn’t the reason but it was a big reason why I started investing at 18."
2021-06-21 03:00:57,stocks,I had a business math class and we learned about stocks in high school. It’s rare but some schools teach it. It was either boring math classes or this so I decided to chose business math.
2021-06-21 03:28:02,stocks,My school had it. It was dual credit AP ECONOMICS.

2021-06-21 07:14:24,stocks,"Economics is a required class in my state, but we never learned about stock. My school offered a finance class, but I didn’t even know what the word finance meant when I was in high school, let alone know the importance of it, so obviously I didn’t take the class."
2021-06-21 08:26:19,stocks,Must depend on the school you go to. I was in economics honors.
2021-06-21 09:14:24,stocks,"We didn't either growing up. My french teacher in middle school had us pick a stock from the paper and track ot over the course of the semester. Looking back, he was really trying to teach us a lot more for life ahead than basic french."
2021-06-21 09:30:45,stocks,"Because of the risk and gambling nature of the stock market. It’s not hard to understand why public schools wouldn’t incorporate stock trading/market in their curriculum. They do teach economics and discuss the general purpose of the market. You can dislike the answer but regardless of DD, there is an element of gambling. One can practice poker and get very good at it too, still gambling in the end."
2021-06-21 09:38:15,stocks,"If you teach kids the basic skills of learning in school they can teach themselves anything they want to know about the stock market on their own. I don't see understanding the market as an essential skill for any high school kid. Sure, it would be nice to know but so would a million other things, like French for example."
2021-06-21 09:40:22,stocks,School is supposed to teach you how to think and learn. They don't need to teach you every single thing. They give you a basic framework with idea that now you're an educated individual you can source information on your own.
2021-06-21 10:19:29,stocks,Italian here. I would be happy even if we just had some financial education class. Economy in high school is basically a taboo in Italy

2021-06-21 12:59:26,stocks,"My graduating class had 117 kids. There was an economics class that was offered your senior year but it was taught by one of the coaches so we actually didn’t learn anything and it was a blow off class. There was no homework and we only did a work sheet if there was a sub that day. 
My school removed all foreign language except Spanish. They removed art from the curriculum when I was in the 4th grade and never brought it back. There were no classes other than the basics and choir.

It’s amazing that I’m even a bit intelligent and understand how the real world works. All I knew about Wall St was about the housing recession that fucked up my family until recently when I’ve gotten my own money. My parents are working class with no formal education so they wouldn’t have been able to teach me either. Dad comes from farming and my mom is a preachers daughter from Kansas. My school literally pumped and molded good employees for the refinery in town."
2021-06-21 13:49:16,stocks,"We did a 8 month stock market simulation as part of our AP Economics class in high school.

No penny stocks, pink sheets or leveraged ETFs were allowed.

I won by putting it all on shale plays and horizontal drilling companies like Apache and Chesapeake lol. This was during the Bush/Cheney years.

We did a similar stock market picking game in 6th grade, and I won that one too by picking a bunch of stupid dot-com and telecom equipment stocks. For that, JDSU will always have a spot in my memories :D

I've never lost a stock picking game hahaha"

2021-06-21 16:03:55,stocks,"I took a bunch of business classes in high school. Economics, marketing, etc. they were all electives though, so you’d only be in the class if you chose it. 

One of the teachers i had for multiple different classes was horrible though, so I skipped a ton of those classes, including the ones where we did a stock market thing on some website.

The classes are there in a lot of schools, it’s just a matter of choosing to take them which a lot of people don’t"
2021-06-21 16:05:09,stocks,"My senior year of high school (2013-2014) my school added a short 20 minute or so morning homeroom class, to wake up, go over important school/grade-year info, and teach topics in a simple and quick form. So that class taught us basic saving and retirement strategies. So that class helped me with putting money into my 401k. Then my history class was half economics, so we learned stuff like how savings account work with crazy 15% interest. I didn't save much for the purpose of building that money in my first few years of adulthood, because my 0.01% interest meant absolutely nothing. I knew a bit about stocks from my boss who was sort of a family friend during the ages of 14 to 22, but was intimidated by them. Only recently joined the stock market in 2020 october"

2021-06-21 19:36:16,stocks,"In Ontario there is a grade 11 economics course, been around since before 2004, but few take it. 

I tried to get my grade 10 math students to play in an investopedia stock simulation, they could care less and only traded when I made them.

For 15 years I’ve been teaching annuities, mortgages, compound interest, depreciation in grade 11 math, still get asked “when will I ever use this in my real life?”

Sad fact is you in high school just didn’t care. Mortgages and annuities have been in the curriculum, and taught, since well into the nineties or earlier, most of us were bored, put in the minimum effort and forgot after the quiz.

You ask yourself why? Because all kinds of adults around them, including my current principal, say openly and almost proudly, “I am just not a math person.”"

2021-06-21 10:22:27,stocks,"These endless, ‘‘Why don’t schools teach *x*?’’ posts on Reddit are exhausting.

1. Your school is not every school. It would be impossible for someone to graduate in many educational systems without learning about compound interest. Don’t generalise your one experience to the universe of secondary education globally or even in your own country.

2. How well would most students have learned, if it *had* been taught? Differently phrased, you were taught a foreign language — one with a deep literature — and clearly gained no appreciation for the privilege. Why would this be any different for many students?

3. The purpose of a secondary education is not to cover every aspect of life, but to provide the fundamental tools that enable you to pursue those independently. You are learning to learn, as you clearly are given your participation here.

If your education gave you the tools to read and do maths, congratulations, you have everything you need to learn about the stock market yourself."

TAG programs nation wide would trade on the simulator all year and compete. For me this started in the mid 90’s so they weren’t online yet but somehow it kept up with the active market. We used those brand new to us but now ancient transparent colored IMac’s.

Luckily I learned this shit now as im 24 but investing everything or at least the majority of my money for those 6 extra years wouldve done wonders. I dont think its taught so that everyone has to “ go to college, work, save your money while it depreciates in value yearly, retire when you’re 65”. meanwhile the rich invest and get richer.

We had to buy shares in 10 different companies. We could do whatever we wanted with them. Buy Sell Hold. I held mine but was down about 100 buy the end of the quarter. Most of my money was in a now extinct company called Digital Equipment Corp or DEC. My dad worked for them and after the big crash of ‘87, they never recovered."
2021-06-21 09:21:23,stocks,"Mine did as well. Economics covered stocks for beginners. We even created virtual portfolios and had a competition for who could return the best yields. Obviously ya boi buying up all the Berkshire pretend shares in 07' caused the parabolic rise and crash of 08'-09'.

Sorry for tanking the markets, but I did win the competition."
2021-06-21 09:23:18,stocks,"We covered this in high school, as well as shop ownership (with an actual storefront which the students managed and staffed), restaurant management and cooking, accounting, marketing, and generic business management.

2021-06-21 09:23:47,stocks,I studied the stock market at several times in my life in school in the 80s and 90s.  We bought and sold stocks and had a contest in classes when I was in 7th and 11th grade.  I guess it depends on what school you attend.  Mine was a demi rural school in a poor state.
2021-06-21 09:28:57,stocks,"High school in general neglects useful subjects, like home maintenance, personal finance, car repair, etc.

It ran off the live numbers of the stock market but it was obviously fake. I remember not knowing much about stocks or investing or anything and ended up just buying stock in BP, some airlines, and some various other groups. I remember I was doing well, and was actually in the top 100 across the US (they had us ranked ha ) Annndddd then the oil spill in the gulf happened and just like that I was in the bottom 100 ! 😂"
2021-06-21 09:33:05,stocks,"Hi

My Economics / Government teacher taught us about it, as well as by ESOL teacher who loved to follow the market regularly.  I was too young to pay too much attention.

In short, the curriculum is created to make you a well rounded member of society, so we all need a little bit of everything.  I think instead of blaming the system for all our issues or shortcomings we each should understand that the information has been out there all along.  We can choose what to do with our lives, our time, our future.  Choose wisely.

Honestly I don't think the vast majority of kids at that age have any interest in stocks so trying to teach them the importance and advantages of investing that young probably goes to waste. Props to you if you would've but unfortunately I don't think many would do the same"
2021-06-21 09:46:01,stocks,"My middle school had a class on the stock market. We'd trade paper stocks using live numbers, starting at $100,000, and whoever had the most money in the end ""won"" the competition.

Education in economics, personal finance etc. it would benefit everyone to have that knowledge before leaving school."
2021-06-21 09:53:36,stocks,We had stock picking tourneys where the best portfolio after the semester ended won a prize. This started when we were pretty young and had no idea what was going on and continued into high school when we still had no idea what was going on.
2021-06-21 09:56:24,stocks,"Must depend on the school because I did. However, it was rolled into another class so was not 100% stock market. We did pretend trading of stocks, which I won when I went all in on Iomega and it went on a ridiculous run"

Don’t remember any instructions on how to do DD, how to read metrics and analytical data, and don’t believe we really went into index funds, or etfs. I get it was supposed to be an introduction, but for a half year course I was hoping to walk away with some understanding of how to invest especially consider the teacher worked on the stock exchange for multiple years. Ended up learning more in the last year than any schooling taught me."
2021-06-21 10:15:34,stocks,We did but I don't think the teacher taught us anything. We should picked random stocks with nothing to go off of. I was second to the last I think lol. And the winner put everything in Google and the released their first phone that year
2021-06-21 10:25:18,stocks,Anyone who understands the stock market well enough to teach it well would be missing out on a lot of money being a teacher.

These opportunities are available in bounds. If not classes at school, extra curricular clubs, discussions and salons on your local coffee shop, seminars at the community center or library, free library books, THE INTERNET and all of its glory, mentors, and your parents are all great sources for this information. You need the ambition to go seek it out. This is available in your every day, public school classroom but none of y’all took advantage of it. It’s entirely your fault."

2021-06-21 11:21:25,stocks,"I went to a large public high school in TN over a decade ago now, and we had one basic economics class that wasn’t required and was only a one-semester elective. I don’t remember going over the stock market at all in the class. Mainly we were thought how to budget, how to balance a checkbook, and then watched movies. I was probably the only one in the class that paid any sort of attention, and even that wasn’t too much. I thought I was going to be hot shit since I wanted to be an engineer and figured I’d be making so much money that I wouldn’t need to budget (lol).

People like to rag on schools by saying “oh why didn’t they teach this ___ important skill?” But in reality, we all know most high schools kids don’t pay attention, I barely did in any class, and nowadays since everything is about testing, kids will do whatever it takes just to make a high grade (cheat, brain dump, whatever)."

Most people didn’t know what to do in the class because there was no real book or curriculum we were following. Plus the class wasn’t mandatory, it was an elective.

There really needs to be more mandatory, financial management classes in high-school. Would really help out, especially with kids going to these big, expensive schools without realizing the financial repercussions and student loans they’ll be facing in the future."

2021-06-21 11:36:27,stocks,"Most have economics classes, which would give a high level view of the stock market. 

However, like most subjects that don't immediately affect the student, they're ignored by those same students who years later will complain about how they weren't taught something. 

Additionally, classes on the stock market are complex. Teaching corporate valuation at the high school level is probably too much. Diving into betas, and some other indicators requires context. 

So apart from extremely high level information on WHAT the market is (which can be based on facts), anything beyond that is a teacher's speculation, and can give a very skewed view of the market. Again, unless we're talking about multiple courses that would be way above a high school students capability. 

Just my opinion."

We had personal finance, business finance, entrepreneurship, accounting, advanced accounting, and computer applications (excel, PowerPoint, etc.)

I always look back on those classes and feel incredibly grateful I was able to learn a lot of this stuff. It spurred my interest in the market and put me on the career path I am on now.

2021-06-21 12:27:48,stocks,Because the government wants to keep people ignorant so they can easily minuplate them for votes and keep power. They don't want you to be financially educated on money /stocks and want you to be in debt.
2021-06-21 12:28:37,stocks,"I have been complaining of this tremendously as of late... I am 38 yrs old as of june 17th.. for the last 2 years I have been buying and reading books on the stock market while investing and learning hands on, attempting to teach myself.. it is a shame that there are no basic courses for our stock markets or on investing in general... basically what we are taught is get a 9-5 that offers retirement and clock in for 30yrs.... ludacris if you ask me... we can do some much more by simply investing ourselves... but anyway.. love this post, and would love to see this become a thing.. good luck to all"

Happened right when the housing market crashed. Fkn teacher didn’t even say once to buy the dip. All he said was it’ll take about 10 years to recover from this."
2021-06-21 12:35:36,stocks,Had an entire semester playing the stock market game.
2021-06-21 12:35:56,stocks,The economy would grind to a halt if everybody just started saving (not spending) and investing :-)
2021-06-21 12:37:30,stocks,"I had classes on all that and wasn't even specializing in business, could have gone much deeper if I wanted. My school had a program called ""business venture"" or something where they'd start a mock business and conduct business over the semester. Idk exactly what they did but the students would show up to school in business attire, it was pretty serious."

2021-06-21 12:39:29,stocks,We did. You get a fake account to trade with. The super stoner in our group spent it all on the ticker POT. The stock went up like 30% that semester. And our teacher told the whole class to buy POT. It was awesome.
2021-06-21 12:48:26,stocks,"Mine did in economics but honestly, unless you have money involved it’s not very interesting"
2021-06-21 12:49:05,stocks,Because Public school cares about turning you into a good employee so you work for money the rest of your life. Instead of your money working for you.
2021-06-21 12:49:17,stocks,Some do but liek my economic class had it as a practically a foot note and everything they said was evtheir the most basic leval stuff or wrong 😑
2021-06-21 12:50:51,stocks,"Why would they? 

Do they teach you how to fix a car anymore? How to pay taxes? How to actually start a business? Or do they teach you to do as your told and repeat tedious, meaningless tasks with an occasional nugget of knowledge gained....

School is just training camp for a life of servitude and subordination"
2021-06-21 12:51:48,stocks,"We had a money management class when I was in high school in 2009. 

Still to this day it is the most useful class I had in high school. I learned how to manage my back accounts, do my taxes, how to be responsible with credit cards and briefly how stocks work. It was an elective class that many would ignore or skip.

The fact that this is not a required class is absolutely devastating. This would help many learn how to use money effectively, reduce poor money management and honestly I think it would grow the economy and lower poverty in the long run."

2021-06-21 13:00:22,stocks,"Schools reinforce the behaviors necessary to be a good worker for the upper echelons of society, those same upper echelons have decided that investing is not something relevant to that goal, and in fact may work to the contrary.

We even had a group project to track stocks, trade and track the value and see how we all would do with fake money. See which group had the biggest increase/decrease. Since the teacher told us to round to the nearest dollar we found some that were sitting at 1.40-1.49 and sold the moment they hit 1.50. Of course some other group got mad at our strategy and she made everyone count the cents so we didn't win."

2021-06-21 13:04:28,stocks,"Trying to teach a high schooler ""stocks"" is actually a pretty difficult position for a school. Economics (Macro typically) makes more sense - and will touch on the stock market - and is actually considered a social science. The truth of the matter is you can either teach them the ""cliff notes of success"" (i.e. put your money into a TSM index and leave it forever) in about 10 minutes, or you can teach them how to think they can time the market. Many kids wont have funds to invest anyways, and wont until they are too old to remember what's going on. If your high school economics teacher knew enough to be teaching valuable investment advice he/she would not be teaching highschool."

2021-06-21 13:07:10,stocks,I did a paper trading class in 5th grade that was for the advanced students who were bored with normal class work. The district followed that up by offering literally nothing similar in middle or high school...
2021-06-21 13:07:29,stocks,A lot of public high schools do teach basic concepts of finance. They tend to be high schools where these kids would learn this from their parents regardless. Go figure.
2021-06-21 13:07:33,stocks,"My middle school had a ""Stock Market Club"" and held a paper event over a semester with some small non-monetary prize for the first place. Our team won with Lockheed Martin after a tip from one of the team's father. This was circa 2001 so read into that how you will."
2021-06-21 13:09:15,stocks,"I don’t know if they still do it, but we had one marking period every year where instead of health class, we had Junior Achievment (I think that’s the name).

It was a great idea, in theory, but it was one of those classes where almost no one paid attention."
2021-06-21 13:09:56,stocks,"When I was in high school, I learned about stock market and economy in my senior year(2016). We did a simulation of everyone in the class Investing in a certain stocks that was popular. I remember  Investing in Amazon, google, and Microsoft.  The budget  was $100,000 simulation  dollars. 

It was fun and I learned a lot about stocks. But not much to really get my foot on it until I went to college  and my peers was using Robinhood for Investing."

2021-06-21 13:13:01,stocks,Mine did but it was terrible. They set you up on paper money with a preset amount to spend and just told kids to have at it. Pretty much everyone lost all their money and the teacher pretty much said that’s why you should just stay away from the stock market.
2021-06-21 13:13:36,stocks,Because stock market is stupid
2021-06-21 13:14:51,stocks,"I went to high school in a great district and graduated from a state university without a single class on how to invest your money. It really is insane how little real life classes you receive in public education. I would have really appreciated classes on how to buy a house, save money, investing in safe etf/bond/etc., how to interview for a job, improving credit, basic home maintenance like turning on and off utilities/air filters/ using appliances safely/fireplace/safe cooking and how to put out cooking fires, basic vehicle knowledge like changing a tire, this sounds like normal stuff but so many people just don't know how to be an adult because they grew up in suburbia and time moves quickly."
2021-06-21 13:15:14,stocks,Because they want you to be a slave wage tax payer.

We had to write down how much we 'bought' the stock for and then track it for the week and at the end of the week we could see how our stocks did. That was it. Nothing about researching the companies or critical thinking just that and then we moved on. This was mid-2000's if that helps any."
2021-06-21 13:19:06,stocks,"Because the education department would rather you focus on social issues and other worthless components. Uneducated useful idiots play right into their hands as we can see in our current society.

2021-06-21 13:20:19,stocks,Same reason they don't have classes on casinos and games of chance; someone much larger and more powerful controls it all and whether or not you make money has nothing to do with your skill. The house inevitably wins.
2021-06-21 13:21:55,stocks,"I don't know but I definitely learned a lot about the evils of communism, the pledge of allegiance, and our glorious triumphs in WW1 and WW2 in public school though. Maybe our education system isn't wholeheartedly designed to benefit the lower/middle class?"

2021-06-21 13:22:56,stocks,A few of my teachers said you should put 10 per aside for retirement.  Even fewer said never pay more than 30 percent what you make on housing.  Get a roomate or rent a room if you have too.

I don't buy the argument that this isn't the case anymore either. The entire system was designed from the ground up as a factory for factory workers. Over the years it has grown past what it was originally designed for, but it's still informed by it's origins. High school students coming out of school today will literally go into college classrooms raising their hand and asking if they have permission to go to the restroom instead of knowing it's a fundamental human right to use the restroom and that they don't have to ask a higher power if it's ok to tend to a bodily function they have no control over. 

Fuck high schools."

2021-06-21 14:05:11,stocks,"From a canadian point of view, they’re taught in business classes…errrr just economics and planning. It does mesh well with accounting, but most business teachers, at least from a high school level, aren’t actually equipped to teach stock market trading or investing. When it is introduced, it’s done in a very superficial way where the teacher has to adjust it to the curriculum. So for economics, you show demand and supply dynamics with stocks. Teachers also use simulations, but those can be flawed. 

Another issue is how do you teach it? With stocks, there are many discourses such as index investing, dividend investing, day trading, etc. If you do stocks, you typically are limited to a few and it comes down to are you willing to teach it? Also consider that teachers are a more conservative breed when it comes to investing so they tend to stay away from stock market investing. If you do teach it, are you worried about the risks such as parents who think they know better or kids copying what you do and executing it poorly, and then suing you. 

Another problem is the kids. When kids do the stock unit, they are mostly concerned with if their portfolio is doing well. They like the oscillations, but not the learning and process to perfect one’s craft. Also consider that kids have more behavioural problems than previous generations so that doesn’t help.

The optimal solution is a stock market club. The problem is how do you make it engaging and educational at the same time? If it isn’t engaging, the club then just becomes another class."
2021-06-21 14:07:50,stocks,Is there are finance classes available at my high school but Nothing really touches on the stock market. I think it has to do with the rich not wanting competition but yeah. The classes touch on loans And stuff like that.

2021-06-21 14:08:59,stocks,"When I was in highschool we had a stock market class. It was an elective and took the entire year. It was my senior year of school. And juniors were able to take it as well, as an elective. This was in 2010. They even had a website we used with mock money to invest in real world stocks with their current rise and fall prices. I took top place at the end of the year bu turning $10k into $100k back then. Was very informative and educational. And it’s what got me into trading today. I’m still a novice trader but thank that class the most and think it was the best class I took my senior year."
2021-06-21 14:10:54,stocks,"Most high schools definitely have economics as an elective. When I went to high school, it was available to juniors and seniors. It was part of the social sciences electives along with classes like psychology, anthropology, law, etc. If I remember correctly, you had to take one per year in order to graduate.

They also teach some economics in statistics.

Most middle schools also have some basic financial education, like budgeting, managing savings and checking accounts, a bit about taxes, etc."
2021-06-21 14:11:12,stocks,"We did do a section on the stock market in our economics class. It wasnt a required course though.

We had a project where we had 30 days to see who could make money paper trading 100k. This happened to coincide with Netflix announcing they were moving away from mail delivery of DVDs and towards streaming. The way I remember it the price dipped hard on this news, then rebounded strong as more details came out. I had maybe 20% of the 100k in Netflix and this was enough to win me the competition. It was cool.

Point is that at some schools it is taught, and taught well. But lots of schools just don't teach anything well, let alone the electives. That's a real issue"
2021-06-21 14:12:37,stocks,"We did, way back in the late 80's.  I mean it wasnt a full class on the stock market but we did have a few months in a class where we were givin like $5,000 in play money to buy and sell stocks and a competition of sorts to see who could do better.  We spent a couple of hrs a week for a semester on it.  Same class also did a household budget that was pretty detailed, like you had so much play money to do your grocery shopping, then you had to plan out all your meals, pay rent or a house payment, taxes, vehicle payment and all that.  

But we had some kids living in nice houses, eating beans 5 days a week and driving a motorcycle so they could afford a nicer house than everyone else.  We had kids living in shacks and driving BMW's.   So you can teach that kind of stuff but you cant make kids take it too seriously."

2021-06-21 14:19:05,stocks,"We actually had a class called Personal Finance in my hs and luckily the guy teaching didn’t even need to be there but he was very well off financially. Had lots of knowledge about stocks and just how to make yourself wealthy and be well off financially in general. I could tell by his aura and confident demeanor the freedom and happiness he had in life just off of being very financially stable, and I think it definitely gave me something to strive for. What sucks is that it was just an elective class, so something you had to sign up for and not a required course such as biology or algebra. And there were probably 100+ other electives you could take at my hs. So 90% of the kids never even took the class. That class taught me almost everything you hear people say about “why wasn’t I taught _____ in high school?” And most people didn’t even have a clue it was there."
2021-06-21 14:19:42,stocks,"We had an econ/stock class in high school, the stock portion is really all I remember from it, I didnt take it too seriously back then so it would have been more beneficial to take something like that at the college level. That's not to say other classmates in high school didnt get more out of it than I did as I wasnt the best student back then"
2021-06-21 14:20:13,stocks,My economics class did. We were to put 20k into whatever we wanted and were graded on how well we kept up with it. I was up big I put it all in vape companies and Activision before they released the new cod (2014) 😎

2021-06-21 14:27:31,stocks,"We did have a class on the stock market, and paper trading. I really wish it was a mandatory class though. And I do wish the teacher taught us real life lessons on it. Aka compound interest, long term investing, financial decisions, etc.

I didn't think much of it at the time and only took it cause the stock market looked like fun. Surprinsgly enough, I made a lot of technical trades in paper trading and was able to net a good profit.

2021-06-21 14:40:01,stocks,Part of it is probably because it's a system that doesn't update itself very fast or often. There's also people that want as many people to become sheep from the education system and just become consumers and not investors. That's my two cents. Though I did have a personal finance course in high school that everyone had to take.
2021-06-21 14:44:33,stocks,What's a good program for me to start learning? I know absolutely nothing
2021-06-21 14:44:40,stocks,"Because its a private club for rich people and the majority help the system run, having more people understand how it works doesn't help them."
2021-06-21 14:45:54,stocks,As a 16 year old trying to convince my school to do this I agree
2021-06-21 14:46:06,stocks,They do. Well sort of. It's the Economics class. Ot was required at my school. Coincidentally it was my favorite class. Tracking stocks and learning how banking systems worked etc. They taught us how to write checks (lol that skill has never been used since debit cards are a thing) as well as how to make a budget. It was a fantastic class and I actually miss it.
2021-06-21 14:46:50,stocks,"The stock market or just finance in general definitely should be taught in high schools. I didn't even know what a stock was until my 11th or 12th grade math teacher made an off hand remark in class one day on how she gets paid by Nike because she's a share holder of their stock. I was instantly intrigued because I was working fast food at the time and knew I wanted other sources of income. 

She was probably the smartest teacher in the entire school. You know that ultra smart aura you get from certain people? She definitely exuded that. She was Also always the one in charge of any fund raising activities for the school, had other business ventures that she occasionally spoke on etc so I kinda got the sense she knew her way with money but never put things together until she made that comment on Nike stock. 

Honestly, if not for being in that class at that time I probably wouldn't of started investing until much later, I still remember opening my first brokerage account years ago in the 12th grade as soon as I turned 18 and started purchasing my first shares. 

This could be more people if only it was taught about more in schools, I've had numerous people much older than me asked what's a stock or what's the stock market etc.. best to learn and start soon, time in the markets is what's important"

2021-06-21 14:52:02,stocks,"I would have loved to have taken a class in high school that taught stock market fundamentals.  This was the late 80's for me.  I think we all have our stories about companies that we thought would be big and we can all look back and say that we wish we had bought stocks back when they were super cheap.  For me it was Tesla.  I remember when Tesla first cam out and I thought it was so cool.  It was years after the EV1 cam out and then was killed.  I definitely thought Tesla was here to stay.  I remember when Tesla opened their store on The 3rd Street Promenade in Santa Monica.  My brother and I walked down there since we live only blocks away.  I was totally blown away when I saw the chassis and the motors and spoke with the sales people.  It was less than $3/share.  I had retirement accounts, but I was not an active investor.

It's designed to give you a strong financial background and get your ready for a career in finance, including stocks. It is available to most high schools, the administration needs to want it and have funding for it though (which is very reasonable because it's a sponsored program). They also need to gage a teacher(s) with a ba in business or something similar/higher."

If you want to learn about the real world, public school is not the place to do it. The internet on the other hand, is a goldmine for knowledge."
2021-06-21 15:05:54,stocks,We learned about the basics in economics
2021-06-21 15:08:31,stocks,When I was in fifth grade my teacher had us all pick stocks from the newspaper and track their stock prices every week and do the math to figure out if we were up or down. It was a very simple introduction that could have been followed by some actual classes in middle or high school. But sadly it was not.
2021-06-21 15:10:14,stocks,"The thing is a lot of schools DO have economics courses. The bitch about *that* is that they don't require it in many cases, and when they do, it's only for a half credit. They systemically embed into kids brains the idea that economics is pointless or for nerds. It's the same reason why you only ever get one or two lessons in basic Algebra on taxes and percentages. It's to keep everyone poor and stupid"

I’ve had students come back as mid to late 20somethings who tell me of their success in the stock market.  One kid (adult now) offered to take me a ride in his newly purchased plane.  Pretty cool seeing how the seeds planted many years ago can take fruit later in life."

2021-06-21 15:29:32,stocks,"I agree. I basically see economics as applied mathematics. Instead of teaching pure mathematics, we should be tailoring math to what people need for their careers. I have taken advanced pure mathematics and applied mathematics and found the applied courses much more useful. It may be political. Information asymmetry keeps those in power, in power.  Imagine a world where people only used a credit card as a convenience to carrying around a lot of cash, only using the card if they already have the money to pay it off."

Where I really learned was from my father. We would sit with each other on Sundays and read the stock prices in the newspaper that we were tracking. When I was 18 I opened a Scottrade account with him as a guarantor and put some savings in there, after that I learned on my own.

Privileged, I know. I'm pretty far to the right politically, but I'd be down for the federal government funding a trading account for every high school graduate with $500. All of the information one needs is available for free now."

It was a great intro for me as it did spark my interests. I do regret not telling my parents to buy carmax as it was on the otc exchange for  .15cents a share.

Furthermore, things like Music and Physical Education are also considered to be 'disposable' courses, as they do not contribute to making better soldiers or better workers.."

    Honestly the fear selling that happens with traders is real, her Account has almost always out paced mine on gains the simple solution was to just care less and mirror trades.
    Should of held some longer but lost gains are like losses----20/20, either way we both have made money.  AMD at $5.25 out at $12, AMZN at 900 out at 1600 unfortunately after pullback, NVDA was good too fell into the time when crypto was just forming.  Her best has been MSFT at 12.50 I think she's still holding that div reinvest for shares has been pumping it for years.  Too Many other trades to remember.   
     My father has always been %100 in stocks, high-school would be an excellent place.  Me and my father talk stocks all the time, where most of my education came from.  He shared alot of pitfalls and successful ideas 💡 with me early on.  Carter, the 80's, dotcom, and the 08 shat-show.  This has been both good and bad,  would of made more money if early on i put my feelings aside on certain companies i didn't like.
     Talk to people with experience in gains as well as losses.  Read some books.  Any add for a stock, scroll to the bottom and read the fine print first.  A circle of people in stocks helps theres too many tickers to watch."
2021-06-21 15:58:58,stocks,"H.S. teachers mostly don't understand Money themselves.

To circle back with the OP, actually kids can invest.   I strongly urge EVERYONE to open a Roth IRA for their kids.   As the kids mature, you can teach them about investments and growth over time.   Let them pick a couple stocks depending on their interests (hobby related, etc.) and see where it goes.   As a parent, you can also contribute which will pay yuuuuge dividends as long as the kids keep the Roth for their lifetime."

They taught resume building, taxes, benefits, insurance, just everything you should have skill wise. Best thing that ever happened to me."

Also so did my elementary school, completely separately. Like 3rd or 4th grade I think we did it. We did sim trading with a set starting amount long term investing mostly. They also had us open saving accounts and I think we put some money in them. Also I think we got bonds or something. We may have also used very small amounts of real money or they gave us a small amount related to our sim trades. I don’t really remember. So really depends on your school and the region you live in."

2021-06-21 16:43:21,stocks,"As a high school teacher, I will say there is an introductory personal finance course that is REQUIRED by anyone that wants to graduate.  This is in NJ, and I am pretty sure it's a nationwide thing.  However, it is just that an intro to checking accounts, paychecks, some taxes info, and eventually loans for buying car, home, etc.  
I personally have a Math degree and teach a Consumer/Business Math class that goes into much more detail where I do in fact introduce the idea of investing using compounding interest, simple interest, and how it's important to start sooner than later.  This class is optional and is often overlooked by the counselors since it's a 4th Math class and only are required for graduation. 
The kids that take it, come back with emails and messages a couple years later saying how much they appreciated the class and how it helped them get their loans for school and a car. The majority of kids learn so much about personal investments and the many different ways they can start. 

It is a definite issue that should be addressed at a national level and also make Math required 4 years."
2021-06-21 16:44:28,stocks,I had to take economics in high school. I think having a class on just the stock market would be too specific to have a whole required class about and it doesn't even work how it's supposed to with manipulation and whatnot.

We'd pick stocks at basically random from the list without any DD whatsoever and see who could build their ""account"" the most. A couple of preppy dudes knew their shit (Dad was in the biz I guess) and did the best. I just picked a bunch of random penny stocks and lost most of my ""money."""

2021-06-21 16:53:09,stocks,"You didn’t take economics in high school? Not shaming just genuinely surprised since I took it & had some classes on it in middle school too

2021-06-21 16:55:57,stocks,Ask the teacher unions?? I learned nothing of the market or how it works.
2021-06-21 16:56:26,stocks,What do you want? A class about corruption and manipulation?
2021-06-21 16:58:18,stocks,We did it in Jr. High
2021-06-21 16:59:18,stocks,"You must be American... languages aren't useless. When I worked in Africa French really, really came in handy.

But your point is well taken... there needs to be a more ""hands on"" approach to learning about the stock market in school."
2021-06-21 17:00:51,stocks,it’s much easier to make profit if most people don’t know what they are doing… i guess
2021-06-21 17:01:16,stocks,When I was in 5th grade we did a experiment to see who could make the most money buying stocks. It lasted liked 3 months. It was pretty neat and I learned alittle about stocks
2021-06-21 17:03:13,stocks,Because they want us to stay ignorant.
2021-06-21 17:07:58,stocks,They do though
2021-06-21 17:11:11,stocks,Funny you say this. Rhode Island schools are starting a course on it and the parents and students are having a fit. It’s oddly weird how angry they are about it.
2021-06-21 17:14:59,stocks,"Bro, they don't even have driver's ed anymore"

2021-06-21 17:19:12,stocks,"I took business studies in GCSE, there was a bit of stock talk, playing on a pretend market (Yahoo i think).

But not much, problem is you need a teacher who knows about the stock market, but also hasn’t made enough money on it to do something better than teach business studies."
2021-06-21 17:19:25,stocks,"High schooler here! We have a new elective called Wall Street and Investments. We talked a little about the economy first then we went on to stocks, bonds/annuities, retirement accounts, and finance careers. I wish it was a full year class though because it was a great learning experience. We also have a personal finance elective too."
2021-06-21 17:20:13,stocks,Lowest common denominator/no child left behind policies. We had stock market classes in middle school back in the 90s.
2021-06-21 17:21:36,stocks,"They want the masses to be dumb as much as possible in financial world so they can do whatever they want with less people criticizing them.

Hence people who are well verse in financial world have the opportunity to reach out to the masses thru social media and educate them. 

As for the misinformed, or peeps with no idea about public market I pray you guys start with curiousity. A small kindle of curiosity might open your mind how simple the market is and not something daunting due to bombardment of acronyms and labels that the finance world put in place. 

Be aware and teach your small people. Educate, educate and educate is the single most important defence against corrupt and manipulators."
2021-06-21 17:25:23,stocks,"My high school had a personal finance class. 

Part of the class was explaining what sticks are and included us playing on a stock market game that followed the real market. I dont remember what the name of it was, but we would always research stocks on marketwatch and then place our bids on the site. 

Marketwatch and investopedia both have their own versions of it now."
2021-06-21 17:28:57,stocks,"I was in high school from 05-08. Economics class was extensive in learning about the stock market. Honestly, whenever people wanna complain about high school ""not teaching me x, y, or z,"" it really simply boils down to either you just didn't pay attention, or it's such a basic life skill that you should've learned it from a parent."
2021-06-21 17:29:32,stocks,"The same reason they don’t wanna teach critical race theory—if the masses are ignorant, they can’t get in the way of *your* progress."
2021-06-21 17:29:52,stocks,Cuz then everyone would go get an MBA and nobody would produce anything.
2021-06-21 17:32:25,stocks,"I remember back in my junior year of high school which was 2015 it was required that all students had to take an elective class called Personal Finance. The class taught us the most useful stuff like how to write checks, how to use a check register, how to fill out tax forms by hand, and a final project about what college we were going to after high school and why. I did go to college and still am but a lot of people didnt plan on going to college so she made them do theirs on the job they wanted to have. Nothing about investing, stocks and the stock market, credit, or mortgage. Learning how to balance my checkbook which I never did once in my entire life because I have a banking app that gives my account balance and keeps track of my purchases is way more useful information than any of that stuff."
2021-06-21 17:32:57,stocks,Cuz the stock market is rigged
2021-06-21 17:33:50,stocks,"Not only does it teach money management and investing, but stocks get you interested in current events, world culture, and politics. This was the best part of getting into investing that I did not anticipate. Before I started to invest I did not really care or pay attention to much in terms of what was going on outside of my immediate life in terms of the above. Having some skin in the game really expands and broadens your view/involvement with the world. That’s a good thing for young people."
2021-06-21 17:34:51,stocks,I think the problem is that any teacher in public schools who has this type of skill to teach classes around the stock market would pursue jobs outside of education and make quite a bit more.
2021-06-21 17:35:37,stocks,I passed AP Econ Exam but I still needed to learn about basic things like market caps all on my own.
2021-06-21 17:36:36,stocks,"That is odd I graduated in 1979 and we not only had a stock club we also had an economics class that taught how to balance your check book, do your taxes and basic living math. We also had an active political club and debate there was the young Republicans and the liberal club Things have gone downhill since I left school I hear they dont even teach how to sign name instead they print and looking at penmanship of most they dont even do a good job at that. the basic economics class was required even if you were a regents honors student"
2021-06-21 17:38:51,stocks,"Kinda shoved in with civics and economics but even then they don't teach much there, idk why there aren't more classes"
2021-06-21 17:43:26,stocks,"There was a website that gave us 5K in play money and whoever got the highest gain by the end of semester won bragging rights .. this was back in late 2000s. It was our econ class. That's where I learned the most... I lost for sure, but someone got lucky on Netflix when it was $15 a share"
2021-06-21 17:49:24,stocks,[removed]
2021-06-21 17:49:25,stocks,Why do we need financial education when we can pay for anything and everything with a credit card?
2021-06-21 17:55:18,stocks,"Yeah I mean not only was every senior at my high school required to take some form of economics which covered stocks and everything that can impacy them, but we also offered AP Macroeconomics (some schools can offer micro or both). The non AP classes even did a stock market simulation project."
2021-06-21 17:57:31,stocks,"Personal finance definitely should be taught in school. Like they need to learn budgeting, why debt is bad, etc. Stocks can be part of it, but IMO people shouldn't start investing until they've actually worked a job.

Also, foreign language is definitely NOT useless for a teen. Being bilingual opens so many doors career-wise. I wish that I would kept up with Spanish after high school. I've been learning German for about 2 years now, but I'm way late to the game since I'm in my 30's."
2021-06-21 17:58:52,stocks,Because worst-case they would not be mature or smart enough to avoid treating it like a casino or blowing real money on fake stocks and a manufactured sense of community. We wouldn’t want a lack of sophistication or critical thinking skills to lose people money they don’t have....oh wait...
2021-06-21 18:00:59,stocks,"My school has SOME financial education, but not nearly enough. I agree"
2021-06-21 18:03:25,stocks,Because if more people understand finance its more competition for rich people...
2021-06-21 18:03:29,stocks,"I still try to teach my students about, but it all comes down to state curriculum.  I still get to squeezing market awareness to our futures."
2021-06-21 18:03:30,stocks,"It is taught, It is just not mentioned in the context of finance until you take Econ junior year of high school. Once I got in my major at college I realized all the junior year classes didn’t require math above Calculus 1, which is an automatic F for most high schoolers if the grades aren’t curved. I also hate when people wonder why accounting is not taught in high school, that shit is hard af and has taken me the last 5 years to get good at by constantly studying and reading. I taught high school this past year specifically Algebra 1 and Geometry and those kids are not ready for the statistics involved in analyzing the stock market and the decision making process involved with it. I actually think high school physics class is what teaches you to think about the world differently and showed me to not just follow the leader blindly into a situation. I now work at fidelity investments so we’ll see how it goes."
2021-06-21 18:07:07,stocks,School isn't to educate you. It's to make you fit enough to get a job and make money for the industrial complex.
2021-06-21 18:08:13,stocks,"In elementary school we had a club you could sign up for that was basically just a paper trading competition. We worked in groups of 3? I want to say and the group who ended up with the most gains by the end of the ""season"" got something as a reward...maybe extra time in the computer lab...I don't really remember. 

They had the same thing in high school as well, in addition to economics and financing classes as well."
2021-06-21 18:09:18,stocks,You are so right!! Schools only interested in  pushing liberal ideologies these days
2021-06-21 18:17:44,stocks,"In the UK we hardly have anything on this. Only if you chose it later in higher education or something. Closest we get is business studies in final years, and even then you have to choose that"
2021-06-21 18:19:25,stocks,"They definitely have these classes. When I graduated in 2002, I took a finance class. We learned about FV calculators and even participated in a stock simulation, where we operated a portfolio with fake money amd were ranked globally. We were required to buy shares options, short stocks, etc. It was good times bc this is when RIM was doing its nose dive."
2021-06-21 18:19:44,stocks,My school had a math and financial applications class it was pretty cool
2021-06-21 18:20:01,stocks,Because the school system is broken and they don’t want kids to learn personal finance. It’s easy to make money off uneducated people.
2021-06-21 18:21:57,stocks,"Same reason public education sucks in general and good education is getting less and less affordable. The very rich and wealthy have been pushing policies that ensure the longevity of their wealth will continue grow and last through generations. There are no classes on stock market because they don't want us and our children to really understand and realize how fucked up the market is. And that we have been their ""pseudo"" slaves for decades. And if you say: ""Oh! Look at all these people being successful and all that."" Think bigger. How many of those successful people there are compared to the rest of the world? It is getting harder to afford any basic needs: healthcare, housing, and now even food prices are shooting up because of inflation. Did you not benefit from the trillions injected into the market? No? Well, where do you think the money went?"
2021-06-21 18:23:26,stocks,"Because the elites don't want people to understand their own game. The pattern day trader rule makes it to where people with under 25,000 dollars cannot really day trade more than 3 times under the guise of margin protection, but stock brokers have MARGIN REQUIREMENTS on their own.... meaning if a position dips below the requirement the broker will liquidate the position unless the trader meets their call. So why does the PDT rule exist again? Yeah.. see the bigger picture, they do no want the little guy making any money cause then they won't work for slave labor wage of 10 dollars an hour anymore."
2021-06-21 18:27:18,stocks,HS tells you how the world is based on whatever the school board approves.  College offers the opportunity for debate and discussion around a topic.  By their very nature HS can’t teach how something fluid like the markets work (beyond super basics).
2021-06-21 18:30:01,stocks,"Honestly facts, though. My school required us to take a foreign language class, and it was such a waste of time. Foreign languages should be something that you learn on your own time; they should not be forced into your schedule by the school. If they had had a class on the stock market, then I would've taken that in a fucking heartbeat."
2021-06-21 18:30:32,stocks,I took an economics class my senior year (2011) and the whole second half was stock market. Used a mock website and everything.
2021-06-21 18:34:22,stocks,Because it would give the labor a way to potentially build wealth. If you were part of the 1% you would want to keep citizens exactly where they are too
2021-06-21 18:34:31,stocks,they need a working class
2021-06-21 18:35:05,stocks,I'm sorry that you went to school in Alabama.
2021-06-21 18:35:35,stocks,I feel like every time I see this it’s from somebody who wasn’t a business student in high school or some bc most of business students who went all the way like me we did learn about stock market we even had a game where we would buy stock from a fake stock market and have to compete with other schools. I learned a lot and it actually taught me to watch the news when I went to invest
2021-06-21 18:37:30,stocks,"French isn’t completely useless for a teen, the cognitive and future benefits of at least going through the process of learning a new language if you don’t know one already are irrefutable"
2021-06-21 18:40:51,stocks,"Because teaching useful life skills like how to viably make a living isn’t what MSM wants and we all know how much pull big money and MSM has. Instead they’d rather teach us, sin cos tan and how to play the didgeridoo."
2021-06-21 18:44:13,stocks,"The education system is designed to teach you how to write resumes, not to teach you how to become successful."
2021-06-21 18:44:37,stocks,This would be such an amazing class.  I'm sure schools have done it (pretty sure there was even an episode of Saved By The Bell) but part of the course can be building a portfolio and tracking gain and loss over the semester or year.  This would be such a great preparation for financial planning.  Too much of school does not take into account real life application of learning.
2021-06-21 18:47:18,stocks,French isn't useless lol.

2021-06-21 18:51:06,stocks,"Because schools have limited resources, and have to teach you math and english. IDK, probably costs more to hire a stock market teacher."
2021-06-21 18:51:53,stocks,"Public school in the US is designed to create suckers who come out take on debt, spend money on crap and then die.  If you want to succeed in life, you have to unlearn everything you learned in public school, especially the way of thinking that is taught there."

My school however is in New Jersey and is in a very rich and competitive school district."
2021-06-21 18:53:58,stocks,"We had an Econ Honors class (sort of a pre AP Micro/Macro class) that lightly covered the stock market, though the most we really got was our teacher setting up a paper trading competition & at the end saying ‘see, it’s all random’. Teacher was a wall st drop out"

You may as well get them to do a six month contest on playing slot machines.    The winner will be the highest risk/reward and your kids will have learned nothing."
2021-06-21 19:00:42,stocks,Mine did back in the year 2000…govt and economics was the mandatory class. Half the year was with one teacher learning gov’t and the other half was economics where we would pick a stock and watch it go up and down daily in the paper and report on why we think it did what it did.
2021-06-21 19:01:25,stocks,Amen!
2021-06-21 19:03:06,stocks,"The answer is because government wants a generation of people growing up learning how to draw an obtuse angle instead of learning to become financially literate. The more people learn about the financial market, the more will realize how full of BS the governments are as they spend us into oblivion"
2021-06-21 19:03:18,stocks,"Well they just want you to work your ass off, pay off your home and car until you are 65 and cant walk and cant travel anymore.... they don't want you to make the most of your money by investing in RE and market... they just want everybody to follow the same pathway and spend to stimulate the economy. The rich stay rich by spending like they’re poor and the poor stay poor by spending like they’re rich. It's very true. They like to scare you off by saying market is risky, you lose 50% of your shit when there is a global market crash.... but if you invest in company with bright future and increasing profit making trend, you are good in long term. You can't lose.

And well most of the Americans live paycheck to paycheck. They do not have such idea and concept as saving, emergency fund and budgeting. Regardless of whether they earn $5000 or $250 a month, they spend all of them. If they do not know the idea and important of budgeting and the idea of setting some of the money earned aside, you are gonna expect them to learn investing?"
2021-06-21 19:03:20,stocks,"Yes because the only thing important in the world is money. The only thing I do every day is stare at my bank account to watch the numbers go up. The fuck kind of post is this?

First off, most high schools do teach economics as an AP course. Even more, most schools offer a “dollars and sense” class that teaches how to manage money on a personal level.

Secondly, how is learning a language or having extra-curricular activities useless for a teen? Being bi-lingual, especially from a young age, is associated with long term memory and advanced problem solving skills. 

I know this probably isn’t the place for my discussion, but I just really loathe when people put down extracurriculars with the “kids should learn money shit” argument. Yes, they should- but they should learn both. And most schools already teach the money shit at the expense of arts and extracurriculars."
2021-06-21 19:06:16,stocks,Probably because they can't give everyone a fucking trophy.

2021-06-21 19:06:35,stocks,We did mock stock market in middle school.

2021-06-21 19:07:45,stocks,I had a class called business math I took in my senior year of high school and we did a 2 month long unit on the stock market. Our teacher had us install a stock exchange simulator and had us compete to see who would have the most capital by the end of the year.

2021-06-21 19:27:10,stocks,Why?  How else are they going to repress the working class?
2021-06-21 19:31:10,stocks,From my experience it is there but it is not a required class. You as a high schooler who does not know which of these classes are actually important are expected to make a choice between fun classes and ones for your future. If you come from a family who is on the poor side and have very little financial literacy those business classes are not even on your radar most likely. Again just my experience and what I've picked up from anecdotes.
2021-06-21 19:34:34,stocks,"My high school has a personal finance class that briefly touched on stuff like stocks and taxes and debt.

2021-06-21 19:51:17,stocks,I guess because usually schools are cheap and wouldn’t pay enough for a CFA certified teacher who could give financial advice. Same reason for taxes.

2021-06-21 01:39:15,stocks,"Was it a public school?  Schools are not meant to educate anyone, they are meant to indoctrinate.   You are supposed to watch TV, consume and work overtime.  Thinking gets people fired, un-personed off the internet and someday you'll be arrested for it."

He was an options trader on the side, he would sink a shit load of cash in, watch it go up and sell.  We knew he did this, but as it was not part of curricular, he couldn’t teach us how he did it.

I used marketwatch.com because of the ease of their virtual stock market simulation. Students had $20,000 to invest. We kept it simple with no options trading or anything crazy and a few other rules on the trades they could make. They had to invest in a least 4 different companies, no more than 60% of their money in any one stock, had to be at least 80% invested, submit at least 8 different orders, etc.

I think just learning how the market works and developing trading strategies was huge for their understanding. Plus, they got to experience and participate in this whole ""meme stock"" phenomenon. There were several students are and lost a lot based on when they bought in to GME, AMC, or BB. Many kids just went for the names they knew like AMZN or MSFT. The RBLX ipo was a huge deal for them. Those who participated had fun, got into it, and learned a lot. This was mostly over distance learning so that was a bit of a struggle.

Nobody forces you to take a JROTC or French class, and both of these have very clear uses.

French is useful if you want or need to communicate with someone who speaks French for literally any reason (working with French speakers, visiting France, living in France).

In fact, it’s definitely not in the AP Economics classes and any classes that teach a watered down curriculum of it for the standard classes. 

If stock investing is taught, it’s likely an elective credit in business/personal finance that teaches everything from managing one’s own money to different avenues of investing that money, interest rates, taxes, microeconomics, etc., and that probably isn’t available unless a teacher designs or pulls another curriculum for it for the school which isn’t standard.

I went to a public school and we had an Economics class where we learned about the stock market and how the financial world works. That single class was the one that made me get a Bachelor's degree in Finance because I fell in love with the finance world. 

But I was part of the few that actually liked the class. Most of my classmates and friends hated the class, found it boring, and did the bare minimum to pass the class. 

Now that we all are adults and see how people that started investing when they were 18 are ahead in life,  we tend to say ""if only they had thought this in high school."" Well, they did at my school but kids at that age have other priorities. 

I'm aware there are countries where they do not teach economic concepts in school and I agree that needs to change. Everyone deserves the opportunity to learn about the economy. I would just say that, based on experience, kids will not really take advantage of this knowledge and a lot of kids will learn by experience (aka making financial mistakes) in the future."

I see articles like [this one](https://finance.zacks.com/difference-between-529-custodial-account-1404.html) that talk about benefits and drawbacks. I would think a custodial brokerage would only be effective for high risk trading when a 529 is not needed or “maxed out”."

2021-06-21 09:39:28,stocks,Its because school is supposed to teach out how to think and how to learn. Once you have proper critical thinking skills and the ability to source information when needed you don't need to be directly taught anything.

2021-06-21 15:46:54,stocks,"Yeah. I was in highschool in the mid-90s and we had a class on budgeting, balancing checkbooks, handling credit cards, writing a resume, doing taxes, etc. We went a few weeks planning mock families, where we had to find a job in the newspaper classified ads, write a fake resume, do a fake interview with the teacher, then once we had the job we had to find housing, put together a budget, and do taxes. It was all very basic and the whole thing only lasted a couple of weeks, but at least it gave people an idea of what living in ""the real world"" was like. 

And this was in a public school in rural Pennsylvania.

But still, some of my classmates would later post dumb shit on facebook saying ""why didn't they teach us any of this in school!"" and I'm like... they did. I was in your class!

 Facebook IPO'ed right around the time I graduated college around $20 and I told my dad to buy some because everyone used it (I knew next to nothing about stocks at that time). On a related note I told him to buy Facebook and also buy Tesla, because I'd done a couple college projects on the Tesla Roadster (This was before Model S was  released) and I was ultrabullish on Tesla EV, this was ~2011. 

FB immediately began falling post-IPO, and went south of $15 within a few weeks. Once it hit $14 or $13 I told my dad in no uncertain terms that every fucking person I knew (at the time) used the platform and to just buy this company because it wasn't about to disappear anytime soon. He didn't listen, in retrospect that'd have been an easy moon landing for him. 

To his credit he did buy tesla at $400 pre-split, I guess. But that FB buy could've been an easy 15-20x"

I've never had this myself, but whenever I hear about others who went to schools having paper trading of the stock market it always sound like a joke with how it turns out.

One of my friends who went to a school with this just invested all his paper money into two tech companies, whereas the rest of the class kept jumping in and out of stocks each week. The paper trading assignment was only 3 months long. The teacher was ticked off at my friend for just investing his money and doing nothing else in the paper trading, while everyone else poured a bunch more hours into it with constantly switching stocks. Then one of his companies announced a merger with another big tech company and sky rocketed in value, causing my friend to get the best ROI by a decent margin."

Otherwise we’re stuck in the world where only those who teach themselves make it.

2021-06-21 00:00:00,stocks,"GOEV (Canoo) - The misunderstood ticker and why you should watch it My personal view on this company

\- I have been invested in this company in some form since Oct 2020.

\- At first glance I hated the company because all I saw was the “ugly” lifestyle vehicle. But then I realized the real product is the skateboard platform which is independently drivable which means you just need to fit a body on top of it and it can be literally any car you want. They were the first to implement drive by wire which aids in the adaptability of the platform. (A certain other American EV company has plans of changing their model to this soon)

Investor Relations Day (6/17/21) main takeaway

\- VDL NEDCAR (Netherlands)

o Will start production in 2022 - 1000 units

\- Oklahoma plant

o Starts production in 2023 – 15,000 units

o 300 Mil tax incentives from the State of Oklahoma ( This is huge)

Speculation/rumors

\- New model this week

o Sport/crossover type model

\- Former CEO at Apple

o Many people speculate he’s over there to oversee the Apple top-hat that they will use on theCanoo platform. Apple is late to the EV game and wouldn’t be bringing competition to the table until 2024. It is speculated they will be using Canoo’s skateboard to cut down on the engineering.

Catalysts

Edit: Sorry for the format, I wrote it out on a word doc and all of the indenting was gone as soon as I posted.

Edit 2: I forgot to emphasize that Canoo owns 100% of the IP. So The founder/CEO being hired by Apple is not going to be a vulnerability."
2021-06-20 23:35:07,stocks,"The car looks awesome, the investor day was great, I can't wait for Canoos to be rolling around the street"
2021-06-21 00:27:52,stocks,"People still don't believe this is a real company. VDL Nedcar will be making the first vehicles in the Netherlands and shipping them to the US. In the meantime, Canoo is learning and emulating them to build their own manufacturing plant in OK. Once Operational, VDL will be focused on supplying Europe. It's looking like a great product and company."
2021-06-21 00:24:04,stocks,"For my job I listen to a lot of earnings calls. I suggest you do this for any stock you want to invest in

Canoo had the worst one I ever heard. 

First off, if you’re going to have a major change in the management of the company, the absolute worst place to do it is in the earnings call. If you’re going to throw your strategy in the trash can, the earnings call is also the worst place to do it. 

Feast your eyes and decide if this is the person/company you trust your money with:

""Today, we announced that Renato Giger, who I have worked with and known for many years, joined us as our Interim CFO.""

New CFO announced on the earnings call? WTF.

Craig Irwin (Analyst):
Okay. The second question there – there's a little bit of a contradiction in your prepared remarks. So Tony, you talked about how engineering IP broadens your TAM, but then you announced that you're deemphasizing your engineering services. Can you help us resolve that and maybe give us a little bit more color about why you would deemphasize engineering, given that the original story was – it would subsidize the development and broaden the partner opportunity with potentially multiple hats on their license.

Tony Aquila (Executive Chairman):
Yes. So look, I would say that from the comments perspective it was a contradiction, it hasn't been a contradiction from my statement. Look, as I said in the new marks we looked into this, it kind of goes to your first question too with the talent war and everything just the $25 million, it would yield us. We at the board really feel like the best thing to do is to accelerate our derivatives and focus our talent on creating IP for the company. You also have a lot of IP leakage when you do this work. And from my perspective, if I had been more involved earlier certainly, I certainly once I started – I invested and then I took the chairmanship, we started the analysis. I had concerns about this. If you study all OEMs, you can find a partnership or something like that if it makes sense. And we'll continue to look for things, but to be a contract engineering house is just really not going to drive the best shareholder value.

WTF!!!!!

Craig Irwin
Okay. And then, this is a tough question, but all the institutions are going to ask this question tomorrow, right? So first Alex Marcinkowski is gone now Paul Balciunas. These are the two gentlemen that sold the pipe. A lot of people met with them and Ulrich for your de-SPAC process. That's a fairly heavy turnover and we didn't have Ulrich on the call today, which appears like I'm missing. Can you maybe talk about the high turnover and what's going on here; and is Ulrich still Chief Executive Officer?

Tony Aquila
Yes. So look as we've kind of been navigating through going public. We're obviously bringing in people with extreme public company experience. We're making the call today from Dallas, Texas; not in California, due to the California still in a bit of a lockdown, and Texas being wide open. So yes Ulrich is still currently the CEO of the company, and as far as with respect to your comment about turnover, its true there's been some turnover in these positions, but we've been bringing in people that one and they have worked together as I mentioned in my comments, and this will stabilize. I think a lot of SPACs and a lot of companies as they go through this migration will be bringing in people with experience in the public markets. So, I just think we're a bit ahead of it and we'll stay ahead of it, and as we navigate this step-by-step quarter-by-quarter.

Craig Irwin
Last question, if I may. You're obviously deemphasizing engineering and engineering services. So that seems to imply that the original SPAC model is no longer guidance going forward. Is that accurate?

Tony Aquila
We'll be giving – we're not going to give – at this point that doesn't make sense to give guidance until we complete the work that we have started. And with all that's gone on in the SPAC world, in the pre-revenue side, we want to be very conservative. If you look back at the history of the team that is now more and more coming into play, they've been – they never missed consensus. And so doing this at a high public company standard, I think is important for all SPACs, and certainly we're going to do our best to lead the way here. And so we will be step-by-step building this and we will be delivering information as it is. It is known and contracted, not based on light rev – reservation models. I think that's dangerous. I think it could be somewhat misleading.

And so typical of any leadership change at different standard comes in and will guide you through that. Kamal, we'll be following up with you on a regular basis. Certainly do acknowledge your point; Craig that you got so to speak, as you mentioned showed a different model, but this model is better from a return on capital basis. And I think as you work through it, you'll like it, especially the areas and the margins of the areas we plan to operate under. So let's kind of table that and discuss through it.

Craig Irwin
So I will acknowledge that these are significant surprises on the call today, and that's not ideal after a SPAC IPO process. So, I just wanted to underline that? Thank you.

Tony Aquila
Totally understand your understand your perspective; obviously I wasn't here when they did the original model, but certainly wanted to get ahead of this and explain to you how this really is going to work and how to build a profitable company, which we've done in the past. And we intend to do here, but hey, we understand the situation it puts you in and we work closely to rectify that. So you can understand very clearly where we're going. And I think once you do, you will understand why we made these changes.

WTF!!!

This earnings call was an unmitigated disaster and honestly its a miracle the stock hasn't burned a hole in the earth by now."

Anyway that alone is big, Apple has wanted Canoo before, so we know they are legit and have something very special. 

The question is what is Apple trying to pull hiring the founder and what does that mean for Canoo? 

Obviously worse case scenario is the founder is just going to hand everything to Apple, is that illegal, well YES, can he technically do that and get away with it through some legal loophole? 

I don't know but why else would Apple want him?"

FAQ

What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

• ⁠Rudeness towards other Redditors, 

• ⁠Spreading incorrect information, 

• ⁠Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.

Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right."
2021-06-21 00:37:26,stocks,I look at the charts myself brother! TradingView is a great free resource. You just click the ticker in and you can see the entire history of it!  I hope that answers your question.

2021-06-21 00:00:00,stocks,"Difference between limit order and stop order From what I understand, the variables stated in a limit order will be sold at that price, whereas in a stop order, there is a trigger price that will sell at a market price?

Isn't a limit order technically a market price at the right timing? I do not know if I understand the difference between a limit order and stop order because I see only a slight difference."
2021-06-20 22:24:19,stocks,Limit is you set the price. You will get that price if you find a buyer/seller. The stop order turns into a market order once it's triggered. Usually a stop loss order. Once the price falls below the stop your order turns into a market order to get rid of it asap.
2021-06-21 00:51:54,stocks,"They are for completely opposite strategies. Let's focus on sell because it gets complicated without focusing on one transaction.

Limit sell order @ $20. You don't want to sell at anything less than $20. If someone is willing to buy at $20 and no-one is selling for less, you get filled.

Stop sell order @$10. This is used when the price is above $10. If it falls to $10, the order becomes live. It's a way to prevent yourself from unnoticed downturns, but it's more useful for short term traders like day traders. Then it can be a market order (sell at best price available once it goes below $10) or limit (sell above $9 for example if it gets below $10). 

Buy is the same but opposite. Limit is buy maximum at x, limit is if it goes above x, buy. Limit buy is less used but some people do use it because they want to buy if it recovers past a certain resistance point or something."
2021-06-20 22:24:43,stocks,"A limit prevents you from getting executed at anything worse than your limit.  A market order exposes you to a random fill based on market depth and the bid/ask.  A stop order can have a stop limit, which you should strongly consider.  A stop market order exposes you to a lot of risk.  A stop limit triggers an order, but prevents you from a fill below your limit.  The biggest risk is then not getting filled bc the stock drops below your limit.  That’s in turn why people use stock market order - it “gets you out at any price”"
2021-06-20 23:39:32,stocks,"If you place a limit order can it be filled at anytime? Meaning, if it doesn’t go near your selected number that day, does it expire."
2021-06-21 04:28:26,stocks,When is a market order beneficial if they are always so high risk?
2021-06-21 00:02:54,stocks,"My brokerage lets you set limit orders for that day or 60 days. You can edit it anytime before it expires, too."
2021-06-21 11:24:39,stocks,On Interactive Brokers you can set it as a day limit (it must be over/under the limit within the day) or GTC order (it is valid until canceled or until the end of the year).
2021-06-21 08:12:03,stocks,"To me, market orders make the most sense to execute orders when you have little capital to work with or if the price of stock is relatively stable so you don't occur any losses while waiting for order to be filled."
2021-06-21 09:05:43,stocks,"Sometimes you want to make absolutely certain you can get out of a position.  If you set a limit you run the risk of not having your order filled (like if the price is dropping quickly).  Market means it will (usually) get filled but might not be the best price.

This is helpful for example when it's 3:59PM with only seconds left on the clock and you want to make absolutely certain that your sell order goes through."
2021-06-21 15:08:37,stocks,"They make more sense in lower volume stocks where even if you're at a limit price you aren't going to necessarily get execution. The current stock I'm trading is like that and it's mildly annoying to do limit orders on so I'll sometimes give up and do market (usually ends up being like a fraction of a penny above or below the limit anyways, probably why it doesn't trigger). They also work if there's high volatility and you need an order now instead of worrying about a particular price if a stock drops like 10% or some such in the morning and you expect a rapid rebound. I've seen that happen quite a few times. Otherwise if the price is relatively stable as the other guy said and you don't give a crap about the 2 bucks or whatever you're technically getting conned out of and just want to be lazy. Or if it's tanking and you want to get out ASAP, which is how stop loss orders work"
2021-06-21 00:07:11,stocks,"Go it, thanks. I’ll check with mine on it."
2021-06-21 12:12:30,stocks,Ah makes sense. Needing to get out before close is really the only example I can understand. Thanks for the response.
2021-06-21 00:00:00,stocks,"Who Square's has such a high cost of revenue? Why\*

I do hold Square's shares, great performer, but I am getting worried by their high Cost of Revenue. The company has great P/S ratio, bad P/E, but I don't mind when the company is growing and spends a lot in R&D + Marketing making the ""E"" smaller.

However, the cost of revenue of Square seems very high for an internet company. Also, it is trending higher and higher. In 2020, they made 13.17B of revenue (very good), but 10B of cost of revenue (ouch).

Gross profit margin:

2018: 40%

2019: 40%

2020: 28.7%

Q1 2021: 19%

Like the more revenue the company is making, the more expensive gets the Cost of revenue? It is the opposite of economy of scale. It leaves way less money to spend in R&D, marketing, or just the cash on hand. With the current price, it is like if investors believe that the revenues will hit 40/50B in few years. I believe that it can happen, but rather in over 10 years...

Because of that, I feel that the company is becoming grossly overvalued, and I plan to sell my shares in a near future. The earning potential seems reduced + Covid accelerator is done. The growth in 2022 will be less in my opinion."
2021-06-20 23:29:44,stocks,"My guess is this is from the growth in bitcoin sales. They count the full price of a bitcoin sale as revenue and the cost of the bitcoin they sold as an expense. The margin of their bitcoin sales is low, I believe under 2%."
2021-06-20 22:11:34,stocks,"You can thank the credit card industry - a lot of top line interchange revenue goes to the processors, etc. Same issue Marqeta has."
2021-06-20 23:51:45,stocks,"Its the bitcoin revenue. They have to include bitcoin in revenue and it costs almost as much so lowers their gross profit %

https://hypercharts.co/sq

Look at the revenue segments chart you will see Bitcoin has become biggest segment. And they make basically no money on bitcoin. Therefore it reduces overall gross margin %


So if you want to make some analysis, I would suggest exclude bitcoin revenue from overall revenue and exclude bitcoin cost and recalculate gross margins or other metrics"

Amendment: day chart looks tottering on a pullback. But it's testing it's resistance, it pulled off the trend line on higher volume. So I believe it'll rest the $157 price before possibly entering bear country."

Because it's bullish in a downturn market, I think it'll hang on. But not break the ceiling.

Should check back on it for when market sentiment becomes bullish in a week (if that?). As market sentiment stops selling off it's likely then this stock can break through.

An earlier breakthrough is just unlikely. But you won't regret buying in and waiting. Unless trend starts to reverse for extraneous reasons in which case you'll see it hit overbought on small upward price changes as MACD falls."

In my opinion, the most important is net income because that is reality of the business. Gross profit is good but usually does not mean anything because it is significantly lower after overhead is paid such as wages and rent (net income).

Revenue is irrelevant to me. It’s the sexy number but anyone with real understanding of business know that this is not good to base success on, unless you are Walmart where you make 2% net income but on half a trillion in sales. 

1. Net income
2. Profit
3. Revenue"

2021-06-21 05:53:57,stocks,"Net income and it’s not particularly close. You can grow revenue all you want but if your business isn’t profitable and your business model doesn’t scale it doesn’t matter. On the other side, even  if revenue decreases, you can still corner the market, cut costs, increase margins, and print money."
2021-06-21 09:39:39,stocks,"All three have significance for different exercises. Net income is subject to a lot of accounting decisions, which can be used to inflate net income (by either pushing expenses to future periods, bringing revenues forward). Revenues on the other hand are less subject to manipulation, which doesn't mean they can't be manipulated. Furthermore, an income statement always starts from sales/revenues and flows down to net income, so revenues are also important.

Gross profit is useful for companies producing physical products as it can be used as an indicator for the profit margins of products, whether they are improving or not, whether a company is doing a good job with limiting expenses or the efficiency of production."

2021-06-21 06:40:14,stocks,"In seriousness, they’re all important. 

If top line is shrinking, you can manage costs to a limited extent to protect earnings. But all cash flow and earnings ultimately come from revenue. 

If your margins are structurally shit, you’ll never have a good business. 

Earnings are what I always look at first if it’s an established business, that’s what you’re buying after all. 

In a growth business, what counts is revenue growth and margin on that incremental revenue. It’s okay if they have poor margins due to lack of scale but if they’re always going to have poor margins, it’s a shit business you don’t want to be in. 

In an established business, earnings and earnings growth is what you want.

Cash flow in all businesses. You want to know they have enough cash on hand that they’re not going to need to ask for additional investment, at a minimum. Dilution is your enemy."

If you look at the daily charts, it's using some number of minutes, weekly charts, a higher number, yearly charts probably use weeks, and 5y chart probably uses months, it's all based on your interval settings. 

RSI just shows if a stock comparatively overbought or oversold, so if you're looking at a long term time frame it's still telling you if it's comparatively overbought or oversold over that time frame. This can be useful because on shorter time frames RSI can more often go over 70 or under 30, but it's more rare to happen over longer time frames. So in your example, if you're looking at a daily chart, it's oversold compared to other days, but not oversold or  overbought compared to other years."

tips:
- if you dont like insomnia, do your DD in your investments and dont trust all financial youtube channels, most of them are just there to pump content 
- learn how to do CC’s and CSP’s, and the wheel strategy but prepare to invest atleast 2-5hrs to digest the strat. recommend watching InTheMoney channel he does a great job at explaining
- track your investments’ reports and related news. as an investor you should want to know what the company is doing and their forecasts for the quarter, year decade etc.
- if you want to dip your fit in the market, recommend starting with index funds like VOO VTI SPY DJI QQQ. indices are relatively safe but the disadvantage is you wont see as dramatic gains but advantage is dips are not as dramatic."

2021-06-21 09:27:21,stocks,"Just my experience - YMMV - If it’s to be done, get it done as quickly as possible. You’ll burn through two resources in a divorce:  time and money.  You can replace money a lot easier. So if you have to pay more (give up more by fighting over thing less), it’s worth it in the long run. Maybe we’ll add another resource - your mental and emotional well being. Yes, it sucks to lose a lot of money in the divorce and it sucks to pay a huge amount in alimony and child support, but my ex and I weren’t on the same page financially so my stress level still reduced significantly after the divorce. Instead of having random charges popping up all the time because “It was on sale!” I had a planned expense going out the door every month and I could prepare for it more and have a strategy that I could stick to and I could save more."

1. $3m is still, very much, middle class. I am not rich.
2. I hate car salespeople. Call it a moral issue. Ill pay engineers and factory workers, but I despise dealerships.
3. I dont waste money on depreciating assets because I am not an imbecile.
4. The car I was looking for was a temp. I only need it for a few years. Not worth wasting money on. Next year I will be buying a paid of electric F150s.

2021-06-21 15:20:04,stocks,"Look man you need to account for the person. End of the day, that is the most important factor. Some people are good at certain things.

* $3m is no different than $50k. Both are paltry sums when talking stock market trades. $3m has practically no impact on any company and frankly, even $20m would have minimal impact... well except penny stocks but I dont touch them. In other words, anything you can do with $50k you can do with $20m. It just depends on strategy.
* You've seen my post history, so you know what my strategy is. The way I do it, it makes no difference how much money you have because 50% is concentrated in just 2-4 stocks. This is how I have been able to scale.
* I always improve myself. Literally, whenever I have time, I learn a new skill. I love doing it and have always been that way. For example, since April, Ive been teaching myself day trading. I started using it last Friday with $25k to meet day trading reqs. I made $2200 on Fri, $980 today. I am not sure if I will continue with it but I am trying to illustrate a point. Some people are just really good at certain things.

BTW I absolutely am not advocating day trading. If anything I would dissuade people from doing it. Reason I am learning it is to fine tune my hedging strategy and I plan to deploy it in very specific scenarios so dont take my gains above as some sort of indicator. I dont. But what I want to be able to more accurately hit crash bottoms. But otherwise, I really dont recommend it."
2021-06-21 15:26:45,stocks,"No one cares about any of the above. All I’m trying to do is dissuade people from reading your lies and then expect that they can achieve a 30% CAGR over 10 years.

2021-06-21 00:00:00,stocks,"Should investors outside the US be concerned about the depreciation of the dollar? I don’t see this talked much about. If an international investor is buying US equities in dollars, they are paying in their own currency which is converted to dollars. 
Since the US dollar is the global reserve currency, we obviously had a lot of printing in 2020. 25% of all US dollar in existence was printed last year. Expectedly, this leads to inflation. Whether is temporary or not remains to be seen but it would not be surprising to see a less valuable dollar. 

Wouldn’t this also mean a smaller ROI for US stocks? For example, you may make a 10% gain on Apple and gain $13 per share. However, if the pound (£) is now 10% stronger against USD, when your USD is converted back to £, you may not even end up making a profit. 
It seems this is likely to happen with the inflation numbers coming out. E.g UK YoY inflation was 2.1%, US was 5%.

How do you account for this, if at all, when investing for the long term? I guess you could stick to investing in companies in your own country but the growth is likely not there compared to the US. It becomes a game of balancing the numbers in to see if you end up losing money in a bullish market."
2021-06-20 21:22:45,stocks,You can hedge with PUTS on UUP if you are very concerned. USD good is a safe haven if things turn turtle so generally not a major issue.

It's only more expensive if you actually miss the buy back.

Instead put reasonable limits.

Watch market sentiment. Buy back after bear sentiment starts to weaken.

You don't need to time it perfectly. Just time it better than had you not timed it at all. 

Im pouring over my MSFT evaluation right now. It's right on the edge of stopping at a resistance. About $259.

2021-06-21 16:08:05,stocks,"As another person has already said, if you’re new, stick to ETFs and index funds. However, if you really want to pick your own stocks, most experts would probably recommend sticking to long-established stable companies. Some you might consider (after doing your own research of course) could be:

1) The “FAANG” companies for tech: Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Alphabet (formerly Google). If you want another tech stock that’s stable and reliable, try Microsoft.

2) Berkshire Hathaway B stock (their A stock is worth over $400k per share at this time) and/or JP Morgan Chase for financial companies.

3) Coca-Cola or Starbucks for food/restaurant stocks.

4) Johnson and Johnson and/or Pfizer for health care.

5) 3M for industrials. I would’ve recommended Boeing as well, but their recent issues have made them not as appealing.

6) Proctor and Gamble or Kimberly-Clark for consumer products.

The reason you want to choose long-standing stable companies is to minimize the amount of risk your portfolio is exposed to while you’re still familiarizing yourself with how investing in the stock market works. As you learn more over time, you can adjust your portfolio to better suit your own investing needs/goals.

Always remember to do your own research first before deciding to buy a stock. Suggestions you receive online should never be treated as financial advice."

Years ago I would have said AAPL.  They have a strong following and people like the company, but they haven’t been innovating much.  Yes, they are developing new chips but so are AMD and NVDA.  There doesn’t seem to be a whole lot of innovation going on.  It’s like Tim Cook is just riding the legacy.

AMD is probably a good choice.  NVDA has been going up like crazy and is about to split, so you may be getting in a little late.  I think the stock price may come back down post split when people take their gains and run.

You can always play it safe for modest gains with SPY and BRKB.

Lots of good choices out there.  Determine your risk tolerance and find some companies that you believe in.  Good luck!"

Rite Aid stock (RAD) has all the ingredients for a GME style runner. I applaud all the memes and the attention it's brought to concept of Naked Shorting. A few of us Rite Aide investors have been fighting this good fight for over 3yrs now. All  without a lot attention. RAD has $24 Billion in revenue to AMC's $450 million. What AMC makes in year. RAD can make in Free Cash Flow. AMC shows 21% of shares shorted. I know it's likely over 50% now with Naked shares. RAD shows 15% of shares shorted, but we RAD investors know it's likely higher with Naked shares. Now my whole point to this comparison is the shares outstanding of each company. RAD has only 55 million shares outstanding. AMC has over 500 million shares outstanding. Your squeeze factor and true investment value with RAD is times 1000% greater. I say this because it's no way Shorts can cover RAD if it ever became a meme stock. The key my thesis is the Institutional ownership. RAD has Institutional ownership of 60%. They know RAD true value is already closer to $100, than to the $20 it's presently trading at. They won't be selling anytime soon. RAD's present Retail owners know RAD's value is closer to $100 also. Shorts are trapped in RAD just the same. Yes this same Naked Shorting that has plagued the Market and taken advantage of Retail stock owners everywhere! All these Hedge Funds have thought of Retail investors as easy prey. Easily scared out of a stock by their Shorting. So they can in turn cover on the cheap. RAD Shorts will be thinking twice as to how they unwind their short positions. As to not bring attention to how badly they are trapped in RAD. RAD at this stage is probably one of the best buying opportunities I have seen in 20yrs. I wish you all luck and blessings for success that you can have."

2021-06-21 00:00:00,stocks,"US Innovation and Competition Act - which semis will receive funds? Which semiconductor companies will be most likely to receive funds after the bill is signed into law? Here are my thoughts and assumptions. Please correct any mistakes. Disclaimer: I own positions in Intel, Micron, and Applied Materials.

My understanding is that the bill is largely meant to support and consolidate semiconductor manufacturing and semi cap manufacturing in the U.S. Thus, U.S.-based companies with facilities in the U.S. that want to develop their semiconductor manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. will be the most likely to receive funding from this law as well as future support from the U.S. government which is aligned with rare bipartisanship to address and neutralize the threat of China’s growing global technological dominance. Those companies will have a competitive advantage in the marketplace after receiving these funds, regardless of other fundamental or technical factors.

However, the funds will come in the form of grants and tax credits. My understanding, and here's where I'm making big assumptions, is that companies must apply to receive the funds and that this is an involved and competitive process. The law won’t be signed until toward the end of this year at the earliest. Then companies will apply for grants to fund projects to build fabs, improve supply chains, etc.

INTC and MU seem like clear favorites to receive funds because they’re U.S.-based IDMs with facilities primarily in the U.S., and they’re often included in news stories related to the bill. TSM and Samsung are outside the U.S., though that doesn’t mean they couldn’t hypothetically receive funds to build a fab in the U.S. But if grants are competitive, then how likely would TSM or Samsung be to receive funds to build a new fab if they were competing with Intel or MU for the same funding, based purely on the intent of the law being to support U.S.-based semiconductor business?

AMAT also seems like a favorite to receive funds even though ASML has a monopoly on the most advanced semi cap equipment. ASML is based in the Netherlands and only has two facilities in the U.S. Also, I speculate that AMAT could use funds from the law to put toward R&D to compete with ASML, but my knowledge in that area is lacking.

It won’t be until next year before companies can even start applying for funds. There probably won’t be any winners for projects until at least a year from now.

Catalysts:

* Bill gets signed by the end of this year.
* Companies submit applications for projects and winners are announced.
* Winners start receiving funds and investing them in projects.

This isn't advice. I'm not a financial advisor."
2021-06-20 22:56:23,stocks,"Yup, except the nevada plant hasnt received funding since it was pledged by Trump and were now under a Trump derangement syndrome Biden administration which, again, has a derangement towards anything Trump put forward. So excuse me for my pessimism, but I doubt the Biden admin will fulfill Trump promises.

You can kiss the AZ plant goodbye as all the tax cuts and benefits Trump promised are in the wind with Biden in office. Politics aside, he definitely does not have an America first policy as Trump had. So I'm not betting on the plant coming to fruition.

So the Taiwanese chip plant will likely bloat to unbecoming levels as Germany, the EU, and US all beg taiwan to prioritize contracts with their nation, meanwhile Taiwan grows weary of demands for loyalty and instead just prefers to go with the best customer - Huawei, but for political reasons were cut off thanks to Trumps China competition policy.

It started by splitting out Ferrari from Fiat(at the time, now STLA), and increasing the range of cars they sell, which has also been going well. They now have a bigger range of non exclusive cars than ever before iirc. They also still make very high end limited supercars too, which are often class leading. High end luxury stocks have done very well in the last few years, the rich have gotten richer, and everyone wants a Ferrari.

I think it will continue to grow, they've got a hybrid car already out, and an electric car coming. That and an SUV, which will bring in mega money, albeit diluting the brand a bit. They also put their engines in Alfa Romeo cars and Maserati's, so that's a source a revenue too.

The only “must be an experienced Ferrari owner” is for getting the opportunity to buy limited edition models like LaFerrari ($1.5mm msrp) where only 700 were produced over a 4 year period. There is such existing demand for Ferrari’s hyper cars (like LaFerrari or the FXX) that even with the restriction of “only existing Ferrari owners”, there is still a lottery to get the chance to buy one. For context of demand you can look at the secondary market, the last LaFerrari ever made (in 2020) was sold at auction for $10mm."

The last LaFerrari (made in 2020) immediately auctioned off for $10mm.

Let's assume that one did pass the process, buying even a 2010+ Ferrari is still super expensive. No 20$/h job will be able to pay that. Unless one lives with parents and all other expenses are paid so the paychecks go entirely to pay the Rarri."
2021-06-20 22:00:46,stocks,"> Make sense now?

Considering I just explained how it works to you, maybe you should sit back down there champ. 

Ferrari produces 10,000 cars a year. Any cunt with a meme stock like yourself can walk into a dealership and buy 9,900 of them. The 100 LaFerraris (their hypercar) they made per year were in such high demand they could restrict who can buy them to purists and even then demand was overbought by a massive amount. That’s pretty normal for buying a hypercar but get this, 97% of Ferrari’s business is their mass manufactured auto business. They’re not a hyper car manufacturer, they do it every few years as a statement and ego piece (the FXX, Enzo, F50, and F40, are all examples of this). 

So someone stating “you can’t buy a ferrari unless you go out and buy a preowned one” is really just showing off how fucking stupid someone is.  Don’t be that guy. You’re not that guy pal."

2021-06-21 00:00:00,stocks,"Russian companies, risks vs usefulness as dollar hedge 

Good morning everyone, this is my first post  on the sub so i hope someone else finds this valuable. 

During March of 2020 I moved about 1/5 of my portfolio into Lukoil, Sberbank, Norilsk Nickle, and Gazprom. I was generally worried about the response to COVID destroying the USD and wanted to diversify away from US equities. I was looking for “hated assets” and these companies had rock bottom valuations, low debt, strong dividends, and plenty of positive tailwind (possible exception of Lukoil long term) 

Today, these companies trade far above the valuations I bought them at and my worry is that the flood of liquidity in the west has increased the correlation between these Russian companies and the U.S stock market. 

Does anyone else have any thoughts on this? Particularly how these companies would do in the event of high U.S inflation and an environment of raising rates? 

I am aware of the “Russia bad, Putin will steal all your money” narrative people like to push but are their any other risks Im not thinking of investing here? Currency, commodities crash, etc? 

Thank you for reading my post, looking forward to reading some other opinions.

2021-06-21 06:21:31,stocks,"I've been a Boeing investor many times over the years.  I don't have a position currently, even though I could easily see it surging higher as production and travel returns to normal.  

I weighed pros and cons, but for me the tie breaker is that the risk profile has dramatically changed, in a few very key ways:  

* we now know that executive and managerial decision-making inside Boeing wasn't just inept, it may have been grossly immoral and possibly criminal, and I'm not aware of any concrete measures that have been taken to even acknowledge that, let alone fix it.  Presumably the same old depraved philosophies will live to see another day.
* the revised airplane still has the fundamental (and potentially fatal) shape and balance problems as before, it's just been kludged with multiple workarounds instead of one workaround.  That's not confidence-inspiring.  The whole reason for trying to software-rig an unstable plane into production was mainly to cut the time to market.  But since that clearly didn't work, the now-multiple years that have elapsed could have allowed for a redesign to a more naturally stable airframe configuration.  It would require someone in Boeing to finally admit the unstable kludge machine is a bad idea, and isn't that forgiving.
* Prior worries about having to train pilots can now be seen in proper perspective: it was always just a drop in the ocean compared to losing your whole sales for years and years, or killing people at an unacceptable rate of 2 plane loads full in the first few months.  Training is actually a good thing, and the cost should be seen as a small but necessary part of safe aviation, not as some demon to be avoided by any means possible.
* Boeing has burned all their chances.  There is zero grace, and with good reason.  That means that for the foreseeable future, at least a decade, the next time, and any time, there's any public incident of any kind involving a Boeing product, the market could shoot the stock down first, and ask questions later.  The days of automatically dismissing any Boeing fault instantly on first report of an incident are gone.  It has flipped to where they will be presumed guilty until proven innocent.

Again, I don't know what will happen with them, but the likely trajectory is up.  They still have brilliant people and duopoly products with 10 year order backlog.  But it's folly to give them the same respect as one would have 4 years ago.  

Back then, if there was a Boeing crash, I knew my shares would be safe for awhile, as facts were gathered and assessed.  That shock absorbing buffer is gone.  And when a company has lost significant attributes like that, we can't pay as much for it as before.

Back then, I didn't know that executives and management were inept and unethical.  One might have guessed, or assumed, but now we know.  And just like shopping for any item, as we discover and verify certain latent problems, whether it's signs of termite damage or debris in the oil pan, the more bad facts we confirm, the lower the bid price should be."

I don't disagree with you, but I think your comment misses the previous post's point. Their point is that a significant part of Boeing's longer term business model relies on sales in Chinese markets. So the pertinent question is not whether I, a westerner, would chose to fly COMAC, but whether a Chinese passengers will fly COMAC.

Boeing wont go bankrupt because of COMAC, but Boeing sales in China impact their bottom line and thus their stock price. Fewer sales in China than expected will negatively impact their stock price."

Thank you for bringing up one of our society's newest and biggest problems.

The idea that a corporation such as Boeing is so ""systemically important"" that it is somehow ""too big to fail"" was birthed in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crash.

Don't get me wrong: I am not necessarily opposed to saving someone (whether a corporation or a small business or a household or an individual) that is in dire straits due to no fault of their own, but Boeing brought the problems associated with the 737 MAX upon itself. If the company failed, that's because the market is holding Boeing accountable for its negligence and its arrogance . . . if the company isn't held accountable in more than a trivial manner, then what's to stop management from pulling more shenanigans like the 737 MAX in the future?"

2021-06-20 21:38:26,stocks,">Exactly. This was all just racist propaganda in the wake of boeings fuck ups that tried to pass the blame off onto foreign pilots.

Unfortunately, ET302 was only the first in a string of recent mistreatment of the Ethiopians, including Trump's bullsh-t about the Egyptians blowing up the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam and Biden's attempt (and subsequent failure due to opposition from China and Russia) to impose sanctions on Ethiopia and somehow resurrect that country's former ruling party and return it to power against the will of the majority of Ethiopians.

I realize this is OT with regard to the thread's main topic, but the U.S. really needs to show more respect for its allies and to quit carousing with those who would turn around and stab the U.S. in the back at a moment's notice.

That said . . .

Here are two articles to think about with regards to Boeing, Ethiopia, and the 737 MAX operating as ET 302 that crashed outside of Addis Ababa in 2019.

[Lawyers advise Ethiopian Airlines against ‘financially disastrous’ settlement offer by Boeing over 737 MAX crash](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/lawyers-advise-ethiopian-airlines-against-financially-disastrous-settlement-offer-by-boeing-over-737-max-crash/) (The Seattle Times, January 21, 2021)

[Boeing Company Delegation, Commission Discuss Investment Opportunities In Ethiopia](https://www.fanabc.com/english/boeing-company-delegation-commission-discuss-investment-opportunities-in-ethiopia/) (FANA, June 7, 2021)

I have been following the news about Ethiopia both here in the West and in local and regional sources. The majority of the population got fed up with the ruling party and replaced them with a new Prime Minister who's very much pro-market. That's why you may have occasionally heard about the new telco licenses for the Ethiopian market, one of which was granted, as well as the ongoing partial (40%) privatization of Ethio Telecom, the state-run telecommunications monopoly.

Anyways, to go back to those links, ordinarily, it makes no sense for Ethiopian Airlines (and by extension, the carrier's owner, the Ethiopian Government) to let Boeing get away with a light settlement . . . until you read the FANA news report from Addis Ababa about a delegation of Boeing executives meeting with agents of the Ethiopian government to discuss ""investment opportunities in Ethiopia.""

Bottom line: I think that the Ethiopian government has extracted something else from Boeing in the wake of the 2019 737 MAX crash, something that is worth far more than cash and that may be a win-win for both sides . . . especially with the country's opening up, the push for regional integration and harmonization of laws and processes with international standards, and Ethiopia's strategic position in the Horn of Africa with regards to logistics. (Part of the agreement with Eritrea is for the Ethiopians to regain access to the Red Sea at Massawa; in the last two years, the Ethiopians secured an agreement with the French government to begin re-establishing naval forces that were disbanded after Eritrea gained independence.) As the Ethiopians move forward, this may yield advantages and opportunities for Boeing, since Ethiopia will inevitably become a ""gateway"" or a ""hub"" for access to Africa, much like it was in ancient times."

> then what's to stop management from pulling more shenanigans like the 737 MAX in the future?

Ideally strong regulation. Aviation regulations are written in blood. The FAA needs to get serious and stop letting companies do whatever they want. There need to be serious consequences for not prioritizing safety and punishments for executives. Fines are just a cost of doing business."

Just look at the NASA HLS competition.

Boeing was disqualified in round 1 due to a terrible, overpriced unrelaisitc bid.

Because of this, congress was no longer interested and massively reduced the budget for the Programm.

Then, NASA chose SpaceX in round 2 as the sole provider, since they where the Best option, and also the cheapest, and there wasn't any budget for an other provider. Congress expected the whole thing to be cancelled, or that the National team (Blue Origin, Lockheed, Northrop) wins at least something.

After that didn't happen, legislation was introduced, saying NASA had to chose a second contractor within 30 days. Due to the short time frame, this essentially was a single source contract to the national team

The same will happen with boeing."

Basically, any time you’re holding an “open” order for an option, you are responsible for it and are at risk of assignment. The only action you can take to guarantee that you won’t be assigned is to “close” the trade by doing the opposite of what you did when you opened the trade on the option (e.g. if you sold an option to open, you can buy it back to close it). So who’s responsible for fulfilling an exercised option? Well, if you have one open at expiration that’s in the money, the answer is “you are.”

Whether or not it’s more beneficial for you to close the trade is a more complicated topic that I won’t discuss here, but I hope this answers your question."

2021-06-21 09:11:34,stocks,"It’s an OTC stock. It’s an American company - they do business in Cali only. I’m not entirely clear how it works but the OTC “F-class” shares are basically surrogates for a ticker on the Canadian Stock Exhchange. This is a loophole to allow them to list somewhere since they can’t exist on the big US exchanges. Yet.
But this is why US companies are such a great opportunity. As soon as these stocks uplist there’s going to be a huge influx of institutional investors. There’s rumors that the stocks might soon uplist from the CSE to the Toronto stock exchange which would make these shares available to a shit ton more people."

But to answer what you’re missing,
a companies “price” is not their share price. A companies “price” is their total value (market cap). And you absolutely need to know what actual price you are getting. And the share price alone does NOT tell you this.

For example,
$WMT share price is $135. Which means they have a total market cap of $378 billion. But this is a CHEAP stock. B/c you are getting a company that did $528 billion in revenue for $378 billion.

Whereas, $PLTR is only $25. Which means their market cap is $40 billion. But this is an incredibly EXPENSIVE stock. Because you are buying a company worth 40 billion that only did *1* billion in revenue in 2020.

Now cheap vs expensive alone does not tell you if it is a good or bad investment (I own both btw). But an investor needs to know WHY a company is “cheap” or “expensive”. Pretending the market cap doesn’t matter is literally nonsensical."

Same goes for foreign stocks.

The goal of international diversification is not to gain exposure to foreign economy, it's to gain exposure to foreign stocks. Again, this hypothetical company traded on a European stock exchange can sell their product in Europe, or  in America, or in a parallel universe. European economy has nothing to do with it. European economy might be tanking, and this stock can still make a killing by selling elsewhere.

Not sure I understand you correctly, but a higher volatility would demand a higher *average return* to command the same *expected return*, if by average return you mean like 10% one year, 15% one year means 12.5% average return. 

When you're buying two different ETF's you will have a lower volatility, and also a *lower* average return, but still the same expected return, does that make sense?

>I guess it also depends on how you define volatility since I've used a fixed percentage when a more realistic scenario might be a geometric distribution.

No, you work with volatilites as fixed percentages usually. Stocks are typically modelled with Geometric Brownian Motion https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion"

If you own Tesla, then you have no exposure to Chinese stocks. Think about this one real hard, maybe you'll start to get it.

You're just confusing two different things: companies doing business in different markets vs owning stocks from different markets. International exposure in the context of portfolio management refers to exposure to foreign equity.

2021-06-21 16:40:48,stocks,"> I think I understand, this may just be a definition issue. So the expected return already incorporates volatility in the way I've described?

Yes.

>If you amend my previous statement with average return would it then be correct that a higher volatility ETF with the same average return would have a lower expected return?

Yes

>If that is the case wouldn't it still be better to buy two ETFs with identical expected return since it would further smooth the volatility to sqrt(2) of each ETFs volatility and therefore give a higher expected return than either ETF individually?

First of all, it would only be sqrt(2)*sigma if the ETF were completely uncorrelated (very unlikely), you have to account for correlation. But even if we assume they are the answer to the question is no, you're saying that decreasing the volatility automatically increases the expected return, this simply isn't the case. Like I said before, what will happen is that both your volatility and *average return* is lower than before, and these effects will simply counteract each other and give you the same expected return.

Also just think about a practical example of why this must be the case: You have 10 dollars which you use to buy 5 dollars of ETF A and 5 dollars of ETF B. You have two brother who each have 5 dollars, and they decide to yolo it all into one of the ETF's, one brother picks A and the other B. After 10 years you compare your  profit with the combined profit of your brother (they put their cash/profits together). Will you have made more money? Obviously not, right."

Do you have the same reaction to seeing a list of stocks to look into here on reddit? If Seeking Alpha suggests looking into P&G, is that a complete waste of time?

I’m literally suggesting something that gives you more personalized potential stocks to look into as opposed to just going through a random list of stocks or organically thinking of it. It’s not a substitute for DD or research. If you’re a vanilla ass dude where the biggest decision you make is buying fucking soap at home, ya, probably not that useful for you. But maybe you’re an BP oil exec and had to buy millions of dollars worth of Dawn on behalf of BP for cleaning up animals after an oil spill, so as a big buyer you’ve got insight into the ecological benefits of Dawn or the advantage they have in mass production or something? I dunno, FFS you guys are fucking pedantic.

I had my company in mind for this stuff, so I happen to use a lot of services over the years and if it’s something I’m buying for my company I generally have particular insight into how that company works and the problem they’re solving. Like picking HubSpot vs Salesforce is a big decision for a company, so the same decision making that goes into that goes into selecting stocks. 

I thought this would be particularly helpful for OTC stocks you won’t hear about often and aren’t top of mind for me to randomly look up."

2021-06-20 22:03:23,stocks,"lol doesn’t surprise me since everyone in here doesn’t understand what I’m really looking for and keeps repeating the same shit.

I haven’t even discussed anything programming related though, so not sure how you came to that conclusion.

Apparently a tool that suggests stocks as ideas to further look into is the devil… but building it isn’t particularly complex, albeit I’d have to do quite a bit of scraping to get the data needed for it.

If I were to build it here’s the gist of what I’d do off the top of my head:

Database with a stock table containing all the stocks with their symbol, full company name, etc, a domain table for storing domain names associated with that stock, and merchant table with stuff like merchant id, BIN, or maybe descriptor prefix (something like that I can end up tying to a stock)

I’d probably just populate the stock table from one of the million repos on GitHub with financial data. The domain table I’ll need to do a ton of scraping to populate. I’m thinking good sources of data will be Wikipedia (since I want child companies too so I can get their domain names), nasdaq.com (to get the stock symbol’s main domain down at the bottom), and maybe DuckDuckGo to help turn any subsidiary company names into a domain (just query the company name and use the first result as the domain name is probably accurate enough). Depending on the source and how reliably structured it is, I’ll either curl or use Puppeteer to scrape it. For the merchant id or BIN I think there’s an API that let’s me do lookups (honestly I don’t feel like looking into this too much but I’m sure I’d find something that gets me what I want).  Now I’ll just send all the stocks into a queue and for simplicity’s sake let’s just assume that all scraping jobs go perfectly and it ends up in my database. I’d also schedule a cron job to update this database periodically to account for company acquisitions and other changes.  I’d probably have another scraper parsing news announcing mergers and acquisitions for best results though; I can use GPT-3 for natural language processing to pick up on the nuances of the article to make sure it’s accurate… but that can come later. Ok, database is now populated.

So now I want it to scan my email for relevant stocks. I can just use the Gmail API for this so I’ll do the oAuth crap and get it connected. Looks like I just need this endpoint to paginate through messages:

    GET https://gmail.googleapis.com/gmail/v1/users/{userId}/messages

All I really care about is the email address of received email, particularly the domain, so this endpoint returns the email metadata, which is good enough for my purposes since I just want to parse the domain out of it. 

So I’ll paginate through the messages and store all the parsed domains in an array I guess, maybe Redis since it’s probably going to take a while to go through all the results. I’d probably filter out a lot of them by excluding gmail.com, yahoo.com, and other common personal emails since I only want emails from companies.

Ok, so that runs and I’ve pulled a bunch of company looking domains. I’ll do a SQL query on my domains table (joining my stock table) and return the stock symbol for any domains that match.

`SELECT stock_symbol FROM domain d JOIN stock s ON s.id = d.stock_id WHERE d.domain_name IN (“sendgrid.com”, “segment.com”, “pingdom.com”);`

(ya not that most optimized but good enough)

As far as the credit card transactions, I’m honestly over writing this all out but basically I’d connect the bank account to Plaid like a lot of financial sites do and I’d just use the Plaid API to parse the transactions, the descriptor prefix is probably good enough to get results similar to what I did with the domains above. 

So as a user of this tool, all I’d do is click a button to authorize it to look through my email. I’d show a little spinner thing as the job runs, then at the end I’d just show a list of stocks I think you might be interested in. 

For me I’d probably have some useful results from my email since I’ve been active in the startup world for 12+ years and use a lot of services for my company. 

So ya, I kinda know wtf I’m talking about but apparently I’m a complete dumbass for wanting a tool that would take like 30 seconds and recommends stocks I should consider buying that’s personalized to me instead of spending hours combing through each stock individually to see if I’m interested in it like you fucking monkeys."

So, like many others in a similar position (I’m sure), I had no idea how the market would react to it. I had erroneously assumed that the reaction would be similar to rising inflation expectations, i.e. rates skyrocketing across the board, with growth and tech selling off."

Big tech has really good outlooks for the next few years, p/e is pretty average yet we are in a low interest rate environment for many years to come. Rate hike won’t even bring us to 2019 levels, Nasdaq p/e is really low considering how much growth is expected there next few years it’s a lot lower than SPY, I don’t care about DOW honestly. The companies I’m in are dirt cheap and high growth, I bought the crash earlier this year. Chinese companies have huge upsides coming this decade, yet they are the cheapest in the market due to xenophobia. Qualcomm is trading like a value stock yet it has huge things coming for it. TSM runs the fucking planet and has multiple foundries coming up. All the stocks I’m holding I can explain why they have huge upside, I’m not caught holding any value traps like the dummies who listened to CNBC earlier this year and are going to get rugpulled. I would be in growth and tech right now, they are not trading very high considering how much growth they compound per year. Stocks like JD are trading at like half their forward revenue, and at single digit forward P/E ratios despite the fact they will compound around 40% growth yearly. There is value to be found in this market still it’s not like the dot com bubble when everything was trading at insane P/E ratios. There will be pullbacks along the way, but overall we are going up even on spy and Dow. Spy will still pass 500 next year and I don’t even really care about their holdings other than apple and Tesla. The materials and industrial holdings of spy will be what causes it to go down those are trading at very high values right now, financials are kind of meh."

FB has been raising the cost steadily over the past 4 weeks.  I assume this is to offset the companies reducing spend - so it's possible they will be able to squeek by on earnings in Q2.  However, if they don't come up w/a solution Q3 is going to be rough IMO."

If I am short, but then action on the security does not pan out the way I forecasted, I may decide that it is no longer in my best interests to maintain my short position.  That, my friend, is the very definition of a short squeeze.  Don't be a pedant when someone says ""forced.""

Read that again, in 100 years, less then 15 times.

2021-06-20 21:36:28,stocks,"Some companies re-invest their earnings instead of dividend, in hopes of being able to use the capital to generate higher earnings and a higher ROI than paying the cash out. If the company can invest their earnings at a higher ROI then you would invest with the dividend then it makes sense. But eventually the point of a stock, or any financial asset, is a future payment in terms of cash flow being returned to the owner in a dividend. If you think the exit is just selling the highly appreciated share, that is speculation, not investing. Investing is predicting future cash flows, not selling an asset to somebody else for a return."

2021-06-21 11:54:55,stocks,"I'm bullish. 

Not worried about the surge in sales from COVID going away, that ended in January. Company gained 10m new customers in 2020, not all will come back, but many will and revs should be way higher than 2019 even in 2022 because of this. 

It has a P/E of 5.5x or so, you do not need it to be spectacular and re-rate to 10x P/E, which was where Michaels was taken-out by a private equity firm in March. 

This is a stable company that has survived the retail apocolypse over the last 10 years. Historcially profitable, will be more profitable in the future given the debt reduction saving them 50M this year and perhaps another 50M over the next 3-5 years as they continue paying down their debt. 

Even assuming their profitability plunges back to 2017-2019 levels, there is no downside in the stock. In fact a DCF will show 50-60% upside on those historical profitability numbers. Not sure when things will re-rate, but while you wait you get a dividend and several potential catalysts, so I think it's a safe play compared to many other stocks in the market now."

2021-06-21 19:42:40,stocks,"I'm not necessarily going to address the nay sayer comments here since it isn't my DD, but I did find this thread because I wanted to see if anyone else had written anything interesting before before/if I create a post with my thoughts. With any stock or analysis that someone does, there are of course going to holes, gaps, differing opinions, and more. As long as the stock doesn't stay flat though, chances are that someone will make money or lose money going long or short based

That said - I'm long CRTX currently for a few reasons and some of those reasons might address a few of the comments. Of course - not financial advice and with a low float stock that is volatile, near the 52-week high isn't *usually* the best time to jump in:
1. Remember when **high short interest** wasn't a buy indicator? I don't remember those days honestly, predates my time as virtually any ratio or indicator can be used in a contrarian sense. High Put/Call ratio? Could mean a pullback since there is likely a lot of hedging, could be bullish if the market is overly buying puts and you like to catch falling knives. High short interest by itself isn't a great buy indicator since the short sellers are there for a reason, adding liquidity, and also generally being correct statistically - BUT that doesn't mean you can't look at it and ponder why/how high interest might be of benefit. For CRTX, you've got 68% institutionally held, a short interest currently of 3.56M or so shares, and at a current volume of ~150,000 shares a day, *if* there is any type of squeeze, that would take 23 days to cover. Probably less realistically since volume spikes to 1.5M aren't uncommon here and days of 300,000 volume are common as well. So let's just call it a round 10 days to cover if a sudden spike happens - that means a lack of liquidity might actually be in the favor of retail investors that can get in and out quickly
2. Still on the topic of short interest, if you combine a few data points then there have been at least 1M newly shorted shares since 2/12 and the absolute highest price that they could have opened a new short position would have been below $50. It will be interesting to see what short interest is as of 6/15 and that data should be available on the 24th this week. So this little rally and trend they're having could be some short sellers quietly buying back shares, but that isn't my guess since they would have opened their short position a long while back to make any money closing at the current prices. The most recent massive sell off was February 16 of this year, and their short interest reported from 2/12 was 2.7M and one 2/26 3.2M, so we know that in that two week span, there was an increase in short interest of 500,000 shares; but the high right before the sell off was only $47 on 2/12 and it didn't go above that prior to 2/26 or all the way to 5/28 (latest data available on short interest)
3. Squeeze be damned, what else is happening here? Well if you draw an upward trending line and then try to stick it on their daily chart from 5/11 until today, you'll probably find they're in an uptrend. It's fine to look for magic candles that signal the uptrend is ending, but from a technical perspective if you had spotted the trend and bought any time from 5/11 onward, you'd probably be up right now
4. Risk factors - biotech stocks including CRTX can be choppy as hell, so buying at $55 and then selling at $30 or below would suck. But when Biogen had relatively mundane knews from the FDA, they saw a 64% spike from low to high on 6/7, and even Eli Lilly had a strong day riding those coat tails. 6/8 is when I started opening long positions because of the pullback CRTX had when BIIB went to the moon, and it has been good so far
5. Options, options, options...they are expecting news in November/December and the options premiums reflect that as IV for those months is absurdly high, but definitely means there is speculating going on. Specifically of interest to me are the ~3,000 $75 calls that expire in November. The spread is wide as to be expected that far out on a low float stock, but the volume on that particular strike is super high comparatively and it also costs more than some of the lower strikes which is...interesting.

Now usually when I see a large open interest on a contract, or a whale buying A LOT of calls with a relatively low strike; my first thought is that they're going to short the stock and use the call as a hedge. That could be the case on the $75, or some of the December options - or someone somewhere might be feeling confident that a spike up is just around the corner.

So if nothing else, you have a choppy biotech stock here that is known to have swings up and down $20+ in a day or two, or fall from new highs to new lows in 2 weeks or less and get back that high a week or two later, it is in an uptrend and has been for 2 months, there is a ton of short interest and at the current price; the growing short interest from 1.5M in October 2020 to 3.6M in May 2021 *probably/maybe* means that a good number of those shorted shares were sold at a price below where they are and ***if*** there is some kind of mad rush to close some of that short interest in a hurry, I would think OP's DD is trying to tell us that we *might* see prices push higher simply because the float and trading volumes are low and momentum is a hell of a drug.

I for one like the stock; although I must admit that I liked them better at $43 when I opened positions vs. $55-$56 right now. However even the $47.72 from 6 days ago probably looks pretty for anyone that read this and thought ""Eh fuck it, I'll buy 100 shares and see what happens"" - what happened was they have $800+ in unrealized gains and can sell a ridiculously priced $75 call with a November expiration for about $1,000"

The point of my post was really to just accentuate that if you find one when you're young then it really kicks off your whole porftolio but of course you cant find one every year! What I meant to say is that when you find a company in your field of study that you believe in and you're young, invest in it, you don't have kids yet and you can take on the educated risk (bet) that its going to work out. Don't be so pessimistic about single stocks in general that you believe that everything except the s&p500 index is going to go to shit, there are good small cap companies out there that will be the nvidias and intel of tomorrow and that will make you well over 10x in a shorter period than the market. My post was just to encourage people to take good educated risks when looking into the market, then if they want with their profits they SHOULD invest it in the sp500 for something safe.
