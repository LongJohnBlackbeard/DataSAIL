This is a damn casino. Nobody is giving out financial advice, and neither should you, especially without actual charts that you draw fancy lines on and excel sheets with big numbers that I can pretend to understand.

I couldn't find any thread discussing this but I believe this is a topic that can't be overlooked as it surely explains why many of us are bonding and showing similar behaviours in this GME / AMC saga. Plus, it may also explain why this is probably one of our greatest strength.I'm myself diagnosed Asperger myself and have spent years researching on the matter as I needed to understand why I couldn't feel and think the way my friends would. I'm sure I'm not the only one here.

# What is Autism and what is its prevalance in humans?

&#x200B;

**Autism Spectrum Disorder**\- Autism is a [developmental disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_disorder) characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism#cite_note-DSM5-3)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism)

\- ASD manifest in different forms and degrees. It can be low, mild, severe and isn't always manifesting as a severe mental disability.[https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/autism-spectrum-disorders](https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/autism-spectrum-disorders)*eg:* [*Asperger's syndrome*](https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/mental-health-aspergers-syndrome) *is on the milder end of the* [*autism*](https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/default.htm) \*spectrum. A person with Asperger's may be very intelligent and able to handle their daily life. They may be really focused on topics that interest them and discuss them nonstop. But they have a much harder time socially.

&#x200B;

**Prevalence**

\- About 1 percent of the world population has autism spectrum disorder. ([CDC, 2014](http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html))

\- Prevalence in the United States is estimated at 1 in 54 births. ([CDC, 2020](https://www.autism-society.org/releases/cdc-releases-new-prevalence-rates-of-people-with-autism-spectrum-disorder/))

\- More than 3.5 million Americans live with an autism spectrum disorder. ([Buescher et al., 2014](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-09/autism-costs-more-than-2-million-over-patient-s-life.html))

\- Prevalence of autism in U.S. children increased by 119.4 percent from 2000 (1 in 150) to 2010 (1 in 68). ([CDC, 2014](http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html)) Autism is the fastest-growing developmental disability. ([CDC, 2020](https://www.autism-society.org/releases/cdc-releases-new-prevalence-rates-of-people-with-autism-spectrum-disorder/))

\- Prevalence has increased by 6-15 percent each year from 2002 to 2010. (Based on biennial numbers from the [CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html))

\-  25% of 4500 children showing ASD symptoms participating in a study were not diagnosed and didn't know know they're affected. [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/aur.2255](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/aur.2255)

\-  ASD can be seen on brain MRIs, ASD brains physically developed differently.  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3081653/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3081653/)

# ""Ok that's a lot but not all of us here have ASD... Even if one 1/54 or 1% of us on here did, how could this be proven and mean anything anyway?""

Well, the pourcentage of ASD apes on here is likely to be **higher** than in those studies... Why?

**Social Media Use and Happiness in Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder**\*""Social Media use by adults with ASD, specifically Facebook use in moderation, may enhance well-being and may be a protective factor against secondary mental health concerns common in this population"".In a 2013 study\*[*,*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563213000708) *researcher* ***Micah O. Mazurek*** ***found that the majority of adults with autism use social media to meet friends.***[^(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29485900/)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29485900/)

**Social media use among adults with autism spectrum disorders***The purpose of this study was to examine patterns and social–emotional correlates of social media use in adults with ASD. Participants completed self-report measures of social media use, friendship quality and quantity, and loneliness.* ***The results indicated that the majority of participants (79.6%) used social networking sites (SNS)****, and that the most commonly cited reason for using SNS was social connection. Adults with ASD who used SNS were more likely to have close friends, and those who used SNS for social engagement reported closer friendship relationships.*

**Social Media help autistic children navigate the world***Dr. Szatmari: the human face doesn't have the same drawing power for an autistic child, and that something about technology triggers the motivation that's lacking in face-to-face contact.* ***This can really have a big impact in helping people with ASD navigate the world and be able to do things that we never thought possible before.***[^(https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/social-media-helping-autistic-children-navigate-the-world/article4358736/)](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/social-media-helping-autistic-children-navigate-the-world/article4358736/)

**Yale study: 'Social media boosts friendship quality in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder'**[^(https://medicine.yale.edu/childstudy/news-article/15234/)](https://medicine.yale.edu/childstudy/news-article/15234/)

If you do some research, you will see that there's many other studies explaining why social medias are one of ASD favorite way to connect and communicate.

Maybe it would be interesting do a pol to see who's diagnosed or feel like being misdiagnosed here...

# ""Yeh ok but what's the link with GME or the stock market then?""

That's where things get interesting...There are hundreds of studies out there showing that **reward pathways** of autistic people are altered and therefore their social relationships but also their **relationship with money** is totally different than the TD brains.

**Reward Circuitry Function in Autism During Face Anticipation and Outcomes***The aim of this study was to investigate reward circuitry responses in autism during reward anticipation and outcomes for monetary and social rewards.* ***During monetary anticipation, participants with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) showed hypoactivation in right nucleus accumbens and hyperactivation in right hippocampus, whereas during monetary outcomes, participants with ASDs showed hyperactivation in left midfrontal and anterior cingulate gyrus.*** *Groups did not differ in nucleus accumbens responses to faces. The ASD group demonstrated hyperactivation in bilateral amygdala during face anticipation that predicted social symptom severity and in bilateral insular cortex during face outcomes.* ***These results add to the growing body of evidence that autism is characterized by altered functioning of reward circuitry.*** *Additionally, atypical amygdala activation during the processing of social rewards may contribute to the development or expression of autistic features.*[^(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-011-1221-1)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-011-1221-1)

**Risk-Aversion and Rationality in Autism Spectrum Disorders***Risk-aversion and rationality have both been highlighted as core features of decision making in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). This study tested whether risk-aversion is related to rational decision-making in ASD individuals. ASD and matched control adults completed a decision-making task that discriminated between the use of risk-averse and rational strategies. Results showed that overall, ASD participants were more risk-averse than control participants. Specifically, both groups made similar choices when risk-aversion was the less rational strategy but* ***ASD participants chose more rational options than control participants when risk-aversion was the most rational strategy. This study confirmed that risk-aversion is a core feature of ASD and revealed that ASD individuals can switch their decision-making strategy adaptively to avoid negative consequences.***[^(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-018-3616-8)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-018-3616-8)

**Reward system dysfunction in autism spectrum disorders**\*“Participants with ASD showed the expected hypoactivation in the mesocorticolimbic circuitry in response to both reward types. In particular, diminished activation in the nucleus accumbens was observed when money, but not when social reward, was at stake, whereas the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex were hypoactivated within the ASD group in response to both rewards.\* ***These data indicate that the reward circuitry is compromised in ASD in social as well as in non-social, i.e. monetary conditions,*** ***which likely contributes to atypical motivated behaviour.”***[^(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3682440/)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3682440/)

# ""Cool but it says ASD individuals can switch their decision-making strategy adaptively to avoid negative consequences... so it could also mean you could paperhand?""

Well, not exactly...

**Emotional decision-making in autism spectrum disorder: the roles of interoception and alexithymia.** [^(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5062918/)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5062918/)""*These results demonstrate that although framing effects are associated with interoception and alexithymia in the neurotypical population,* ***emotional and interoceptive signals have less impact upon the decision-making process in ASD***\*.""\*

**Trait Autism is a Better Predictor of Empathy than Alexithymia***The study found that having more autistic traits is associated with lower empathy – even after factoring alexithymia into the analysis. In fact, the study provides some of the* \*\*\*best evidence so far that autism is definitely linked to lower empathy.\*\*\***Autism and Reactions to Provocation in a Social and Non-social Context**[^(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-019-04257-w)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-019-04257-w)*Compared to Healthy controles, individuals with ASD showed similar externalizing behavior in the social context.* ***In the non-social context*** *(meaning non physical environment)* ***reactions after provocation were enhanced relative to non-provoking situations.*** *The findings implicate that the context is an important influencing variable when comparing individuals with ASD to HCs after being provoked.*

See where I'm going?

# ""Ok but it still doesn't mean you wouldn't give up at some point?""

ASD mostly characterised by Restrictive and Repetitive behaviours. We get even more obsessed when it comes to things we enjoy and distract us... or rather keep us in focus.

And what do ASD love more than everything? Yes Cramer, that's exactly what we like, the stock... because we love video games!

**The risk for pathological video game use appears larger in adults with ASD compared with TD ('traditional') adults**[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29485900/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29485900/)

**Video game use in boys with autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, or typical development***Boys with ASD spend much more time playing video games than do boys with TD, and boys with ASD and ADHD are at greater risk for problematic video game use than are boys with TD.*[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23897915/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23897915/)

**Video games from the perspective of adults with autism spectrum disorder**The most frequent all-time favorite video game genres were Role-Playing (31%) and Action-Adventure (19%).  *To the moon, right?*[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563215003581](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563215003581)

**Restricted and repetitive behaviors in autism spectrum disorders**[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21574682/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21574682/)

# ""Mmmmmh... but if all of this is just a game to you, you'll still end up turning off the console when you'll realise you might not get what you want?""

Nope, not really... the funny thing about ASD RRBs is that we are excited by the reward anticipation itself, not the reward. As long as the adversaire isn't down its knees giving up, we won't turn off the console. Plus, the thing we'll miss the most and regret while being millionaires is the entertainment and excitement itself.

**Common alterations in sensitivity to type but not amount of reward in ADHD and autism spectrum disorders**\*'The results, while not supporting hyposensitivity to changes in reward amount in ADHD and ASD, do suggest that both groups are generally less motivated in settings where social as opposed to monetary rewards can be earned.'\*[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21223259/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21223259/)

**Money motivates in autism, attention deficit**'*They also perform better when the reward is greater: for example, 15 cents rather than 5, or comments such as “You’re a star” as opposed to “Well done.”'*[https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/cognition-and-behavior-money-motivates-in-autism-attention-deficit/](https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/cognition-and-behavior-money-motivates-in-autism-attention-deficit/)

**Autistic Traits Affect Reward Anticipation but not Reception**[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-65345-x](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-65345-x)

I've lost a link to an amazing study showing that ASD individuals were more generous when it came to sharing their monetary reward with other participants compared to control. If anyone finds it, please post it in the comments :).

# Conclusion

Hedgies can try manipulate the ASD apes we are with FUD or any other techniques; ASD brains won’t react. We don't show improvement with hours of therapy not using reward as stimuli. And our stimuli here... well they are trying to take it away from us so all it does is increasing our obsession and make us buy more.

Anyway, I have no idea if all I just put together makes sense or is accurate but as having ASD, I'm relating to all of these facts 100%.

I also understand that there might just be only 10 of us with ASD here, as well as there could be 100k  but if you are not ASD and call yourself autist, make us proud with your diamond hands!

There's one thing I'm sure tho, it is that I love you all beautiful apes.

2021-03-13 18:39:16,Wallstreetbets,"Stimulus Check Hype I’ve see a lot of people hyping up the stimulus checks and I completely agree that it’s an amazing thing which will help in this fight against the hedges. I’ve also seen fellow apes think it will boost to 350 on Monday which I completely think is possible.

I just want to emphasise that, as said by many before me, hedges can see us hype so please do not get disappointed if after a bit of a boost they immediately push it back down again. All we have to do is buy and hold, then we can enjoy the sweet tendies of £100k per share.

I also want to add that I have been using the Etoro app for a little while now (trash I know) but there is one mega ape invested who has been giving daily predictions and warnings and has been literally bang on every single day.

So I unplugged, and hung out with my family. I’m an Old  Ape. I’m an ape with wife ape, a child ape. I’m an ape that owns a few businesses, and properties. But most importantly - I’m an ape that is completely over the looseness of regulations in securities exchanges, and this ape isn’t fucking selling.Feeling recharged this morning, with a couple cups of coffee - I decided to jump into Option order flow from Cheddar Flow.

&#x200B;

I used the following parameters:3/1 to 3/15 OrdersRemoved everything that has expired and decided to do what gives me comfort as a wrinkle brain ape and just look at the concrete data.

&#x200B;

The Excel sheet I provided shows many things, is it accurate? No - probably not. This ape may have some wrinkles, but is too smooth calculate IV.The bulleted point of the sheet is this (NOT BANANA ADVICE, JUST WRINKLE BRAIN APE LOOKING FOR ANSWERS)

There are: 111,204 Volume picked up in options that have yet to expire - between calls & putsThere is: 538,434 Current option interest on the strikes in this sheet The Average strike price divided by the total number of contracts purchased is 18,665 (this accounts for puts as well as calls)

.Because ape only has some wrinkles, not all the wrinkles I can’t account for IV - but I can account for a banana to banana value at volatility less cost. So ape decided to account for that, to give himself a bigger view of the overall picture.

There was: $24million in buys in deep ITM and slightly OOTM options picked up on 3/4 (ape things hedges for hedges (double fuck you scumbag funds if you’re reading this btw)

On a banana for banana basis ape determined total value of all options right now is 94,854,461 bananas.

So wrinkle brain ape took out the value of the puts, and hedges - and determined that the actual value is 140,017,514 Bananas in value. That’s a lot of bananas. Like a lot.  


 **(( EDIT: $99,965,839 spent on these options. // Shorts/Hedge removed is 116,463,553 ))**  


With ape baseless speculation - I value The shorts/hedge (fuck you again btw) as -45,163,053 bananas. That’s quite a banana deficit before you account for IV and Theta.  


**(( EDIT: -16,497,714 with adjustments to formula  still not sure how to account for IV / Vega / Theta in all of this))**

&#x200B;

Other information I like:65.2 million outstanding sharesshort float is 54.16 million cccording to whale wisdom q4 filings there are 74.474 million shares held (LOL what? More shares than available - keep this in mind),short interest according to Morningstar is 52% . (**EDIT: updated to 26.22%)**

There are currently 8.2 million more shares than outstanding (before apes and dfv of course).Short total should be around 28million shares.**Meaning 36.437 million shares need to be bought in order to cover.**  


**(( EDIT: -22,474,752 total shares to be covered after adjusting SI -))**

**TLDR:** Just fucking holding your shares, they bring bananas.Stop bitching about gamma, stop bitching about options, stop bitching about the day to day - wrinkle brain ape says this. Shit is going to hit the fan. Be apart of history apes.

Go long, and stay strong

\*\*Positions:\*\*Was holding 365 shares, told wife i'd withdraw more money this weekend because she's sketched out as fuck about all of this (bigly bananas up for the year), down to 265 shares now.  with $30k in bananas to continue to add

2021-03-13 17:40:51,Wallstreetbets,"Wanda AMC hypothesis AMC filed Wanda's intent to convert it's class B shares into class A shares on Feb 5th to the SEC. AMC's CEO recently stated that this was triggered by share dilution causing Wanda's majority shares fell below 30% and currently only sits at 9%. On March 10th it seemed like shares appeared out of nowhere and the cost to borrow rate plummeted. If you assume that the filing becomes official on the first business day after filing then it would have been official Feb 8th. If you count 30 days from Feb 8th then it would be March 10th. On March 10th it seemed that shares appeared out of nowhere and the cost to borrow plummeted. 

Is it possible that Wanda had a 30 day period where they weren't allowed to sell shares? As a matter of fact it seems that Wanda may have sold ALL their shares all together. Motley Fools' website lists institutional ownership as of March 13 and Wanda isn't listed at all. 

Another thing I read is that Class B shareholders are the last to receive any compensation if the company goes bankrupt. Why would Wanda ok the dilution of AMC's shares knowing it would cause them to lose the majority control they paid 2.6 Billion dollars for? Could it be that AMC fully anticipated going bankrupt prior to the reddit rally? I know that hypothesis doesn't jive with what was said in the shareholders meeting but I don't think anything they said necessarily disproves anything I've hypothesized. Nor would anything they said be a lie. They did very specifically point out that Wanda's position was held as of March 3rd. 

Why is March 3rd significant? That is 30 days from Feb 1 which is the day that the original reporting states that Wanda announced to AMC they would be converting shares. Would the same 30 day rule apply? They had to wait 30 days to disclose to the company their intent to sell and then 30 days from the SEC filing date to officially sell?"

I've been thinking (it hurts, but i'm  stubborn so keep at it) - there are many out there who subscribe to and  promote the notion that at current MC of \~ 17B $GME is grossly, and i  mean GROSSLY overvalued  ( last SP of \~$266 X 65M Float = 17B) and the  only thing that GME has going for it is this stubborn pack of apes who  like the stock and diamond hand their shares as if those were last  bananas on Earth and therefore presenting and causing all kinds of  nuisances and troubles to otherwise sophisticated investors getting in  their way of  making big bucks as usual by doing all kinds of complex  calculations on smart machines, forecasting, prognosticating, staring  and squiggly lines all day, pontificating to ignorant masses etc. etc.  etc.

\-  well you know what

i  know it's maybe a bit ""apples n oranges"" ; but let's take a quick look at DASH shall we...?

Now  if DASH can take on most of delivery business in US  (including  business w no or in-house delivery services start outsourcing to DASH  and of  course they can start collecting/mining info get into  advertising etc etc ) -  then yes - i say DASH might be worth 46B maybe  even much more (btw - DASH currently is doing less in Sales and looses  as much as GME)

Market  is forward  looking so considering GME and it's potential in - gaming;  e-sports;  betting; e-sports tournaments/events and the fact that the  brand name  is getting a positive FREE SYMPATHETIC PUBLICITY around the  world  especially among GME core users and considering demographic -  who's  then to say that GME is not actually worth the current SP of \~$300  and  why should it be valued 3 times LESS than DASH???!!!

Also I ran a quick ""back of the envelope"" screener (all data are from [Finviz.com](https://finviz.com/) link below // );

I  only specified few fundamental and technical parameters to try to see  what I come up with - take a look-see; snoop around a bit; click away on  some of the familiar names... and some of those business are app's (of  course i'm over-simplifying!!! don't get on my case - I'm VENTING!!!)

There  are currently more than 20 Co's (some of which might be hailed as  disruptions, innovators and all around trailblazers) who's MC is larger  than GME's - in some cases considerably larger; most if not ALL (i have  not checked one by one) are loosing some big bucks - in the billions;  some have triple digits F/PE; ROI/ROA/ROE in deep double digit red - but  hey you don't see a band of apes getting assigned the responsibility of  unreasonably and blatantly ""manipulating"" and  inflating the SP and  keeping the MC where it's at..... (btw reason DASH didn't make the list  is coz they currently don't have ROI/ROA listed)

So in conclusion: **TLDR**

GME SP is currently in ""no-man's"" land and ""Who's to say GME is over-valued....??!!"" - (fundamentally, of course, we all understand it is currently, but again, markets are forward looking, GME has A LOT going for it now and is taking active and tangible steps to adopts and fine tune it's business model and is no more ""over-valued"" than some of the market ""darlings"" currently trading at considerable premium)

To  the moons!!! (yeah you got that right - MOONS - plural - i am maybe a  retard ape but i know MARS has two moons, M  A  R  S - Mars biches...  and don't get me started w Jupiter and Saturn - take that suits...!!!!)

2021-03-13 15:56:23,Wallstreetbets,"Green-Centric Technology Set to Benefit from Infrastructure Spending Real talk: Congress is getting started on the infrastructure bill and the majority leader in the Senate plans on a bill passage by October. It should be climate focused considering that the Biden administration ran on that message. One of Biden’s initiatives was building a network of charging station across America. Another one is making modern changes to the power grid system and alternative ways to harness energy. Of courses the materials to build these priorities takes steel and fuel.

Based on these assumptions mixed in with a few facts about the materials that will be used to modernize our infrastructure, as other analysts have reiterated, this is a great year for energy and materials. They like to think about the reopening which I think is short-sighted. The real growth will come from the rumor out of Congress. That’s going to be the accelerant for a lot of these alternative energy stocks.

Here are some on my watch list:
MP Materials
Star Peak Energy (soon to be STEM this month)
ChargePoint

MP Materials 

• Not a fan all too much for this one, and it has a competitive advantage that’s also its greatest weakness. They are the only rare earth material miner in the US. It only takes a competitor with lower prices to soak up their market share. A little apprehensive about this one but I like their team. Maybe you guys have more information on what makes this one stellar.

Star Peak Energy 

• This one is a good one in my opinion for its uniqueness. Other green tech stocks in its sector are trading at much much higher multiples like Blink whereas this company is only 8x. So, it’s trading at a discount from its peers. They offer energy solutions driven by their patented AI system Athena to harness power from energy storage units. They also plan to be cash flow positive by 2022-2023. That’s beside the point though, they’re pioneering great sustainable technology and already have a 75% market share in California in energy storage. I like this one a lot. They’re planning a merger with Stem this month and it will be listed in the NYSE as STEM. 

ChargePoint 

• The company has the widest distribution of charging units across the country. Though they aren’t as good as other chargers in their sector, they have them at scale. This play is largely contingent on the infrastructure bill. GM plans to have like 30 EV cars by 2025, so just imagine the growth story for this stock. Even at its current multiple, I can honestly say that Biden’s proposal is not factored in. They’re going to be met with more demand than they projected in a few years as more and more people embrace EV’s."

2021-03-13 13:46:52,Wallstreetbets,"Out of VIAC. Now in GNOG, SRPT, and GD. So I haven't really logged into Reddit for some time. It's completely blown up wow. Thanks so much for the awards. I've received several messages asking me what's in my book now, so I'm gonna write a quick update.

Alright, so **I've already gotten out of ViacomCBS** \- did so **at $70** actually. Happy to outline my rationale in full next time but I'm relatively busy today so I'm just gonna update y'all on my positions (and a TLDR on why I'm invested in some of them). Let me know what your thoughts are - would love to have a discussion around this. So, I've **recently rotated into the following stocks. Interesting positions in bold.** 

**Swing Trades (6 Month Plays)**

* **Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT; -13%)**: Sarepta is **massively undervalued**. **Only player right now in the DMD space**. Additional **FDA approvals** suggest that the FDA is still keen on SRPT's treatments (there was a little controversy in the past). Trade carefully though, this stock can get volatile. I believe that I got in a little too early, but my personal **PT for SRPT is 120**.
* **Golden Nugget Online Gaming (GNOG; +22%)**: 3 main reasons why GNOG is a strong buy. Firstly, it is a **severely undervalued** stock. Warrants have also mostly expired / been exercised. Secondly, **online gambling is getting legalized** across the US. Thirdly, the **brand recognition** in the US is pretty high. If Draft Kings is the global player for millennials, **GNOG is the US player for boomers**. Would love to write an in-depth analysis on GNOG when I have time. 
* **General Dynamics (GD; +12%)**: **Space baby, space**. Increased government contracts + retail interest = Boom.
* Helca Mining (HL; +6%): Super volatile trade. Indirect hedge against inflation. 
* Lockheed Martin (LMT; +1%): Severely undervalued IMO. Also, Space. 

**Buy and Hold (Long Term Plays)**

* Ozon Holdings (OZON; +19%): Amazon of Russia. Highly volatile though, so I'd recommend caution on when and at what price you enter this trade. 
* Royal Dutch Shell (RDSB; +14%): Great management team + execution = Likely successful in transition into clean energy. 
* British Petroleum (BP; +4%): Fastest transition by a major oil player into clean energy. 2nd time's the charm, I believe. 
* Dollar General (DGBP; -3%): The underlying economy is actually quite week IMO. There's likely to have been quite a bit of capital scrapping over the past year. Unemployment has fallen and people are getting vaccinated. But there is a non-zero risk of another potential wave (SA Variant) which may result in an increase in U3. U6 unemployment is also likely to be above typical averages after COVID as employers realize many of their employees can plausibly be streamlined. 

Happy to do another in depth analysis on any of the above positions as my previous post got quite a bit of traction (thanks for the interest!). Let me know if you're keen on any of them and I'll pen my thoughts accordingly."

2021-03-13 12:08:47,Wallstreetbets,"Just found a fucking gem. First attempt at DD. FSLR Edit: not financial advice. full disclosure I was denied options trading. ignore the following

FSLR got caught up with short selling around the same time as GME so it is looking like some tasty dip right now, let me tell you why.

THESE FUCKING GENIUSES DON'T USE SILICON

Did you know that 80% of solar production relies on the same dumb shit as GPUs and smart cars? 

You know graphics cards cost twice as much and are impossible to buy. Extrapolate that into the summer when everyone but Texas wants to cash in on this green new deal jam. Retail/Scalpers may benefit from that, but it's less than worthless when you are filling last year's wholesale orders. 

The cost of metallurgical silicon is up 30%. Every DD done since 2010 basically ignores the possibility that we could have another shortage. Thanks pandemic. Now they are saying 5 years to sort it out entirely? That's Biden's entire administration.

Oh, and did you know that nearly every solar company with meaningful output is not 'really' based in the US. There are three diamond domestic dogs: FSLR, TSLA, and SPWR. SPWR uses silicon, I can't find explicit text about TSLA/Panasonic material but it does look like a clusterfuck of a deal that's falling apart. 

FSLR is the largest. Since 2015. AND THEY DO NOT USE SILICON.

Solar panels are about to be even more in demand than GPUs are now. Only one domestic company can fill trucks with them this year. 

MSM were churning out articles convincing people to sell this stock while they were actively shorting it. Not one fucking article mentions THEY DO NOT USE SILICON. 

Please, look"

2021-03-13 10:21:10,Wallstreetbets,"Options 101 for the Learned Ape - Knuckles off the ground Edition # So you're on RobinBull WeHood and you wanna play options.

&#x200B;

**Options are the easiest way to lose money. If  you are going to walk into this pit of snakes; do not start off by doing it dick first. I am not a professional. This is not financial advice. If I am wrong call me out. If I don't know the answer to a question I will find someone that does.**

Now you have a choice, some would say the option, to read this wall of text which means you  think, ask questions, get Gud or you not and you can Yolo Gamble at the moon and be angry/happy that the stonk god that lives in your phone givith or taketh away...

**So lets touch the monolith shall we**[**.**](https://u.teknik.io/kJXMd.jfif)

These services let you trade what's called covered options. You can buy puts and calls.  Let's talk about the long call to start once you figure that out you can just reverse everything and call it a put.

**Long calls are types of options** which are a contract that is made between you and the seller of the contract that states you have the right to purchase shares of the underlying stock for the price agreed upon from that seller.  This is called the strike price, but it's really just the price that you can purchase the stock at. So You now own the right not the obligation to purchase the stock at anytime between now and when the option closes. Some would say you have the OPTION to purchase the stock at the agreed upon price not the obligation. Option contracts are actually a bundle of contracts covering 100 shares.

So the seller is betting that by the date the the share price will be ""out of the money"" or beneath the contract strike price and you are betting it will be above it. Because if you buy the right to purchase GOEV at 15 dollars for 100 shares and it's 30 dollars by the time the contract is up you now own 15$ x 100 in value. Because you can take the 100 shares you got for 15 and sell them for 30. What if you paid just a fraction for the right to do this?  What if you paid say. 10 cents per share for the right to do this... You might make some money..  This is why options are called derivative products because they derive the value from what they contain not from the actual share of the company. Options contain the time left until expiry.  In this time they may go up or down.  The ability for an option to gain more value (and lose it) directly affects the price of the option.  Options that are farther out are less risky for you and more risky for the seller so will always be more expensive than ones closer in.

The price per contract represents money times 100 shares because it is the price per share so a 5 cent 3/19 15c (A long call for 15 dollars representing the ability to purchase 100 shares of the underlying stock for 15 dollars a share at any time until 3/19 costing 5 cents per share) is 5 bucks a contract... 0.05 cents per share x 100 shares = 1 call option contract.


If the Share Price at the time of expiry is 14.99 the option is worthless because you could just go to market and buy it there cheaper it just wouldn't make sense to ""execute"" the option on 99 percent of the situations. A short squeeze is actually one of the situations where executing makes sense for shorts underwater.

So if I was going to sell you the right to buy $GOEV at 100 bucks, that's a lot of risk for you and not a lot of risk for me so the price would be low... 0.05 cents per contract x100 contracts per bundle would be 5 bucks.  So you with 50 bucks could have 10 contracts... I take your 50 bucks and think I made a good trade...

Tomorrow UBER says they partnered. (A very real possibility) and it revalues the company at 75 billion dollars or so which is 20x it's current share price of like 200 and now you have the right to buy 10 bundles of 100 shares at 100 dollars per share  and you could immediately sell that on the market for profit. So you spent 50 bucks but in the end will make (1,000 x 100 dollars) so 100,000 dollars from 50.  **But people will buy that right from you for that much so you don't have to actually purchase the shares.**  so the price of that contract would be 100 (with a little sugar on top for how much time is left on it) x100 per contract. Now what if the expiry of this contract was tomorrow. Is it very likely that the valuation of $GOEV will be 100 tomorrow? No so that would be dumb to even buy for any money. but what about in 2 years. Well that's way more likely and so the price will change based upon the likelihood of the sp achieving these prices..

Lets say you spend 1000 dollars on a fuck ton of options for a strike price of 3 dollars on a stock that's worth 2. You pay .40  for them.  If that stock goes to 1.50. It is very likely that the price will go to .20  meaning you just lost 500 fucking dollars. Just like that.  Whereas you would only have lost 250 if you bought shares. Options also expire and Shares last foreverish. Options are timed play most of the time as in you think there is going to be a catalyst which moves the Share price.

Also, Open Interest means the amount of contracts out for a given strike price.  Sometimes there isn't enough volume to support that mega bag of super OTM option contracts you got on some weird stock no one knows about.  Make sure there is plenty of volume if its something you are going to move.

So you wanna buy options when the stock is down and sell them when it's up because you get your max benefits like shares. In fact you want to time options so that you time market sentiment or news.  Feel like a buyout is coming and it might affect the SP positively.. well yolo some calls brosky.  **Remember TA is virgin astrology. DD is the Lifestyle Chads live.**

Also, you will always put a limit price on your purchase or sales for these options.  A limit is just declaring you will sell these options for said price.  You can not just ""market buy"" options for as far as I know.

You will never owe money on Robinhood because you can only buy or sell calls or puts that are covered. Covered means you set the shares aside 100 of them until expiry.. naked means you have enough big baller money to say hey.. I'm good for it... Naked options are where the theoretically infinite loss comes from due to the fact that the share price could change infinitely... As in what if you needed 100 shares and there's only 101 and I knew you needed them so I could charge you whatever money I wanted... This is where naked shorting gets I to a problem...  Those calls you bought? Someone else is covering them or more likely a market maker worth billions is good for them. Robinhood wouldn't let you be that dumb...

The last piece here is that market makers have to maintain a certain amount of shares on hand per every option they sell.. this is related to the Delta which is the change in price over time... So a Delta of .5 means that for every 100 shares a market maker has to own 50 if the price goes over the strike price or itm at expiry a market maker has to have 100 shares per 1 contract sold. So it goes and just buys it at market.  There are a metric fuckton of calls that are sold on GOEV that are approaching being in the money and when they do mm have to buy which drives up the price... I  actually suspect a bunch of gambling addicted apes are jacking those numbers to Mars.  Making MM purchase millions of shares per every dollar of valuation.

For example there are currently 26523 contracts for 3/29 17.5c 26523 x100 means those contracts represent 2.6 million shares.  When the SP hits 16 and it becomes more likely that it will be in the money market makers will go to market and purchase 265k shares and that's just for that one strike price for 1 dollar.. AKA the beating heart of the Gamma Squeeze.

Edit 1 - if you think you're actually going to make profit check out this calculator in /u/dumbveganbitch's [response](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m41ghq/options_101_for_the_learned_ape_knuckles_off_the/gqsjog1?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3). Option value is just a description of a point in the trajectory of a rocket ship, should it actually take off this helps you figure out the optimal height to bail.

Edit 2 - [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m41ghq/options_101_for_the_learned_ape_knuckles_off_the/gqt2a2s?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) is a good question by /u/UncoolDad31. The price of an option contract is called the premium you can see how ~~share price had to go above the Strike~~ if the market **believes** the share price will go above the strike price and the premium you paid you will profit.  As the share price approaches the strike price and the velocity increases, raising the premium means the next buyer will take on the option at a higher price.  You get laid because you took the risk initially and are essentially creating a safer bet for the next person.  Or so they think. 

Essentially you bought tickets to the moon while the rocketship was on the launch pad and then it took off without exploding. Mid flight those tickets would be more expensive because there's more of a likelihood of getting there. But still some risk. By the time you reach the moon those tickets would reflect the least risk because you're already there. But maybe you haven't totally landed.  The best time to sell options  is on a spike right before the rocket explodes. There's always the last fool sitting in that 🚀 just make sure it's not you."

So Dan Gilbert founder of Rocket companies also went to Michigan State. He is also a loyal alumnis.

**Step 4.**  Buy the thing your enemy loves. (Art of War chapter 97)

Dan  Gilbert decides to throw his money bags around. After all what good is  having ""Fuck You Money"" if you dont use it. So what does he do. He goes  and buys the naming rights for Michigan St basketball team. So now every  time Mat looks at the thing he loves, the team he won a championship  with. It says "" Spartans presented by **Rocket Mortgage""**

>In both cases, I was LITERALLY told by my brokerage ON A RECORDED LINE that the decision was made to protect the Market Makers from having to hedge and in turn causing a gamma squeeze????

They are trying to limit new 0DTE options writing to prevent gamma squeeze on OPEX, but most brokers should still allow you to buy weeklies on $GME.

Looking at this graph, the Calls OI falls dramatically after 3/19

and with it the gamma amplification affect. With the 3/12 gone, that's almost 30% of the calls OI, but you still have 3/19 that accounts for another 30% of calls OI. The stimmy should be hitting your bank account in the next few days, there's still a chance for gamma.

I have no opinion on the short interest, maybe hedgies covered, maybe they printed shares out of thin air, I don't know. But they have been increasingly shorting via puts this past few weeks, this helps the gamma squeeze a bit though not as much as calls.

The graph shows that hedgies think 🦍🦍🦍 attention  span is limited to a few months a best, and they are betting heavily $GME will fall within a few weeks from now.

Here's some graphs courtesy of /u/HAVE__A_NICE__DAY, she's an ex hedgies quant who needs karma to post, if u like her graphs upvote her comments.\\

According to her : ""blue is the implied vol from puts, red is the implied vol from calls; higher IV means it's trading at higher premium, so puts are more expensive as you go further out in time. **so in the near term, puts are cheap because hedgies are too chicken to buy puts even thought they think the stock is <50 then in the medium-long term (july and onward) calls vs puts premiums flip because hedgies are buying more long-dated puts""**

I can't comment on the business transformation, I'm not an e-commerce expert, I don't know what it would take for $GME to compete with steam and etc. What I do know for sure is that, if $GME is bought by X% of float net buy EOD, share price will close up Y% EOD. You can amplify your share buying effect by buying calls at SPECIFIC STRIKES AND EXPIRIES. If you bought shares, it would take around 355 MM USD of net buy inflow to raise the price by 20% EOD, with ITM(safer)/ATM calls and the gamma amplification it would only take \~18 MM USD on the ITM/ATM calls 3/12 before 3/12 expiry.

With the 3/12 now  expired, the amp factor and general cascading gamma effect will be lower, around \~ 40 MM USD net ITM(safer)/ATM calls needed.(that's about 40,000 🦍🦍🦍 each with 1k 🍌🍌🍌)

# TL;DR 3/19 would be the last significant gamma squeeze opportunity based on current OI,🦍🦍🦍 together strong, YOLO-ers 🦍🦍🦍 buying 800C not helping.

Buying 1 Contract of 270C 3/12 on Friday afternoon 3/5  or Monday morning 3/8, at the price of 3-5USD per contract(100 shares) / $ 300 with **6x initial delta amplification** would have resulted in **42x amplification**  value of shares delta hedged by MMs in Thursday or Friday open of about $13,000. Since the delta of the contract increased 0.12 to 0.49 and the share prices rose from 137 to 260-290 within that time.

2021-03-13 05:53:40,Wallstreetbets,"Deutsche Telekom Recently I read the DD of [u/GermanRocketMan\_13](https://www.reddit.com/u/GermanRocketMan_13/) on WSB ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m25ors/why\_deutsche\_telekom\_has\_a\_132\_to\_194\_stock\_price/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m25ors/why_deutsche_telekom_has_a_132_to_194_stock_price/) ) where he promotes Deutsche Telekom and I am gonna promote that again.

The last couple years Deutsche Telekom has been the most boring stonk you can ever imagine. No volatility at all. BORING. But that is about to change this year. The stonk has potential. When I asked [u/GermanRocketMan\_13](https://www.reddit.com/u/GermanRocketMan_13/) why the stock would change after having a growth of barely 1 euro a year. he answered with the following:

A) Their US subsidiary shows really promising growth figures and a rather high market capitalization (which should reflect in their share price as 43% shareholder as well - at least sooner or later)

B) Finally, the delayed fibre glass rollout in Germany shows some growth and returns

C) Since they are in Germany a de-facto infrastructure monopolist (the competitors need to rent asset usage and maintenance from DTE, 5G is a solid growth driver

TBH these reasons are entirely understandeable and in my opinion corrrect, the results have shown this in their yearly report. A 20% growth in 2020.

Currently the shares are trading at precovid levels without the revenue growth, meaning they are potentially undervalued at this moment from a logical point of view.

Now one of the negative sides of things the user informs us about is debt. Currently Deutsche Telekom has a 100b debt. I disagree about this being a negative thing. As he talks about AT&T I will give AT&T's debt aswell. AT&T's debt is 190B. Other telekom companies have arround the same % of debt. For example the Dutch telekom company KPN has a market cap of 11B and a debt of 10B. The debt of Deutsche Telekom is not unusual in its sector. If anything, its completely normal.

After consindering all of this I see this stock as a value stock. A stock that has potential growth. And I can see you wondering why does it matter that the stock has changed from dividend stock to value stock? I can tell you thats only because of one reason. Options. Options are fucking cheap. Considering this stock has had no volatility for 20 years means that options are cheap as hell. I bought 100 June 17 2022 options with a strike price of 18 for 50 cents each. Currently they sell for 63 cents and thats still fucking cheap.

Now I do see the stock falling with 60 cents considering the ex dividend date at 29-03-2021. But after that I expect a stable growth to 20+ due to all of the reason mr [u/GermanRocketMan\_13](https://www.reddit.com/u/GermanRocketMan_13/) gives.

Keep in mind the stock currently trades at precovid levels while its revenue went up with 20%, and that 20% revenue growth wasnt expected last year, so it will most likely definetly shoot up.

If you disagree with this DD please tell me why so I can potentially get out of this position :P

Edit:

POS:  100 C18.00 17JUN 2022 for 50 cents ea (5k).

My own guess, based on nothing but the fact that I used to hold my breath a lot when I was little: it’ll be manipulated for years.

2021-03-13 04:42:03,Wallstreetbets,"There are more retail investors than ever, but we don’t have the power to tank markets. I saw a post of a person nervous that the economy is going to tank because of GameStop. This individual’s mind was so manipulated by the media that she truly thinks retail investors are the reason for GameStop and the possibility of a recession. The post was insulting against the common people, and it was extremely naïve. We can help the cause, but as you saw today and yesterday we certainly cannot move it or else we would have. All we do is help bullish institutions by HodLing a stock that we like. 

I also see a lot of articles saying that retail investors are essentially the cause of hedge funds losing money and 401(k) stocks just doing their average thing. Meanwhile we’re making 100%-300% returns because we see past the bullshit and don’t trust the system. This is infuriating to me and I don’t think it gets a enough of attention. Gme dropped from 348 to 178 before I could take a snapshot of my gains...yeah we don’t have that type of power. We have a different power...buy and hold a stock we like. 

There are some really smart apes on WSB here and some really dumb apes. We don’t have the ability to pum* GME, we just make it A LOT harder for you to dum* it. The reason for that is because we are fearless and re*arded and we like the stock. We have learned not to panic sell (more of us at least).

My point is figure it the fuck out and stop patronizing over 9 million people by telling the public that we are some godly entity with extreme power. If you’re out there hedgies please listen: figure out your own problems that your own greed got you into and stop crying on live television. The only difference between retails then and now, is that we see right past your lies and are more aware of how to make money. We just do it legally. 

Three years ago no one thought a retail investor could be, not a force in the market, but a CHANGE in the market. What really grinds my bananas, is the fact that it is the billionaire hedge funds job to adjust and pivot to the macro level of market changes. All we do is buy and hold. You’re telling me that these dumb hedgies can’t figure out a way to legally work with that? Then they were never qualified to be in that position. 

GME made us woke. Now you have to figure out how to make money rather than manipulating the public with articles released 10 minutes before the price action actually happens. We will hold through your fomenting and your petty ass $1 price target downgrades to justify movement in the stock. 

Think about it...their argument is don’t let retail investors trade because it makes our job harder. It’s harder because they were less informed back then than they are now. We have to stop giving them freedom. It wont work....since we have social media to spread real truth. No way to hide information like they used to. If somehow they do find a work around that it would have to be done illegally and unconstitutionally. They cant take that route because it would be planet of the apes part seven or some thing."

There was an AI program predicting 100k+ full squeeze at 140% SI. This is the power of exponential growth - However this program is heavily extrapolated and doesn't take into account external factors such as Prisoners dilemma, there are also many probable flaws in the script.

 Let's do some simple maths (correct me if i'm wrong i'm trash at maths), We have a ""realistic SI of 600%, a difference of 460% or 4.6x) now lets interpolate the squeeze from January; $148 -> $347 -> $483 -> $1k+ (likely would've been higher), now lets extrapolate our current situation $265 -> $ 621.3 (\[347/148\]x265) -> $864.8 (\[483/347x621.3) -> $1790+ (\[1,000/483\]x864x8). Now lets take into account the 4.6x short interest - 1790x4.6 = $8234+. Take this with a grain of salt. This calculation (like the AI model) is heavily extrapolated and does not take into account the situations present during the squeeze in January such as the 9 figure volume that drove GME up + Gamma squeeze we may or may not have the same factors in the same squeeze today. However what I can say for certain is that this squeeze will be LARGER than the one in January due to real SI being 600+% (remember exponential growth - the higher the SI the even greater the price)."
2021-03-13 04:23:28,Wallstreetbets,"$HRB H&R Block - Buy some leaps (Part 2) Last month I wrote a post on why I'm buying $HRB leaps ([Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llok83/hrb_hr_block_buy_some_leaps_and_forget_about_em/)). My main reasons were: 

1. Pivot from brick & mortar to digital which could lead to higher sales multiples
2. Their $3.5b stock buyback program which still has $600m to go and will run through June 2022 (for reference: their current market cap is $3.84b)

Today, H&R Block announced 4 new Vice Presidents that will help drive the next phase of growth for the company. Among them are:

Karisa Booker, who previously led a complete consumer data transformation of AMC's marketing

Scott Runkel, who was head of product at Walmart and led the team responsible for ""defining quality standards for digital products."" 

These appointments reaffirm H&R Block's commitment to a digital transformation.

In addition to pivoting to digital, I believe that HRB's new focus on small businesses will greatly improve its bottom line. Some of you might wonder, there over 200 million tax paying individuals in the USA but merely 30 million small businesses, why should they focus on small businesses?

I think the answer is quite simple: most **individuals only file their taxes once a year,** and there are plenty of free do-it-yourself options for them. On the other hand, **businesses pay taxes year-round.** Payroll, sales tax, income tax, bookkeeping, many of which will require services that could generate more revenue compared to individuals doing their income tax one time a year.

HRB is expected to bring in $3.55b of revenue in 2021. Currently, it has a PS ratio of **1.42**, compared to their competitor Intuit (TurboTax)'s **13.65**. Intuit Inc ($INTU) trades at $395 with a market cap of over $108b. There's no doubt in my mind that the upside will be tremendous if HRB can successfully pull off the transformation. 

HRB released earnings on March 8th and reported a -$1.17 EPS for the quarter, beating the consensus estimate of -$1.29. The call transcript can be found [here](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/03/09/hr-block-hrb-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcript/).

Fun Fact: HRB's CEO Jeff Jones was briefly the President of UBER in 2017 but quit during the #DeleteUber movement which took aim at the company's gender bias and toxic culture in the workplace. Jeff cited ""differences over beliefs and approach to leadership"" as his reason for resigning. Four years later, under Jeff's leadership, HRB scored 100% on the Corporate Equality Index and is recognized as one of ""Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality.""

2021-03-13 04:16:38,Wallstreetbets,"QFIN - DD - Big Banana Play - Earnings on 3/15 *Join me on this rocket ship named QFIN.*  🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 
____________
**EDIT: Many people have brought up concern that this stock has already tripled and might be played out. I strongly disagree - from a valuation standpoint it is still an amazing buy. It wasn’t the cash flow or loan quality keeping the price down - it was the regulatory risk. As that risk diminishes it will grow to reach it’s fair valuation, which is around 50 using even a conservative growth rate in a conservative FCFE. The real risk is new regulations, or a bigger impact of the current ones, hence why I spent most of this DD talking about them. Right now the market is pricing in regulations wiping out about half of their revenue sources, which I strongly disagree with.

The earnings call is Monday at 9PM EST, which is Tuesday morning for QFIN in China. The numbers will be interesting but the real catalyst will be management’s discussion of the impact of regulations. Make sure to place all bets by then!**
______________

I have ventured out of my usual territory in my hunt for an exotic rocket ship-shaped banana, and I’ve got good news for all ape-kind: I’ve found one. Here’s my DD (whatever that means). 

Ticker: **QFIN**, AKA ""360 Digitech"". They are a Chinese Fintech company. Currently trading around $31.50. Market Cap is around 4.8 Billion. Very few people in America have heard of them. PE is less than 10, growth is insane, plenty of cash on the balance sheet, low leverage, etc. From a fundamentals or cashflow analysis, this is a banana mine. 

**Here's their business model:**

*First*, they use their online presence to advertise loans to the rapidly-growing Chinese middle class.

*Second*, they use their proprietary risk-assessment tools to analyze the credit-worthiness of the applicants. They also have proprietary identification tools to help prevent fraud and simultaneously speed up the loan process (this is a bigger deal than it sounds like due to the strong desire for convenience in lending) 

*Third*, they partner with banks to supply the capital for the loans. 

*Fourth,* they service the loans and deal with recovery in case of defaults.

The business model is important because in order to understand why this is an amazing buy you also need to understand where their revenue comes from. It's not just loan interest as you would expect.

**But first, let’s talk numbers.** 2017 Revenue: *175 million* 2018 Revenue: *3.75 Billion* 2019 Revenue: *6.99 Billion* TTM: *9.19 Billion* (TTM means trailing twelve months)

Obviously that’s insane growth. Most apes can’t even count that high. 

And yet, despite that growth, their P/E ratio is a measly **9.4!** *(P/E is a measure of how high up tree us apes must climb to reach banana, lower number = banana more soon)* **That’s less than half the P/E of the S&P 500** *(P/E: 27.5*), **despite having significantly more growth.** 

To understand why the stock is still so cheap, let’s talk about why dumb apes might *NOT* want to buy it. 

Firstly, I assume most of you haven’t bought it yet because you have never heard of it. Do a search for QFIN on reddit – it’s next to impossible to find mention of it here. Furthermore, the trading volume is extremely low…. And most of the ownership is institutional. A few hedge funds, sure, but mostly ETFs, which is exactly what’s caused this great buying opportunity. As most Chinese Fintech stock prices have struggled lately with regulations (with the exception of this week), QFIN is relatively immune from the changes. QFIN has only gone down because most of the ownership is through the sector ETFs, which have been dragging QFIN down with them. Only recently did it buck the trend and move away from its sector's performance, in large part because people are just now starting to notice it.

This is a misunderstood company with obvious value. The play here isn’t that there’s extra value - the value is obvious to everyone - the play is that the “problems” are being significantly exaggerated and misunderstood… so rather than tell you where the deep value is, I will instead focus on why the doubters are wrong and why QFIN is uniquely placed in its sector. 

**First Reason for Doubt – Winnie the Pooh.** The Chinese Fintech industry has recently been slapped with some extra regulations that I had to get my mandarin-speaking wife to translate for me. 

One regulation is that for microlending transactions involving banks and partners, the partners (in this case, QFIN) must contribute at least 25% of the capital. Here’s a breakdown of the rules: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-20/china-imposes-further-caps-on-online-lending-amid-clampdown](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-20/china-imposes-further-caps-on-online-lending-amid-clampdown). *The stock tanked 30% when this happened.*

**Why it doesn’t matter:** According to QFIN’s CEO, Wu “Cock Slapper” Haisheng, *“Currently, the outstanding balance of the outstanding loans issued through our micro lending subsidiary, accounts for less than 1% of the total loan balance, and joint lending accounts for around 0.01%. Therefore, based on our personal evaluation, the new rules will have little impact on our loan origination business.”* 

Another new regulation is that online lending can only be done with banks that are established in the same province as the applicant. This is no problem – QFIN has a multitude of partners in each region. There are other new regulations coming down the pipeline (capital requirements, etc) but QFIN is well capitalized and capable of overcoming all the known issues. 

**Second Reason for Doubt – Default Risk.** There is concern that the loan default rate will be high, especially if China’s economy crashes, and that this will destroy the value of the company similarly to what happened to US banks with bad mortgages in 2008.

**Why it doesn’t matter:** First of all, *sack up.* 

Now that we’ve covered that primary reason, the fact of the matter is that default risk will always be a thing for banks. But QFIN isn’t a bank. *(Actually, they technically do have a banking charter in case they have to become one for due to new regulations, but they aren't currently using it.)* Remember their business model I mentioned earlier? 

*Now consider this:* 

Remember that 9.9 billion revenue for the trailing twelve months? Of that 9.9 billion, 2.3 billion is interest income. *(600mm interest expense).* Meanwhile, **they’re receiving 8 billion in service revenue**. (source: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QFIN/financials?p=QFIN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QFIN/financials?p=QFIN)) They’re bringing in far more money from loan origination commissions and the SaaS fees for their credit analysis than they’re bringing in from actual interest income. In other words, they aren’t a bank. What’s even more important is that QFIN literally does have the best proprietary software, as evidenced by the default rates of their loans. Compare QFIN’s loans defaults to FINV’s, who shot up *90%* yesterday after their earnings call. Go to slide 17: [https://ir.360shuke.com/static-files/6ffd9815-c5d3-478e-81df-0f4b3eb1ad0f](https://ir.360shuke.com/static-files/6ffd9815-c5d3-478e-81df-0f4b3eb1ad0f) 

If you’re too lazy to click the link, the TL DR is that QFIN’s historical defaults for every tranche is significantly lower. 

Another facet to consider is that even if their interest income does drop significantly, their operating margin is strong and, more importantly, improving. Despite their revenue increasing significantly, “Total operating expenses, excluding provisions were roughly flat Q-on-Q but decreased 33% year-on-year. The year-on-year decline mainly reflects significant improvement in operational efficiency” – CFO Alex “Oh God Please No Not My Face” Xu 

**Third Reason for Doubt – uNaUdiTeD fInAnCiALs**

OK so this is the best criticism the bears have. It’s also the most nebulous. 

A few things to think about: 

This is a Chinese company with Chinese consumer loans on their balance sheet. The QFIN ticker is an ADR. I’m not an accountant, but AFAIK all of the Chinese fintech companies without a US presence use unaudited financials. I don’t think it’s that weird. 

Speaking of accounting, QFIN has a history of overestimating expected losses. *In other words, they used pessimistic estimates that make their financials look worse than they really are.* Back in 2Q2020, Chinese regulators slapped a cap on the interest rate of internet-sourced loans. Some of QFIN’s loans at the time were above that rate, meaning they were impacted. An unscrupulous CFO would not have marked down the loans in anticipation of a decrease in value due to the new, lower interest they would be receiving*. QFIN did the opposite – they devalued the loans by too much* (mostly because they overestimated the default rate). “...the high take rate for capital-light model in the third quarter, maybe partially contributed to a reversal of the charge in the second quarter.” – Ethan “Prolapse King” Wang, paraphrasing something the CFO took two minutes to explain when asked why the loans were doing better than anticipated after being devalued.

**What risks are there still?**

First and foremost, macroeconomic risks. As the Chinese consumer fares, so does QFIN. I view this as a good thing, not a bad one, but it does constitute a risk. Additional regulation from Winnie-The-Pooh represents a risk too, but it looks like, for now, that storm has mostly passed. My take is that the Chinese regulators seemed to have a hard on for fucking up Ant Group – a spinoff of Alibaba. Jack “Actual Vampire” Ma had mouthed off publicly about regulations and so the CCP went after him with even more regulations after disappearing the guy for a month. Ant Group focuses more on microlending, but QFIN’s stock, as another Chinese Fintech company, got dragged down by the bears despite not really being affected. Ant group is finally approved for their IPO, so it looks like Winnie’s red rocket for regulation is rapidly retracting.

**Any big banana showers coming soon?** YES! **Earnings call on 3/15!** QFIN has a history of smashing earnings estimates. If QFIN has even half the success of FINV, who went up 90% on the day of their earnings call, then it’ll be bananas for everyone. Apes taking a rocket ship to banana planet. 

If you still aren’t convinced just look at the fucking fundamentals you god damn baboon. 

TLDR: I like the stock. 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀

2021-03-13 04:16:16,Wallstreetbets,GME Diversified Update 💎🙌🚀 
2021-03-13 04:13:40,Wallstreetbets,Still holding and buying more. Here comes that stimmy check. 
2021-03-13 03:49:03,Wallstreetbets,"Simplying Law DD series - NSCC rule 18 and GME Alright my first DD hit well, but I've got the impression all those after it are essentially not plain enough. I'm going to try and take a different approach and simplify as much as possible.

Not financial or legal advice, any assumptions drawn are your own, hell I might and probably am wrong on things (have been before) and if I am, do your part - please tell me and I'll update.

This will be the first in a series and we'll start with a simplified DD on Rule 18 of the NSCC rules, as this forms part of the 'disorderly market' rule spotted where people are afraid the NSCC and friends will just sit back and let the 'participants' mess with trying to prevent the MOASS, ironically, for fear of creating a disorderly market their members already made.

I mean we know they've already done that with GME as other excellent DD shows, but let's get into it.

Rule 18. This rule applies **only** when the NSCC declines / ceases to act for a 'participant'. OK great but what does that mean and what causes this?

The rule states the NSCC will cease to act should a participant become a Defaulting Member, or undergo a Defaulting Event. i.e. the NSCC determines that member either can't settle a trade based on their funds or made a really stupid decision or multiple decisions on a trade or actions involved in it. This means guess what? We block your access in the market and control your portfolio until it's resolved using this rule.

The list of who this affects is looong. Pretty much anyone with a relationship to the NSCC. For ease for us apes, this affects entities such as Citadel (member). Anyone can apply as any kind of member though, provided they are FATCA certified and have a Cybersecurity confirmation and get approved (i.e. many more than you might think).

Side note: those we suspect are responsible for GME are still members. They might have gone through a Defaulting Event (January?), but as they aren't insolvent and are active in the market, it's safe to assume these rules aren't in play. Even if they get kicked out, this isn't FUD relating to payment if the market goes crazy, more on this later.

Onto the rule. So the NSCC thinks you fucked up or you did, or both and you're either a dreaded Default Member / went through a Defaulting Event. What now? 

Unless the NSCC board says otherwise, on their notice being delivered, any CNS trade, Balance Order trade, Special Trade or Foreign trade, Long or Short position(s) for an OW Obligation that was entered for a CNS Accounting Operation, any cash relating to an OW adjustment and uncompleted cash ACATS transaction are the fuck up's responsibility.

*Special mention: fuck Special Trades. Literally defined as security trades between members only and it's allowed. Ripe for manipulation if you ask me.*

I know what you're thinking. What does any of that mean?

The thing about legal documents, they'll make up a bunch of definitions on the first page, which then refer you to many different pages to explain a definition. Then they expect you know what they're talking about 100 pages later to bore your ass into not looking it up.

Fortunately, I have nothing better to do. Or maybe I do, but I'm a retard. For ape understanding, this is basically saying anything you're on the hook for the moment our letter of bye bye is delivered, you're responsible for.

Oh no, does this mean they won't pay for the GME squeeze? **Nope.**

Put simply, this is the NSCC's way of clawing back as much money from that member's fuck up as possible before paying the remainder of what they can't liquidate from them first. 

It also states any net loss will be debited to the member, meaning they pay it first in accordance with their rules and get whatever they can when they're liquidated. Not only that, any sums due to the stupid member from other members will also be used to close them out.

*This makes the SLD filing that much more pronounced in my view, as they think even this risk isn't enough to stop members making stupid decisions.*

For instance, all the following rules gives the NSCC the right to take control of that member's entire NSCC and friends holdings to sort things out. 

The rule also states they will focus on settlement, not profit or loss. The **only** reason they will not just fire sell / buy is if they think it's related to fraud; or would cause a disorderly market to genuine market participants. 

What I think they mean by this is imagine Blackrock took out an uncharacteristic fat risky short position which dived, and then suddenly the NSCC liquidated their GME position on the bid and the stock tanked before the squeeze and allowed shorters to cover at low prices due to the low volume. 

You'd be furious as you were affected by some third parties stupid decision. That's why they allow it at their **discretion** instead. They'll probably buy the shorts or sell the longs at some point, but they also don't want to cause a crash / surge in any stock.

Let's face it, at this stage a risky, double, tripled etc down short position in GME would likely cause the NSCC to buy at any price, as they'd see what's coming and was only ever being delayed by their members if they hold this position, as they continue to eat billions in interest. 

Pulling the band aid off quickly may be the better approach if you don't face the risk of becoming insolvent and the loss is theoretically infinite.

The rule therefore has no impact on the NSCC stepping in and causing / preventing the squeeze for GME. If anything, if a member triggers this rule I'd argue it helps it.

TLDT: this rule is like the NSCC's version of an intervention for that loved one you know is a gambling addict. You take away their cards and cash, sell their damn car if you need to and collect owed money from their 'friends', and pay off the rest yourself until you get them paid off. Then, you never let them into the casino again.

Edit: not even removing the TLDT mistake or the misspelling of simplifying as it shows I belong here"

That being said, everyone knows this brand. It was ahead of it’s time, but only for a very short time, when it came to camera quality and capabilities. As smartphones got better and better it started to deteriorate their sales as more could simply use their IFIN and Samscumb phone.

That brings us to the present. They are pivoting to a subscription model which has grown from new to 760,000 paid subscribers in approximately one years time since they pivoted their focus. This shit ass company’s market cap is only around 1.6B even after its present rally from $7 to around $11. Its short float is nothing great-approx 11% if this Google didn’t lie to this dumb retard, but that’s plenty to build on. This small cap target is the perfect candidate to diamond hand the hell out of and make a run towards Ape Heaven. GoPro has learned from their mistakes and focused on cutting costs while staying afloat. Now that we are REOPENING, this could end up being the perfect play as people begin to travel, climb mountains, skydive, snowboard nude down Mount Everest, and other shit GoPro people do that this ape wouldn’t touch.

Many a DD has been posted discussing the numbers behind the price changes in GME. I have read a number of them and it's one of a few reasons that GME will pay me twice. However, I have seen very little discussion on something that should be shouted from the goddamn rooftops. Something that would mean GME might pay me 10 more times.

* Collusion!

No self respecting media outlet will ever publish an article on hedgefund collusion. While I have seen comments here and there about price manipulation and short ladder attacks, almost no one in the media is talking about how several HFs are acting as a group right now. 


My first premise for this belief is based on Melvin capital receiving a cash injection from Citadel.  In what world does a professional financial institution look at another professional financial institution, that is bleeding money, and say, ""you guys just lost a shitload of cash, here have some of mine in exchange for..."" no article I have seen has really covered what was received in exchange for the injection. As far as I can tell, it was just friends helping friends. Which for me is a giant sign saying, ""Collusion found here! Come back on Thursday for the Melvin special"" 


My second premise for collusion is the message consistency in the media. Nearly every media outlet gets their pocket lined by one hedgefund or another. Jim Cramer admitted as much in his video explaining how hedgefunds manipulate media to influence stock prices. I don't believe that each institution practices manipulation on an individual basis. You would see a lot more conflicting messages if they did. The consistency of the message from the media on GME is astounding. They all have slightly different reasons and theories, but all of them have the exact same conclusion, the shorts covered. **BULL FUCKING SHIT**. 


My third and final premise for collusion, is more speculative. I believe that the second wave of GME is another institution winding down their short position. If they can loan each other money to keep their friends liquid, then they can certainly all get together and find a cost effective way to exit their shorts. I believe this is what's happening right now. I think they fucked up so bad, that they have to collude in order to unwind this position or they lose all of their money. 


In conclusion


They are colluding on their exits so they don't pay out 10k a share, so they don't have to sell all of their other positions to cover, so the insider whale douchebags can pull out their money and replace it with dumb money to pay us a pittance with, so they can all survive when they fucked up so badly, so they don't get a slap on the hands from uncle Sam, and finally so they can once again fuck the retail investor.

2021-03-13 02:11:39,Wallstreetbets,"Canoo was algo attacked today probably to cover shorts https://ibb.co/r7YhN6N

I am posting in WSB as I honestly believe it meets the criteria in terms of market cap and retail interest. This post may get auto-deleted or mod-deleted. If it disappears just know that’s it’s not of my fact. I’ve been covering Canoo for a few months so check my post history if you need. 

**Context:** Canoo released the presentation of its new truck on March 11th (YouTube, Instagram etc.). A great new catalyst which was covered by multiple media. Price action went rapidly up after the stock been hammered below $10 on the recent tech growth correction. 

**Options context:** For the last couple of weeks I have noticed that put/call ratio was **massively** skewed towards calls volume i.e. I’m talking near 10 to 1 every single day. Option interest also much bigger on calls side. Although the price of the IV was relatively “cheap” around 100% (for a new public company with long duration growth). 

**Weekly price increase:** The stock went from $11 on Monday until exactly $16.00 today... until something funny happened... [weekly graph](https://ibb.co/Wfhtwm9)

**What I believe happened:** Some big money was too short on the stock that started running way too fast for a mispriced implied volatility of just 100%. The heat intensified and people were more than ever buying calls (like 90% 95% of options volume were calls again). Also these calls are concentrated onto March expiry as there are no weeklies on this name. 

**What I believe they did:** They had to cover their shorts as money was bleeding fast with no sign of any slow down (Canoo was even up 5% PM when all tech growth was in the red). Massive sell wall at 16.00 with more than 100K on the offer. But even after it dropped the stock wanted to moon again and people were still buying calls relentlessly. **They activated the ultra algo** in order to drop the share price as fast and as low as possible in order to trigger stop losses on calls. Specifically on MAR 15CALLS. 

**Evidence:** Look again at the [screenshot.](https://ibb.co/r7YhN6N)

At time 12:59:50 and 12:59:51 you will see that within **one second** big quantities were bought at the lowest prices of the day (0.35 to 0.45) then 3 seconds later it went back up to regular prices and quantities. This is the evidence that someone has triggered a sell off on Canoo stock to trigger stop losses on MAR 15C for the algo to buy absolutely everything it could within 1 second. It happened so fast that you couldn’t even feel it. Only an algo was capable to perform this. I had to dig into time/sales to decipher what happened.

**ELI5** Why buy calls if they are short? HF was about to lose too much money on shorting Canoo a retail darling that wants to moon hard. They couldn’t control the price action anymore. They had to hedge their short by getting long calls and mitigate their potential loss. They scooped more than 1K MAR 15C at around 0.42 average price and within the next few seconds it went back to 0.80 and then minutes later to 1.00. All this happened at plain sight before you had time to blink. Now don’t expect media talking about this kind of stuff. They too busy witch hunting retail. This post may also get censored anyway.

I’ve tried my best to make this a quick and simple post. I’ve explained it at the best of my understanding. Obviously not a recommendation to buy sell hold any security. I shared public data. My interpretations could be erroneous. 

**Bonus S3 short data** on Canoo: 
short interest is $152M
10.33M shares shorted
10.33% of Float
9.37% S3 SI% Float
47.82% fee.
Shares shorted up +1.6 million shares, worth $23 million, +13.3%, last week.

**TLDR** HF got caught asleep at the wheel shorting Canoo. Retail likes it too much and wanna moon. They had to buy next week calls ASAP and as cheap as possible. Used algo ultra fast. One second later: thank you very much for cheap calls."

2021-03-12 23:50:14,Wallstreetbets,"$LUMN - Lumen Technologies (Formerly CenturyLink) by u/uknj **$LUMN - Lumen Technologies (Formerly CenturyLink) by** u/uknj

Lumen Technologies (formerly CenturyLink) is a telecommunications company which provides products and services related Network, Cloud, Security, Voice, and Managed Services to enterprise, SME, and retail customers. Lumen is aiming to position itself as a key infrastructure partner underpinning public and private cloud, edge computing and fiber connectivity. LUMN is building its services with 4 key areas in mind:

1. Physical assets and infrastructure – These include fiber, hardware and facilities.
2. Software managed networking – This is a network-as-a-service (NaaS) offering that can be leveraged to connect organisations with
3. Hybrid Cloud – These include private cloud and datacentres, colocation services and connections with public cloud service provider partners.
4. Lumen Orchestrator – This is the orchestration solution that allows for the management and control of the various services that are offered.

I am currently bearish about LUMN with no immediate plans to invest (although in the event of the price dropping into the single digits, I would re-evaluate this position). There are a few key reasons for this, but I encourage you to read the full bullish, bearish, and neutral considerations in the rest of the post:

1. LUMN earns a significant portion of its revenues from legacy offerings e.g., traditional telephony. This revenue stream has been decreasing YoY for the last few years and this is likely to continue.
2. Despite the above, there are significant areas of potential for LUMN – specifically in their Edge Computing and software defined networking offerings (see Organisational Summary below). Edge Computing is only a small % of current revenues and while it is likely to grow, it will take time to significantly grow these streams. I view the Edge Computing growth as a slow burner and small market, but this will grow at a rapid rate in the future.
3. LUMN has a high level of debt, and while they have managed to de-lever and reduce interest rates, the amount of debt is still significant. When accounting for intangibles and goodwill, the level of liabilities is roughly 1.6x the value of assets (although specifically looking at long term debt this is a healthier picture at 70% of non-current assets).
4. Revenues have been consecutively down for the last few years and are unlikely to show a significant turnaround next year. This is somewhat mitigated by improvements in margin which are expected to continue and a healthy level of free cash flow at $2,770 although this has been declining YoY.

Please do have a read of the Bull, Bear and Neutral points in the detailed post below for a more balanced and in-depth view.

# Key Data

All data believed to be accurate as of 05/03/2021

* Price = $13.45
* P/E = -12x
* EPS = -2.12 (dil)
* Forward P/E = 8.5x

# Detailed Analysis

**Bull Considerations**

* $LUMN are well positioned to become significant players in high potential markets – specifically fiber and underlying network infrastructure, NaaS and Edge computing.
* $LUMN has several verticals it can offer to customers including Hybrid Cloud, Connected Security and Collaboration. These can be leveraged to grow revenue streams in parallel (i.e., cross selling products and services to customers).
* Successfully managed to de-lever the company from previous debts. While this is a great deleveraging trend and a significant reduction in interest rates by redeeming outstanding 5.375% and 7.00% notes1 and replacing them with 4% bonds, the level of debt is still a concern (see bearish consideration item 1).
* The dividend from $LUMN has been consistent and relatively attractive (although on a yield basis this is less so if the price continues to rise). The board are committed to continuing the dividend payment and at the present time it can be safely assumed that $0.25 will be paid per share per quarter for the remainder of FY21. Dividend yield should not be the primary reason for going into $LUMN as yield is \~ 7% (at a stock price of $13.70). In the event of a dip to single digits, the dividend becomes extremely attractive and is worth considering (at a yield of > 9%).
* Despite the overall reduction in EBITDA (see bearish item 4), EBITDA margin has improved and is likely to continue improving into FY21 due to cost cutting measures being pushed by executive leadership.
* Significant number of insider purchases throughout 2020 with one sale.

**Bear Considerations**

* Overall, there are likely to be better candidates for returns on investments than LUMN, while LUMN is in a number of attractive areas, it is still growing revenues and these are unlikely to materialise in any significant manner over the next year or two. See competitive advantage section for additional details.
* $LUMN holds significant long-term debt of $31,837 (down from $34,694 in 2019). This debt is primarily due to $LUMN’s all in play to fiber (at the expense of 5g) when they purchased Level 3 Communications for $34,000. It is worth noting that $LUMN has not had an issue with either paying down debt and paying dividends with its current cash flow.
* $LUMN earns a substantial portion of revenues from legacy services. These include voice ($391 in 4Q20) which approximates to 29% of overall revenue. As can probably be guessed, this has regularly declined over the course of FY20. While not all the voice revenue is likely to be a “legacy” product, I am considering it as such as there are likely to be other legacy revenue streams. (N.B. According to $LUMN legacy revenues primarily include voice, private line (including special access), switched access and other ancillary services.)
* $LUMN is facing lengthening sales cycles for its products and services as their customers (and more likely organisations in general) continue to evaluate new infrastructure needs and delay purchasing unless necessary. This is likely to continue until at least 2022 as cost pressure at organisations globally push down purchases.
* Revenues are down both QoQ and YoY with EBITDA down YoY and there is no expectation that they will increase next year with best estimates at stable revenue / EBITDA and worst-case a reduction. YoY revenues have decreased for both FY20, FY19 and FY18, although the rate of decrease has reduced over time.
* Free cash flow while still high is reducing over time and will continue to do so as LUMN are likely to continue to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and paying off its long-term debt.
* Executive compensation (specifically focussing on CEO compensation) is above average for the industry at $17M (compared to an average of $10M for similar sizes). It is worth noting that when comparing against larger companies or those listed as competitors, this level of compensation was not unusual. Compensation did stabilise as performance dropped, however, no decrease in compensation occurred despite the decrease in earnings. While not initially a problem, if the results do not turn around, and there is no decrease in compensation, there is a concern that executive pay is no longer in line with the company’s results.

**Neutral Considerations**

* Long term credit rating (Moody’s) – Ba3: Speculative with substantial - high credit risk.
* Speculative Grade Liquidity Ratings – SGL-2: Good liquidity, will be able to meet their obligations over the next 12 months through mostly internal resources but may rely on external sources of committed financing.
* Southeastern Asset Management has increased its position in $LUMN as of Dec 2020. It is worth noting that they have lost (\~25%) on the investment to date2. Despite this, they remain bullish on the overall prospects as the CEO has tightened controls on costs and margin improves. Additionally, they believe $LUMN can monetise several segments they are in (specifically fiber), and that as a multiple of free cash flow (< 5 at the time of investing) is an attractive valuation. As a final point, they have signed an NDA with $LUMN, and this indicates a higher and more “activist” level of engagement3. I have listed this as neutral despite the bullish sentiment of SAM, as their track record for the last year has not been great compared to the overall market.
* $LUMN will be seeing reduced subsidy revenue (from CAF II – A US initiative to improve connectivity) with subsidies declining to $20 by 2022. However, $LUMN believes their investment into providing this connectivity is likely to add to revenue that will make up for the loss in subsidy.

# Organisation Summary

Essentially Lumen Combine underlying infrastructure with platforms (i.e., cloud PaaS) and Applications (SaaS):

1. **Adaptive Networking** – High performance network connectivity i.e., on premise private lines, Content Delivery Network, fiber internet connectivity, direct cloud connections (where they provide corporate WAN infrastructure a direct link to Cloud) and managed networking services / consulting.

* Content delivery network market growth is forecast to grow at 14% till 20254.
* Fiber Internet connectivity in the US grew at 12% from 2019-202022 and will likely continue to grow at a similar rate for the next few years. Across the EU growth rates are largely similar for both coverage growth and subscriber growth5.
* Software defined networking offerings (Networking as a service) is an expanding industry and likely to see significant growth of 34% annually till 20266.
* Growth rates and industry sizes for private lines and direct cloud connections are not easily available. I believe direct cloud connections are a growth area and likely to grow at a reasonable 10-15% annually for the next few years (based on over all cloud growth, increase in colocation and deployment of data centres – see Hybrid Cloud below).

1. **Collaboration** \- VOIP, teleconferencing, collaboration solutions (e.g., file sharing and virtual meeting rooms all hosted by Lumen, but the products can be from vendors like Zoom, Webex Skype etc.), contact centres and calling services (e.g., traditional phone style calling both locally and internationally as well as toll free / business numbers. Also advanced emergency services support).

* VOIP is relatively mature industry with a CAGR of 12% (at best) till 20257. Personally, I think we can discount any mobile VOIP growth as I do not believe LUMN has offerings in this space and in my view, this would lower the effective CAGR with 8-10% looking a more reasonable target.
* Call centre growth is forecast to grow at 6% till 20278. The US houses over 60% of call centres globally, and this number is only going to decrease as increased internet penetration and decreased telecom rates drive the outsourcing of call centres9.
* Numbers and growth rates to traditional telephony are limited but I imagine that growth is probably negative. For toll free, business numbers and emergency services support, growth is likely positive but limited.
* Collaboration solutions are growing at a reasonably high rate of 13% till 202710. However, LUMN is limited to managing, implementing, running, and hosting products from other vendors as they do not sell their own.

1. **Connected Security** – Threat management (managed threat intelligence), managed SOC services, WAF and DDoS mitigation, managed firewalls, and professional services.

* The WAF market is expected to grow at 18% annually till 202211.
* The DDoS mitigation market is set to grow at 15% annually till 202612.
* The managed security services are expected to grow at a CAGR of 8% till 202513. While I think managed firewall growth is likely to be less than other managed security services (e.g., IAM, SOC etc), a growth rate of 4-6% is probable.

1. Edge Computing – Managed services, connections to both public cloud and private data centres, networking, colocation, cloud. Essentially connecting edge locations / end user servers to backbone infrastructure.

* Edge computing as an industry is forecast to grow at \~25% annually till 202514. However, it is currently a small market valued at \~ $ 2,000 in 20201. Edge computing as a market can be further subdivided into hardware, platform, and services. Hardware is expected to grow at the fastest rate of the three potentially reaching 40%15.

1. **Hybrid Cloud** – Cloud storage, disaster recovery (data replication and business continuity), hosting services, data centres, private and public cloud alongside consulting for cloud.

* The private cloud market is expected to grow at 29% annually till 2025. Private cloud growth will primarily be driven by businesses who wish to take advantage of public cloud capability with the addition of potentially more secure and customisable hosting resources. On-premises cloud growth will be significantly lower than provider hosted options (PaaS / IaaS) which are likely to hit 50%16.
* Hosting services are likely to increase in market size by 15% annually17.
* Deployment of data centres are likely to increase slowly over the next few years with a growth rate not likely to exceed 10% (estimated at 6% for 202118). Similarly, colocation services are likely to see a modest 14% CAGR19.
* Global cloud storage is expected to increase at a rate of 20% till 202520.

# Competitive Advantage

1. **Adaptive Networking:**

* Summary: A large revenue earner with solid growth potential. $LUMN is a large player in the infrastructure space and should be able to leverage that to provide organisations with NaaS and global fiber connectivity.
* From a coverage perspective (compared to Verizon and AT&T as of 2019), $LUMN serves 16% of the population, with Verizon and AT&T serving 17% and 41% respectively. It is worth noting that $LUMN covers more states than either21, 22. N.B. this view is for consumers but presumably also can also be applied to corporate coverage.
* $LUMN is relatively well positioned from a fiber perspective as they have a lot of “unique coverage” (i.e., locations served without significant competition) in the US and have coverage in Europe and Asia. They carry a large portion of internet traffic on their network backbone and have 180,000 locations globally which provide their customers direct access to $LUMN infrastructure. Additionally, they have direct connectivity to several cloud service providers and data centres. Compared to competitors, they appear to have the largest total fiber route23.
* The software defined networking offerings are an exciting growth opportunity and combined with the strong infrastructure position of $LUMN will mean that customers (particularly those that are multinationals and large enterprises) can utilise the network as a service offering to connect their enterprise infrastructure efficiently and effectively across the globe including connections from on-premises to cloud service providers.
* While competitors do exist, from both a software defined networking perspective (e.g., Fortinet, Cato etc.) and an infrastructure perspective (e.g. Verizon, AT&T etc.) $LUMN has the advantage of being a strong player in both areas with good partnerships with Cisco and VMWare.

1. **Collaboration:**

* Summary: Largely a legacy business and revenue generator for $LUMN. This will be a shrinking revenue area for $LUMN as the decline in traditional legacy telephony services is unlikely to be made up for by any growth in VoIP or collaboration solutions. Additionally, this area is a large revenue earner for $LUMN, and significant declines here would result in material impact to value.
* While implementing and managing VoIP, teleconferencing and collaboration solutions with partnered vendors (e.g., Zoom) are likely to show some little to moderate growth over the coming years, they will likely provide consistent revenue due to the underlying network requirements needed to effectively utilise such solutions.
* Traditional telephony services including contact / service centres and business telephony service revenues are likely to shrink over the coming few years.

1. **Connected Security:**

* Summary: The cybersecurity market is an exciting growth area which holds significant potential for $LUMN. However, it remains a small % of overall revenues and so revenue growth in-line with industry expectation will not materially impact the overall value of $LUMN.
* If $LUMN can leverage their verticals in the datacentre / cloud space to cross sell their security services this could see some reasonably large growth, but overall due to the small footprint of $LUMN in the cloud space presently, material value growth due to this vertical is likely be several years out.
* Additionally, $LUMN is not a recognised global player in this industry unlike Akamai or NetScout, and so will be at a disadvantage compared to incumbents with higher profile portfolios.

1. **Edge Computing:**

* Summary: This could be a strong growth area for $LUMN. Could be a way to take advantage of the potentially significant growth area of Edge computing. However, it is likely to significantly materialise only 1-2 years out with little revenue growth in this area prior to then as organisations slowly accept this paradigm shift. Additionally, it will be a highly competitive area that will require significant investment to grow and maintain an advantage.
* As of 23 Feb 2021, $LUMN claims they provide 60% of enterprise locations with <5ms latency to edge nodes. Their goal is 90% by the end of the year and their large fiber network leaves them at an advantage compared to competitors. (See Adaptive Networking).
* An example from the 4Q20 earnings call was SAP using their Edge infrastructure to bring SaaS applications closer to customers and bypassing unnecessary internet traversal.
* While $LUMN can leverage its underlying infrastructure and assets to push a solid offering, this is likely to be a highly competitive space with players including typical cloud service providers e.g. Microsoft, Amazon, Google and HPE as well as specialised players e.g. Mutable. Large cloud players will have both the hardware and software required to compete effectively with $LUMN while also being able to leverage their substantial public cloud technologies to gain an advantage.

1. **Hybrid Cloud:**

* Summary: If you are interested in taking advantage of private or public cloud growth then Lumen probably is not the best value even at its current multiple. This is due to low revenues (as a % of total revenues) from Cloud related activities. Additionally, this space is highly competitive and $LUMN does not appear to have the background or experience (it is working on growing its employee expertise) although they can potentially take advantage of their underlying infrastructure from their fiber and physical assets.
* Personally, I believe Private Cloud is not a significantly growing area with potentially some shorter term increase due to pandemic pushing a more remote working / access focus. However, longer term 3-5 years out, I think hybrid cloud will be the dominant focus as organisations transition from private cloud to increased public cloud usage. Only 3% of enterprises use private cloud exclusively24.
* If you are going to opt for growth within public cloud, there are higher growth options with AMZN, GOOG and MSFT although these are substantially higher in price. Alternatively, Cisco, HPE, or other smaller providers may work. A dedicated cloud provider will likely provide better value than $LUMN due to the low revenue share (see above).

All the stuff we've talked about and seen, but there was a part of me thinking that we was just in an echo chamber, parroting ourselves. Until today. All day I've seen a news article on yahoo with the title ""Trader arrested as Gamestop soars"" . I know because I clicked the article about 20 times. I was confused as it was just a story about a Japanese guy getting arrested years ago. I kept clicking the story thinking something was bugged. But now after market closes the title has changed. To how the gamestop situation echoes a situation years ago when someone was arrested. The intent is clear. Scare people away from GME. It reeks of desperation. They're grasping at straws. Apes we are winning."

2021-03-13 01:36:05,Wallstreetbets,"Why UWMC has Value in Both the Long and Short Term Full Disclaimer: Not financial advice, I eat crayons.

United Wholesale Mortgage is an amazing buy that I think has both long term and short term potential. I will admit, I don't know a lot about stocks, but when I look at UWMC I see value town for days. I wouldn't call this DD because I just googled stuff.

**Who Is UWMC and What Do They Do?**

UWMC underwrites loans for brokers, banks, and credit unions. They do it all- FHA, Conventional, VA, the works. Their primary business however seems to be with brokers. Now what is a mortgage broker? No really I had to google this to get a better understanding. Mortgage brokers essentially take your info, screen it, and then look at the variety of home loan options available to you and aim to get you the best deal in return (usually) for a small fee. Mortgage brokers currently make up a little over 20% of the housing market vs. 7% 2011 and 16% in 2019. They essentially help people find the best deal on the market to help finance their home, and seem to be popular among millennial homebuyers. With mortgage brokers shares growing in the mortgage space this gives UWM great growth potential (I think).

**What is UWMC's Edge?**

Now what differentiates them from other companies? Well one is their fast turnaround times. UWMC proprietary tech that allows for the quickest turnaround time in the market due to streamlined efficiency. That tech alone makes them convenient for the broker and home buyer. This makes the loan process insanely fast vs their competitors who can take a longer time to close the deal. They've built strong relations within the broker community and appear to have a symbiotic relationship with the brokers they work with.

**UWMC Ultimatum**

There's been a lot of speculation over that Chad Ishbia's ultimatum to the brokers- sign the addendum by 03/15 saying you will halt working with Fairway and RKT. Well 90% of their brokers signed it, so I think this narrative is overplayed quite a bit. Like I said, UWMC and brokers work together to profit in a symbiotic fashion. Brokers are the face and voice you see UWM directs them traffic, they each get a cut, both walk away happy with fast turnaround times/best deal for their customers. According to UWMC, RKT has gone out of their way to bypass broker's. RKT is better off offering them a rate, bypass the broker, make more money cutting out the middle man (I may be under simplifying this or have it wrong). Rocket Mortgage is not interested in working with individual brokers when they have an in house team to help keep it all in the family.

**The Value Short Term**

Short term I think we have a few key things coming up.

* [u/faisall1](https://www.reddit.com/user/faisall1/) is convinced there's a short squeeze, if you wanna see his DD on that it's here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3o6bu/uwmc\_part\_4\_when\_the\_squozes\_keep\_on\_squoozing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3o6bu/uwmc_part_4_when_the_squozes_keep_on_squoozing/) I hope this is why I've been getting fed red crayons.
* Addendum Deadline is 03/15, looks like a majority of brokers have agreed which at the very minimum shouldn't hurt their bottom line. Looks like a win-win for the UWM-Broker channel
* Russell 1000/3000 Addition on 03/22
* Q1 Earnings Report after destroying their Q4 numbers. Housing volume Remains low, demand remains high. Despite Treasury Yield + Mortgage Rate Increase I think we're gonna see good numbers here. Also I like dividends.

&#x200B;

**The Long Term Value**

The individual broker is not going away, UWM has made quick turnaround times standard for brokers and homebuyers increasing the speed and quality of service you get from an individual broker. The growth of the broker sector is a positive for both homebuyers and UWM, I like my quarterly dividends, and the stock is just way too undervalued here. Every analysis I see online has a target price of $11\~$13, so it's at a discount at $8.30 right now. UWM has rock solid financials. UWMC has a PE of 6.17 and PS of 3.84 vs. RKT with a PE 2.06 and a PS of 8.46. Look, I'm not the smartest guy, but I can clearly see that UWM has a distinct edge in the home loan market. I think UWM has a wide valuation between $11\~$16 in a fair market all things equal.

I took my tendies and yeeted them all into UWMC. 374 share and x3 $9 calls 05/21.

&#x200B;

TL;DR UWM has been feeding me red crayons, but I feel like it's gonna give me green ones soon. I like dividends because I'm big boomer."

Bruh, I'm Glad your back bruh,

Dude bruh I was so high bruh... I was so fuckin' high...

and everything was cool Mann and then like I smelled smoke brooo

Shit was on fire mannn  and it was the **50 day MVA** and it was over my head bruh,

you don't understand bro

# The 50 day MVA was over my head 

Today started out like many others, GOEV bulling out the gate and just destroying shit. We did this before. Released the hordes over ran silly sell walls, kicked in doors took plunder and moved on.  In the distance was the prize. Gleaming 16$.  It was the only thing between us and the sick GammaRamp Dildo of Naughty Gainz posting.

We ran up on it, Got pushed back, Ran up on it again and again got pushed back off the stage, Voltron jumps up, swerves fakes, and then does the Philadelphia eagle all over Gojira's face.

For the rest of the morning Voltron and Godzilla are fighting on a cliff edge for fucking hours.  Hours on this tightrope edge. Shit is going down. Couches are getting broken in half and thrown into the mc Donald's ball pit. The toddlers are running the daycare. The candy jar is empty at the nurses station. Fuck, I forgot its our anniversary again.

The party is on fire. There is no driver at the wheel.

But the crowd roars when Voltron drops a back cracker on Gojira.  Theres voltron kicking the shit out of a big lizard, people cheering from the balcony, hes looking hot. You're all smug looking at your mad gainz.   Gojira is all beaten up, getting tossed around.   Cup to Handle Voltron climbs on top of the ring and jumps arm out stretched, Gojira rolls out of the way and bam theres Mecha all dazed, Gojira starts winning some more fist fights, the mecha is sparking, slipping... loosing his groove...

Our Gamma Ramp is  still quite lopsided see the [comment](https://i.imgur.com/LIsnoKy.png) below by /u/krvrotmg.  OI is positive... intraday selloff is irrelevant below.

I bought the dip a bit. Won't lie.  The thesis is still in place...  We took a beating and continued to raise the price this is highly bullish. However, You might still be holding a gun, but admit it... you got a little nervous there didn't you. I'll write something deep and thinky bullish for Monday.

In the end I will give the big lizard this.

That was a pretty fucking smart move.

/[Jcw122](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jcw122/) in case the auto mod deleted my reply:  
 Like I state in my DD, EXPI reached platform maturity this year and by that, I mean that they began reaping the fruits of their investments and work. Their net income transitioned from negative to positive as the platform matured over the last few years. Look at their YOY growth in their agents, the company's revenue is driven by the number of transactions closed by their agents. So as the agents grow, the revenue grows. This company IMO should be worth 25B at the moment, minimum. It is not speculation like Zillow nor is it constrained to the US like Zillow is. EXPI is expanding globally and is going to be making all the TENDIES at a global scale. I mean look at these financials, any reasonable APE would know that this is solid. Other companies like Zillow, Redfin, etc are theory, this company is the  IRL PRACTICE.   


If you still don't believe in this, then you sir are a 🌈 🐻 ! Have a good day sir!

&#x200B;

 **TL;DR: Do not fucking hang on to dates and give others false hopes so they don't trigger the big red self destruct button when shit does not pan out they way you fucks fantasized.**

&#x200B;

Q: What is March 19 ? 

A: Quadruple Witching

&#x200B;

Q: Is it a guaranteed liftoff date and should you put your orders in for Lambos on 20 March ? 

A: No

&#x200B;

**Background:**

But why shouldn't we latch on to 19 March...

Well, imagine all the hedgies are in a circle formation and collectively walking this formation down the road. 

Q: What are they hiding in center of this formation and kicking down the road ?

A: A time bomb (shorted/counterfeit shares).

Now these hedgies are told, if they *leave the formation* (cover their positions) they will be *shot* (suffer huge losses) because when they leave the formation, the apes will be able to see the time bomb and become even more retarded.

Now each time one you retards throws a *run-away-from-the-bomb-free* *card* (sell GME) a hedgie can pounce on it and run away from the time bomb.

**Problem:**

Now when you give the young apes false hopes of with these dates, they grab onto their tiny nuts and wait for the ""GMEday"". And when it turns out to be a <100% gain day; they freak out and throw *run-away-from-the-bomb-free* *cards.* 

**Solution:**

HODL, that's right ! Just HODL. Trust the numbers and trust the process. There is no way these capping shitbags have covered their positions... read the DDs by apes with brains that have more wrinkles than mine.

2021-03-13 00:33:22,Wallstreetbets,"To anyone who invested significant life savings or taking out debt to go all in on GME I went all in on gme last time and held from $40 to $105. This time, I bought like 2 shares and rode them from $160 to $326. I wouldnt have really cared had these shares gone to shit.

Despite what many people who have a vested interest in this succeeding are telling you, a price increase to 800$ is not **certain.** A lot of shorts have already been and are being covered right now. The volume yesterday and today combined is the same as the total float. This is huge. The volume on Wednesday was 71mil., which is bigger than the actual float. While I am sure that the short interest right now is still very high, because this seems like free money to most hedgefunds a further price increase is not certain at all at these levels. Im confident that 90% of shares shorted at 40-90$ have already been squeezed out, causing the massive price increases to $340. The only way another short squeeze happens is if some insitution decides to make it happen by playing the long side and squeezing out the shares reshorted at 200-300$, but this would be very hard, since the price is already so high. Not impossible but NOT CERTAIN. Despite all the hivemind shit you hear on this sub. YOU NEED TO CONTROL YOUR RISK and if you're betting a large part of your life on this succeeding you should sell gme until movement in the stock doesnt dictate your financial security. Retailers are not driving the price anyway, so dont lose your life savings and go into debt because you saw a ""apes together strong"" meme or some dumb shit.  


The most ironic shit is that if you follow wsb advice you can never win because even if a squeeze happens, the posts here will tell you that ""its not the real squeeze, hold dont sell"", so you can never actually profit from it by selling to the shorts that need to cover. Selling to them is left up to some smart retailers and mainly the institutions that are playing the long game on this. Don't help them, HELP YOURSELF. CONTROL YOUR RISK. HAVE FUN BUT MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS DUMB AS FUCK.

TLDR: Another squeeze might happen but not certain. Make sure you know that, even if you wouldnt get this impression by browsing this sub. Don't bet your financial security on this.

Edit: The retard meme is more than a meme I guess :(

Edit2: Btw I still own one share for the meme but would be totally fine if it lost 80% of its value"

The article is from May referring to the first stimulus.  

I think this should be bigger news with most Americans receiving $1,400 next week.  Some people mention it is priced in but an inflow of some significant part of  the stimulus checks ($400 billion) flowing into the market can't be priced in.  It isn't news - it is actual money hitting the market.

2021-03-13 00:28:11,Wallstreetbets,"Why just purchasing $800 calls isn't enough for 🚀 I've read a few times now that the gamma squeeze is best squoze by the purchase of calls, particularly high multiple calls. I even read one apes theory that we should all purhase call options and that all those apes holding 4 shares of GME don't belong on the 🚀 with us. This is based on the assumption that MM's who are writing/selling these options are always hedging by buying the underlying asset, thus creating a huge leverage effect. I believe in some instances this may not be the case. When you look at the sheer number of $800 calls that were purchased and expiring today it far exceeds other more reasonable call levels. Say a MM decided the probability of GME hitting $800 today was exceedingly low, especially since they understand they could actually drive it there through the gamma effect mentioned previously, this MM may decide to just sell all hedging GME shares and sell those options ""naked"" This would have netted them profits from a sideways day of trading  and expiration of calls not in the money.
This is why we need to purchase calls at all levels and the underlying asset as well. Each in the money call option does force MM's to hedge.

2021-03-13 00:23:30,Wallstreetbets,"CNBC says stocks should be traded based on fundamentals, so here is the APE ratings based on fundamentals. What would the ratings on stocks be if they actually traded based on fundamentals?  Well lets find out:

The list of stocks are all companies I like.  They are all on my list of stocks to watch for wheel trades.  These are all companies that I would want to own if the price was right.

&#x200B;

Since stock prices are usually based on perception of future performance, for each stock I looked up its estimated price earnings for 2021.  I ignored 2020 completely.  If it is a spec stock expected to loose money in 2021 I estimated its first profitable year in say 2022.  If I thought the CNBC estimate for 2021 was good I used it.  Otherwise I upped it a little or lowered it a little based on my opinion of future earnings.

&#x200B;

I also used CNBC's numbers for past earnings to estimate what I thought the growth rate for the next few years would be.  Again I ignore 2020.

&#x200B;

I then find a price target of earnings \* 2 \* growth rate.  The only exception was Hasbro which is a dividend stock.

&#x200B;

I then calculated a price I would want to own the stock at which is usually about 70% of price target or 1.4 \* earnings \* growth.

&#x200B;

If a stock is trading at PE of more than 2 times growth rate it is rated a SELL

If a stock is trading at a PE between 1.4 and 2 times growth it is rated a HOLD

If a stock is trading under 1.4 growth it is rated a buy.

If it is trading at a PE of under its growth I rated it a STRONG BUY.

Other than Hasbro I did not take dividends, revenue, or assets under consideration.  This was a simple calculation.  Therefore THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE YOU SHOULD DO YOUR OWN DD BEFORE BUYING, SELLING, OR HOLDING ANY STOCK!!!

&#x200B;

Also, I did not take squeezes into consideration they are ONLY based on future fundes.

&#x200B;

I think the results will be SHOCKING!

Yes I used excel I know I suck.

This is a shorter term play.

We just saw great earning in previous QTR, I expect another great round of earnings with valentines day, and not to be a piece of shit but the huge covid spikes causing death and sickness where flowers sales without contact will spike.

With the massive earning from Q4 we didn’t see much of a pop, it grew before the report. I expect similar situations for Q1 earnings

Once covid subsides I would expect 1-800 to take a nose dive so we are talking 3-6 months max! My wifes boyfriend sends these to her all the time and she loves it. I have sent feedback to request crayons added for the smooth brains.

The company has a few subs that compliment flowers. their indoor plant business has also had a large boom with people working from home.

I supported the cause and got my boo thang some for v day. The product was amazing so i felt comfortable holding.

2021-03-12 23:54:44,Wallstreetbets,"Trading Tips for Novice Apes I scored me an Adderall yesterday and in my amphetamine-induced madness sat down and wrote a bunch of rambling crap about trading stonks and options for beginners. I know, let's let the newbies lose all their money and clean out this trash-heap, but come on, the paper trading competition is more effective than sheer stupidity. Anyways, here's some tips to not lose money, at least not as quickly as $800 GME calls.

  DiVeRsIfY!

Options are great. No, not those kind of options, but options like how normal people use the word. Basically when trading it’s hard to be right 100% of the time, so why risk your whole account by owning a single stock? It’s dangerous because *you will be wrong* and if you bet it all when you’re wrong, even if it is rare, you’re out of the game. All the money is gone. You might even *owe money to the broker* if you did something really dumb.

Diversification is sometimes laughed about, even by giants like Warren Buffet. He famously said something like, “Put all your eggs in one basket *and watch the basket*.” He’s not wrong, but most people don’t know what to look for regarding dangers to this basket. There could be a wolf about to eat all the eggs and we wouldn’t know it. *We wouldn’t even know what a wolf looks like!* My point is unless you’re an expert at knowing market conditions, economic conditions, and are great at reading 10-Ks and 10-Qs like a wizard, you probably can’t watch the basket very well.

Personally, I admit I don’t know shit about companies. I invest in meme stocks that have high options premium. That’s my investment strategy. My egg basket is, well, I don’t know what it is, but it sure isn’t something that has any business holding eggs. The eggs could be eaten, spoiled (there's probably an option expiration joke here), or be stolen at any moment and that’s why I have multiple baskets. One or two of the baskets can get stolen/eaten, and I still have eight more. I can and will be wrong, and at most it’ll wipe out 10% of my holdings. I, and you, can happily easily take a 10% hit to the investment account and be able to function.

This play more into my next tip: be stoic. By diversifying you can remove extreme emotion from your investing/trading.

## Be Calm. Be Chill. Be Stoic. It’s just money after all!

You are your main enemy to stock market success. It’s not market makers, shorts, or other traders; they only use you against yourself. Why? Because you’re a person. You have emotions. You’re stupid and irrational and emotional. Money is on the line; you know the thing we all trade for shelter, food, good, and everything? Money is fundamentally tied to emotion, so when your money starts to get messed with you get stupid. Think of all the silly shit you’ve done and said on an emotional high or low. You may have drunkenly told someone you loved them, kicked someone’s ass, bought something stupid, and apply this to your investment account. How are you going to treat hundreds or thousands of investment money if you’re emotional? When a stock you own (please be diversified!) drops 60% and your money disappears what do you do? You have a choice and emotion will only make the choice harder to make.

I don’t really have a tip here because it’s something you learn to deal with. There is no magical key to not being emotional when money is involved (besides shutting your phone off and going for a walk), but just know that it is immensely important, more than any other thing, to keep emotion in check in regards to investing. I do have a few tips on things to be aware of though. Luckily they have names so by labeling them you can recognize what’s happening and combat it.

## FOMO

Fear of Missing Out. You watch a stock you were kinda thinking about buying jump 300% in a few days. People at work are talking about their hot stock that's printing them tendies. You start to think that maybe you missed the boat -- you dragged your feet and are sitting out riding the rocket to the moon -- or did you? Maybe it’ll go up another 300% *if you get in ASAP!* Yeah, that’s a great idea. You’re not even greedy, you just want it to go up a little bit so you can feel like you were part of the moon mission, and that’s not hard to do, right? Surely if it went up so quickly, it’ll keep going up at least until you sell.

Wrong. This is a terrible idea. Hype is dangerous. FOMO is why people I work with are chucking money into \[redacted\] at $50,000 after it went up 1,000% in a year. This is why people are *still* bagholding GameStop at $450 per share. This is why a large portion of bagholders exist in the first place; their still holding onto their $18 AMCs they bought a few months ago no wanting to take the loss.

If you find yourself experiencing HARD FOMO and *just can’t resist*, buy yourself a small portion. Don’t go crazy. Don’t “invest” anything more than you’re willing to lose. Using \[redacted\] again, if you invested $1,000 at $50,000 and \[redacted\] went down to $5,000, would you be fine with it? You turned $1,000 into $100 and how would you feel? There is a low enough point where it’s stomachable, so invest that. I’m not buying \[redacted\] but if I did I’d be okay with a $500 ""investment."" If I lose it, it’s fine, and I won’t lose sleep over it. FOMO is dangerous so be aware of it.

## FUD/Dooming

The opposite of FOMO: Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt. This can be caused by your family questioning what the hell you bought, news stories, internet shitposts, etc. and make you scared to hold your stock/option because you're worried the price will crash. These pale in comparison to witnessing a beloved stock you owe totally collapse in price. You watch your thousands of dollars of gain disappear in a few days (or maybe hours) and what do you do? You panic sell. You're $10,000 profit is down to $7,000, $6,000 and $5,000 and *OMG how much worse can it get! I could lose all my profit!* You panic sell and realize a $2,000 gain, but oh how you kick yourself in the ass for not getting out at the top. You were greedy, you feel like shit. You're the worst trader ever.

Then the next day the stock goes up and you get a side of FOMO to go with your main-course FUD. *If only you held...but maybe it's not too late to jump back in?*

As before, no real tips on this one. It's also hard to give tips for when something emotional is happening. It's easy to say ""*don't panic sell!*"" but when you're on the verge of panic selling its hard to detach yourself from the numbers on your screen and actually not panic sell. Only with hindsight do you realize how much of a paper-handed bitch you were.

Like with FOMO, a good recipe for mitigating FUD is to give into your emotions just a little bit so you feel like you're doing something. If you want to sell as a stock is crashing, sell half. Sell a third. You don't need to sell it all and regret it later. And if you have truly massive balls, you can always *buy more shares on the way down!*

## No Regrets! No ""what ifs""!

There's few things worse than seeing an ""investment"" work out better than you expected but to not sell at the top. You're always haunted by the ""what if I just did this…"" A stock triples, you don't sell, and then it's back to where you bought it at. You could've raked in *so much money* but you held too long and raked in absolutely nothing.

Then there's the opposite problem: selling too early. You got greedy/scared and took a 10% gain when you could've had a 1000% gain. This was me with *GameStop* in January. I had 400 shares total and sold them around $30-40. Sure I made $5,000 but I could've had $150,000 if I held on for another week or so! Try not to kick yourself in the ass for missing like that and tell me how well it goes. It's hard.

At least I didn't FOMO back in. I realized my mistake -- I sold too early -- and am trying my best to not let it haunt me. Everything is clear with hindsight and what I did made sense at the time. Trading is stupidly hard and no one perfectly buys at the bottom or sells at the top and as long as you come out ahead, who cares? I'm not the guy holding bags at $450 a share, and at least I was in the play and made some significant cash. As always, easier said than done, but try not to be too hard on yourself for not being perfect.

My tip here is to take profits as you wish. You can probably tell that I'm a big fan of taking half-measures -- selling half, buying half -- because you're doing something and doing something feels good. If a stock goes up 20% and you want to sell, sell half. Realize some profits and let the rest ride. If it goes up even more, sell half of those, and so on. This isn't a rule, just an idea. You feel good taking profits but leaving some on the table does wonders for the ""what if"" thoughts that might haunt you.

The same is true for buying. Buy half of what you want and see how it plays out. If the stock goes down, buy more. This keeps you safe from tossing in a ton of money at a high price, but makes you feel good for getting some cash in the game.

Disclaimer: I like the stock. This is financial advice."

I highly recommend reading the Prequels before going ahead with the sequels. Disclaimer, this sequel will not be as good as the origin post!

So, shorts are still winning with the short volume ratio being 30.17 Yesterday(Fintel). Although some of the shorts had to cover to avoid paying the dividends, yesterday they got back at it with the ratio mentioned before. It's really inspiring how relentless they are! In addition, the borrow rate rose to 8.86%(Fintel).

**As of 03/11/2021(Fintel) the Short Volume Ratio is 30%.** To put things into perspective, If there's a short interest of %10, that's considered high. If there's a short interest of %20 or greater, **that's considered extremely high**. 

&#x200B;

[03\/11\/2021\(Fintel\) the Short Volume Ratio](https://preview.redd.it/ej84xpck5nm61.png?width=557&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc67440203d544cba39db6f3db68f0d3200870c3)

The only reason I could come up with as to why this is being shorted so much is due to institutional holders not wanting it reach the 10$+ where a Gamma squeeze could potentially happen on 03/19/2021 Calls. This would results in their premiums for Calls being lost(all opinion). Remember that there is a large institutional stake in $UWMC.(More on this paragraph in part 2)

**(NEWS)** Anyway, if you missed the recent [$UWMC news](https://nationalmortgageprofessional.com/news/76503/larger-broker-shops-already-signed-addendum), United Wholesale Mortgage reported that some large broker shops across the country have signed the UWM all-in addendum representing over 90% of broker shops who will no longer work with Rocket Mortgage and Fairway Independent Mortgage Corporation, exactly one week after the Facebook Live announcement.

The All-In addendum states that after **March 15**, broker-owners continuing to do doing business with UWM means they can no longer do business with both Rocket Mortgage and Fairway Independent Mortgage Corporation.

 ""The support and appreciation we have received over the last week has far exceeded our expectations,"" said Mat Ishbia(CEO).  ""Our partners understand the importance of working with a lender focused on the future growth of not only their business but the entire channel.""

**In summary, I'm very excited for next week. It'll prove to me either the CEO is as good as I expect him to be (He's a big reason why \~48% of my portfolio is in it) and he'll capitalize on the rare opportunity of a Gamma squeeze which could potentially happen on 03/19/2021 Calls (more on that in Part 2), or I would be very disappointed.**

 **I wouldn't buy any $UWMC 03/19 Calls anymore** because they are useless in my opinion towards the stock and have a high **risk of expiring worthless (More on that in Part 2).** On the other hand, **I would only buy shares** and maybe leaps if they are cheap enough.

**(Important Part):** If you like the stock and think it’s undervalued, you can share $UWMC posts or make your own DD to give this stock more exposure. If people believe in it as much as you do, they might buy it and we can hopefully all eat Tendies on the Moon(soon)🚀🌕🍗

2021-03-12 21:34:20,Wallstreetbets,"A health guide for the storm we find ourselves in. Ok guys I get it and I have been there when it comes to making this money with GME. I have been the guy who hits the refresh button all day, who GUH's the dips, of course I have in the past had to use credit because I had spent more of my paycheck  than I should have.  I have seen a lot of people who are getting  obsessive to the point its could be unhealthy. We are one of the most chilled out group of autists  I have ever met. Which is why I made this guide to remind you all of a few things. I based this guide off of posts I have seen and replies to posts I have made. Please note I am not speaking about 1 stock in general, this applies to everything market related. I just use GME because its an easy example. 

1. It's a good thing the market closes on the Weekend. This cannot be the only thing you focus on. As your parents or wife's boyfriend would tell you "" Go outside"". You need to get out and do other things not related to the stock market. Keep your hobbies, play with your kids, go see your parents. You have to get out and do things other than WSB,and watching tickers all day.
2. Eat you Autistic pieces of shit. 3 Meals a day I dont care if its all Wendys, you have to eat 3 meals a day. On a serious note either eat some fruit or take a good multi vitamin. For the sake of not spending all of Melvins money on doctors visits please drink some water too.  

3. DON'T SPEND MONEY YOU DON'T HAVE. If I see one more question about how margin works ,how to get approved for margin or if they should yolo all their money on Margin im going to have a stroke.  If you thought losing more than half your initial investment sucks, Imagine losing all you invested because you now owe your broker their portion. Then of course you might owe some interest on that pending on the broker.

&#x200B;

4. Dont let this get in the way of your day job. I cleared near half my yearly salary on GME round one. I did this all the while working and not neglecting my responsibilities. I dont care if you're a  bagger at the grocery store or the stim man Crazy Joe. Do your shit so you can pay your bills. If you really cannot help it take some PTO on a day that you think you will need to watch it constantly. Just dont get fired.

&#x200B;

5. Your family probably thinks its cool you're in on something big ( GME for example),but they probably get sick of hearing about it. This should not be the only dialog you have with others around you. Keep that shit here, lets circle jerk. Told the wife today Im back in GME for 3k more ( I have been trying to swing trade it for RD 2 just to do something different all the while catching the squeeze). All she said was "" again?"". Now in RD 1 she was asking about it probably as much as I was looking at it . This is not nearly as cool as many of us think it is. Most people dont get whats happening or do not care. This is ok.

6. Know when to get out. I know this is hard for people from my generation but in this game there are winners and losers. Dont be a fuckin loser you fucking loser. When this shit can change your life take some profit. Stay in diamond hand the shit out of it but take care of you. Someone during this squeeze will still buy at the top Guaranteed . He/she will HODL and be stuck at sub 10% loss for sure.  Get in before its too late or just say this is not for me this time. 

7. Now this is kinda misinformation because the market makes no sense right now but.... Once something reaches the news,social media ,or is being talked about. Its usually too late. BUY the rumor sell the news.Someone out there already knew this before the media did, they got in when it was low. Once its common knowledge these people or firms are already selling leaving you bag holding. 

8. Do your DD. No!! not the DD your wife's boyfriend is giving her while you cuck looking at AH tickers on your phone. Research the stock , and decide for yourself. Go to investopedia and educate yourself on the vocabulary. You should know some basics behind stock fundamentals. If Im pushing a stock on here , you do not know me. I could just be trying to give you my bags to hold. 

&#x200B;

9. Exercise please , you need to move about during your day. It will help you mentally and physically .

10.Dont hate on others who dont invest in your stock. We are a support group, a fundamental group and above all else we eat crayons together. I bought GME in January at 40$ per share, got told I was a retard for doing so by my friends. Never said shit to them when it mooned,even though they told me WMT is where the money is. Not everyone is in GME, and those who are genuinely believe the hype. As my wife's boyfriend says to be when I get to be a grumpy gills "" If you dont have anything nice to say dont say anything at all.""

11. To make it simple if you dont know how to buy a Call option don't be buying call options. You need to do a lot more research into the fundamentals. You will lose your ass.

Basically they build to order construction elements like roof trusses, dormers, and cabinets to make the framing of a building much simpler, cheaper, and faster than if a builder was buying the lumber, looking and plans and doing all the framing themselves.

I like this stock and have been adding over the last 18 months.  It has a 5.5b market cap so within the thresholds of this forum. Why it is not a meme yet I do not know. The thing moves like NAIL with a beta of 2.58 while being wholly less likely to go up in smoke. 2020 was a huge year for them, the stock gained 146% yet still trades at just 17.75 P/E. It is currently trading near ATH making it both undervalued and a growth opportunity.

Honestly, I don’t know much about technical analysis so I’m just going to quote their CEO regarding Q4: “Revenue increased 3.6%, adjusted operating profit grew 22.8% and adjusted EBITDA increased 21.6%. Adjusted operating and EBITDA margins expanded 200 basis points and 240 basis points respectively, and adjusted net income increased 32.6% to $7.28 per diluted share.”

The stock is only around $47 a share with 206.5 million shares. There is currently unprecedented demand for residential new construction but all their sectors grew last year, including commercial construction.  Their earnings per share growth for Q4 2020 grew 237% over the same quarter of the prior year.

Cons: Volume is low, no one seems to know about it. Bid ask spreads fairly wide. Lumber prices are extremely high right now due to idiots who hoarded toilet paper and forest fires in the Northwest USA last year, I believe they can just pass this on to customers but could affect existing contacts. Related to beta, sometimes this can move a lot without an obvious catalyst (good IMO). It doesn’t get much coverage.

# The New Normal (disruption)

Whether you're a believer in climate change or a denier of it, one thing we can all agree on is that extreme weather patterns  (by view of our short lifespans) are becoming more and more frequent, whether you think it's because that's just how things go or if cow farts are going to doom us all. Weather related damage to life, liberty, and the pursuit of tendies is now averaging 22 billion dollars a year in the United States absent of cost to infrastructure disruptions, with power disruption phenomena contributing to over 50,000 deaths per year.  As we continue to evolve and become more reliant upon technology, distributed data platforms, IoT, EVs, robot surgeons, etc., disruptions in access to power render us completely impotent to function as a society.

&#x200B;

# Our crumbling infrastructure:

&#x200B;

Thanks to the Boomers who have been wasting our immense wealth on blow, being able to see the pimples on Jenna Jameson's ass in 20 year old videos while they flaccidly beat off in their office, and in general fucking everything in this world up, the American Society of Civil Engineers has given our power grid infrastructure a D-minus grade.  Not only are there many single points of failure, the grid we presently have was only rated for 50 years of service, and a huge percentage of it is well beyond that expected lifespan.  Meanwhile, our consumption demands have increased exponentially and will continue to do so both as our population expands due to a combination of your wife's boyfriend continually getting her pregnant (or open border policies, whichever you believe in) as well as our fucked up attempts to become the Jetsons.  These are streams that should not be crossed, but we're doing it anyways because we're in the early stages of the Idiocracy documentary.

&#x200B;

# Enter $BE.  So what do these guys do?  The 3 R's:  Resiliency, Redundancy, and Retardedness

First, let's get one thing out of the way:  These guys are NOT primarily a play on replacing municipal infrastructure with green energy like solar or wind farms for large capacity energy production.  That's a crowded space, and they'd be a bad competitor there.  What they are a play on is providing MICROGRIDS for critical infrastructure to ensure continuous power delivery to essential services.  Their product provides RESILIENCY and REDUNDANCY to individual campuses and facilities to ensure that, even in the absolute worst case scenario, the wheels keep turning at vulnerable locales.  Think hospitals, water treatment facilities, nursing homes, airports, etc. at the lower level of Maslow's hierarchy and data centers, shipping hubs and the CEO's 7th vacation villa at the corporate level.  The things that will grind something to a screeching halt in the event of power failure.  The 3rd R is just a reminder that, if you're reading this, you're retarded.  Just thought you might need a reminder.

&#x200B;

# OK, HOW do they do it?  What makes them special/different?  Elon says solar and batteries are the futurez, man

&#x200B;

$BE is different than most green energy plays in that they make solid oxide fuel cells they call servers that will convert fuel (usually hydrogen, but they can run on RNG or ethanol, as well) to electricity WITHOUT combustion (that's the big differentiator here).  I won't get too sciency here because you smooth brains wouldn't get it, but it's got electrolytes, and that's what plants crave, bitches.  They require no precious metals (so no shortage concerns).  Each ""server"", which runs about 3/4 of a million dollars a unit, produces 250 kw of juice and can power 1 30,000 square foot commercial space or up to 100 homes.  These servers produce energy at 55% efficiency (for point of comparison, solar is 12%).  They do produce CO2 as waste, but only half as much as natural gas power stations.  When using RNG as the fuel source, they are a net-zero carbon emission product, which is good both for government spending programs to appease the Sierra Club as well as carbon tax dodging companies.  They're also presently burning all their positive cash flow into figuring out how to harness the CO2 these produce to turn it into some other form of energy, which would make them a CARBON NEGATIVE product if they pull it off.  That's Star Trek shit right there. These servers pay for themselves in an average of 3-5 years, making them an attractive long-term investment, especially against the 17 years it takes for solar to pay for itself.

&#x200B;

Most importantly, they operate completely independently of a power grid and are not subject to adverse weather impacting their functionality (like a solar panel getting covered with snow or temperatures falling so low that nat gas plants and windmills freeze), guaranteeing reliable access to power.  Elon's mega batteries are still constrained by the limitation that power needs to be injected into the batteries and those batteries can be drained.  These fuel cells will always operate and never run out of juice barring a component failure.

&#x200B;

**All of this is important because it highlights the fact that $BE has no real competitors on the market for the niche they've filled, and aren't going to be hampered by price increases/hunting for lithium, rare earth metals, chip shortages, etc.  The only comparable company out there is Ballard Power Systems, who is focused more on buses, industrial machinery, trains, etc., not infrastructure.   Ballard is trying to fight in the battery space, which is very crowded.**

&#x200B;

# Fuck you, Mr. Wizard - TENDIES, fucker!

&#x200B;

Alright, alright, alright.  Chill the fuck out.  I'm sorry your wife didn't peg you last night and now you're surly.  These dudes are gonna make money 4 ways:

&#x200B;

* 1 is the human life aspect.  Loss of life is tragic, but let's be honest:  Mostly, it's just bad optics if you're a politician, and what happened in Texas and California threatens political job security.    If they can spend YOUR money to ensure that they can keep TAKING money from you, they're gonna be all ears.  Expect a lot of regulation in the coming years mandating that essential facilities have access to reliable off-grid power in the case of natural disaster, Hungarian hackers or Chinese invaders.  And we can't just have Becky from HR run out to the Generac every 20 minutes to fill it with gas from the Exxon station down the street.  Interns won't blow you if you're working at Wendy's after getting voted out. The fact that it will save lives is just a nice bonus
* 2 is corporate greed.  It's bad for business to be ground to a halt, and corporations know they can't rely on the government to give them juice.  Most of $BE's money thus far (we'll get to that in a moment) already comes from corporate America.  Companies like $EBAY,  $HD, $WMT, $INTC, $AAPL, $GOOGL, $ORCL, etc. already use these guys to ensure that their data centers and shipping depots are always powered on and operational because just because the apocalypse is here doesn't mean you stop making money.   Secretaries won't blow you in the executive washroom if the board fires you.
* The 3rd is as an add-on to replacements to our current grid infrastructure to harden it and provide insurance against limited disruptions.  Customers  won't blow you if their nipples are frozen.
* The 4th is a future product, but as they hone their product and reduce their cost of production, adding a small consumer grade sized server to your home could provide about 1kW of power at a cost of about 3 grand, making it a favorable alternative to a generator or a Tesla wall paired with solar panels.  Your wife won't blow you if....well, let's be honest, she just won't blow you.  Sorry.

# Under the hood:  Financials:

&#x200B;

At the time of this writing, $BE is trading at $27.14 with a market cap of 5 billion dollars.  Their 52 week high was $45, and their 52 week low was all the way down at $3.  They were recently dragged down in the broader market correction on the NASDAQ because, even though they're an energy sector play and thus shouldn't have been hit as hard, they're ""tech energy"", so they got pulled down unfairly (right along with last week's DD, $CLNE - you're welcome on that, btw).  Even th ough they have a gross margin of over 25%, they are not a profitable company because they put all of their money into R&D.  They do about a billion dollars in revenue annually and are looking at a growth rate of over 420% in the next 2 years (no, I didn't randomly pick that number off the top of my head, that's where the math leads.  It's a sign, bitches).

&#x200B;

If we look at total returns with companies $BE gets lumped in with, we see that they severely lagged in terms of return during this green energy boom:

&#x200B;

Now, there are 2 ways you can look at this:  You can be the bad kind of retarded and say it's a bad investment because  some of these other plays have performed better, or you can be the good kind of retarded and realize that these other plays that outperformed were all in the BATTERY space and that Bloom was overlooked because it plays in infrastructure, and now gets to CATCH UP to the rest of these guys that are already very crowded trades, making you a fuck ton of money.  You want to throw money in something that's already fully vested, or something that's ""got next""?

What's the smart money doing?  Let's take a look at the short interest:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The smart money is getting the fuck out of the way because they know this thing is coiling and is gonna bust a nut all over their faces if they don't.

&#x200B;

Normalizing all of their numbers, the price target for this stonk was trending along nicely till the broader market correction the last few weeks.  And these targets were before a light got shone on how shitty our power reliability is

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Stonks only go up](https://preview.redd.it/jxssf1o2lmm61.png?width=495&format=png&auto=webp&s=527a481b906f993df7f6659046875a760421c4ab)

&#x200B;

# Technical Teabagging:

Looking at the technicals, we see a few things.  First, on the daily it's not the smoothest price action, but we had a nice upwards channel up until the correction, and it's since gone into a descending wedge with a strong bull flag to the upside.  Now if you're looking at this and thinking to yourself ""self, this looks like a very traditional head and shoulders pattern and we've formed the right neckline"", you would be correct looking at the chart blind, but in so doing you would be ignoring the larger market correction that caused the beginning of that pattern to form, which means it'll probably be a broken H&S.  Again, these lines aren't great because I'm too lazy - I usually just eyeball it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Daily](https://preview.redd.it/21azp5m5mmm61.png?width=1207&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6e59b9f8192944a323c329bde077cc52309be70)

Expanding out to a 2 hour 20 day, things get cleaner.  Your light blue line is the 20 day moving average, the dark blue is the 50 day SMA, and the cream line is the 200 SMA.  Descending resistance, ascending support.  It's nearing the end of its coil for a breakout.  The 20 day and 50 MA will very likely be crossing in the near future at that $34 mark.

&#x200B;

# So, to summarize:

&#x200B;

* $BE has a lot of tailwinds at its back as the result of the recent infrastructure debacles and the calls for regulation and upgrades to infrastructure, which will only become more frequent as time progresses
* With a 3-5 year return on investment, these products present an attractive investment to corporations looking to both hedge their bets against corporate incompetence as well as reduce their exposure to carbon tax measures
* Because their products don't go into EV's and aren't working with supervillains trying to get people to buy joke currency, they were largely left behind in the recent surge in green energy valuations because people largely didn't understand their voodoo or that these guys even existed, but social awareness of them is raising.  Leaving them a lot of room to the upside to run
* Even though they should have been immune to the broader market selloff as an energy sector play (the energy stonks actually went up during that correction), they got unfairly dragged down because they're still sort of a tech play.  This creates an interesting and attractive buying opportunity, even if this stonk has run a bit since I started touting it in the dailies (as I only do one DD a week, you've missed the absolute bottom, but this is free so fuck you if you want to complain)
* They're definitely going to be getting some of that gubmit corporate stimmy money to shut AOC up.
* Microgrids to critical operations such as hospitals, nursing homes, water treatment facilities, etc. are going to become a big thing and very likely an architectural standard in the future
* **They have zero competition in the space they reside in, which is really fucking unusual**
* There's a long play here by which these things could be attractive power assurance features to new home builds or as retrofits, particularly in parts of the country where natural disasters and adverse weather frequently affect access to electricity
* They're immune to weather phenomena (and actually operate better in colder weather), making them an attractive power resiliency option

&#x200B;

# Price Targets:

&#x200B;

As I've said multiple times, this stonk was positively FLYING as it caught up to $PLUG, $FCEL, etc. in the sector as people became more aware of it as a value play.  Couple that with the tailwinds it now has as a result of a shitty winter and never ending California wildfires.  A short term price target of $32 by mid April is a bet I'd have 70% conviction on.  Barring continued market manipulation because of Boomer bonds, 45-50 by mid summer, and a long term price target (given their growth projections) of $72 are entirely within reach.

&#x200B;

# How do you play it?:

&#x200B;

You can actually FD this one, if you really want to.  This thing has a very standard behavior:  It tends to pop at the open and then fades into the day.  Further, if you time that coil right, you can experience a really nice breakout on a weekly.  Personally, I like the 5/21 32cs at anything under $4 and I was buying the shit out of them during the correction, but that's just because my brain still has like 3 wrinkles in it that I can't seem to iron out.

&#x200B;

One thing to note is this is not a high volume stonk.  Only about 35000 shares will trade hands near the open, and options interest is low enough to where if you're playing with a big bankroll, filling a large order will take time.  As such, the spreads tend to be pretty wide on this guy, so you're going to want to manually enter something that's 10 cents above the current offer price and babysit it till its filled.

&#x200B;

# Position Disclaimers:

&#x200B;

I'm balls deep in these guys, and have been since early November of last year when I purchased most of the shares my VC had from funding them a decade ago to my personal accounts as we shifted the nature of our portfolio.  Since that time, I've only added to my positions on the options chain.

&#x200B;

* 263,800 shares @ $14
* 2000 5/21 32c's at an average cost basis of 2.60
* 1000 1/22 60c's at 3 even
* 500 1/22 65c's at 2.70

I'd like to say my position is fully vested, but I've been buying every single fucking dip on this one.

&#x200B;

All my love,

2021-03-12 20:55:42,Wallstreetbets,"AFRM offers 84% upside potential. I’m putting a price target of $145 on the shares, representing enormous opportunity from current levels ($79).  Here’s my thesis:  Affirm charges merchants -- including COVID-19 lockdown beneficiary Peloton -- to take on the risk of customers who want to pay with installments. Millennials are driving a change in the traditional idea of paying by credit, and investors now have a way to play that trend in the U. S. Affirm allows consumers to split purchases into installments. The company is modernizing the world of payments by offering an option to make purchases over time without incurring interest for consumers.

Affirm makes money on its ""0% APR"" installment options by taking a cut of the merchant end of the transaction. The idea is that merchants are willing to pay Affirm to conduct risk modeling and offer its service as a way to boost conversion to a sale. The 0% APR options generally nets the company its largest fees from merchants, though it also offers "" simple-interest"" loans through which it receives fixed interest payments on the consumer end as well.

Max Levchin co-founded Affirm in 2012. He has an impressive pedigree as one of PayPal’s co-founders. While everyone recognizes Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, you shouldn’t dismiss Levchin’s contribution – he is a powerhouse. We are impressed when someone creates an empire and helps revolutionize the way business is done. We have great faith in him as Affirm’s CEO.

Levchin is a disruptor and is changing the way people pay for goods and how they pay for them over time. Seeking to set the credit card world on its head, the company appeals to both consumers and merchants with a simple, attractive proposition. His vision for the company is to be as “ubiquitous, secure, and convenient as legacy networks, yet far more transparent, honest, and both consumer- and merchant-centric.”

The company is the online lender on the consumer front, and brings clarity on the amount owed and when it is due. A major portion of its business is helping merchants provide 0% financing, and it has signed up major companies like Priceline, Gucci, Dyson, and Expedia. The consumer-centric approach means the company doesn’t charge late fees and interest is not compounded. That is, it is simple interest. The company profits by treating its customers fairly, rather than by gouging them with high interest and unreasonable fees. Profitability is based on growing consumer acceptance, which in turn, makes it more valuable for merchants to offer. For merchants, the company is focused on helping them improve their brand, gain more customers, and increase sales. Affirm earns revenue from this source when it facilitates a sale and payment.

Affirm and Shopify struck an agreement in July through which Shopify would list Affirm as a payment option, giving the company exposure to Shopify's vast base of merchants. Affirm will pay Shopify a fee for each sale processed through its platform, and the company will be Shopify's exclusive partner for such payment options over the course of the arrangement, which lasts three years initially and then subsequently renews for additional one-year terms unless one party decides to discontinue the arrangement.

The company is past the proof-of-concept stage. There are over 6.2 million (!) consumers that have signed up, having completed over 17 million transactions, and the company works with over 6,500 merchants. Gross Merchandise Value\* (GMV) was $10.7 billion over the last three years. Last year, about 64% of its loans were made to repeat customers.

The company went public on January 13th at $49, pricing 25 million shares above the $41 to $44 range. There was strong demand for the IPO. Opening at $91, it reached $103 on the first day of trading. The following day, it went to $138.  Now the stock in trading in the 80s meaning you can get it for less than the IPO.

There is a long runway for continued strong revenue growth that will drive earnings improvement. This will continue fueling the stock.

Founder and CEO Max Levchin controls 20% of the company. Counting him, directors and officers control 31% of the shares. There are very well-known investors that continue to hold major interests. The Founders Fund (a venture capital firm with $3 billion under management, which includes Brian Singerman, Peter Thiel, and Keith Rabois,) has 7%. Khosla Ventures (5%), Lightspeed Ventures (7%), Jasmine Ventures (9%), and Shopify (8%) all have significant ownership. With strong leadership and a unique business model that continues to prove itself, Affirm will continue attracting younger consumers and merchants. Revenue growth is just in the early stages."

I think GM has more gas left in the tank even after this run.  I took this gain because the size of position had grown and with the expiration next week I decided to lock this in, as well as I'm transferring out of Interactive Brokers.  I still have 20 more calls (also shown below) that I'll try to press to a $60 strike before closing/rolling that position.

My basic premise is that while most are viewing GM's rise as an EV play, the share gains are actually because of Boomer metrics.  GM is producing too much cash and growing earnings too much to have a dying industrial PE multiple.  They're sandbagging earnings and have a history of such.  When they beat earnings again next quarter, GM will moon, again.  You don't have to view GM as a Tesla rival to have tendies print now because of large SUV's.  **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

(due to all the GME hype, it didn't get much attention)

&nbsp;

*How did it get this way?*

The small float at 50 million shares and incredibly high institutional ownership with low volume translates to it being easily manipulated. Institutions got lazy and let this thing slipway past where it should have gotten. No retail investor is long on fucking SEAS.

In other words, if take your 💩 and make it look like a [chocolate bar](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Cadbury-Dairy-Milk-Caramel-Bar.jpg), no one will be any the wiser as long as they don't get close enough to sniff.

""Just skimming the fundamentals, this company looks like absolute dogshit."" -/u/ethandavid

Seriously, there is no bull argument at all for this being above $20, and this stock is starting to *stink*. 

Check out this article: [SeaWorld attendance dives 53% in the final quarter of 2020, but stock soars](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/tourism/os-bz-seaworld-earnings-covid-rebound-20210225-fs7wmwm3zrh7jlzwm5qdsbdz7y-story.html)

A small dip in the fake momentum and this thing comes **tumbling down**.

&nbsp;

*But what about the cute killer whales? I'm not evil!*

Watch Blackfish. It would be doing them a favor if SeaWorld was bankrupt.

Even without that knowledge, the company itself is run by some really scummy individuals. 

The starting wage at SeaWorld Orlando is current $11 an hour. Instead of raising the minimum wage, the CEO plans to ""increase automation efforts overtime"" to solve their cost problems. Not only are your Orca's being kept in a cage, but they also won't even pay the people to take care of them.

&nbsp;

*But we only know how to get tendies with undervalued stocks!*

Indeed young one, but everyone can learn. The bold get the tendies. 

You usually need to apply to get shorting approved on your margin account. Fidelity has a pretty quick turnaround time, so if SEAS is still above $40 by the time you get approved it can be a great play to make.

There is a lot of benefit to having at least one 🌈🐻 position in your portfolio. Probably even more than one (explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxf7y0/whats_happening_with_the_bond_market_or_how_i/))

Long puts work too, but I recommend shorting since it is less a question of *if* and more of a question of *when* the stock tanks. Even bankruptcy is not out of the question as /u/cyphonismus explained in his DD.

There is a reason hedgies love it. 

**TL:DR** - short SEAS, use premium to buy more GME 🚀🚀🚀
