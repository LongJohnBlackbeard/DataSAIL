I was shocked to see all of the support this morning, so I sent everything that was happening to the director and told her to check her donation account. She said they've received over 20k in donations this morning from people named Gamestop (she has no idea what Gamestop is). She asked me what was happening. I told her ""Apes together, strong"".

&#x200B;

Update: You apes have raised over $100k so far! Unreal. In talking with Tara and the WSB mods, I think we're going to make an update video next week to update everyone on how much you all raised and show some behind the scenes footage of the facilities and gorillas in Rwanda. They're also designing an ""Apes together, strong"" tshirt to make available in the store for you guys. Thank you everyone again for your kindness. You don't know how much this support means to the Fossey Fund and the gorillas. This is the best community on Reddit."

Retail investors will pay off their debt, help their parents, contribute to their local communities and make crazy donations even if they are just 'meme-ing'.

Big money will throw a giant party at some extremely high up hotel and invite VIP only and then do another round of behind the scenes block investments to rack up even more money for more parties and profits.

Edit: The first thing my brother did when I earned him some money was to pay off his car loan immediately so that he could solely focus on his student loan."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because they will probably have to adopt the same gorillas out to many people, I can see this turning into a club thing. Does anyone remember that Reddit button April fools thing? Where each colour would be it’s on tribe? Like that.

So you’ll have /r/gorilla-Bob and /r/gorilla-bill and so on. Everybody fawning over their chosen gorilla. 

I might go team orangutan when it’s tendies time."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I just want to know if I adopt a gorilla can they hang out with me?

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,there will be so many gorilla adoptions when the squeeze squozes
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hedgefucks will be put on endangered list.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Amazing yet sadly amazing that it needs to come to this whilst the hedges have sat on trillions doing jack shit all this time

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is just to save gorillas...and the rest of the rainforest...and then the world. Great move!  There should be an Ape as a reward/avatar to give to people and part of the sales directly to this org!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,We need an Ape reward for reddit!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or, we are actually putting the money back into the economy instead of hoarding it and making more."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is probably the most wholesome thing I’ve seen all day 🦍💪🏽🙏🏽
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for sending this to us all. As a kid I grew up obsessed with mountain gorillas, Diane Fossey was my hero and I was devastated when she was killed.

I went to university and through my studies in physical anthropology and primatology I got to meet Jane goodall and Birute Galdikas which was amazing, but I never got to go to the Virungas. Over the years I've donated to the Fossey Fund, and the digit foundation. 

Today's movement means so much to me. Scrolling through the main page has had me with this massive smile all day, and now finding out how much we've all contributed so far is just incredible"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is awesome. It's honestly my favorite thing to come out of WSB. It makes me so happy. I'm not really involved in conservation or anything, but gorillas and orangutans are two of my favorite animals ever. I'm so happy to see them getting this much support from a random source. Hopefully it makes a difference. And it reminds me, I've been wanted to set up a recurring donation to a fund like this. Gonna get on it ASAP.

Edit: Set up monthly $50 donations each to Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund and Orangutan Foundation International"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've never seen such an observable, efficient, excellent example of private capital (wealth) being used for ecological conservation. This wasn't done for any political motive, commercial sponsorship, or ulterior purpose, besides a bunch of people wanting to have fun with a meme and protect an endangered hominid species in northern Rwanda (near the border of Uganda and the DR Congo). This is wonderful.

Just another example of what happens when groups of people communicate and share good ideas in an open forum in a respectful way. Keep on rollin' everyone."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol that's fucking awesome!

This, again, shows the difference between billionaire hedges and the real people of this world.

Apes together, STRONG!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The only sad part about all of this is she didn’t end the video with, “apes strong together.”"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can't get over how crazy this is lmao, some random retard from WSB adopts a gorilla names it gamestop and makes a post. Apes follow him and donate over 20k causing the fucking director to publicly congratulate us haha

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Chris MacIntosh (Capitalist Exploits) just highlighted $RIG in his most recent newsletter. Here's what he said:

""Transocean is the last man standing of the US offshore oil drillers. “Toxic and I wouldn’t touch it with a 40 foot barge pole,” you might think (along with most souls who inhabit the known universe). 

However, we encourage you to take a closer look at the cash flow statement of Transocean. The company is cash flow positive from operations and is free cash flow positive over the last 3 quarters.

Of course, if one was a little sharper, then buying at $1 would net a 14x return on just getting back to where it was in 2017 and 2018 and a 40x return on where it was in 2014. 

I know what you are thinking — dreams are free, but just one trade like this can make up for a large number of pathetic trades. This is why we say asymmetry is your secret weapon when it comes to investing.""

Point is, yes, I'm in and thank you for the confirmation bias."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What a joke
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actually you should bet against oil, with alot of car company's going electric those prices will drop"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Oil isn’t just for cars you know.... literally renewable energy is built from oil. You can never go wrong with oil if you get in during a dip. Idk why people are so against the stock
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Renewable energy can’t provide 100% of infrastructure needs and most of the heavy machinery needed to build the infrastructure will likely be gas or diesel powered. I’m in on green energy, but it might take some time to develop. Personally, I like underperforming stock that have a high likelihood of rebounding."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea which would further cut oil production from the US. This will give OPEC more market share, and the ability to make a bigger impact on the oil economy with oil cuts. Renewable is the future but it is not going to be done in months, but rather decades."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"My point it finally has cash coming in which will allow it refinance any and all debt. This is a distressed business, which will have a amazing rebound if the continued progress and recovery maintains its current pace."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Oil is used for so much more than cars.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"What? Do some research first, you’re making yourself look dumb. Oil prices will continue to climb with inflation worries, oil production cutbacks, and reopening demand into summer."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you think they mine the lithium and other resources to make batteries?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"oil will be for while, its still good investment but not long term"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep. It made it through this tough time and didnt go bankrupt. Theres no other way but up especially with oil prices rising steadily over the summer and COVID slowing down.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm talking at long term (couple years) put against oil. It's going to drop with the electric push.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s arguably a good investment long term too. You can’t go a day without using a product made from crude oil.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes short term but take a long bet like out to 2023 or 2025 when gm plans to have all electric profile.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Then don’t do it now while oil will continue to rise
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"depend your ages, so it can be long term or short term investment 

I personally not invest in oil industry but more in technology"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Robinhood has put options out to 2023. So you could do it now with a very low price

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Just read on another post that multiple people adopt the same ape.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I just checked and the gorilla is still on the website. Either they allow multiple people to adopt the same one or their listings haven't updated.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Not saying this is or isn't a repost but if you look at the adoption web site it's only asking for $60 for this little guy so I'm assuming everyone who paid in would get the same acknowledgment.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The people at this foundation are probably confused and happy as heck by the influx of these donations. I love it!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I just like imagining the people at this foundation scratching their heads like an ape wondering why the sudden surge of adoptions. What if years later they trace the restoration of the gorilla populations all due to WSB?

Furthermore, more funding could go to philanthropic efforts and education (really the number 1 thing we need). GME could then just proliferate into so many places that everyone benefits. We really need a company to lead an effort like this. I can think of no better candidate. +And some of us get tendies to do the things we've always dreamed of... but...

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Good on you!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That would be awesome seeing Wall Street bets be behind the reason why gorilas didn’t go extinct 😂
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Inagine you get 2 adoptions a month usually and one day you wake up and about 500 people adopted a gorilla in one day lol.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine him staring at the GME chart hodling with 🤚🏿💎
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Son of a bitch
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That s pretty logic
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been thinking the same thing for a while now, retail is such a small amount of the float. The massive buys we see in the early hours may just be market makers hedging their options exposure via synthetic longs. They can do this indefinitely unless the rules get enforced."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Actually this could be a giant problem if the ETFs all rebalance OUT of GME this on the 19th  More than 100% of the float could get sold on one day.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Why we need a recall.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe There is a battle brewing amongst HFs. They maybe positioning knowing we are holding. Two animals will tear each other apart over food and then the Apes come in and take over and feast. Let them fight it out..... and we rule this jungle!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Interesting.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"On the flip side, I think they have to stop lending them out to sell them. So they would have to call them back first."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What this guy said
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Popi is a beaty eyed little bug monke and I’m so proud of him
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This sub is wild. Using hedgie payouts to support our hairy ape cousins. Warms my fucking heart.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuckin love this ape
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How did you adopt Popi if u/rickjackwood also adopted Popi??

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t give a fuck about making statements I just want to make money
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How are making a statement if you don't take their money?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You do realize that several hedges are long GME and it's just a couple you're trying to stick it to...right? 

All those institutional shares are owned primarily by hedges. They will sell out when they've screwed over thier frenemies enough and will laugh at leaving retail holding the bag after we helped them do thier thing.

I'm long GME, but please have a strategy to make money or you will lose it."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a casino not a fucking stage
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,wtf?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m in it to make a statement. 

That statement is: “Fuck you. Pay me.”"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,EL - OH - EL
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Obviously the hedge funds are gonna be REALLY UPSET if OP rebels against them by losing money.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This. Never fool yourself about who’s using who.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Clearly we can do one by doing the other and vice versa people. We will become wealthy, and send a message. There is no doing just one of these."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Did this ape go to glamor shots like it’s fucking 1993?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Best community on reddit btw
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,If there's nine million sponsored gorilla's maybe that foundation can go on the stockmarket and we can gamble on gorillas
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,From billboards to animal adoption. We have evolved!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn, you got the sexiest one."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is one of the best movements I've seen in a long time. I guess a lot of us will look back on live and say:Remember that time in 2021, when we were apes, saved apes and lived by the code of the apes? Love it!!! Should become a lifestyle ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the kind of movement i can get behind

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What a handsome ape
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ape has more flair than I do
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd adopt one of you ape's children but I know that the baby really is just your wife's bf's.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What!? How can I do this? When I win i promise I will adopt a whole family.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yessssss

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,does Gorilla meat taste like chicken?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck yeah he did
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This ape is looking better than half the headshots on IMDB.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,No... its just maybelline 😉
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Jesus freaking love you. Do you remember all those terrible glamor shot. They were so bad. Some of the girls would wear this crazy heavy makeup too.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I buy and sell apes like myself every day.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It's truly amazing
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a beauty
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You are asking the real questions here
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,On god
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Do *you* taste like chicken?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This question is retarded
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This ape fucks.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,heh
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Just sell weekly 20% above current price. Get enough each week to add more into pltr.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice to see some sensibility here. Although I decided to dump half of 11.5k shares into leaps. To feel some excitement. I'm so desensitized to 3-5% movement now
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The market works very simply - when the crowd buys, prices go up and vice versa."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just assume that PLTR will reach $65 long before Jan 22.  You may not have any stock in a year, depending on how many calls you sell.  If I were you, I'd keep the stock and forget about the calls."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea until PLTR actually hits $65💀 releastically though it probably wont and you should be able to get out during a dip.

Enjoy your tendies good sir."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So your cost basis + the premium collected on calls will basically get you back to where you would have been if you never bought PLTR.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ahhh man you are going to be rich assss fuckkkkkkkkk in the long term. Lately it’s been GME vs PLTR. Stop it. Let’s all get rich together.💕🚀
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,how long will it take to sell 100 contracts that far out?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,My man!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s what I was doing from when it was $15 to today. Looking for a more passive approach, RH taking too much of my time at the moment. I also hold PLTR in my ROTH IRAs for long term 10+ years hold. This was more of a yolo to buy a truck now and pay off my house if called."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re talking about the difference between making a lot of money, or making a lot of money.

I have more shares in a ROTH IRA just in case 😅"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is a shitty play. He could sell further OTM calls if he wanted a less hands on approach like he's saying he doesn't want to focus on calls as much, or he could just forget he has the shares for years. Here he's going to lose his shares at 65 lmao"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,If it hits 65 he gets what he wants anyway🤦🏻‍♂️. Only if it goes way higher does he miss out on anything
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I’d be ok with that. I’d buy ETFs and collect dividends 😅
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Remind me 1 year!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Been selling CC since PLTR was $14. Built a big part of my position by doing that. The cash for the last 5,000 shares I got from when AMC went from $2 to $20 in two weeks."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Plus whatever gains the stock makes lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Took about 2 minutes.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Instantly if he lowers the ask lol like an hour realistically when pltr is green though, the volume on some strikes has been pretty high"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Poster above you: ""oh man, you might make $400k in a year, that'd be terrible"" what a joke lol"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,If it hits 65... if it’s a price you’re comfortable selling at as an exit strategy it’s fine. He doesn’t have to sell calls for all 10k shares either.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You must not understand how selling calls work, selling calls is bearish as you are hoping a dip occurs so you can buy to close your contract at a profit. 

Or you know that the stock won’t hit $65 and instead will dip so you can relax with theta decay.

If PLTR hits $65 he is now at risk of someone exercising the contract and having his shares called away, meaning he would miss on much more profit as PLTR rises in profit because he gave his shares away.

Think before you comment."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea its a good play as its so far out a dip is bound to happen and you would be able to close. 

Only thing I would change would be waiting till there is a rally then selling the calls as that would make you the most money but either way its a good play."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"sweet, what was the premium per share?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it hits $70 then did he not make major gain up to $65 - yes he did

Did he miss out on more? - Yes but still doesn't mean he didn't have a massive gain

The real issue is he is stuck holding the shares. What if it drops, can't sell / take a beating on the options

$65+ isn't a risk to not making profits, it is a risk to not making more. Price dropping is a risk because he owns the shares"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,He wants to sell at 65..... its only dangerous if he was selling naked calls. You sure you understand how this works??
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"No. Cc’s allow him to sell his shares at $65 per share. They aren’t randomly taken away by the tendieman. So he only loses if PLTR’s share price gets above his premiums plus the strike price. Even then, he does not lose, because he has no money to lose. He just has potential gains lost."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"He’s not trying to buy to close, I don’t get why that’s so hard for you to understand"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably around $3.50
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,$3.20
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes I think we all understand that but regardless thanks for explaining more for others who may be new. 

If you were to see above already told OP its a good play."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Obviously not if the title of the post says he wants to enjoy theta gains. Which only come from time decay meaning he doesn’t believe it will come anywhere near $65.

Again think before you comment."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"As someone who has actually sold CC’s and has gotten the calls exercised you are mistaken. As long as PLTR’s price is above that strike price the call can be exercised at any point by the buyer. 

He does lose money as if PLTR were to hit $100 for example he would miss out on actually owning PLTR and the potential premium as he sold the Calls when PLTR was at $25.

Which is why most people only sell CC at a relative peak in a stock price then ride the dip and close the contract. 

Kind of sad I have to explain this in the sub but I understand most people don’t actually sell calls or puts due to capital or stock requirements as most platformS don’t allow you to sell naked options."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Danm is it that hard to read and get context. 

I never said he has to buy to close he can obviously wait until expiration as I had already said multiple times. 

Buying to close would just allow him to take his gains quicker and release his collateral, or he could wait until expiration up to him."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Learn to read, he is taking his theta gains now and buying a truck, and opening the app in 2 years hoping PLTR goes to the moon...... you lock in your theta gains even if the stock goes to zero"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,">is it that hard to read and get context

It is for you apparently. You’re telling OP that there might be a dip so he can buy to close, and it’s clear from his post he has no interest in buy to close. You’re the one having a hard time reading and getting context."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also it seems you have never sold a contract or else I wouldn't have to explain this to you, yes you receive the premium as soon as you sell the contract. 

However you still need to wait till it expires or close it to release your collateral. So unless he wants to wait till expiration the best option would be wait for a dip and buy $65 calls on that strike date to close his contracts and get his collateral back. 

Which is why I told him it would be better to wait for a rally then to sell( in order to get most premium) then wait for a dip and close his contracts. Iv'e done this plenty of times before, try it then come back and discuss."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ahh didn’t realize 2022 was in 2 years also please look up what theta is. 

It increases with time decay thats why buying OTM weekly options are so dangerous by the time its Friday they are worthless unless you are close ITM."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow I didn’t realize I wasn’t allowed to offer up investment strategies. OP is his own person and can choose what to do.

I am simply giving him an example of how he could take theta gains without having to wait a whole year until expiration. It is completely up to him what he chooses to do with his money I don’t really care."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"For anyone still reading. This strategy will allow u to sell call options multiple times and is a great way to lock in theta gains as soon as you buy back the call. Its more effort as you have to keep your eye on the options price etc. but it also increases your theta gains.
I guess what many dont understand is that u can sell and buy back options multiple times. There is more to selling calls!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly kind of sad what quality this sub has turned into if I have to explain selling calls to people. 

But it is simple sell them when the stock has rallied and is hitting all time highs then ride the decay as it drops buy them to close. And rinse and repeat. 

This only doesn't work if the stock keeps rising in prices and now you have missed out but since OP has long dated sells his risk is lower as the chance for a dip is much higher over longer periods of time."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah. I think the thing is this is much more stress free and many people dont have enough shares to make this repeated sell and buy back worth it. If u sell one call for 120$ and buy back when its worth 60$ are the 60$ u make really worth it if it keeps u glued to screen the whole day. Of course this is a massive exxageration but i can see why people would opt for the thing op did
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep and you also have to think about the opportunity cost as you have to wait for the dip to close out your contract and will not have access to your collaterall to invest in other stocks. 

But it is a great low risk strategy, I usually find myself selling weeklies after there is a rally, I try to time the top then close out after a dip or wait till expiration."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Your posts are the best part of my weekend. Thank you fellow retard.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, 80% of the time. My general thesis is that the market will see a big dip into FOMC, the key is whether VXX participates"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, I feel like the Monday big open are always followed by massive profit takes within the hour"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably because this is pretty much the cheapest it's ever been?

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah, probably could have made a bit more hodling, but it it my profit threshold for an option like that so I cashed out and moved forward."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I’m being serious, thanks honestly man. You’ve helped me get into the market in a more strategic way. Your posts have been the starting off point I needed to learn how to actually do my own research. Thank you so much ❤️"

SKLZ increasing that 14% figure only increases AAPL’s income, and AAPL has no reason to try to limit or try to take 30% of total bet."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wouldn’t it be 🍯for the 🌈🐻
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t think it’s reason enough as apple would not leave profits for so long they probably have some talk with them . Company’s revenue seems to be up for the 20th consecutive quarter  so have puts would be stupid as investors see fundamentals. Plus their is no big money movement looking from the outside. Just my two bananas.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,They have many apps on the google play store too
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The lottery rake is 50 percent. Parimutuel betting rake is 20 percent in most states. Both of these types of betting have done very well for a long time. Not sure if 14 percent will keep many people from playing if they like this type of gambling.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you have any evidence Apple is taking any of the revenue currently? At what percentage? Do they take from the developers share too?

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"According to their website, those games only allow virtual currency, meaning they likely have little revenue?

https://skillz.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028517711-Google-Play-Store"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Asking if I have evidence is pedantic, as I said “AAPL is likely...”.  It’s a logical assumption.  I’ve been wrong before, so take it as you will.  If the revenue generated is by collecting a rake of every bet, it’s logical to assume that’s where AAPL will take their cut from.  It is unreasonable to believe AAPL would try to say they are due 30% of every dollar bet.  As you said, that would be an untenable business model."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s wack, I’m not sure what’s going on but I’ve had an iPhone and an android and I’ve played a skills game on both and they both use real money, as far as I can tell."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m sorry, I didn’t mean it like that, I’m just genuinely curious what kind of deal AAPL has with SKLZ behind the scenes, it seems significant to me and I can’t for the life of me find out anything certain about it."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"My thoughts on how they handle the income:

SKLZ get 14% from bets. For example, we'll just say a bet is $10. That 10 x 14%= 1.42 (SKLZ profit). That profit then gets the 30% reduction, meaning AAPL gets ¢42. Meaning the realized profit for SKLZ is $1 for every $10 on their bets.

This is just speculation and simple math from me. I'm not much of a business man, but I'm sure they've figured it all out since I'm /nearly/ certain there's other betting apps on the Apple Store. I just know March Madness is here so these kinds of companies can make a large income with the traffic, especially now with Esports."

 He says ""If I'd have waited a week I could have bought in at half that price""
 This is not so cleverly disguised fud, he doesn't come right out and say the price will be 50% less this week, but he implies it and implies you should cut other people's throats to sell before them.

  These fucking shills wanna act like we're dumb money sheep that can't see a "" empathy plea "" for the bullshit that it is. 

  Dude even tried to say DFV has an exit strategy when he literally doubled down on his position. 

   Every fucking time the price rises enough to threaten them, the FUD wave starts. 

  There are more shitty tickers being pushed this weekend and more FUD shill posts then I've seen since January and $SLV.

I was right, but got too excited. I learned my lesson. I still view my play as a good one, even if not the best; GME is going places short term and long. It truly cannot lose imo.

I am saying people need to have a goal set in mind and aim for it. Don't be that guy thay kept waiting for someone else to post when to exit; by then it is always too late and that's just a fact of life. If that is shillish, bearish or FUD to you then idc. Your life."

   If I am pointing out the underlying messages you are putting out. 
  You need to consider what I am saying, and why.  If you are actually long GME, then why is everything your saying undertinged with ""sell before the crash"" ?

 Now.  Let me explain something to you Shilly McHedgedundson
   All these ""dumb money""  ""crashing plane"" "" sell out your fellow man cause free market"" goes against the entire thesis of the short squeeze. 
  You wanna call me names little hedgie? Cool. 
  We aren't cut throat crybaby manipulating pieces of shit like you. 
  My goal is to take hedge fund money. 
 The same goal the hedge funds long in GME have. 
  
  You trying to equate GME to a pump and dump that we should cut our fellow apes troat just to profit, shows you are deep in the corner of the short hedge funds that we are smacking the fuck down. 
  
  But go ahead, tell people to buy $SLV, or plea to our empathy or humanity or whatever the fuck you want. 
  
   Real APE take gamble, for BIG tendies.  Now we're knocking on the door of the squeeze and you join the FUD crowd.

  ""Cut my throat to get ahead. "" 

 You hedge fund fucks would like that, for us to scramble over ourselves selling before this week bankrupts you.

When the short squeeze pops off it’s gonna moon but yes there is gonna be a crash and you got me fucked up if you think I’m not gonna sell all but one share (I’m gonna get that bitch in a paper share after I’m fuck you rich) when it hits $69,420.69."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That isn't a dumb money argument. There are a lot of genuinely new investors who jumped into this to escape poverty. Not once did I say sell.

Quit projecting your weak-ass, conspiracy theories on people. Do you seriously think my account which frequents video games, real girls and here is a shill acount for Melvin?

Yes, they don't care. They are strangers on the internet. They care as much as any stranger cares. They wouldn't wish you harm usually, but they're not gonna just stop their lives for you. If you fuck up, unlike hedgies nobody bails us out. You owe it to yourself to think for yourself.

I got into GME because I thought it made sense. End of story. I will exit or double down as I see fit, as it makes sense. That's all that needs said. And yes, the average market player, retail included, IS out to fuck you. For them to make money they have to. I lose money by you making money.

This is not preschool; some of us will lose. I am saying at least lose because YOU made a bad play. Not because you were indecisive and let 8 million strangers convince you how to think.

Not every dissenting opinion is a shill. I support GME; this ape bullshit is getting grating. Do you know why it is most likely Friday we failed to break 300? A bunch of people tried 800c.

 You sir, are completely fucking wrong.

 They had no incentive to discuss things with me. 
  I've personally reached out to people that have posted losses, and spoke with a few and still do. 

  Your idea that the whole world is shit, and saying ape shit is grating, shows how shitty and lonely your life is.

Yea they have many bananas, but not infinite bananas. Remember, their end game WAS bankruptcy for gme. They were never planning on buying them back EVER. It costs us nothing to hold. My personal favorite scenario has to be the dtcc liquidating them themselves at a moment’s notice."

Then earlier this week we saw an article about a guy from citadel who left the company again after coming back for less than two years (was it two or one?). I think the top people are preparing for the worst so they can be protected.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I think citadel is long now. Don’t forget Janet yellen mentioned these hedge funds should reposition. Ex fed chair Ben bernanke is on the board of citadel- he used his get out of short jail free card and any other short lucky to be part of his circle. 99% of options flow thru Citadel so if citadel went down the whole market goes down. Yellen saved citadel and they repositioned net long.  All other shorts that stayed and new short sellers who jumped in after first squeeze are gonna get nuked. No saving them that’s why the price has stepped all the way up to $264 as of Friday close. There won’t be a stopping of GME trading anymore. Manipulation by shorts yes but they will be sacrificed if GME runs to the moon no saving them.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Didn’t it squeeze from Monday to Wednesday??  Some mother fucker scored a win in making GME fall like a head shot kill, but if that wasn’t a successful manipulation, wouldn’t you consider the 2 days prior, the squeeze???

Remember, I’m just a fucking retard. And I like the stock."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn’t short interest only around 30% now?  There could be another minor squeeze but what we’re seeing is the effect of millions of retards.. not hedge funds being ‘underwater’ still.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes or no?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I've been killing it by buying at the peak right before it dips. I've got so many downwards red lines. I dont know how the scoring works but I'm pretty sure I'm winning...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucking buy hard on those dips. I started January at 300. Went hard in February at 48. Will do it again if they let me. I can stay retarded longer than they can stay solvent. That’s the principle.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Me too.  It'll just give me a chance to load up on a lot more shares especially if the dips to 40 coincide with my paydays.

Daily interest payment depends on closing price at the end of day.

However, this is ignoring that the current short squeeze play really has little to do with the underlying fundamentals of the company (despite what some folks on here are saying). So Cohen's only relevant if Gamestop issues a dividend or stock split (which they very well might not do, but if they do it forces a stock accounting so it would interfere with the counterfeit shares strategy) or to the degree that increasing confidence in the company influences folks to buy stock despite not knowing or understanding the short squeeze scenario (which some will)."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,They knew they had bag holders waiting to take the stock off their hands at any price. Of course they would drive it up and then dumpster it whenever they felt it was good enough.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The biggest problem I see with shuting down trading on GME is the loss of trust with all retail clients. Because either it's a free market and everyone can buy what they want or it is not. I think it's unlikely and it's a last resort for them. But still possible, and on some level, perhaps even necessary from their point of view. Anyway - fuck'em."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"OTOH if trading halts, the shorts are stuck paying interest, right? I can see that sort of shutdown resulting in a giant controlled reordering of ownership of the company where we the people still walk away with significant tendies.

They had no problem saying it was 140% back when that was the reported number, but now that it dropped they’re grasping at straws, I saw some retard on here posit that short interest is really at like 900% lol. There’s no hope for people like that just sit back and wait for the loss porn."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not a complete free market, nor has it ever been. Completely free markets quickly devolve into anarchy as the snake oil salesmen defraud the majority quickly destroying trust in the market. The level of corruption ebbs and flows, but regulation has always been a part of it. It's why there are stoppages and insider trading is illegal (though not fairly enforced).

You talk about maintaining trust in the market, but if a small % of people (hedges and retail that own GME) are reaping massive rewards because a smaller % of people (a couple hedges that shorted GME) are tanking the entire market, trust is also destroyed. Massive wealth will be destroyed for those that took no position whatsoever in GME and that is why the SEC will probably step in and halt all trading."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It's more likely that the long hedges and corporations cut a deal with the shorts to unwind the cluster fuck. Retail either gets a few scraps thrown thier way or has the privilege of holding bags for 3-5 years while the GME slowly turns into a superpower.

There have been many times I've wanted a one or two-off part but they would not be machinable and the cost of casting would be WAY too high for an individual dicking around in the garage. Wonder what 3D printing would have cost. This opens up a whole new world to a whole demographic. 

Are you planning on shares or calls? I'm definitely putting this one on my watch list. Might consider some 3/19 $22.5c if they don't open super strong. Theta has them at probably $0.55 Monday morning if it opens at around its Friday close. But with earnings on Monday who the hell knows. Price never makes much sense relative to earnings."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I have been wanting to get in too. My worry is binder jetting technology is not there yet. The parts created are weak and need post processing like heat'em in a furnace.

The plan is to buy and hold, so I guess we can only help by holding now (unless we find some more money to throw at it)?

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"What I’m worried about, and I think is most likely, is an institution(s) working a deal to “bail” the shorts out. I say “bail” because the shorts are obviously fucked, but I foresee retail being robbed of the full extent of this squeeze as institutions direct the liquidation of hedge fund capital into their accounts, not only capping the squeeze, but causing retail to scramble to avoid holding the bag. 

I read another comment that mentioned that there was evidence of banks offering a deal to the hedgies before the Jan squeeze and they turned it down. I’m very skeptical of this take, but it’s certainly within the realm of possibility and we’re probably getting to the point where any deal looks better than MOASS. Any news of a deal will send the share price skyrocketing down, so retail’s going to have to be on their toes with this one."

We don't need significant volume now because there isn't share liquidity - retail and long institutions are holding. It's why relatively small purchases move the price substantially. Significant volume would send this rocketing instantly, but I think it will likely happen anyway when short institutions back off on price suppression (which we saw Wednesday morning when the stock price doubled in a couple of hours on a couple million trades in volume)."

I.e. if you sell naked GME call for $450 (bc you think it won’t happen) and it happens now you have to buy shares of GME at or above $450 which is costing you $45k plus. 

Where as if you already had the shares (covered call)  you can just sell them without having to buy shares on the market.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Man if only all the people could get an influx of extra money at the same time....
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,We just got our stimulus check. Can you guess where it’s going to go?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro, we all just got $1400 checks. If 1/100th of us bought more because of it, that's still almost 100,000 buyers from just this pool of degenerates"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That wasn't parabloic at all, that was relatively linear"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,A true retard.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"LMAO, already priced in 🤔"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s Saturday
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Um, sir - This is a Wendy's......"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Good man
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"realistically the best calls to buy are the ones where the delta is going to have the biggest impact. There was a thread made in the last week examining the highest impact calls based on the available calls at the time. I believe the $270ish range were highest impact last week, but it's definitely changed now"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Acronym check, ATM? DTE?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"it was still above average volume day overall, but yes, if shorts back off a little the price spikes hard

mind you, if shorts are planning conversions, then they're ALSO longs in the case of buy pressure (as they need shares to do a conversion).....until they're not, which is what we witnessed wednesday

they were likely the buying pressure that got added right at the start of the day (where we saw a 6.21m uptick) and then they let it ride, and smashed later in the day

I'd be warry of high volume + fast uprising, as it could signal this kind of move again"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Do naked longs exist? Just asking bro. I'm defo a naked short either way
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ill never lend you my shares again dude. You said you were gonna care for em, not lend em around like some cheap whore! And I thought we were friends!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"100-300 million & it is over

I have said it in previous posts, higher then high demand volume"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,No it didn’t. But what happens after does. Can’t go up if we out of fucking money. Good thing stimmy got passed. 500 end of next week. Bank on it sluts.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol. Good luck with that theory
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets, Not all of us.... nonetheless 🚀🚀💎💎🚀🚀
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So if 100k buy it with stimulus they would own 600k more gme. You really think that's all it takes to squeeze
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,He's just that dedicated.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, for anyone wondering here is the thread that contains the optimum call purchase calculator for maximum delta leverage. Instructions on how to use it are included.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"the tldr on which options to buy is, if they are cheap, it's because they're no use to anyone, including the squeeze."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Well we probably had 200M volume this week alone so.. do we not need a defined time frame for the volume as well?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup those Debbie downer sluts are terrible! I hope $500 next week!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you really think WSB has the only people buying it?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone got an update for this week on which ones to get for 3/19?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let me be clear, we won’t have a high volume spike from your average players until news hits all can see.

All the high volume you see that has no transparent news on it is the institutions  going at each other or high 3rd party buys. The small retail keeps the price stable as long as they hold"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol. Yes.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I see 4 things saying increases and 1 thing saying decreases. Seems like the 1 decrease will cancel out with one of the 4 increases leaving us with nothing but 3 increases (🚀🌑) and that options can't go tits up
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I love how your using MU as the example.  I'm holding MU 4/16s right now and getting theta fucked because for all the big up and down days is essential going no where. Should have sold when it hit $96 a month ago because now if it goes $96 I'm still not up as much as I was. Fucking 💎🙌
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,They say you learn the greeks by getting fucked by them and figuring out which one it was. Now I understand why I never needed to bother learning Rho.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry I'm still too dumb to understand. I'll just yolo and hope for the bestest
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,As someone who is starting to sell options I want to thank you for making potentially millions of people erroneously think theta is linear and not exponential. Can't wait to make money off them.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is actually helpful lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you buy 100 calls of that exact option, rho would need to be taken into consideration"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"No cap, best explanation ever without having to listen to 20min youtube videos or read 10 fucking pages. Easy to understand"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck thanks this is great.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You did a great job and good thinking making it a meme. When I was learning the greeks it was hard to find a good explanation and I learned about theta the hard way. This would have been useful. I did manage to at least get my money back though. Thanks for making and/or sharing.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I miss the options wizard.. he made good calls
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I gotta say. Been trading for 15 plus years. Can’t keep the Greeks straight. This actually helped. Who would have thought?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"this is only technical analysis in the english language sense, not in the stock voodoo sense. mislabeled. edit: but still helpful."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What interest rates does rho consider?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This pic is older than time, but it still holds up"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,one of the best instructionals on the internets
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like your funny words, magic man"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So how does theta gang work? Are they the ones selling the options?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"this is awesome, thanks! Can you explain two things?

\- Theta gang; what's the play here? you sell the contract before theta impact is introduced in your option and you still walk away with tendies. right?

\- and how does Vega work, can you explain that a bit more?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Checks for /u/MartyMoho , 😤. 

Low key though MU is my biggest bet rn, literally can’t go tits up :) 


🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m pretty sure gamma is on the second dollar increase not the first, but I’m also wrinkle free in my brain cuz Downey > Clorox."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Did that dude who was all in on mu a couple years ago go long on rope?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dumb ass fucking question. I just finalized my first options gains this week but I haven’t gotten to considering the Greeks yet. Are they something you look at before buying a contract to make a descision, or something you watch during the week to know when to sell?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't have time for all these silly names ape see green ape happy
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets, the iv on damn near everything has been high for a year .  off the charts high
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did know the greeks, my problem with it (except for theta) is how to use them."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Reminder to everyone that an option is usually tied to 100 shares, so everything should be multiplied by 100. 

Ie if MU goes up a dollar here, your contract would increase by $45, and your new delta would be 0.68 because gamma is 0.23

So if MU went up another dollar, your contract would increase by $68 that time"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the tl;dr
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Word of advice: unless you see a reason coming up for big moves, think about cutting your losses or rolling out farther. Unless you can afford to lose the money.

Edit: this is also not my original work, but it helped me when I first got here a few years ago and I figured it was worth a repost for all the new monke"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,i assumed that was picked as a joke about the greek letter Mu.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Chure, I’ll help: https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/9j8m42/theta_question_linear_decay/"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It helped me a ton when I first got here, and with so much new money I figured it’d be a good refresher"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ye I didn’t see another appropriate flair for it is all
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup. They sell options and collect the premium, hoping that the option expires out of the money (OTM) so it can’t be exercised. So they keep the 100 shares they own (if they wrote a covered call) or don’t have to buy 100 shares to sell you (if they wrote uncovered), and also keep the money that someone paid for the option."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"For theta gang: They sell options and collect the premium, hoping that the option expires out of the money (OTM) so it can’t be exercised. So they keep the 100 shares they own (if they wrote a covered option) or don’t have to buy 100 shares to sell you (if they wrote uncovered), and also keep the money that someone paid for the option.

Vega is basically the same as delta, except for implied volatility. For every percent of IV gain or loss, the option becomes more or less expensive via the Vega amount.  It’s generally better to buy an option close to close and sell the next morning since IV is generally higher then if it’s moved a lot or is otherwise volatile. 

Look up and understand IV crush before you start trading options on meme stocks. IV stocks are hot potatoes."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Whichever one of those is best for squeezing is the one that’s right
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Move the decimal two places to the right, monke"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The ones you should really check before buying are Open Interest and Implied Volatility which aren’t really Greeks but they tell you how fucked you are when the stock makes moves, and when it’s time to sell - no open interest, no buyers.

Second after those is Theta, to know how fucked your are every day.

Then if you want to understand the types of moves that option can make (moon shot moves? Or baby delta moves?) see Delta.

Gamma & Vega are good information.

Rho is gay and mostly overlooked."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Generally when you’re buying to open you’d give them a quick check, and you want favorable greeks for the play you’re making. Whether that’s price movement or IV or both. 

The takeaway here is theres a lot of factors that go into how much an option is worth. For instance, the reason GME options are so expensive right now is because the IV (implied volatility) is so high, which prices into the option via Vega."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I saw MU and new this was from years back. Bring back the MUn and Lisa Su while we’re at it!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks apemigo!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,ty for this!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You figured correctly. Thanks dude
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,it is just a shame when good info gets tagged as magic.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,IV crush and Theta gang are what u gotta watch out for before making yer entry point!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"A rule I made to myself after I got fucked by RKT is “if you see 150% gains in less than a hour, fucking take them” my greed got the best of me and i assumed it would keep going up. Expired worthless. Does that sound dumb or smart? I can’t tell the difference right now. To me it sounds like someone who doesn’t quite know what they’re doing yet. Which I don’t."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Or just join theta gang and fuck the options buyers :P
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly anything over 100% is already incredible and I think that should be the rule of thumb - you’re retarded not to sell when you’re up 100%!  At LEAST SELL 50%...  that way the position is free, you can let it run, and you can’t possibly lose what you paid.

So whenever you’re up 100% if you wanna be smart and not gamble, always sell 50% and let the rest go to the moon 🌚"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Are we still talking about options? I only had one contract (im starting very small). You cant sell 50% of a contract right?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Options or equity, but yeah ok if you have 1 contract that won’t work lol, so buy 2 and average down"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Better be buying a Raising Canes with that money, you’ll have tendies for life!"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Idk they have a strong rating online. Feel free to donate to whichever organization you’d like.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes you can adopt the same monkey. The only difference is you get a certificate with whatever name you want on it. We all have to share gorillas. Kind of like when my wife had a child with her boyfriend.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I signed up for a volunteer trip with [Ape Malaysia](https://apemalaysia.com/).  There are many different volunteer opportunities, this one I got into kind of by fluke booking last minute and really just wanting to help with the Orangutans, and go to Borneo. They organize your accommodation, feed you, and you just learn tonnes.  We started work before dawn, quit by noon, then mid afternoon were back out in the boat to count wildlife.  The best part of this trip is you're allowed into the wildlife sanctuary (where we were planting) and that's a no go for everyone except workers, had no idea how huge this was until I got there.  

Unreal experience, being woken up in the middle of the night by a bull pygmy elephant calling to the ladies across the river, and just seeing so many critters.  I went by myself, met amazing like minded folks from all over, and highly recommend this to anyone who loves nature.  

[Here's](https://imgur.com/qH0o94b) my fave pic of the trip, a short tailed macaque.  These guys have adapted to walking on the jungle floor, not many do (especially orangutans), so this group we were planting for also set up [""slack lines""](https://imgur.com/EuQTaME) high in the trees to help the primates cross the crocodile infested waterways. [This](https://www.thegreatprojects.com/) is the website that has all the different trips, all over the world.   I'm going back as soon as I can :) Okay, last pic, the boss of this family of [Proboscis](https://imgur.com/SWPhJ5X) monkeys.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, to be fair, I was already drinking some sweet Austin, Texas Mead and some delicious Ft. Worth, Texas IPA"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds fucking delicious 🤤
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"NOOOOOOO!!! No margin! 

Your shares can and will be sold out from under you to ""cover their potential losses on a volatile asset"". Cash only boss, don't give any ammo to the enemy here."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Margin is a Bad idea because your margin shares will be lend out to hedgies just buy shares with your Owen Money and hodl
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So you know that flash crash on Thursday? If you are borrowing on margin, such a move will trigger your broker to liquidate your position immediately. If that happens you’ll be left with hardly any money or owing your broker money as you sit with a dildo up your ass watching the stock recover immediately. 

If you are buying gme on margin you’re fucking yourself and you are also allowing for the ladder attacks to be successful because they force the sale of positions such as yours."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Margin call in 5...4...3
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Margin bad.  Cash good.  cuz of potential wild swings.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s not as absolutely bad as people say here.

If you bought 5x as many shares as you could at 40. You are laughing. They would have to go down to $32 dollars to get margin called at 5:1 which wouldn’t realistically happen any more.

However if you bought at $280, and intend to hold even at $200, then you will have to have $80 for every stock you own.

Even then you might get margin called earlier.

Margin is a loan and allows you to tie up your capital in other stable investments. With a proper diverse portfolio, you’re risks are much smaller than an all out gamble like GME is. 

But also, the company could decide to change the margin requirements for specific stocks. They would face a lot of backlash for doing so, especially without warning but it could happen at which point you would be margin called instantly. 

You know when people warn about using cash you don’t have. Margin/Leverage is exactly that.

So don’t treat the margin amount as ‘how much I can invest’. Decide your own margins for each stock and make sure to keep that much in your equity."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You guys are crazy with the margin bets lol I love it. Just be careful. Don't get margin called
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, you definitely belong here. Better Google 'margin call' and put a wrinkle on your smooth brain."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Butters better.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This 🦍 gets it. As price go up buy more stonks. 💎🙌🏻🚀
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Gotcha.  Gonna rework the allocation this week.  Thank you.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't have Owen money.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait, but I then set them to limit sell at 10,000, doesn’t that stop them being able to borrow for shorts?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think so. You can still get margin called. You used money that isn't yours, they can sell anything at market price you purchased since it's margin...."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"As far as i know No your Broker deletes your Limit sell or set‘s down the qantity they also secretly reduced limit sell‘s in january from 420,69$ to 65$"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hmmmmmm....  ok, will have to rethink...  cause this is all my margin, I’d have to sell everything else to then buy gme.  Thanks for the tip dear ape, will create a plan."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Right. The only safe place in this calamity is cash purchased shares. They’ll margin call as soon as the scarcity skyrockets.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Best case is that when there's a pop up next week, you sell and then rebuy back in with your cash account. Hopefully there isn't 6 halts an hour because of huge movement, that will hopefully get you enough time to close your position and get back in with cash money."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly why I don't fuck with margin. My money is my money.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm sure this will be riddled with inaccuracy

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If this paints Melvin, Steve & Ken in a positive manner I short Hulu.

Apes together strong."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It won't be good for us.  They will have the documentary ending with the stock price crashing to $40 or so and show people getting burned by it.  It will make this whole thing look bad.

This documentary is coming out in the middle of the story, not the end.  It will clearly be propaganda that will attempt to be ""fair"" to both sides, but will end with heartache and a negative spin...and with the impression *it was fun while it lasted but it’s all over*.

Source: think about it, the documentary had to have wrapped filming a week or so ago.

We know it’s not the end of the story, however.  They jumped the gun.  Let’s make the establishment look foolish, **again**."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How are they realising a documentary when it's still happening and a thing
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It's like making a WW2 documentary in 1942...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How extensive could it be after less than a month? And it not even being over?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m going to short this documentary I know it’s going to be shite
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably propaganda
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I see a lot of negativity surrounding this but I remain optimistic. GME needs volume and more publicity, good or bad, is welcomed.

Hulu has it labeled as a TV series. That implies this is the first episode of the series. I have a feeling the producers are smarter than the hedgefunds and know this isn’t over. Why would they rush to produce a 53 minute documentary covering a story that obviously isn’t finished? Why release it 2 days before the next congressional hearing? The series relies on the GameStop saga continuing and the plot thickening. More drama = more viewers = mo’ tendies. 

This is amazing guys. We will get exclusive interviews with some big players who DEFENDED us (looking at you Mark Cuban and Steven Huffman). We also have Vlad and Cramer probably spewing bullshit that is likely to backfire on them in the next few weeks. Potentially at the hearing (for Vlad). IMO, the more those two idiots talk about GME, the better.

I look forward to watching this Monday night knowing millions of other viewers will also be watching it while their stimulus checks start rolling in."

Since the GME saga is obviously not over I can see the ending alluding to the fact that this, in fact, is not over and we can expect more drama. Which is good for us."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Couldn’t agree more! I’m excited to watch it. Good or bad it’ll help GME get even more eyes on it. 👌 Though I suspect it’ll be good and paint brokerages negatively for stopping traders from trading in Jan. That is my hope at least.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"they're gonna tell us what's gonna happen, it's a predictive documentary"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m thinking this documentary is going to be heavily focused on when Robinhood and other brokerages halted retail traders from buying GME during the first big surge at the end of January and the fall out of that. So focused on why brokerages made those decisions, what people think about it good or bad, what policy changes might occur to make sure that doesn’t happen again, etc. However, with what happened this past week they should definitely do a follow up/part 2 of this on going story as I think what happened this week is a story of it’s own but will build off of what happened in Jan/early Feb. I also agree that it’s definitely a cash grab too as Hulu announced this the day GME spiked to $345+. Would it be better to wait to finish a doc like this to get all the details- yes. However, with the resurgence of interest in GME due to this past week, it couldn’t be a better time to release it as everyone is wanting to watch, read, listen to any content that’s covering this stock right now."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did you consider the large institutional ownership of GME? Aren't owners of more than 5% of the company supposed to report within 45 days of any transactions they've made (correct me if I'm wrong)? Considering 122% (or so) of ownership lies with institutions alone, if owners liquidated during the squeeze, the 45 day period where they'd have to report it would happen this week.

My hypothesis is that if we don't see any institutions reporting decreased ownership over the next week, SI% could not have fallen at all, because the only shares that would have been available to trade during the first squeeze would have been borrowed shares. Individual short positions could have been closed out, but if they were with borrowed shares, then the net stays the same at a macro level. If you use a borrowed share to close a short position, if it ever gets recalled, it opens up the short position that was closed (using that share) creating a net neutral position, thereby not affecting the SI%.

I might just be retarded but this is my take on it. Good analysis too btw."

So they hold no responsibility in being wrong. Therefore manipulatable for capital gainz. FINRA and others are only risking reputation and even then if that goes down they move the sentiment to another “trusted” company. This now almost 3 months later is backfiring horribly. There bet was i believe to scare out retail investors not just out of gamestop but to fold all together. Well we are fuckin retarded right? They did not expect us to hold and buy more. Its beautiful to see. Its all bullshit and games until the shit hits the fan. I am retarded tho. I am probably wrong. I will bet on im correct. They had us in the first half not even gonna lie!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a Cuckhold Rehabilitation Centre"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hi there! I just wanted to say that I really appreciate the time and effort you put into this work and post! 

I'm not smart enough to know if you're right or wrong about any of this, but I do get the feeling we are being lied to about SI% from FINRA/S3. My broker is telling me that if I want to short GME, I'll be paying ridiculously high interest rates, AND must maintain a 500% margin requirement. No other stock has these requirements... 

If SI% on GME is so low and the shorts have mostly covered, why am I being quoted a price that suggests otherwise?

Another commenter suggested using your method to determine the SI% of another stock to test the accuracy of your methods. I think that's a great idea and would be very interested in reading the results if you choose to do this.

Again, thank you for your efforts! Always a great read! : )"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So you’re saying short interest is greater than 15%? 30%? 

That’s all I need to know. The reported short interest is still INSANE!!! 

We don’t need to know that short interest is greater than 100%. The manipulated reports show a high enough short interest % to DESTROY the hedgies. 

Happily holding and will happily buy more."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"TL:DR 

Hold GME"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL, we're supposed to believe that they went from 132% SI to 46% SI in 8 days WHILE the price drops from $60 to $49? (and drops even more after that).

How stupid do they think we are?  


In those days, the total volume was about 122 million. So if they would have covered, that would mean that out of the total 122 million volume, 38.7 million would have been buys to cover the shorts. And yet the price went down somehow?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude there’s no way, 600% to 1000%?! That’s wawaweewa numbers"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dont trust S3s numbers. Looking back to what they said the SI% was on Feb 26th, 32%, compared to the FINRA data of 50%, it's clearly way off. Looking back at FINRAs bi-monthly reports compared to S3s numbers at that time, they are always way off. So either Finra is wrong or S3 is wrong.

That being said you basically are assuming that the only way for the price to have tanked down to $40s range is new shorts flooding the sell side. You don't even consider that many people or whales paper handed to make a quick buck? Also when the price jumped from 40$ to 150$ its was only caused by people buying...not shorts covering?

You need to factor this into your calculation. You can't make an assumption that short volume and short interest are correlated without having a control group to compare it with. Take several other stocks and do the same calculation. 

Instead of just brushing aside the legit criticism of your calculation, and it is legitimate, you can easily show that your methodology is not flawed by comparing it to other tickers. 

As someone that has a nice chunk of change in gme I don't like seeing posts that hype expectations of people only to cause FUD when it turns out to be wrong. Not saying this post is wrong but your claims that you have definitive proof of SI% being closer to 600% has very important consequences, so you better make sure that its right. I hope you do becuase I like the stock."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Bruh moment. Monke gang stronk
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dont understand the MM shorts and immediately covers rebuttal. Because lets say for example i want to buy 100 shares and the MM shorts to get me 100 shares and then immediately buys the 100 back. Then this would mean the MM contributes 50% of his volume to the short volume percent and the other 50% to the long volume percent. So if a MM is always shorting and buying back then there should never be a discrepancy between short and long volume. The only way for short volume percent to be higher than long volume percent is if there are more shorts. Why is this way of thinking wrong?? 

Lets say on a given day we have 70% 30% short and long volume respectively. Since a market maker must short and buy in equal amounts  then half of the long volume should be attributed to the MM which means that the MM in total for the day has attributed to 15% of the long volume and (.15)(.75) of the short volume. But this means (.85)(.75) is the remaining and unaccounted for short volume percent. So isnt this remaining short percent, purely new shorts??"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idk anything but it seems to me that someone is just ignoring that if all those shorts were ""millisecond shorts"" they would be matched by an equal volume of long trade.

So if every day short volume > than long volume that means that at least the difference between short and long = to the new shorts.

If basically everyday that ratio is more than 50% how the hell are they reducing shorts? Even if not increasing as much as OP says, even if 99.9% of the trades were ""millisecond shorts"" the SI would at least stay the same. I still doubt that 140 -> 20 drop.

I think SI as % of float is at least 100%"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Since early Feb I‘m wondering about those institutional shareholders to. When I first looked at them I was literally stunned. Just the top 10 institutional shareholders had about 65 million shares with nearly is the whole float. Then there all the apes holding onto GME since end of January. There were million of retail apes flooding the market. Even if it’s just 15-20million shares that the retail owns - how in the actual fuck could there been a 50-100million short position be covered. I mean if the individual amount of shares being traded is about 10-20millions which seems to be quite high if you ask me, then the shorts would have to buy the stock, return them to their MM, they selling them off to the market and then the shorts have to buy it back from the market again and repeat this process 5-10times which wouldn’t resulted in a price drop back to 40-60$. There is a big mathematical logical mistake in the whole thing since end of January. Millions of short positions got closed but the price fell and all of this under the assumption that institutional shareholders themselves hold more shares then currently outstanding."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"They are in such deep ship if the short interest is actually anywhere close to 200%, let alone if it's 600% or even 1000%

And you know what? I am pretty sure it's at least 400%.

I think there's more on the line than just a lot of money. There's some very illegal shit going on here, pretty sure.

The numbers just don't add up at all, and no matter how much they short (it's obvious from the price action that new shorts are still being opened pretty much every day), there is always more shorts available.

And the volume is really high compared to the float, even though we know many of us are holding. Of course it's possible that some shares are being traded back and forth, but even then the volume (compared to float) is really high compared to other stocks. This may point to the actual number of shares in circulation being a lot higher than it should be. In other words, counterfeit shares."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It does make sense. People sell for many different reasons some are rational some irrational. 

If someone thinks that the price is going to continue to go down they will sell. Many did just that even if they bought at 450.

The idea that it's not a loss unless you sell is incorrect. There is something called opportunity cost which is basically a person losing out on another investment that is currently increasing in value. 

Someone invested $50k at $100 a share and it dropped to $40 that would leave them $20k. If they sold the day it dropped and put it into another stock that was mooning the next day they would have recouped the losses and then reinvested it back into gme but with much more money. This is opportunity cost, missing out on a potentially mooning stock by keeping it in a losing unrealized loss position. 

I bought in gme at 70$ and averaged up to $115 before it tanked to 40$ I made a calculated guess that it will go back up faster than another investment that was available so I held and am still holding.

On the other hand I lost on AMC and I sold it when it tanked and put it into GME. That was a wise decision even though I was down in amc... gme has risen much faster than amc and by a significantly larger amount. If I didn't sell it and left it in amc I would have lost that unrealized gain that I just made.

So yes it makes sense to sell if someone thinks that the price is going to continue to go down or if they have another investment that will rise faster."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was aware that it was Morningstar but I was under the impression that they got their numbers directly from FINRA. 

You would think that they wouldn't make a mistake as significant as miscalculating the float by close to 50% but I guess it makes sense seeing that the difference is almost 50% between S3 and Morningstar every time.

So you are saying FINRA does not share or publish their reports?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"As i mentioned in my other comment, i think you are missing the point. If a MM shorts shares to complete a buy order and then immediately buys shares to close the short, this would not cause a disparity between short and long volume. 

The MM shorts and buys the same exact amount! So how can this cause the short volume to go up more than the long volume. Therefore higher percentages of short volume mean more shorting is occuring outside the shorting the MM does to complete buy orders. 

Im not saying that if the short volume is 300mil then 300mil is the short interest. But if total short volume percent is higher than total long volume percent then there must be more shorts occurring than buys."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you are missing the point, if a costumer buys and a MM shorts to complete the customers buy but then immediately closes his short then the MM’s activity is equal between shorting and buying. So this should not create a disparity between total short volume and total long volume. 

So the higher percent of short volume to long volume cant be caused by MM completing buy orders because during a buy order they equally short and buy."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it’s crazy. I’ve commented elsewhere it’s super problematic because it looks like an “official” FINRA website but it’s literally just pulling data from Morningstar, not Vice versa. (Also note the holdings data is wrong. There must be something fcked up with the feed because it’s pulling holdings data from multiple dates for the same firm. Hence all the “institutional ownership is 220%!! posts are wrong. Fido and Blackrock are each listed 2-3x) 

FINRA doesn’t share or officially publish their reports. The reason is that NYSE are greedy mofos and charge an exorbitant amount for their data and they don’t want it displayed for free. 

Hence- short volume data is only for TRFs, not NYSE or NASDAQ exchanges (both available for a fee)
Short interest bimonthly reports are only available for a fee for NYSE, free for Nasdaq (you can look up short interest for Nasdaq listed stocks on their website)
A bunch of providers get the short interest reports from NYSE and use those in their calculations (ie Morningstar) but they also need to have an accurate float :)

I think it’s wild there’s no good repository of data for retail investors but this is where it stands now. Keeping track of things like float and shares out isn’t easy, Bloomberg pays thousands of people and creates all sorts of high end AI to read through company reports just for this purpose."

It came from him attempting to justify reported data and he just can’t match anything up. So then led to this. 

I think It could be 200/300% if the free float is as limited as it seems and not at the 50m or so quoted, but more in the 24~30m. 

Given January 140% and feb 8th was 132%... I think SI is around that level still.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"First, as noted above, the data in the Short Sale Files includes only trades that are publicly disseminated and excludes trades that are not publicly disseminated. As a result, some offsetting buying activity related to reported short selling would not be reflected in the Daily File and may result in the appearance of a higher concentration of short sale to total volume.

A common example is where a firm is facilitating a customer order to sell long. The firm may elect to first sell an equivalent number of shares from its own trading account to another firm and then purchase the shares from the customer at the same price to fill the outstanding long sale order. Trading in this manner reduces risk for the firm by enabling it to manage its inventory and lock in a price for the customer execution. Although this trading model involves two separate trades—one between the two firms and one between the firm and its customer—the two offsetting trades are executed at the same price to fill a single customer order. Thus, FINRA rules provide for the public dissemination of only one of the trades (the trade between the two firms) so as not to overstate the reported volume.5 If the firm facilitating the customer long sale order has either no position or a short position in the security in its trading account, the trade with the other firm is reported as short and included in the short sale volume calculations in the Daily File. The volume associated with the firm’s purchase from its customer, however, is not reflected in the Daily File. Thus, the firm’s short sale is included in the short sale volume calculations without any indication that it is associated with an offsetting purchase to facilitate a customer long sale.

Second, as noted above, the data is published separately by FINRA for each FINRA trade reporting facility and by each exchange, and is not consolidated. Thus, to obtain a complete picture of short sale volume to total volume in a particular listed stock, market participants must combine data published by FINRA for each of its trade reporting facilities, as well as data published by the exchanges.6"

Suppose I buy 100 shares. A MM shorts 100 shares amd delivers to me. Then the MM himself buys 100 shares to close the short. So in total the MM added 100 to the short volume for the day and 100 to the buy volume for the day. 

Tell me how this increases short volume percent more than long volume percent."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Then we know exactly nothing at all.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"What is the proof they lied? Every data source I've seen (FINRA, S3, some other data firm that also estimates short interest) shows it down dramatically."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re not looking for facts or information you’re looking for confirmation bias. You’re in luck, its widely available in this sub. Enjoy."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Well this is WSB.  But yeah shorts covered that week.  Prove me wrong.  The gamma squeeze and short squeeze happened together.  If a 6000% increase year to date isn’t a short squeeze then Idk what is.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah my point isn’t “sell GME” it’s ... you literally cannot use short volume data to calculate or infer short interest. That’s it haha. 

People get very offended by this and want to show me some nonsense math but... no. It’s simply not how it works."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here I will quote it for you so you don't have to read the whole thing.

>A common example is where a firm is facilitating a customer order to sell long. The firm may elect to first sell an equivalent number of shares from its own trading account to another firm and then purchase the shares from the customer at the same price to fill the outstanding long sale order. Trading in this manner reduces risk for the firm by enabling it to manage its inventory and lock in a price for the customer execution. Although this trading model involves two separate trades—one between the two firms and one between the firm and its customer—the two offsetting trades are executed at the same price to fill a single customer order. Thus, FINRA rules provide for the public dissemination of only one of the trades (the trade between the two firms) so as not to overstate the reported volume.5 If the firm facilitating the customer long sale order has either no position or a short position in the security in its trading account, the trade with the other firm is reported as short and included in the short sale volume calculations in the Daily File. The volume associated with the firm’s purchase from its customer, however, is not reflected in the Daily File. Thus, the firm’s short sale is included in the short sale volume calculations without any indication that it is associated with an offsetting purchase to facilitate a customer long sale.

TLDR: only the short volume is reported, not the long"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Precisely.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The day before Robinhood shut down buying,  financial media channels were pushing a clearly coordinated narrative that Melvin Capital had closed their short positions to discourage people from buying. Which as we all know by this point, is not true. Whether or not that extends to reporting in other data sources is to be seen, but it shows a clear willingness to lie and mislead. I’ve seen compelling DD in both directions that those numbers are accurate and other analysis that suggests they aren’t. At this point I don’t think anyone but the hedges truly knows what the real SI number is."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not saying you're wrong or right - you clearly know more than I do. But man your entire comment history is just negativity / opposition towards gme and amc and literally nothing else. That must be exhausting, even if it is just you honestly correcting everyone."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah, it’s just that your counter argument really really sucks. In fact, I’m not convinced you’ve done any research at all. You’ve provided no clear figures or citations that would allow anyone to prove or disprove your thesis, which makes it pure trash and completely speculative. 
What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it happened in a day 6000% gain, then yes. 

Why every short squeeze up to date was parabolic price jump in a single day?
Again, why it did stop at 480$ when official numbers for SI was 140%?

You have claims from multiple people that price going up was driven by retails buying, not shorts covering."

I get negative when I present simple facts that are provably true and people who don’t know what they’re talking about push back instead of saying “oh can you explain that?” 

Lots of pretend tough guys here

Also I comment a lot on GME and AMC purely because it’s what 90% of the conversations are about and they are by far and away the conversations with the most provably wrong assertions.

I suggest doing more research!  The price stopped at 480 because Robinhood shut off buying, duh!  The price rose to that level because of a short squeeze + the gamma squeeze by retail CAUSED the short squeeze.

The current price is due to retail, but what happened in January was because of a gamma squeeze that Led to the short squeeze.  Can there be another squeeze?  Yea.  Was there a squeeze already?  Yes...  was it ...’the mother of all squeezes’?.  Apparently not.  But there was already a massive short squeeze.  Denying that proves you don’t know anything"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's fair, I shouldn't have used negativity - your facts typically go against the sentiment of the sub (again, with high confirmation bias that isn't necessarily a bad thing). It's important to hear your take on this stuff as well."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The entire premise of this post is that the hedges are lying to FINRA, not that FINRA itself is lying. That claim would be ridiculous. 

The entire claim of this DD is that the FINRA numbers are mathematically impossible to be correct, and that’s backed up with a lot of solid research and analysis by the OP. that’s the thesis that’s being argued here. I’m not sure how a screenshot from Bloomberg is supposed to be evidence against that claim, seeing as the entire point of this post is essentially to disprove or provide a counter argument to the idea those figures are accurate?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Please show me where was my claim that any SS had 6k gain?

Your argument was that YoY gain of 6k was proof for short squeeze.

Are you going to use Cramer as a proof for your statment? C'mon man.

I have seen that you got paid by GME, and I'm happy for you. But claiming that 100% gain in a single day was short squeeze is beyond dumb."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Good news hedge funds don’t report their shorts to FINRA. Brokerages report to the exchange which reports to FINRA.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You just don’t seem to understand that it was impossible for shorts NOT to cover that week.  They literally got margin called.  We know Melvin capital lost 30% BECAUSE they had to cover.

I’m not arguing against the validity of what’s happening I’m just saying a short squeeze did happen..  shorts have covered.  Not all but the biggest players have covered for sure they arent that dumb."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I never said about shorts not covering. I am talking about short squeeze.

Shorts can cover without squeeze."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Short covering causes short squeezes mate.  GameStop has been having small short squeezes all of 2020.  And what happened in January is called a short squeeze.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"During the hearings, even the hedge funds admitted on record that what happened wasnt a short but a gamma squeeze.
Why would they lie about it when it s obviously good for them to say ""ok nothing more to see here, short squeeze happened, we covered, now get over it"" ?

Somebody bought a massive amount of puts at the 250 strike. That is why MM would need to rapidly offload shares they were holding as a hedge. Puts are negative delta.

A hedge fund with even 1% the capital of retail is going to be significantly more powerful, because they can direct their money in a coordinated manner. You simply will never get WSB or retail at large to do anything cohesively beyond a general sentiment of ""we like stock X"" or ""we do not like stock Y"". And even if you get those agreements in sentiment, you're going to have a million different ways in which us retail morons choose to play it.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"MM's want to be delta neutral at all times. The closer they are to neutral, the more money they make. 

When you sell a call, you need to hedge the downside risk (call ends up ITM) with an asset that will perfectly track the fluctuations in price of the underlying. In this case, why not just use the underlying? So they do. If delta is 0.1, for every $1 the stock moves, the option moves $0.10. so to get that same effect, you could buy 10 shares. 

When you sell a put, it is exactly the same in reverse. Your downside risk is that the price plummets and the put goes ITM. So how do you profit off an asset price falling? You either sell your existing shares, or you short sell new ones. Delta on the put is -0.1, then for every $1 the stock drops, the price of the put increases by $0.10. so the MM's need to make money on the price falling. To get the same effect, they can short sell 10 shares. 

From a MM perspective though, why would you buy shares that you are short? And why would you short sell shares that are sitting in your account? So they don't. They only hedge the difference between the open interest in the calls and puts. So if there were 10 calls open with 0.1 delta, and 9 puts open with -0.1 delta, they are going to buy only 10 shares and then they are delta neutral.

Edit: gamma ramping only exists when there is a massive difference in open interest between calls and puts. If every time a call gets opened, someone else opens a put, the MM is neutral and won't need to buy shares which would lead to a gamma squeeze."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"MM's make money by remaining neutral on the option positions they sell. In order to do so they remain delta hedge. When people (hedge funds, big pockets, or maybe just wealthy individuals betting against the crowd) buy puts from the market makers they now need to sell shares because puts are negative delta)

When people buy calls or sell puts MM's on the other side buy shares.

When people buy puts or sell calls MM's on the other side sell shares.

They also have special rules to MM. Naked short selling and synthetic longs are legal for MM's as long as they are taking the position to remain neutral on the underlying security."

But now that Germany, Russia, and the Allies have started slinging shit, pretty much all we can do at this point is hide in the basement and hope that when the shooting stops, it's the good guys who now occupy our quaint little village."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Agree on that
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So what you're saying is.. We need a leader. Or better yet, a symbol, because as a symbol we're incorruptible"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. And a quick google seems to suggest it’s happened like once.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Like, I like GME and I believe in it...but let’s be realistic here"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s literally the gamma squeeze.  It’s when large quantities of options force MMs to buy / sell outsized amounts of shares, creating a feedback loop that extends the run in either direction. 

The big misconception is people thinking a specific price point triggers said squeeze.  It doesn’t, because as you note the MM is real time delta hedging at all price points."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You just described a gamma squeeze lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So what do the MMs that sold the options do when GME goes to 400 and all the strikes go ITM?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks a lot!

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"These dumb fucks can't see what we see: gaming is the biggest industry. Gamestop is the only dedicated international retailer in this industry, it already has supply lines and no doubt contracts to secure minimum stock levels of games and hardware, instantly making it competitive against other online retailers as they pivot.

Decades of serving customers the physical necessities of gaming, will have built good relationships with publishers and manufacturers.

Even if the pivot fails I think the big boy accelerationist capitalists under estimate the demand for a retail experience. They want the maximally optimised cyberpunk future now, but real people don't value that. B&M retail is not for everybody all the time, but it's part of the fabric of what we expect from living in developed places."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Now look up how often a black swan event has occurred. Cuz while this might not tick all the criteria anymore we're still in uncharted territory. No pun.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,True but also account for the fact everyone splits their stock. A lot of companies would be 10k a share but they do splits.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dont know man this is life,  crazier things have happened before.  There's always a once in a life time story that will go down over and over in history. Im not saying this is it. Im not saying it will reach 10k a share but what im saying is... if there's a probability it can't or won't happen there's also a equal probability that it can and will happen. My bet is it will hit 10k and maybe this will be history maybe this will go down as a once in a life time thing who knows? But im in and I believe in it."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That attitude is what creates wealth in this one off situation. You should be watching the market very closely as gme tops out and be looking for a discount in the market. Turn your profits into something bigger. 💎👊
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. That was the one I mentioned.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I only made five millimeters
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I bet I could turn that 14m into 125k in half that time!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"For the inevitable reports. This counts as a yolo due to OP posting active positions that obviously meet the equity requirements. OPs claim of gains was backed up by the graph. If this was a gains post OP would need to post positions for all those gains, but this is a YOLO post."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The best way to get to $14 million in the stock market is to start with $20 million.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You should try buying calls
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"From the graph, it is hard to tell.  Did the March 2020 COVID19 stock market dump affect you much?  Looks like it did, but very little.

April and may 2020, I know the market started roaring back up.



Can you tell us more larger plays you made that got you to the $14mil?

Very impressive!

If I were you, I would just invest in all dividend stocks and live off of it.  5% of $14 mill is $700k per year.  That is way more than enough for me to spend per year.

Thanks"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you an insider? how come you yolo 125k into SPR?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you just send me message everyone move your making.  I’ll do what your doing.  Nice work.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's too bad that a guy that made 14mil on options is going to get less upvotes than some hard F that bought 3 shares of AMC or GME. 

Congratulations homie. This shit is impressive af!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats..... and FUCK you
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"congrats and welcome to r/rich, now that you've arrived, how disappointed are you?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,My guy really put 8 figures in sprouts farmers market 😳
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You know 14 million is a lot of money. But 1 of those millions YOLO’d into GME would probably be a fuck ton more!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow, that might be the single highest gain porn I've seen on this sub*.

*Edit ""that isn't DFV."""
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yolo it all on GME 3/19 $800 calls 😂

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"wow. congrats. 

would love to see 

\- how you got 125k to throw at this in the first place

\- your trade history

I do not doubt this to be legit.  
I have my doubts to be repeatable consistently with the exact same strategy. 

you need more than just balls to pull this off. 

again, congrats"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Congrats and fuck you! 

Is this enough for you to be satisfied, of will you stay at the casino?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That's insane!! Keep it going!! Congrats!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Congratulations, and fuck you!

A few questions:

1) Is this a tax advantaged account, or are you fuk?

2) What are your plans now that you can retire?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow! Congratulations! So happy for you
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can't imagine how stressful watching those tickers would be, congratulations"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats and fuck you! Oof your starting investment is something I can only dream of at this point.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Shoot I had those positions and closed them out in Dec. I sad.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This entire time you only invested in SPR and AER since you had $125k?

Has anyone who has more got millions in stocks tried getting their money?
Like has anyone been able to cash out? 

Genuinely interested!"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What did you invest in?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s funny. I do better yoloing than diversifying for swing short term. I tried to diversify in February and I lost money. I saw the rocket play and the second GME play and only went in with a small amount instead of yoloing cost me almost a mil.

I think diversifying isn’t for me"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The 1 real question I have, is what made you keep going? Why didnt you just pull out when you hit like 4 or 5 million and be comfortable for life? And wheres the invite to the 🦍 party?"

About 50k was from the sale of a home that had appreciated.

The reality is that the 737 is Boeing’s biggest cash cow. They were always going to figure it out. Talking with all my families airline pilot friends who had flown it or were in training when it got grounded they were like “they’ll figure out a fix, it’s everyone needs this plane to survive”.

From any rational perspective it was an idiotic time to buy calls buuuut stupid doesn’t mean insider. There wasn’t some huge news months later. It took over a year just to get wind that the FAA was likely to approve and approval took even more months."

Even if you're just moderately playing the market, the more money you have typically the more money you'll make. 

With my smooth brained mind, I tripled my initial investment in one year. 

Most of that was with TSLA, but I only bought into the company because I liked the stock and what the company was trying to do. This was way before I was on WSB or got on the hype for TSLA. 

If I had more money I would have probably spread it out about to where I have it now. 

So yea, if I had like 25K to throw away like this guy did, doing the exact shares I did with what I have now, I'd have 75K lol."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess both could be technically correct.. like one year ago today he had $125k.. But started 2 years ago at $45k ?  Idk.. OPs story seems inconsistent lol.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Reasonably. They could have invested the time combing comments to see how OP pulled it off and what they did that could be duplicated...only to find a load of BS

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The same could be said about a person trading with $10 compared to a person with $1000.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's the same at 125k, that's why what he did was amazing, one big mistake and he doesn't get there.  Plenty of people have lost $125k on GME this year."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I totally get that. I commented that for every one of this guy there are 140 who lost 100k. He hit the roulette wheel a couple times with big bets. Just saying that’s how you’d do it.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Not a problem when there is $14 million in the account.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,He just wants to self direct the funds instead of being forced into 40 shares BOOMERTARGETF2099F @ 400/share with a yearly growth of .05% and start fees starting at 3% of total balance.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I got dibbs on the 🍑
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's correct. They make 80% of the 737 max. So I was flipping a coin on the 737 max demand picking up relatively quickly. I also believed it had at least bottomed out, as it's been above 80 within the last 18 months.

Spr used to be part of Boeing, but they spun them off as a separate company."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,True!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but you only have to be right *enough*"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Well... someone is winning...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes it would.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is entirely believable to start small two years ago and make a fortune in the interim. There have been multiple stock that turned into ten baggers and when you catch them at the right time and you ride them up you will get there.

Once you’ve reached critical mass the value increases become fantastic amounts of money.

In fact I would be in exactly this position if I wasn’t such a nervous wreck. I had at least 9 stock that went ballistic and I managed to drag defeat out of the jaws of success. It’s a lot of money but it’s entirely believable."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It's not 50/50 if you do some research and make the play planning for the future. Oh fuck nvm this is wsb my bad.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can’t argue there
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,No shit dr genius
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Only if they sold. Most averaged down. Most are up (except ol paperhands portnoy).
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,If you throw around 125k in a year to 14 million you either A. Have a rich family where you throw away money all the time. Or B. You have so much money that you lose 125k and it doesn't matter.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So you are privy to his trades then? 
 How do you know how or what he traded to make those claims?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Blinded by the diamond hands! Well played.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, that's a pretty solid reason / bet. Far too logical for this sub."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So how much did you buy in options?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You flipped a coin with $125k?  

Step 1.  Be wealthy."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hell of a good coin toss and some sound judgment.

Be ready for the capital gains tax bite though.. not that you'd be in a bad position after anyway.

Enjoy the win, my man."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucking legend
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay, so please post your plays to take the 14m to 50 mil, so I can jump in lol"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So you did a bunch of fancy research and think you’re some kind of genius? Congrats and fuck you so much
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s better to be lucky than smart.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What was your experience with options before you took the plunge?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fascinating!

If I may be enlightened, what was your thought process in selecting SPR with your YOLO 125k play? Out of all the possible tickers and market developments, why this?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,They also make the pods for Virgin Hyperloop (and Aecom/ACM helps build the tracks)
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it had gone the other way, would you have been out just the $125k or could it have turned out worse?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you going to post your portfolio going forward so we can also make tendies for once and stop losing money?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How’d you pick the stock?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Interesting - so were you essentially just rolling your wins into the same SPR and AER stock and calls since March?

Also, will you buy me a house? I promise I'm a good person who deserves it!!!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"How did you know about SPR in the first place, before you did your due diligence and bought the calls?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you even find these stocks? Thats my all time big question. Where do you/people find these stocks?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I still think you're right on this.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can't argue with the results!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lord knows I would
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,::facepalm:: good point.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I'm not discounting DFV, but it's almost like he's in his own category of Autist. OP is damn impressive in his own right and also impressive by non-GME standards."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The only acceptable date.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, then, good thing the “extreme left” is nowhere near in power for OP"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It's like golf. Lowest score wins.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"125 call options on a solar company before that huge retrace.  I was talking to my buddy and I said ‘I should have just bought the lotus evora I wanted, at least I’d still have the car’."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Now way, That was too good of a return rate for a strip club investment"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Facts
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,No.  GME doesn’t have fundamentals
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, I watched 10k turn into 3k after the first GME squeeze, and that was pretty painful. I can’t imagine how I’d fee if I was working with 6 figures."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha hard to say unless I’ve experienced it. Ya got 7 million I can borrow?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn. I wished I had the balls to YOLO everything as COVID hit. But the fear that almost no companies would turn a profit and the market could reflect the actual economic collapse people were about to endure was real.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"? So you agree then, lol"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's me! I'm a blatant retard.

Bought  1@288, sold 50 or 45 or something. Probably the most retarded thing I've done, I had even told myself it's the stupidest thing to sell. I did it anyway.

At least I've learned that doing things you think is totally retarded is probably retarded, so you shouldn't do it."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe he started making coffee at home and passed on the avacado toast
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The coffee thing is no joke. A latte costs like $5. Six if you tip. If youre a fiend like me, you get two a day. That totals about $84 a week, $336 a month, $4032 a year. This is literally enough to start yoloing and get you to a milly if you're lucky as fuck, or invest boomer style and pay off the mortgage in a million years. I stopped buying lattes and got a nice manual espresso press and ordering fancy coffee from the internet. I drink better coffee than i was paying more for and already paid off the initial expense of the machine. I should make this a post on r/investing, they would cream their jeans over it."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or you're just a degenerate.  That is definitely a possibility, especially in this sub."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Cause generalizations are always correct.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,tfw you have a rich family but they won't give you their money
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro, he posted his trades. They were SPR calls."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,As an updog I approve this!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Love stinks
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"He put $125k on a plane recoverinog that was legally required grounding by the FAA AND had two planes crash within a year time because of poor design and trainning

Imho he got bailed out by COVID because the low passenger rate put the final nail in the coffin to the biggest planes and made the 737max more attractive comparatively. 

Also it gave Boeing more time to get their shit figured out and legal again, and the Airline stimulus helped make up for all the losses of grounded 737 maxes which again were down BEFORE COVID

I'd say when the majority of ALL of the entire fleets are grounded (no matter what kind of plane), the Airline companies are going to be more forgiving then if only one specific type of plane was grounded for years

This wasn't too logical for the sub. This dude belongs here. Remember he wasn't JUST betting the 737max recovered, he bought calls, he put a damn timeline on this shit. This was a real fucking gamble with $125k"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Like a true retard he bought 17 mm
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,lambos or food stamps it is
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How much would the taxes be? Is it 50%?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Options don’t go negative. They could have expired worthless, meaning 0."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,They arent.  They didn't get the minimum wage increase.  The moderate left is keeping them in check.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's the car I would get if I ever made some serious money. It's price is inflated, but not stupidly so like many other supercars."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I spent a long time trying to get a good deal on my car only to lose two of my cars buying tech call options ATM 2 months out. Kept buying dips. Shit hurts 🥲
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't the call have expired worthless not cost you that much? Or you paid that much for many contracts?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,But you'd still be paying monthly for it. Silver lining I guess?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You paid 1k a piece for call options?

and yes: GME

for the evolution of their stock price. I’m not saying these are ‘proper’ valuations, the market was ‘right’, it makes sense or it is sane, I’m saying these companies, among many others, have seen their stock price go up considerably in the last two years which means that, when you joined them at the right time it was possible to make a very great deal of money.

The multiplier effect of a double up is ferociously effective. Start with $1000 bucks, 10 double ups (I’m not remotely suggesting this would be easy) and you’re over $ 1 million. There is power in those numbers. Scrape together $1000 (and I’m aware that a lot of people don’t get that opportunity), make the right decisions (again, not self-evident), a million bucks makes a difference in someone’s life.

I’m wondering how many people who get that $1400 check will see it for the opportunity it is and make the right choices."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You gotta make a lot more yolos and get them all right if you are starting with $10
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes? What's your point?

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not really a gamble. Boeing wasn’t going to flush the max, and the order book was still stacked deep."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Well put.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are you saying you think the 737 Max wasn't going to recover without COVID? That would be a real dumb assumption lol.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I generalized slightly about my portfolio.  I wasn’t just in that.  But the 125 csiq calls were more than $60k.  Those expired worthless. The rest was ‘spent’ chasing a MARA and SOS rip.  A few serepta calls and some ark genomics
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,No.  Would have bought it in cash.  Late model 400’s w 10k miles are $70k all day
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Now.  It’s somewhere in here.  125 options were a little more than $60k.   I bought $60 ITM when the share price was btw $63 and $64

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm curious why you bought ITM calls instead of just buying the shares outright? I feel like that approach just increased your risk without increasing the possible reward.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Excellent work ape. State legalization will snowball as more states begin to pull in tax revenue from it. Your state doesn't want to be sitting on the sideline of easy tax money while everyone else is raking it in. Its also justified from a moral standpoint when everyone else is doing it and it will get bipartisan support imo. I'm bullish as can be about this whole year for them and long term. Lots of potential new deals, company growth options and state legalization catalysts. Going to try to pull together a DD post pretty soon here prior to Q1 report if I can find the time 🍻"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I could be wrong here but I feel as if casinos and online sports books attract two different demographics. While there will be overlap in some of the customers and sports books could take away from, most people who go to casinos usually go for the experience and having a good time versus sports books who attract those who’s sole purpose is to just gamble."

Could very well be.  However it could be looked the other way as well where giving up some overlap is unacceptable. The other side of it is that online gambling is another revenue stream so one could make the argument to fight for the additional revenues"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice work. I’ll add something that I posted in r/options a few weeks ago:

Options newbies!! Please learn the MECHANICS of options before you start trading!

I see a lot of new options traders here with questions about what happens at expiry, etc. You’ve done some homework, figured out long calls = bullish, long puts = bearish and think you’re ready to play. 

Before you start yolo’ing please learn about expiration, exercising, etc. Not every brokerage has the same process for dealing with ITM options at expiry. Do NOT wait until 2 PM on Friday of expiry to sell/ exercise. Do NOT assume your brokerage will automatically sell for you or auto exercise- go to their website or call and ask. Understand if you exercise you need to have cash in your account to take delivery. It’s pretty rare that exercising is the best course of action. Frankly most options buyers should just take exercising out of their vocabulary. (And no, exercising calls doesn’t cause a short squeeze) 

Understand assignment in short options. You likely won’t be notified until Sat or Monday of assignment. Understand pin risk. Understand that options buyers have until 5:30 on Friday to notify their broker of their intention to exercise so if you sell an option that is OTM on Friday at 4 PM and the stock makes a huge move AH you can get absolutely screwed. 

Bottom line - save yourself a headache and **close out your trades before 3 PM on Friday** it might be 2 PM for RH.

Related to mechanics- understand implied volatility and vol crush. It’s possible to buy a put on a high flying stock and LOSE money if the stock corrects -20% or vice versa. https://moontowermeta.com/how-options-confuse-directional-traders/

I’ve seen a few posts from people thinking they got “robbed” because they didn’t sell or exercise ITM call options- don’t let it be you!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Read it once.

Need to read many more times.

Then do DD to make sure I understand it.

Then maybe try a couple of fake transactions to verify I understand it.

Finally YOLO and lose everything.

Rinse and repeat."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate this as I’m still learning thank you for the write up! 

1. So I would never have the cash to buy the shares and would “sell” the contract - would someone always be available to buy it or is it just a “return back to the wild” and give me a profit? Or do you have to wait for someone to buy the contract even if it’s profitable? Hope that makes sense. 

2. Can you do an option if you don’t have the hypothetical money to buy the shares? 

3. So In a call option the worst case scenario is you lose your premium? You don’t have to pay extra money back right?"

When you sell back an option, you also collect the remaining time value on the long contract. When you exercise, you forfeit the time value."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Too bad these idiots think selling at any point is dumb and they will hold options til they expire
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Question... 

Im new to options, but so far Im having some serious beginners luck.

I bought a VaicomCBS $90 3/19 for $126.00 on 3/8 when the stock price was $77.00

Over the next few days leading up to yesterday, I watched it jump from negative numbers all the way to $500. This was with it nowhere near the strike price. 

Ive had some serious issues with exit strategies and when to be happy and take a profit. I had a conversation with myself Thursday that if it got back to $600, Id take it and be happy. And Friday morning, I did. I sold it for $900 at about 10 a.m... right as it neared the strike price and with a WEEK of time value left! Sold it, was happy and then checked ViacomCBS to see it had passed the strike price.

It ended the AH session at $95.40... $5.40 above my strike price. My knuckles drag and show my shame. Dumb ass ape.

I wonder how much I let go with that decision. Sold it on the way up. Nice.

So, my question is, did I do the right thing? I took a GOOD profit for my investment and I sold the contract for $900. Did it sell because I left room for others to take profit? Is that a good practice? Sell on the way up for a “sure sell”? Or hold till the last bit has been juiced and attempt to sell the contract?

In any case, Ive learned one helluva lesson. This is a numbers game, not a money game. When you let yer wallet make the decisions, yer gonna lose. I lost focus and panic sold. Premature ejak at its finest.

Neat.

EDIT: The real question was why was it worth so much when it wasnt even ITM? Is that an affect of mostly theta and vega?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This was an amazing explanation. I’ve lurked here awhile but have messed around w just buying/selling stocks for 10 years (don’t have lots of money). I want to learn more and make more and this seems like a logical next step for me.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Pro tip: Try buying options on a site that allows you to trade fake money so you can see how it works before you blow 90k and get a divorce.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m hitting levels of retard that have never been hit before.

So you’re telling me that the guy who lost $90k on FD GME lost it all in fees per share? As in he paid like $5 per share and had 18,000 shares waiting in contracts?

Or how else did physically lose 90k? I thought he wouldn’t have been obligated to buy the actual shares."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I must be a special kind of idiot because that scroll bar lookin scary ain’t got no time fo dat.

TLDR: Buy call if think go 📈buy put if think go 📉. If you are safe space baby don’t want risk buy covered call. Don’t fuck with any other options if you’re beginner. 

Edit: Yo why are the charts red up blue down though."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you so much! I been trying to fill in the blanks myself lol I understand how everyone loses money now!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I need “safe word” explained in this much detail so my wife’s boyfriend can understand it better.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think of options as gift cards for stocks that you pay a fee to buy, and can become valuable in and of themselves so you don’t actually have to redeem them at the cash register and instead sell them for a profit."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3zh49/gme\_dd\_friday\_opex\_312\_post\_mortem\_warning\_gamma/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3zh49/gme_dd_friday_opex_312_post_mortem_warning_gamma/)

Just want to say that no, options is not easy money. Don't YOLO your life savings on deep OTM (out of the money) call options that expires in a week's time, you're almost certainly guaranteed to lose all of it.

Remember options have a **time component** (expiration) to it, as opposed to simply buying and holding the stock (no ticking timer to force you to do things)

Take care playing with options, don't be like that guy a few days ago losing $100K buying 0-day to expiry options..."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Good stuff here! Thank you OP
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you; this is great! Can you elaborate on the timeframe when you exercise your contract you said “this can take some time”. Hours, days weeks? Do they take your cash right away but shares take time to get into your account?"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"OK, cool. Thank you, that explains a lot. I'm sitting on some liquidity and would like to experiment with a small number of shares... 1, 5, or 10 maybe.

Now: to actually place an order, what is Buy to Open/Buy to Close/Sell To Open/Sell to Close? 

What is ""Leg option"" with Bid and Ask? Looking at GME Strike of $290, with a $40 Ask, this sounds like instead of the $2 example you gave, I'd need to get over $330 to be ITM.

To do a Price Limit on this, am I entering a limit on the $40? So I should put in like $42 in case something insane happens right after I submit the order?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here is a helpful link for buying options:
optionsprofitcalculator.com

You can enter see how much you can gain based on the expiration date for calls and puts. I find it very helpful"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Very informative! I have some follow up questions: 

if I buy a call and am ITM, but don’t have the funds to exercise, what’s the process to sell the contract to somebody that does? How is the price they’ll pay for my Call determined, and is the process comparatively simple to exercising, (hitting the button) like mentioned above?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is incredibly helpful! 

I have a question for you or anyone that can help. What happens if my contract is so deep ITM that no one is willing to buy it when I try to sell and I do not have enough money to exercise?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love this because it is so obviously written by a teacher. It brings me back to high school and really makes me wish these are things that we were taught. I already knew that things, but I read it anyway and I appreciate your time! So, thank you!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is wonderful. Can you do puts next? Then naked calls/puts?

Seriously appreciate the comprehensive way you broke this down. I literally bought trading options for dummies and it was 100x harder to comprehend. (Might even wanna contact them about rewriting that book!)"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Too much reading for me to understand it, but a call just means talking to someone on the phone i guess?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you sell the option, how do you calculate profits? I’m assuming you obviously don’t sell it for what you paid because there’s no money in that, but what is the sale price? Do you name your price? That’s the only part I don’t understand."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"this was the best explanation ive seen. finally i sort of understand it

only thing im not sure on is how selling the contract works
in this example of 1 $5 GME $400c 3/19:

would someone buy the contract from you for $40000?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've read the explanation for call options across various sites, and even on youtube videos.. and while I understood the concept, none of them explained it as well as this post does, which really solidifies my understanding. This was super well done."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can't read, but I had my wife's boyfriend read it to me and now I know to buy more GME. Thanks OP."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So are the premiums higher the closer your strike price is to the current price?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wish this could be pushed out everywhere. I've seen a lot of straight up LIES from the MSM, but also a lot of (what I used to consider) reputable stock sites, saying call options are exactly like shorts. They are saying the big bets that don't pan out can have a short squeeze into the ground. They left out SO much information, 100% intentionally, even i got scared a bit. But, it took less than 5 minutes of Google research to see their full of shill shit and we're actually winning, and the 50k, 100k ""jokes"" on here aren't actually jokes, and not all that overly optimistic. We can actually reach those fucking numbers."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you very much for doing this OP

It is very dangerous investing money or worse LIFE SAVINGS into something you have NO or very LITTLE knowledge of.

Even with extensive knowledge and experience you still don’t invest life savings."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I understand options enough to know I don’t want to fuck around with it.

Not yet."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"And for those who don't know, make sure to buy your calls ""to open"" (you're opening, or starting, a position in that option) and sell your calls ""to close"" (you're closing out your position in the contract). Don't mess with the other two."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess I’m still retarded. So if I put in a call for next Thursday at 400 for 100 shares I don’t actually have to buy it? It’s just a hypothetical thing? And then after it goes higher than 400 I can sell it to someone that actually has money for a profit and I can cash out? But if it doesn’t I can just say eh Nevermind and walk away from it and I have no repercussions?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I normally don't read stuff like this that are long but I gotta say, I'm impressed. I now know a little more of what certain words mean. Though I'm still gonna stick to my cash account and only buy with what I own."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a fellow teacher, nice work. Even did some modeling before the “we do” activity. Your admin would be proud. 

One question- how fast can this be cashed in on? 

Say I’m ITM, bc the stock hit $410, but it’s really volatile that day. 

How quickly can I exercise my right to buy and then turn around and have the shares sold?

Thank you for clarifying all of this- I didn’t know you could exercise at any time. I thought it was only on that one date."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok now do selling calls.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great read, thanks for posting.

What I need help understanding is how is margin calculated by the broker when dealing with options?  I'm not sure it is calculable at all without a computer algorithm.  It gets eaten up so fast when I buy/sell options."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Great explanation! Question: Do you have to sell your contract before the expiration date? I’m assuming so bc doesn’t the contract have to be executed before the expiration date otherwise it’s worthless? So nobody would buy an expired contract right?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So buy GME 800c for March and April, got it."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Commenting so I can go back and find this if I ever need to.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Options explained- nice write up. Also it’s on Reddit with 9 mill subscribers. Even if 100k  of them get into trading options as it’s becoming popular, it will sky rocket stocks.  Contacts will be priced out so high with everyone buying long leaps it may pull stocks up. - kinda of the tail wagging the dog.  Until the dog shakes and it comes down crashing 

I think options will be the cause of the next crash. But till then go buy calls"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I understand Call Options now, but they seem like a very expensive lottery ticket."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I miss the old days where you had to spend a year on this sub before you understood anything about the stock market or what anything meant
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Terrific. Now how about a primer like this on Puts.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So in your example, let's say that the value of GME is at $420 but I don't have $42000 to exercise the option. I can sell the contact, but what can I get for it?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Perfect timing, I've been looking for some call info now that GME is getting expensive to keep buying.  This is fully hypothetical and not a prediction whatsoever.  But if I bought an 800c for 3/19, if the amount I could make on the premium goes to $80,000 am I able to buy the shares with that money?  As you can roll a position to one longer out I was wondering if that same idea could be applied to exercising.  

I can see both making sense.  Rolling a call to a later date is keeping money in the casino which they are fine with you doing because eventually you'll lose according to their statistics.  Buying the stock is similar to buying something completely different so it's taking money off the table.  But the money you've made is tangible so being able to spend it immediately also makes sense.  

I want shares but if I can scale up to 100 more shares gambling at the cost of 1-2 that's a gamble I'm very willing to take.  I just won't be able to come up with $80k without winning that gamble before hand.  I also feel that for me to make $80k on the call the price will have to be much higher than $800 so if I sold the contract and then bought stocks I'd get much less.  

Any answers would be great.  I've been thinking about this for a few days now and I'm not sure how to find the answer.  Google and youtube haven't really given me what I'm looking for in previous attempts."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"When buying the option, remember to pick limit price, or you can get totally over your head paying market price for the option you are looking at."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ape have dumb questions.  So I don’t have to buy the 100 shares I can just let the contract expire if I’m OTM?  I buy the contract upfront and I am guaranteed then at least losing that?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How would you go about selling the call if you couldn’t afford exercising it
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for this and helping us retards on a slower path to financial ruin.

I had some follow up questions if someone could help me out. Let's say you have a SPY $375c 4/16. There are somethings that still confuse me it says Current Price is $21.55,  Bid is $21.44x38 and Ask is $21.66x38 what are these three things?

So my options are to sell the contract and make around $900 currently, but what happens if I let it go till 4/16 and don't do anything, it will automatically expire and I'll lose the money I paid for the contract?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for being an educator! I got halfway through this and I'm coming back to test myself and make sure it sticks. My husband is a teacher as well, calls himself a geologists though. Since he's always trying to reach those rocks that sit in the desks."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let's say I buy the option for 100 shares yadda yadda yadda. GME spikes way ITM. I want to sell contract to someone else. Is there a guarantee that someone HAS to buy it, of can I get stuck holding while time runs out?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, newbe ape here. Listen, when i exercise my call option ITM and buy a shitload of shares under the market price, who the hell is the ape in the other side selling then to me?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks so much for this very concise and helpful guide! Sorry but I still have a few questions:

1. In your example, if the price of GME was $350 on 3/19, then do I just do nothing and the contract expires? And I’d just be out the $200 (which I assume I paid up front for the contract)?

2. If the price of GME goes up to $500 and I sell my contract, is it a taxable event?

3. Who determines the value of the contract up front? Do I just seek a contract with a strike number that I specify? Or are these contracts already listed somewhere?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I always wondered this, but don’t know enough about options. The question is, can you exercise a, (maybe there is a term, but I don’t know it, so I’ll call it this) reverse call. Basically, I want cheap shares, so I was looking at OTM puts. The premium is low, very low if you go way otm, I’m not just talking about GME, but you get the picture. Could I then buy a put contract to buy 100x of XYZ stock that’s actually at $100 for $50 then immediately exercise to buy 100 shares at a 50% discount?
Or is it if the contract is OTM, I simply am not allowed to exercise? Or since it’s a put do I Immediately have to sell after I exercise?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"FD's give you a dildo either way, most of the time it's red sometimes it's green"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,TL;DR- Buy 400 call option for GME?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why did people but GME $800c, does the premium cost less if you're strike price is higher?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You gave a bunch of apes a very dangerous knowledge.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honest ape question, if a call or put expires I only have to pay the premium?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Upvoting before I even read it
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,One more very important thing to understand is bid ask spread for options. Unlike the stock price options sometimes have very low liquidity and buying selling them can be difficult and  low liquidity can cause you to lose a lot of money
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn. That was awesome.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, too long, I'll just keep my stocks  IN my hands."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow. This made me feel like I can upgrade from crayons to Colored pencils.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Aw yay the 7 million 🦍 might finally know why this sub is here.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Whats the difference between selling an option or exercising it?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Instructions unclear, put another pre-market order for GME in"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,[Call/put Options and more 101](https://youtu.be/7PM4rNDr4oI) video that i learned from last night. Plan to buy some GME (or amc if gme is too expensive for me)calls mondays if my brokerage firm approves my account. For thosed who prefer visual aid/examples i highly suggest this
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"i never knew how retarded we were, till we made a post like this reach the front page. also its explained in a way that hopefully most retards on here will understand"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn I wish I could read
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I do have a question about options that I never seen answered. 

Who creates the contracts? I know you can buy a $5 GME option which is extremely expensive but who made a contract that said I can buy these at $5? Where do the stocks come from if you want to exercise? Who is selling stocks for $5 if you want to exercise?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,My advice: do NOT play with options until you really understand them. Go with very small plays to try each element. This is how people lose their asses.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok I don't fully understand. So a call means you have the option to buy a stock at a fixed price. But if the call is OTM then wouldn't you not want to exercise to buy the stock? And what does it mean when a call expires worthless? The call expired worthless so the guy was out $90k? I didn't quite get that.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow this sub went downhill fast
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,When did we turn into this 😔
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Not all heroes wear capes thank you OP
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just buy the shares. Safer and better to hold. With some much manipulation going on, it’s impossible to predict when it squeezes"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ironically, this wasn't any better or clearer than any other explanation.

Let's say someone has a box with 100 shares of a company, whose stock is valued at $1, and they're offering the box up for sale. You give them some money to hold onto the box for you and not sell it to anyone else. He writes ""$1 each"" on the box and You now have a contract with him to buy them at that price later. But he gives you an expiration date since he doesn't want to wait forever


A week later the stock goes up to $2. You have first dibs so you could agree to pay him for all the shares at the price on the box ($1) and now you'd own 100 shares for $1 that are currently valued at $2. 


Or, if you don't have the money to buy the shares, you can offer to sell your 'dibs' on the box to someone else for a profit. You sell the option to buy the contracts to the next guy and he can decide if he wants to buy the shares or sell the contract to the next person"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I ain’t doing that I’ve seen people lose so much, I’ll just buy the stock I’m sorry I’m too dumb. This is way to advance for my smooth brain. I imagine buying a call and then somehow losing my entire investment in a day. Like okay let’s say I buy an option for 1000 dollars. Is it possible to lose the entire 80k in my account from this option? Or will I just be risking the 1000. Basically what I’m saying is, is it possible to lose more money than you put into the option on a call or a put"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Instructions unclear, bought more GME"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,If u don't understand this you deserve to lose money and learn these lessons the hard way. Fucking stop babying these gme born retards. Let them get cooked its fun for everyone and one day they might learn the Greeks and actually make money.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I teach Middle School, which means I explain things to students who haven't yet graduated to the level of High School Idiot . 

Buying a call is like buying 100 coupons that are  good to buy a stock at X price. 

The more the  stock price is above X, the more valuable your coupons are.

If the stock price is below X, your coupons are much less valuable.

These coupons have an expiration date."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Commenting so I can keep track of this thread, I’ve been looking into calls and puts and this has helped break down the process for a smooth brained ape such as myself"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks from a young ape, good info."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This was an awesome explanation - thank you! One question though, when you buy a call are you risking only the premium you pay? Or if the stock price is now $350 on a $400c do you lose exponentially more money?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You know what’s crazy- you’re correct.

See I teach the idiots, who teach the High School idiots.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for taking so much time to explain this to a bunch of retards who can’t read. You really are a teacher.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,TLDR: I still don’t understand them 100% but thanks for trying and may god have mercy on your students
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ape like
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for this
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for this. My ape brain did not get it until now but at this point I’ve got a basic understanding which means time to YOLO my life savings on some options.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Still feel bad for the 90k guy. He’s likely a millionaire who doesn’t care either way but still
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Very well done.. I've been trading options and getting into the subtleties of Vega.. would love if you did more details explanations for theta and vega
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you.  You have enlightened this idiot.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That was a fantastic overview, well done and thank you!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I just tell everyone the basics then if they still are questioning how it works I tell them to go look at ford and buy 1 option. It's cheap has pretty decent ups and downs so you can see how it works.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would add not to exercise too far from expiry, as you'd lose the remaining premium"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You said you'd explain puts 😞
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Make a PowerPoint for us.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,do the GREEKS
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That was such a great explanation. The examples were really helpful. I teach math at the college level (still... idiots) so I very much appreciate things being explained in a fair and self-contained way. Would love to see a similar explanation for put options.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm offended and grateful. But also offended
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, daddy"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So you explained it for idiots but my brain is extra smooth. When you say you are buying a call option for $400 are you saying you are buying 100 shares for $400 or are you saying you are buying 100 shares for $400 per share ($4000 total for the 100 share contract)?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,">If it said $400p, it would be a put option, but we'll talk about those later.

Typical teacher saying they'll cover stuff later but never do!   

I jest good post for for the uninformed. Honestly the best way to really get it is to buy a really cheap call option and watch what it does."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This explanation was so good I almost fell off the spectrum.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I literally was researching this and was so confused. You explained it in a way this smooth brain ape could understand. Thank you very much!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This was very good explanation. Thanks

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This was super helpful thank you grand tard, I’m wondering how people predict the price target? Blindly throw a dart at the chart?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wish I had gold to give you for this perfect explanation
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Man I wish I could read
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So on a call option, if the price goes below the strike you don't have to exercise the contract and you've effectively only lose the premium paid for the contact? So in your example, 1c at a $2 premium would be a $200 loss if the stock fell below the strike point?

I'm guessing puts is essentially the same but in reverse?

Also, who sets the premium values?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,When reddit teaches you more about money than a grade 11 business and accounting class ever could

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is it generally better to have the funds available to excercise? Or would you say that buying and selling calls before excercising could be equally as profitable?

Also, when you excercise does the premium value add to your profits or does that only apply to when options are bought and sold?

Edit: clarification."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you sell a premium, can the option be exercised on you?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The ape committee has accepted and approved your Options dissertation
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So if i buy call options, and the value goes below whatever my price target was, I’m only out the premium i had to pay for the contracts? That seems way better than buying stocks lol"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait until these asshats learn about puts.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So let me ask in my own words so I can try to be less stupid...

If I have $100 in my account, and I buy $100 worth of Call, and the stock price goes to $105 for example, but I can't afford to buy the shares, I can sell just the Call contract, correct?

And if it goes down, I just have to let it expire? I am not obligated to buy anything, right? 

I'm still out my $100 because I paid for the Call, but that's it, correct?"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The best way to ensure succes whether buying a put or call or regardless of the exp is to buy close ITM‼️‼️...meaning of the stock is at $10 n u think it’s going to $20 in two weeks but the call for two weeks out but pay the expensive prenuim n buy the let’s say 11BEP call options..u will always make bread !!! Cos once the actual stock gets passed $11 u are in the money but It drops to like $8 u know u got two weeks left n it just had to pass $11 to start making profit..which it should u have conviction in the stock ‼️‼️😭

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You had me right until the “what is a call option: basics” part. Then you lost me.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Okay but in fidelity it says. Quantity = legs and buy to close and buy to open what does this mean?? What is one leg equal to 100 shares?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is it that premiums don't always decrease at every step to the next higher strike price? I have seen asking prices at one strike price that are less than for the next higher value. Why would anyone pay more for a call with a higher strike price?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you. I'll read it someday 🦍
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is actually a great explanation. Thanks for the wrinkle in my brain.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I must have a smooth fucking brain because I barely understood any of that. 

&#x200B;

only part I took from this is you pay additional cost (premium) for your call , so if the price is 10, premium per share is 2. so you need to hit above 12, not 10 for profit. 

&#x200B;

I thought calls (and please remember, fucking smooth brain here) were more like a bet.  like ""hey I bet 100.00 dollars, that NUT is gonna be above 15.00 by friday"".

if NUT hits above 15, you gain X amount due to some percentage calculation due to the odds being against when you made said bet. if the price stayed below 15, you loose your 100.00 bet.

&#x200B;

and I do apologize for any brain cells I killed with that example. Just proof of how Autistic i really am. 

&#x200B;

I should reaaaaallly not be allowed to handle my own money..."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,my smooth brain got some wrinkles now thanks to your post
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit, when does the movie version come out?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a phenomenal explanation for idiots. Well done.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is very well written. 🖍️🙌📈
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This! I feel a little less lost now, but somehow slightly more retarded... Lvl up!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"What I dont really understand is the inverse relationship between simply buying the stock and watching it go up versus the call option. Lets say GME is trading at $100. And I believe it will go to $200. What is the difference in me simply buying 100 shares at $100 vs buying a call option at $200? In both scenarios lets say it goes to $200. The option would be ITM. In the first scenario, I've doubled my money. In scenario 2, did I not just double my money? So, why take the extra risk of a call option?

I must be bad at math, go easy on me and thanks for the write up."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Man, if i could read i bet this would be some good knowledge to have stored in my brain"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,One thing I don't understand: Where do the contracts come from? who decided there should be a call option to buy at $800 for March 19?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is why teachers are underpaid and underappreciated. Thank you so much from an AP IDIOT!! 🔥🔥🔥👑
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What happens if I bought a call option for 170 for GME expiring March 26.  Do I want to exercise it or sell it?  For more tendies that is..
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This literally answered every single question I have had over the past several weeks and haven’t been able to understand from anything else I read 🤯🤯🤯🤯 thank you ape teacher. Thank you.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,i think i love you op
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So why, if the price is right, cant you complete the contract like a dropboxing effect where you sell the stock that you promised to buy directly to the buyer and then pay off the contract with the sale money?

I might be wrong but it looks like you said even if the stock price is in the profit region that if you cant afford the call you have to sell the contract itself and not the shares you said you would buy"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"What is the difference in profit between exercising and then selling the shares, and selling the contract?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Screw Jim Cramer. Someone give this guy/gal a show. And hey, if you ever write a 101 book on stocks, you’re damn right I’ll buy it."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've had a question I can't seem to understand because smooth brain. What if there are no bids for a deep ITM call you're holding? How would you make money on this play if there are liquidity issues and you don't have the cash to exercise? Idk if that happens often. 

Please help, I'm retarded."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So if you don’t buy the shares or sell the option you’re still out the $2 per share or whatever it was?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you so much for this. Since I don't have big money I'm still a bit nervous to use call options. If I want to sell my call, do I sell it like I sell shares or is there a special way I have to do it to make sure I'm selling the calls and not shares I hold in that same stock?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This bad boy needs a sticky or something. 
Very helpful and clear. :D"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Where are the pictures
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Who issues contracts? I mean, is the company that issues the contract the same as the company that owns the stock? Can I issue options for stock that I own? How do they decide how much to sell their options for?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How are some people negative thousands of dollars with options? They bought on margin? I thought you only lose the premium if it all goes bad.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So it's a reservation to a restaurant that you can ignore if they got an ecoli outbreak or squeeze into if they're popping super hard. And if you don't have the money to buy a plate you can become a scalper and sell those tickets for some sweet Wendy tendies instead.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Who sets the cost of the premium and how is it determined?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can we pin this? My 8 yr old mind and 37 body understood this
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How is the expiration date determined?  Can one choose an expiration date (would assume later dates = higher premiums)?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I still don’t understand any of this

I study economics at college

I am retarded"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If options values fluctuate much like stock values fluctuate can you sell an option prior to expiration even if the option is OTM and still make a profit?

For example if I have a call option with 30 days remaining.  I purchased it on day 1 for $5 and on day 20 it is now being sold for $10. Even if the underlying stock moved up but the option was still OTM can I sell that option for $10?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I learned about options too and had to go back to teaching.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"TLDR; HEY! IM NOT AN IDIOT, IM A RETARD AND SOME
OF US HERE ARE AUTISTS!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"> is not an investment term, and you don't need to know what it means in order to understand calls. It is a WSB term

Oh crap I got that exam question super wrong then"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you 🚀
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do you yield more profit if you exercise a call option (if you have the capital to buy it) and resell it immediately, or is it better just to sell off your call option?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel so much enlightened now. About to finish my beer and start a hedge fund with the 3 hedgehogs I found earlier in my garden.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wall of text crits me for 9999  /died
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Good information!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,If I am in your class I would rather learn this than some mitochondria being power house of the cell
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Looking forward to reading this....
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, Jr. High teacher here and your explanation was thorough and cleared some things up for me."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Slow clap, TY from a retard!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You, sir, truly are the Superbus"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Great work!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great info cheers. 
Where can you buy options? I can't seem to find anywhere that does them just CFD and spread bets."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m sure there are many things you don’t understand.  The idiot factor truly goes both ways.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Calls aren’t that hard to understand it just takes time. I would be careful with learning by experience. It’s good experience, but a lot of times it hurts."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I fell asleep reading this, much like how I spent my days in class during high school."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a Wendy's."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,In what case scenario do I lose money in a call option ?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you big ape.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hell yeah! I still don’t understand! 🦍🦍🦍
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,😳
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I understand options well enough to know I'd rather just buy shares of the stock. I own about 30 shares. So I have something. To hold onto.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,No emojis so i still didnt understand
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tldr. 

I had to bother the shit out of some wow guildies that I played classic with to learn how they worked. Read so much shit and it confused me more each time I read something. Got that shit now though. Gimme them free tendies.

Also, yes... don't go crazy at first. Find a cheap call in a stock. Maybe 2. Buy a short one you don't mind losing a few  bucks on and a long one. I like the volatility stocks for calls. You can lose your money quick. But you cant lose more than you spent.

Real tldr: Call options are like your standard tendies, only they are covered in the most delicious bbq sauce you've ever ever tasted.... or they are covered in 🌈🐻 jizz. Just make sure you know which is the good one before you deep throat that tendie."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"TL:DR... Call Options have 3 goals... Stock, Price, Time... get these 3 right and you can make money.

Stock = Ticker Symbol

Price = Strike

Time = Expiry Date

EX:  I want SNDL to hit $7 before 1/21/2022 (actual call option I'm holding)

SNDL $7c 1/21/2022"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,🍆 this looks like an easy game to play.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Now do expansionary fiscal policy,  quantitative easing, the yield curve, and fixed income securities"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn’t read this but I hope you mentioned IV crush
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Options sounds like the actual dumbest way of investing.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is fucking amazing. Thank you for making me less dumb.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Great explanation.  I am still retarded.  But now I have more toys to play with.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thx. One thing still not being clear in me monkey brain, but if i sell my call contract, am I exposed to the obligation of selling the underlying asset at strike price? Or is it the one who created the contract in the first place (the ''writer"")? If so, how does the system knows who he is?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That was the best explanation I’ve seen so far.  Thank you very much.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I read the Bible in less time than it took to read this.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sold my 350c for next week for a solid 3:1
  
But in kinda eyeing that 800 action 👀👀"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,But I can’t read
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s pretty simple Buy anything sticks go up
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Awesome. Thank you for helping Ape. 

Ape still wishes he knew EXACTLY how to to this step by step on RH and Fidelity so Ape didn’t fuck up and lose everything. 
As in:
Do this, then this, then this....
Ape watched YouTube and some other video, but Ape no trust anyone beside other Ape."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,My question is where can I buy options that dont have ungodly premiums like 70 dollars for a 270 stock(Tesla and Gamestop)
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you Mr. u/The_Superbus. Can I have the hall pass? I need to go buy some Call Options.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you sensei.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Incredible breakdown. Spoken like a true didactically infused 🦍
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"An educative community, this is the way. 

💎🙌"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you this really helped
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great explanation. I assume puts are the opposite of calls, in that while doing a put your contract is with someone else making a call? Looking forward to the next lesson teach!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just because you buy a call option at 100 shares does it mean you are obligated to exercise all 100 shares in the option? 

Or can you take 10-20, doing nothing with the rest? Or do you sell the rest to someone else?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Today I learned that IV stands for Implied Volatility and is not just a metaphor that literally shows a volatile graph of a stock...

Damn."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Not one god damned emoji in a post for idiots.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey quick question on this bit, apologies if has been covered elsewhere, but when you say ""This can take some time"" here, is there a set turnaround expected?  


Eg, if GME spiked and I hit exercise because I'm ITM and want to sell them whilst it's spiking - Depending how long the ""some time"" is here, it could have crashed back down and I could be OTM by the time the shares come through?  


Is there any protection for this?  
Thanks  


  
Section I reference  
 

I BOUGHT A CALL AND I'M ITM! HOW/WHEN DO I EXERCISE MY CONTRACTS

Make sure that you have enough money to cover buying all the shares and click the exercise button. They get your money, and you get their shares. This can take some time."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,One of my wrinkles have now been smoothened away.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You caught me on a commercial break so you have my full attention
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn bro Idk if the idiots you teach are gonna keep being idiots. 

With teachers like you this sub ain’t gonna have any retards to recruit"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,But i like pictures!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I really do appreciate this. Most useful post ive seen all week and bookmarked to reread. Im a noob. Im not making any moves besides buying some gme shares. Id like to learn before i start wotking this. Maybe so some small time just to practice or get a feel. But this is alot of helpful info. Thank you
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is great. Definitely going to pretend like I read it just like I used to do in high school.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the best, easiest to absorb information on options I’ve seen here so far. And people will still be asking what a bid/ask spread is by tonight .. Most apes only understand green up red down gammas and deltas are way too complicated for the average autist"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You are a crack at teaching!! Don’t teach them love for Socialism please.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh snap, I think I got a wrinkle....."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's too complicated.

What are calls?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you do one for puts?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just love the title!

Havent even read the post"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You sir, are one fuck of a fine teacher.  Maybe there's hope for our youth yet."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,is there any brokers that allow you to purchase options without having the funds required to exercise?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I teach middle school, which means I wxplain things to little idiots everyday





Jk they are adorable and kind."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dunno I think if you want to make these apes understand you need to put it in gamestop terms:

A call option is a way to preorder a PS5. You pay for your spot in line and a price guarantee. Your spot has an expiration date and you can sell your spot if you want. You can buy the game anytime before your preorder spot expires."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Good work!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice. Now do this for puts, plz."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Good explanation. So  is everyone then buying calls on GME due to volatility? Like can if be 20 dollars above the day you buy them? And then also where do you buy that?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for explaining this. I want to learn how to do this but first understanding the basics & terminology I needed to do first.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I like this cat
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you have to buy ALL the shares or can you buy just a few?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Man is a saint
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That wall of text fell on me but I was quick and moved away in time!  (quality post TY for posting).
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I love you. People hated and down voted me when I ask questions.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So what happens if you want to exercise your call but u don’t have the cash to buy the 100 shares?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you're ITM but poor, can you choose to exercise and immediately sell or would that result in margin call?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The obelisk gave the apes knowledge, but that knowledge would be their destruction."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"okay thx! what about puts then? as i understand it, its kinda the opposite right?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m in tech school and my professor buts my balls when I flip options. What’s your trade?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fixed downside, infinite upside. Like a lottery ticket that you can resell before the draw"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"“That would be a put option, but we’ll talk about those later.” When is later? :("
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mr Bus, thanks, you´re the best!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Tl/dr Get FOMO and YOLO on calls to git gud FDs.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So can i buy 500 1 dollar call options for gamestop tomorrow or does the 'call' have to be more than the current price?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Problems is you're missing some of the key ideas with options in this explanation.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,tl;dr me
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You got any pictures or sock puppets?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"""...I explain things to idiots everyday...""  Kinda harsh.  Most of my high school students were pretty awesome people, no matter the level of knowledge or ignorance on a subject."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The fact that this is posted to the top is proof that this subreddit is dead. Rip
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow. You Should be a teacher
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This explanation... but.... with pictures would be really nice. Psst Pixton dot com is nice.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Badass post fr. I'm a low-level tard and getting dumber by the day thanks to this. √
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just bought my first option !!!
1 $0,56 AAPL $130c"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Saved...thanks for the lesson
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,MVP
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought some RKT calls 24.89 and 25.89 for next week and might have destroyed myself on IV crush? Lol  they are down 15% and 25% even tho the underlying are hardly down since I bought them. Maybe next week I’ll see a recovery. 🤞
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"A 16-year-old who just got a dog.

What?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"thanks. a couple of questions:

1. do calls/puts only come in sets of 100 shares? can i get a call for 69 gme shares at 420 by 4/20?

2. can i exercise the contract partially? like my contract is itm and i want to excercise it but i have money only for 50 shares out of 100. can i just buy 50 shares, sell them for profit then buy and sell the other 50. thanks"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for helping these guys out.  Its exhausting seeing these questions in the daily  thread!  I learned everything I know thru ""In the Money"" channel on YT.  Adam's voice is sex."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I was trying to explain this to my buddy yesterday while we were at the playground with our kids. Just imagine me trying to shout about In The Money over a din of toddlers' screams. This is wayy easier.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have a question: if a call is an agreement to buy 100 shares at a strike price, why wouldn't I just set the strike price lower than where I expect the stock to go?

For example, if I think GME will hit $300 by April, why don't I buy a call with a strike price of $270 with an expiration in April? Why would I ever buy a call with a $300 strike price? Is their a larger premium for calls that are closer to the current price?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Excellent OP. You are a great one helping newer apes
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So who do I go to when I run out of coins to play games with?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I understand yolo and how good the green button looks
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,God bless good teachers.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I understand these now, you sir are the Ape Whisperer!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"""I explain things to idiots"" *proceeds to write 8000 words*"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Excellent post that I wish I had seen a year ago lol - But still, thank you, I know this took some time and effort!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just cause they're high school students doesn't mean they're idiots, sure retarded, buy not idiotic. You could be teaching innovators or people that could save your life"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit it took over twenty years but I finally learned something from a high school teacher.

Thank you Mr. The_Superbus! Will this be on the final?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Am a 🦍

Time to make ![img](emote|wsb_emojis|tendies)"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good, now I need to find an app different than etoro in the UK to play around with options"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,PSA - Some brokerages (like Fidelity) don't have an exercise button.  You have to call them on the phone to exercise (that is how infrequently exercising happens).
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Carefully, he’s a hero."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,i had to put this into translate and have it read to me
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would people buy calls on gme though when we're trying to squeeze shares?  Just buy the shares
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for posting but I've got no wrinkles left...I don't get what's the advantage of this compared to buying the stock when it hits the price and don't pay the premium, also no risk of being OTM?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for the great explanation. I understand how call options work but the one question I can’t seem to get answered is: what happens if you have a call option that expires ITM but you don’t sell the contract nor exercise for shares?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't think I think you ever did come back to explain what a put option is
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I was in High School too, or something."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you do more write ups on any other topics or subjects?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This was so informative and well explained. I really want to try but it I’m still to nervous. I’ve just been buying shares and holding. Which I think is still good.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I love you.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for an explanation I can understand, because I’m a dumbass. But not as dumb as a high school idiot.  I think."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you write one for covered puts?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If a call is ITM at expiration, can I still sell the call? And do I need to sell this on the day of expiration or day I do it after that date?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you ape
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,. For later
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Great beginners explanation of options very simple and easy to understand. Thank you!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Following because I'm going to have to read this multiple times before it makes since.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Good read
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Now do puts lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Fantastic explanation. Even my smooth brain understood some of it.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why wouldn’t you have the money to Exercise your Call when you had the money to Buy it? 

When you exercise a call do you end up just buying the 100 shares at their current price?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Whats the point of shit like this? Seems like complicated gambling.  Does this keep the economy working somehow? Feed anything other than gamblers wallets? Why do these type of options even exist?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Beautiful fren.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn, bro. Thanks. I feel a little less retarded now."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm still learning so this was very informative for me.
Also, I'm laughing my ass off.
Well done ape"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would someone buy a $280 GME call option while GME is ‘currently’ worth $200? Or even $800 call options as I saw around here?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re a hero and a scholar.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks fellow ape!!! Ape strong together!!! That was really helpful!!!🙌🏻🙌🏻💎💎💎🙌🏻🙌🏻
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great read, good documentation, I would like to contribute if we want to educate apes on different option strategies like spreads, butterfly, iron condor etc., Because it's hurt when apes do pure gamble rather educated risks.."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Instructions unclear dick stuck in phone call receiver... help
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"> But what if the price of GME goes way up but I don't have $40,000 around to buy 100 shares at $400/share? Then you sell the contract to someone who either does have $40,000 sitting around, or (slightly advanced info here that you don't need to know) to someone who is trying to offset a position

Well, this just made call options a lot more affordable."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn, thanks a bunch for this. The part about selling your contract because you can't exercise it, how does one even get to start? What I mean is that what is a good app to use? I am using Public and Cash App for my holds but I installed Robinhood and didn't want to lie about my finances and now I can't purchase options. My guess is that it just isn't for you if you don't have the income which is why I am holding my share of GME and waiting on my stimulus for more. I would just like to be able to try options and sell a conract to make something back so I can buy shares to hold. Is that a bad move? I don't want to fuck up the game at all and want the best outcome for all apes"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Teacher I have a question, if I got ITM calls but not the funds to exercise as you said I can sell the option, but what is a normal percentage of ""sale"" I have to sell those options in order to be attractive?

&#x200B;

Like if I got Calls that expire tomorrow for 10k profit I should be able to sell for at least 9k so I just ""give away"" 1k, right ? but whats a normal/common ""discount"" rate in order to be fair but still profiting a lot"

Dumb ape go back to eating crayons now.

Edit: One question I’m trying to understand is this: assuming your call is ITM, and you want to sell it instead of exercise, do you have to do it before it expires, or do you have to the option to do it once it expires? I know you can do it anytime leading up to it, I just wasn’t sure how the process unfolds once expiration day comes."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So If I think a stock will go up, and I can afford to just straight up buy 100 stocks, isn’t it better to just buy them than to put a Call for them?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Couldn't one just always only exercise a call if and when it's ITM? Thus a call would never be risky and always be profitable? I'm sure not or everyone would do that; what am I missing?

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hmm
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you making the same amount of money if you exercise a contract and receive the shares and then instantly sell them and if you just sell your contract? I know the value of the stock might change in between the time you received your shares but let’s say the price stays the same. Is exercising calls and then selling making money then just selling your option?

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Many talk letters here. Spend long time eye listening
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So give me an example with prices for buying and selling a call option and making a profit.  Do I buy the option for $25 and sell for $30 and make $5?  Seems like you would stand to make more money just buying shares.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think the ""Aha"" moment I had with options is this: With a call option, you get the profits ""as if"" you owned the underlying shares, meaning you just have to put up the cash to buy a premium but still get all the profits. However, there is also the time factor that prices in uncertainty into the equation which gets smaller as you get closer to expiration, and you get no money at all if the option expires when it is OTM...and you're out the original premium you paid."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The options detail I haven’t been able to wrap my head around is what happens if your option expires ITM but you don’t exercise it? Will your broker automatically sell it off to someone buying shares? Do you have to manually close them? If there isn’t enough buying interest in the stock (which theoretically shouldn’t happen if your call was ITM) can your ITM call expire worthless if you don’t exercise and buy the stock?

I think it might just be too dumb of a question so no[t many] YouTube videos etc seem to have addressed it that I can find 😂

(Ps i do understand the concept of EV expiring and it might be a wash on holding longer if IV isn’t expected to skyrocket.)"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Retard here, if I understood anything, since you don't need to buy the shares (execute the contract) so the only risk there is is that you lose the premium you paid in the beginning?"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Me accidentally selling a naked call option my first time: got em
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Awesome explanation!! I have been meaning to learn about calls for a while now... my question is how do people lose so much money? If a call gives you the ability and not the obligation to buy a stock, if the call is OTM, can’t they just wait until expiration and the only money they would lose is the initial premium? I don’t get how people lose so much."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I started reading this thinking “great someone who has finally explained it like I am actually retarded” and it was all beginning to make sense! Then I read more and more and before I knew it my brain was smoother than it’s ever been

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the info.. I thought this was the kind of stuff they did away with when the market crashed in 29. 

ITs all such a game I always though you want X stock at $ then its simple math I want 1000 GME at $100 means transfer $100,000 to a broker and its yours.  IF you sell at $200 you made out. If you sell at less than a hundy you lose.  ALl this stuff seems like just ways to keep the average gorilla out of it ."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm no expert, but my understanding is GME @ $400.  I like the stock.

💎💎🙌🙌🙌"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So when I'm ITM I can buy all of the shares or sell the contract. Selling the contract seems like a good idea if you cannot buy the shares. Is this correct?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You see a stock getting volatile and you want to get in.You check the options chain and calls are cheap and you see one you like.

You buy the option contract, understood it all. It has the premium, you calculated that cost. The strike price and expiration date all work out favorably for your projected price target and timeframe. Hooray.

Then the underlying stock moons and your contract is worth a shit ton.

*How* do you sell it? Do you just hit sell and then all the money that contract is worth just shows up? Do you have to enter a price? Is it worth just.. whatever it happens to be worth because of the intrinsic/extrinsic value or do you also set a price? Is their a bid/ask for contracts in that strike/expiration range or is it like a market/limit sell?

I've never bought one, only looked at a lot of them and everyone always says 'Just sell it..' but they never specify what that entails."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So how do I sell my option?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Why? Because if the price only got to $400, you could have bought it for $400/share without buying the contract, which means the money you spend on the contract was a waste.

I'm not understanding this part. If I only paid $2 per share, how is paying $400 per share as good, or better, than paying much less for the shares?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey sincerely OP thanks for posting this. I’ve been reading a lot about options over the past month and this has been the most ELI5 description I’ve found. I hope you do puts soon :) thanks for taking the time.

Now I’m gonna go eat glue"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,so why is this better than just buying the share when its lower than your call price and you expect it to go up
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Alright Mr. Know-it-all why don't you tell me why people buy ITM calls instead of close OTM calls and just waiting for it to go ITM??
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok so now I completely understand. So does this mean the guy who lost 90k when they discovered calls, lost 90k in JUST the premiums to buy the calls?"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a perfect explanation
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe I'm worse than stupid. If you don't have to pay for the calls, how are people out of money?
And can you just make money getting contracts and selling them? If no one buys them you wouldn't lose money because you don't have to pay for them, right?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"How much would a call sell for if it was ITM? If it was  10 $5 GME $800c 3/19  , and the current price was $810 or $805 (ATM) ? Would it be the $500 you paid for the premium, or more?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I still don't get why people would use call options. If I buy a stock, and the price goes up a dollar, I get that dollar if I sell. That's the benefit you said the call options get, so how is it ever better than just buying the stock?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wat choo meen?

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You got an upvote from me for taking the time to write this
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not gonna lie, I always thought calls were a deal that you would buy at the price you bought the call contract at IF the stock hit the strike price.

For example, a 3/19 $800 call. Let's say I purchased when GME was $220. I always thought that I could buy 100 shares of GME at $220/share ONLY IF GME hit $800 by 3/19. If it didn't hit that number, it'd expire worthless.

Can I ask as a followup, what’s a “bull spread”? And also, why is it better to sell the option rather than exercise it? How much would a $400c, break even at $402 option sell for if the price was at say $410 vs exercising the contract and selling at that price?"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So when we celebrated amc at 8.01 it was actually a bunch of people making a profit? But they were forced to buy shares so that's why we celebrated because buying shares increases the price? But if they were OTM then they expired worthless and no shares are purchased to increase stock value?

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yo teach! Thanks
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for posting this!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Solid write up. 👍
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I can’t wait to read this later
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you bro!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Serious question - have you ever fantasize about a hot ass girl cheerleader at your high school??? (the 18 yr old ones of course).
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What I’m hearing is but ASO calls for a month out.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Erm Sir? I'm in your AP maths class...am I an idiot too then?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Melts my heart when WSB spreads real helpful knowledge
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,*one wrinkle forms*
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the knowledge. I feel like I can now become a degenerate gambler, who tells people he is an investor."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You teach, me dumb ape, learn, post porn, yolo later!!! Got it! This the is way. Perfect"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Really useful explanation, thank you!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Explaining what FDs should be bannable imo but good write up for the Jan crowd
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Question:

""...but not the obligation""

How do I choose that path?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Really well done. Thx teach
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I resent being called an idiot, I much rather be called a retard or an autist"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The title alone is worth my upvote
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just lost my life savings, thanks."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Great explanation and I like very end as well caution is good.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks Dad.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Great. One question. How to I sell a call contract if I can't afford to buy the options?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ty this is very helpful.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,AKAB
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I am saving this to re-read when I'm not high. That was excellent! It's the first explanation that's resonated with me. I appreciate your insight; thank you.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"After reading this, I feel like I finally formed a wrinkle in my brain"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Now do puts?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Will you do puts as well?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone else feel a little deflated when realizing you aren't even smart enough to be recognized as an idiot?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone use IG and can help me purchase through this shit broker? I want to buy some options but I can’t find GME anywhere
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Whenever I try to buy a call it says not enough buying power. I don’t understand how to figure out how much money I need to buy it.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,But who makes those contracts 🤔🤔
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I gotchu, fam. Here’s a *book* on call options!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, just to clarify, You are paying the premium for the co tract, whether you exercise the option or not, right?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If a dumb ape can't Google what's a call option, there's no way they are reading all that"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stopped reading when I saw that ppl DONT have to buy their calls if they expire?? What, so then what is the downside? 

Why wouldn't all apes just makes calls on everything if they don't have to buy it? 

Sorry OP I'm sure you explain this but my dumb ape attn span is rotten banana"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Some bold lettering would help. All I see is blobs. You must not teach the truest idiots.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,fuck... going to have to find a middle school teacher apparently
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow. I learnt this shit at uni and this is explained much clearer. Then again i probably didnt study as much as i should have
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, can you explain puts, too?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dear god, I think you just created another wrinkle in my brain! Thank you 🙏🦍"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,scool what that
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s a Donkie punch 🥊?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You said you were going to get to puts, and then you didn’t."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Note: Calls are only one type of option. Puts are essentially calls, but in reverse. Call = right to buy at X price, Put = right to sell at X price."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didn't see any pictures or a sparkline, or even a TL;DR... So I down voted and typed this comment."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I cannot read 😫
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"so, in your example, you need the price to hit $402 in order to break even, and $403+ to make profit. BUT what if the price hits $400-$401? are you required to buy? (since that is the call price?)
 anyway, if the price stays under $400, and you don't buy and it expires, essentially the only money you will be losing is the premium price you paid, correct?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So you say you're not obligated to exercise the option, does this mean no matter what happens you only lose the premium? Like if you bought it and forgot it? Or are you at any point obligated to pay more than the premium?

Is this the same for puts?

Like I'm afraid I'll buy an option for $2-$20-$200 or something but somehow get stuck with a $20k bill lol."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Imma come back to this
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, this is great. JUST enough knowledge to yolo my live savings away."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Why do people sell calls? Is the premium really enough to make it worth it for them?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Got it, YoLo in all my savings on calls!! Woohoo!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Amazing. Now we need part two on puts please
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks a lot, OP!
But I still have a question. Can I buy a call for just ome share for example, and not 100?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good info, thanks!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Dang!!!! Thanks for this I have been wondering how to do call options!!!!!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,\*GUH\*
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This was a really great explanation. Thank you for this write up.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd rather not understand so I can ignore it
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bear with me I'm pretty retarded.  
So unlike shorting I'm not obligated to buy the stocks? I just lose the money that the contract was worth? That goes to who? The person who holds the stock?  
If I want to do a 10 $5 GME $500c 25/3 does the person who gives me that contact have to hold on to those 10?  
Is it the exact same for PUTS but in reverse?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn it. I swore I would never begin to learn this because I thought you HAD to buy the shares at the end no matter what. The simplicity of this makes it a helluvalot worse for me because this is way easier than I thought and most of the calls I've done in my head have materialised but I just didn't want to take the risk. Damn it. 

I suppose my next question is, based on what I said, why should or shouldn't proceed to learn more? If I should learn more, do you have some resources for me to read?

Thanks."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Saved me two hours of Youtube.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"i may have said this before, but i mean it now, 

you are the man."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What is this sub turning too? Ya'll just upvoted a helpful posts and didn't cuss his out or ban him??? That is the true sign this sub has to many imposters in it. Bring me back to pre covid WSB sheesh
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Saving this. I need to learn how to loose more of my money quicker. Thanks!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"""The contract can't hurt you""

The contract: The contract the contract"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I need to find a $1 stock and test this out..or, can paper trading do calls? WeBull, for example?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The main thing I learned from this is the actual cost to buy the option which was confusing.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Now do covered calls please... lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"No learn, Only Ape, To Moon"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,A easier to explain it is a call option is just Kmart layaway for stocks with a non refundable deposit.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks man! I actually kind of understand options now.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you please explain puts next?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok so now we need a part 2 that dives deeper
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"My issue is this, lets say I find 5 stocks I like. And I buy three of them. Those 3 go down and the other two shoot up. IDK."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Quick question, would love some insight and someone to double check my homework, plzzz

I have 1 $1.86 AMC $5c 4/16 that’s ITM current stock price is $11.34

Right now it’s worth $6.35 or $636 if I were to hypothetically sell it right now (it’s Saturday market is closed I know). Therefore $636 minus my $186 premium I paid would be a net profit of $450 if I sold right now (robinhood says I’m only up $449, but close enough). 

If I exercised right now I would pay $500 plus the $186 premium I already paid so $686 then I would 100 shares valued at $11.34 which would be $1,134. If I then immediately sold it now it would be a net profit of $448 or about the exact same if I just sold the contract instead of exercising. 

If I sold now I could make a >200% profit, but let’s say I think AMC is going to moon to $20 eventually and think it could happen before expiration. I would probably want to wait until it launches off closer to expiration then do this math all over again and see if selling the contract or exercising it would be more lucrative, right? Let’s say it goes to $15 at expiration and I’m up a lot of money if I sell, but I think it’s going to keep climbing and it would be a better pay off to exercise and sit on the shares until they rise, right? I won’t need to hit exercise and it will naturally be exercised/bought by me at expiration AS LONG AS I HAVE THE $500 FUNDS in my account to be used. Otherwise it won’t get exercised and I’ll be shit outta luck. Right?

Bonus part 2: There’s a lot of stocks that have dipped hard d/t covid and other reasons right now and I know (pretend I’m a smart wizard from the future) they will eventually (and soonish) be worth a lot more than they are now. Why would I want to buy a call and exercise if I plan to keep the stock to let it fully mature instead of just buying the stock? Why would I want to pay so much to exercise and risk it being OTM then just pay a little more than the premium to buy 100 shares of the stock and not have to worry about it going up too slow? I just don’t get why anyone would buy a call and plan to exercise it instead of selling it and not paying the expensive call price."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So how would you sell a contract if it was ITM and you didn't have the money up front? Do you have to personally know someone with money and then you and them work out a deal? Is there a craigslist page for ITM contracts? Our funds removed from your account immediately after hitting exercise contract?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, time to go all in on call options and lose all my money."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm not really sure how theta works. I just buy LEAPS so I don't have to worry about it.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do you pay the premium just to form the contract, or only if you exercise/sell the call?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,My brain is smooth like eggshell. I still don’t get it.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here is a question: what if your contracts are in the money, expiration is coming up, you don’t have enough money to exercise, and nobody is buying your calls, possibly because the options aren’t liquid enough. Are you FORCED to exercise in that case, or can you let some or all of your options expire worthless (even though they are ITM) because you don’t have the money to exercise them?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Could you reduce this to, say, 15 words or perhaps even 20 characters?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Did I just grow a fucking wrinkle on my smoothbrain???!! In all seriousness. This was a fantastic explanation. OP knows his shit.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for your time. Not sure if am allowed to ask questions.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good explanation thank you but got 1 last question. You buy a call option for the 19th and you itm, but you are not around foe some reason or the other. So after the 19th your call option is worthless ? Even though you were itm at the end of the day on the 19th. That is all the question i have left about options. Thanks for anyones help on this matter"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sooooo, is there an option to sell a call if I can't cover the price if I'm itm? Like is it a simple thing to do? I don't know what I'm doing."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Do we still not have a rule against teaching the retards of this sub to believe they understand how options work?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro thanks so much!!!! You legit are an amazing teacher. I believe you! You helped me understand so much!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, reading into selling cash covered calls and doing that first helped me understand options trading. A much safer way to start out in my opinion."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can break it down as easy as you want, dummies still won’t understand. I’ve seen it broken down to atoms and OP still clueless"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,If I could afford it I would give you rewards. Thank you so much this was very well written and helped a lot!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ape understand, ape buy lots of calls"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,800C 3/19? Ok got it
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Too many words. Hurts my eyes.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,can u please explain puts too. +imho your students are lucky to have u as a their teacher.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So TLDR; ... Call options let you can, for a fee, buy an ""ability"" to buy stocks at a certain price that comes with an additional small fee?

If you can't buy those stocks at that price, because you can't afford it, you can sell this deal to someone else instead.

The risk is that you don't use your ability to buy them at that price, because it's lower than the market value... in which case you'd lose the fee to buy the option/ability."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I felt my brain forming wrinkles. Ape needs a nap now.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, FD actually stands for F******** D*********"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is what I need. A book, YouTube playlist, or something, that explains vocabulary. It's easy to research something once I hear it exists, but my issue is not know what other terms are out there.

Are the finance books, or playlists, like the OP's?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I haven’t laughed reading options explanations ever before in my life. I didn’t know what a FD was but I get it now. Thanks for the ELI5
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice write up. You forgot to explain ATM. ATM is where it’s at.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This post created the slightest of ridges in my pearl brain. Finally half understanding options after weeks of failed attempts. Thanks your sir

Hey I *WENT* to high school!
Do you know Dave!??"

It's well written, easy to understand and helps/teaches people.

That ain't right"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lost me on ""exercise"". Fuck it! I'm not doing that."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you have to buy all 100 or can you buy half? Bet its always based on 100.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Idk what any of this has to do with these delicious crayons.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Excuse me HS teacher! Could you please explain like I'm five? TL;DR version of an ELIF, kthx"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you I need to practice with fake ape money first to get hang of
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you sir for your very informative post. You have helped me fill some of the gaps in my knowledge of call options and done it in a way that I did not feel talked down to. Good job may you always be ITM
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you go about selling a contract?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Very good explanation. Just validated my understanding. 

Ty ty fellow ape 🦍. May the tendie gods bless you with many a banoonoos 🍌"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you look at my Google history today? This is what I was googling all day.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This was by far the best explanation I have seen on options. Thank you. As a reward, I give you a useless handshake award reddit gave me today."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"But I can’t read god dammit 🦧

Somone explain with emojis please"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I would give you an award for this too if I didn’t already have all my money in GME and AMC
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,">**Now you can look like you know what you're talking about even though you still probably don't.**

This is how I know you're actually a teacher and used to dealing with idiots. Bravo."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well put 
Hopefully those Apes buying options without knowing what they are doing, understand now what damage they can cause 
Buy what you can pay for until you understand what risk you are for others"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Excellent explanation thanks
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for this. I’ve stayed away from options due to lack of understanding. Loss porn is not my favorite porn. Time to give this a try.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You won’t believe it but I still don’t get it
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,THANK YOU! I have read about options so many times and being an ape makes it harder to comprehend. Thank you for taking the time to educate the rest of us noobs.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"First off, I’m very new this and still an idiot in the stock market. I’ve recently had options added to my account. It only allows calls so far, and when I go to buy one, it gives me 2 options, either buy to close or sell to open. I’m not completely sure what this means. Anyone willing to explain this?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Better than any YT video I’ve watched. This comment has weight how? I can’t even read a receipt to save my life.., but I read this entire gold mine of a post. For that, I am grateful."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Stock Market for Dummies should be your next book.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I just like that you kept using that poor bastard throughout as an example.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"How does selling the ITM contract work? Does the seller set the price or is it a fixed percentage of the value or something along those lines? 

Do these sales get executed pretty fast typically?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"**Options 101**

More didactic than that impossible."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice!! Explaining Puts vs Calls including ITM and OTM would be helpful. I still have a tough time wrapping my head around it. I see all these charts with those things and it shows huge numbers. Iv been searching and trying to figure it out. This helped some.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,FANTASTIC!  Please do one for put options as well!

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is very informative for buying calls! Can you also do a piece for selling covered calls and different put options as well?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish I could read.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,One question - which brokers can I buy options on?

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol I had to pause to think about what ""FD"" really stood for"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let's say I buy a call, I'm in the money, I exercise shares and then drop out of money - I'm still out a ton yes? I'm thinking of GME crater last week from 350 to 200. Could be worse to exercise then vs waiting. Is the right strategy to exercise only when you are ready to sell the shares (or right when they are about to expire)?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Weird question but wouldn’t getting a really low call price he better? For example if a stock price is 100, would t it make sense to get a call for let’s say, 120? Rather than 200? So you’d make more if it goes up hiigjer if that makes sense"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you make a video i can’t read
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Upvoted for title alone
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This I get, but it’s the bid and ask price that is not matching with this info. If I am buying a contract at the ask, but selling at the bid, which is always lower than the ask, how does anyone make money this way? Is it how you exercise your contract option?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, that was a good explanation!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Could you explain Binary Options now?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,title got me!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So what happens if I sell a covered call and then sell the shares and then the contract gets exercised. Do I have to pay 100 x the strike price or 100 x market value of stock at that point?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok. So if I go and buy one call of GME for $400 that expires next week. That would mean 1 $5(don’t know the exact price) GME $400 3/19. That’s great to know.
I am still a bit confused. So if I don’t have to buy the option, even if the stock tanks, the only money that I would loose is the $500 contract cost? That’s it?
Maybe the additional premium of $25 but nothing else? Ever?
So there is no scenario in which I would lose more than say those $525?
I read a porn loss of a call option trader that lost $350k. How can that happen then? Did he go crazy on contracts? Like 1000 $3,50 ASS $420 6/9 and ran out of time? 
My smooth brain is scared that someone is gonna come after my bananas I lost in a call option I never thought I did bet, because I ate too many crayons. 

Thanks for explaining though."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,">you try it. A $700 call on GME that expires next week costs around seven bucks a share. How would you explain to me that you bought two of them?

>You would say that you bought 2 $7 GME $700c 3/19. Now you can look like you know what you're talking about even though you still probably don't.

:) Examples are always so helpful. That's how I knew you really were a teacher"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel a wrinkle forming on my brain... nope, just a tumor... nothing to see here."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck no I ain’t reading that but I’m buying gme options for 1k
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Saving this. Thank you homie 🤞🏾🚀
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you 😊 now I know. Rooting for you apes here from the sidelines - you got the moon in your sites, hold till your wife's boyfriend screams for mercy 🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕🌝🚀🚀🚀🚀🪐🤟"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The one thing I saw missing there is an explanation as to why someone would use this, aside from speculative purposes. I think it’s important to understand that most of these tools have a purpose other than pure speculation.  

BUYING CALLS is a way of participating in an expected stock upswing for less money than buying the stock and less exposure if the stock tanks instead of  increasing. It’s basically saying, “I think it’s gonna go up and if it does I’ll make a profit, and if it drops I have a fixed cost.”  

When you were the buyer you don’t talk about naked calls and covered calls. The buyer doesn’t have a position to cover. It’s the seller who has a potentially unlimited risk for naked calls.  When you are buying a call option, your exposure is fixed and that’s one of the most conservative things about it.  

SELLING COVERED CALLS is a way of making some extra money off of the stock that you already hold, if you don’t expect it to go up as much as other people expect it to go up, or if you plan on taking profits anyway.  If you have 100 shares of XYZ at $50, and you would gladly sell it for $60, you could sell covered calls at the $60 strike price. How much you get for those contracts would depend upon how much other people think the stock is likely to get to 60 before the expiration.  Let’s say you got a dollar a contract.  

If XYZ stock goes to 70, there are two ways to look at it.  One, you got $61 per share and lost out on $9. Two, you were gonna sell at $60 so you got an extra $1. 

If XYZ stays below $60, you made a dollar per share and you still have your stock.  Repeat as necessary.  

So someone covered calls is a way to either, make a little profit when you would’ve put a market limit order in anyway, or make a little profit when the market is more excited about your stock’s future  than you are in the near term, and you’re willing to either forgo that profit and make a little money right now or end up holding onto your stock anyway.  

SELLING NAKED CALLS is gambling.  :)"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would like to add one note to his description, which was done very well. This is a multi national thread. His example is for how it works within the USA. In Some nations the contracts can only be exercised at expiration. The most important thing about options trading, is to understand fully the risks associated, and that what you think you are doing, is in fact exactly what you are doing.  Perhaps the original poster might be so kind as to put an explanation of buying puts up for everyone. I’ve explained calls before and puts as well, just not as well as he did."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can’t read, so I need to ask a question. Do I have to pay the premium no matter what? Whether I act or not?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m not sure what this guy is talking about I’m gonna stick to buying options.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Very well explained
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Question: Do people also sell calls with a striking price that is a lot lower than the stock's current price with a high premium? (As in they're kinda shorting the stock cos they believe it will go down and you believe it will go back up?)
Or is that just completely unnecessary and doesn't make sense as it wouldn't be the most profitable thing for the call-seller to do?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This was very well explained! Could you add a note about auto exercising/auto selling when ITM expiration happens or like in RH around 2 or 3 they close out your positions it the option expires that day?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So if you buy a call option and let the contract expire instead of exercising it, do you lose the premium or do you only pay the premium if you actually buy the shares?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"When you sell the contract to someone else, how much would you sell it for?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"> That is called theta decay, but you don't have to worry about that.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you explain the stock market to me idk how to do stonks
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So at a minimum you have to pay that $2/share contract price even if you don’t buy the shares before the deadline?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you so much for this. Ape knowledge big
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Very awesome write up.  I'm just under idiot intelligence and I think even I recognized some of the words you used.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s just too bad that nobody in this sub knows how to read.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the best explanation I've seen on the internet. Thank you!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m a little confused when you said $5 GME $800c. Is it $5 a share or $800 a share? If it is $5 a share, what does the 800 mean?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So does this mean cashing in on a Call requires two transactions? 1. Exercise the call(Buy the shares). 2. Sell the shares.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can i exercise a call without actually paying if I sold it right away for a profit? Ok as soon as i wrote out the question i knew the answer.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish my broker had an exercise calls button.    Its stupid to be on the phone for an hour to do such a simple transaction.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can you do one on futures now? Lol

I don't see options to buy calls in the apps I've been using. I'm guessing that just means it's a shitty/beginner app or something.

Edit: do I need a brokerage account to take advantage of these things"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great write up. How about one on ""puts as your time allows?"" You have a great way of explaining things. 👍"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Proud of you for this! Thank you for the edu-ma-cation.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m sure I will get a lot out of this write up as soon as another teacher comes along to teach me how to read it. I’ll just continue to grunt and stab at random call options on my phone until that happens.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s funny that you say Finance Majors, i assure you they don’t teach options in any depth or detail."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can sell contracts at anytime, but don't you need a buyer to buy them off you? If so, What if no one wants to buy them?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for that
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So to buy a $275 GME Call you have to have invest atleast 4K? Any way I can make a call with only like 1K? I know this probably sounds dumb as fuck I am a retard
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You think I can read at a high school level ? I bought GME at 325$
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So can you tell me the exact call to buy?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So why are buying calls more profitable than just buying the shares before it gets to your target price?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Great contribution! Thanks for your help!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Do I pay the contract price regardless if I exercise the option or not?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I've needed this for so long but have been too dumb to ask. Thank you.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m upvoting simply because of your opening line “I teach high school so I explain things to idiots all day”
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,My god this is exactly what I’ve been looking for thank you so much
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, explain to me why, if my goal is to buy a call and then exercise it if it hits ITM, why wouldn't I just buy shares? Seems like a lot more risk, and more headache than just buying shares.


I buy an option with a $400 strike. If it hits, cool. Every dollar it goes up, I make $100.

But fuck that. Why wouldn't I just set a $400 limit order? Every $1 it goes up, I make $100 and don't have to fuck with theta alpha omega te quiero taco bell shit.

Someone please explain. I understand what they are, now, but I don't understand why they are better than just buying shares... Unless you plan on doing some fuckery with just selling the contract rather than exercising."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you so much for this. I was actually just watching some YT vids about calls and puts etc but you explained it significantly better.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks retard
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice write-up but misses an important part about exercising or sell to close call options situation, i.e. here's how you make money on call options, quick and easy understanding. I just learned this last night to my best understanding. 

Exercising call options means you effectively buy 100 stocks at the contract price for every contract you ""buy to open"". Take one contract of GME 290C expiring 4/16/21. 

Exercising that call option means you buy 100 shares of GME at $290 even though its current price is $264.50 when I typed this. You make money if the GME stock price is above $290 + the premium you paid. Using $310 GME stock price as an example, that's a $20 discount for every share when you exercise however you gotta pony up $290 x 100 shares = $29,000 for that. You still pay $29,000 plus the cost of the premium when exercising an options contract from my understanding.

You sell to close a call option to avoid paying money to buy 100 shares. The Sell to Close ability works when the price of a stock rises quickly in a short time that you effectively earn a profit way before the expiration of contract."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Now selling puts? 🤔

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I still have one dumb question. Do I have to have the money to cover the call if it expired ITM?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe.  That’s giving most a lot of credit
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I understood just about everything except for the two values.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This ape is STILL struggling.

No matter how much people break it down for me, I still struggle to understand.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Tbh I've watched several videos and found this the least confusing a d best description yet
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,If they could read.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lost me on the first sentence
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Do I get nana for reading?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I saw a wall of text and went to comment on the first most upvoted comment on the thread. Saving this post though.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I am doing the same with this comment. Smooth brain can’t handle so many words in one evening
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Might take a few years but you'll get there
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That's for buys. If you start selling options then it gets way more complicated.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"instructions unclear, bought more GME"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"take the free course (**Options 101: Basic Concepts and Terminology**) on [https://www.optionseducation.org/](https://www.optionseducation.org/) to get a solid (but basic) understanding (3hrs max)

No not easy money. If you're new to options:

1. don't write options
2. don't YOLO on deep OTM calls (remember the guy that lost $100K on hail marry 0dte calls?)
3. save your bananas and buy GME shares instead - there is no timer forcing you to sell

0dte = 0 day to expiry"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,LPT always in the comments
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not actually true though. GME is the perfect example - puts went through the roof on the first big run up because the volatility spiked. I would know, I sold a bunch."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"My teacher taught an easy way to remember:

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"OK, pardon my retardation. I understand buying calls. Is there a way to buy pits that has a similar limited risk of the price of contract? 

I guess I don’t understand if that’s possible or if betting against a stock is always shorting/infinite risk."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy call buy put. Really this is all beginners should worry about, and a covered call/put maybe. I don’t get why this post is fuckin college essay level it’s pretty simple."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,all that matters in high school is sex
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I just feel like I’ve leveled up and learned a new skill  from “the scroll of autist options” but can’t use the new skill yet because I don’t have enough MP.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,exactly why OP needs to add a part 3 on understanding how to read options chains after writing part 2 on puts.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Selling covered calls on a cheap stock is a great way to become familiar with some of the interface as well. As long as you're selling calls at a strike price above your cost basis, the only risk you'll ever have is missed profits."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I am concerned about how to seel the contract. Because I don't want to be stuck with something that expires worthless as I try to figure out what buuttons to press. I have figured out how to buy so far and messed with expiry and strike price to see how things change.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,that's probably a good thing
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I spent two years writing curriculum, so I have a lot of practice."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,A career in technical writing perhaps?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes! Give OP a gig. More apes making more money means more GME rocket fuel. 🚀
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If this isn't a ""teachers don't get paid enough post"" I don't know what is."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If your contract is ITM, how does the selling process work? 

For example, GME $400c 03/19. GME goes up to $450. 

If exercised and immediately sold the stonk, I make $5,000, but if sold contract, do I still make $5,000?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think the only thing missed is explaining why buying can be bad

It mentions it takes a long time to settle, but especially for volatile stocks this is bad. If stock changes price and you can't sell what is being converted you take a huge risk."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It depends... assignment is more likely the deeper ITM a short call goes, especially if it's a low volatility underlying and there is a long while until expiration.

Also assignment is more likely to happen on stocks that regular dividends."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seriously, this really should be conveyed more often. Because I could read about options as much as I wanted; it didn’t make sense how people were making so much off of them until someone mentioned this."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"But, when it is ITM, someone has to exercise before it expires, right?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wouldn’t someone want to exercise their deep ITM call option near expiration so that they could have a lower cost basis?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,And you do that by............?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I am not a cat
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hang in there
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can somebody please make a post that explains reading first??
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Someday we'll both learn to read and then we'll be rich.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,When do call options expire for Robinhood?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"1.  You sell it on the market the same way you do a share of GME.
2. Yes.
3. Yes."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your 1st question brings up a few good points. Open Interest (OI) and daily trading volume for the contracts are sometimes worth considering, especially if you don’t want to or plan to take the contract to expiration. Your option may be in the money but you still need a counter party on the other side to complete the transaction, buy or sell."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you want to learn something use the internet to find sources that already explain it / teach it well.

The dude InTheMoney on YouTube’s second tutorial is pretty damn solid if you need a follow up."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Many posts get removed by the auto mod. I had one like this as well and they just get nuked.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"There’s already a ton of info on this stuff man... You can find great sources on options trading on youtube, investopedia, other subreddits, etc. 

Back in the day you wouldn’t come to this sub without knowing what options are in the first place, so it’s just weird to see people complaining that nobody will teach them (when it’s what this sub is built off of)."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,People post these explanations frequently. I see one about every day make the front page when it isn't flooded with GME posts.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Explain women huh... well if you have one you better hope gme hits the moon or you’ll be broke forever.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's easy.

1. Be handsome and fit.
2. Be rich.
3. Don't be a dick, but have a nice one.
4. Prepare to be disappointed anyway."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Just like you but less banana and more peach.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh jesus christ..

no seriously, Jesus, can you come here for a second, this ape has a question none of us can answer. 

What do you mean you lost the instructions? 

Well then how are we...what? 

what do you mean ""wing it""? 

The king of kings said to wing it."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Indeed

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"For real though.  I'm trying to understand the greeks and it's .. well, japanese to me."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"From my understanding, the only time you want to exercise it before expiration would be if there was a dividend you wanted to lock in worth more than the Theta/IV left in it."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you still hold the option when it expires and it is ITM, then it automatically exercises.  If you don't have enough cash in your account to pay for the stocks, then you go negative and get margin called and the stocks get automatically sold until you're out of hole."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,OP answered it correct but also depending on who you’re trading with many of them will try to sell your option contract before expiration of you don’t have the money to cover.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Depends on your broker and what rules they use.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'll do puts later.  Maybe tomorrow, but not today."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This please, OP. I would venmo you ones of dollars for a whole series of posts walking us poor apes through these concepts."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea fr they are going to be complaining about that until they find out to actually take profit
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You did the right thing, no one can predict the top, and no one will call you a fool for taking profits. The stock could have just as easily slipped back down and become worthless. 

What happened here and why it became do valuable so quickly, even if you were nowhere near the money is that since they ran hot and we're swinging quickly, more people started buying options. This increased the Vega and implied volitility. Those helped multiply the value of the contract. Now the hard lesson a lot of people learn is when IV dries up, and even if a stock is creeping up, the value of an option can continue to drop, even if it is in the money. When buying an option, always look at the IV and make sure you know what you are getting into. The lower the better, but some high volitility stocks will always have higher IV. A lot of people might buy options on the earnings week and hope for a big boost after earnings, then when the earnings are meh, IV may fall flat and that option will deflate."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Whats the difference between calls and covered calls? Didn't OP say options are calls?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If your contract is ITM, how does the selling process work? 

For example, GME $400c 03/19. GME goes up to $450. 

If exercised and immediately sold the stonk, I make $5,000, but if sold contract, do I still make $5,000?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Too many words.  All in GME 3/19 800c :)
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe it takes a couple days. Most people don't exercise the the calls and typically sell the contract before or at expiration. I believe only 10-20% exercise. Usually the it is worth more to sell the contract because they hold extrinsic value until the date of expiration.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you know how much you paid for an option (which you should be able to figure out because the above shows you how to calculate price), and you know how much you are selling your option for, then you know your profit.

Ex:  You bought an option for $200 ($2/share), and you sell the contract for $1200 because you're in the money.  That means you made $1000 profit. 

The pricing of the option is done by a complex equation that factors in price, theta, and IV.  You don't get to set your own price any more than you get to set the price of your GME share; the amount you can sell it for is based on the amount the market has decided it is worth."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's how I taught myself back in the day, but the fact that you can't open a thread without someone asking what $550c means means that apparently most people aren't doing it themselves."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You sell it on the market the same way you bought it.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m a simple ape but maybe don’t buy a call if you can’t afford the rest of the contract? You’re agreeing on a price beforehand. You know how much it’ll cost. Why agree to purchase something you know you can’t afford? 

You’d be better off buying 50 shares at market value that day if you think it’s going to be higher in the future."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Someone would gladly buy it because 100 calls would be 10,000 shares. Remember 1 call is 100 shares. As for your actual question, I'm curious too. Presumably people who are buying calls think that the price is going to go higher...?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"And yes, naturally, I speak of GME. Sorry everyone. I'm on the hype train."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, unless you have enough money to buy those shares."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If a call is OTM by expiration date it will expire and you’ll lose the option to buy the stock at the strike price. That means it expires worthless. Think of it as a buying condition. By “X” date the stock price must be equal or greater than the strike price to even have the option to exercise. If it fails to meet those conditions it just expires worthless and the trader who bought the call is just out the premium they paid for the contract. 

If a call is OTM, you’re hoping it will become ITM at some point by expiration date. It only expires worthless if it’s OTM by the expiration date.(Which I believe means you have up until market close on your expiration date, though I’m not 100% sure on that.)

If it’s ITM then you can either sell the contract or exercise your option to buy the stocks for the strike price. What you want to do and how much profit you’ll make is dependent on the factors OP explained."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This community as a whole has fallen since the GME thing. I never thought we’d have to explain fucking options on here
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,People were saying the same thing 145 days ago
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So if the stock goes down to 50 cents, no one wants the “dibs” and I’m out what I paid the guy to hold it. So I’m essentially paying someone to hold on to the box, and hoping that the box will rise in value. Is that right? 

So the guy who paid 90k, he paid 90k in premiums? He paid 90k for the owner to hold on to the box?

Edit: even if the box drops to 50 cents, can’t I still buy the box to salvage at least some of my money?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"no, you cant lose more than you put in. this is actually why institutions use options (not for yolo’ing their client’s money). your risk is fixed. the absolute most you can lose is the premium you paid."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also a good website to see potential profits is optionsprofitcalculator . com

You can choose stonk/date/strike and put in price ranges.  Itll pull up a chart.  Also a tab underneath chart thatll show different results ie... profut/loss potential, risk % ..etc..."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"In this scenario the contract you paid for expired worthless. Your max loss is the price you paid per premium x’s 100. 

Ex: you paid $1 for that $400 call but it’s now 350. It’s OTM and rendered worthless but you still paid $1 for each x’s 100. 

In that case $100 is your total loss."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The market maker will buy it and seek to offset by selling off the same position to someone else.  It's pretty similar to what market makers do when you buy/sell a stock.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You have the option to buy 100 shares for $400/share, which would cost $40,000.  In order to get that option, you pay a premium."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Most people generally just trade the calls to profit off the premium going up. I've never had the intentions or money to exercise and of the options I've traded.

For the second question technically the premium would eat into your profits because that's the amount you paid to be able to exercise the contract. 

Say you paid 200 dollars for a call with a strike price of $10 and now the stock is trading at $20. You would've paid $200 for the right to buy 100 shares for $1000 ($10x100) which you could then sell for $2000 ($20x100) so your profit would the difference minus the premium you paid so in this situation $2000-$1000 = $1000-200 =$800"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you sell a call, then yes, someone can exercise on you.  If you sell a covered call, which means you own 100 shares, then it isn't a big deal because they'll just buy the shares you already own.  if you sell a naked call, which means you don't own 100 shares of the stock you are selling the call for, you can get proper fucked."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,when the imposter is sus!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is a bet of sorts, since it’s time-limited and you lose all your money if you bet wrong. But the potential profit is just a function of the strike price, premium, and share price. If NUT hits $15 at expiry it means you’re able to buy 100 shares at $10 from a call option. So you’re set up to get in at $5 profit per share. Of course, you have to factor in the premium ($2/share), so here your net NUT profit is $3 share at 100 shares per call. $300."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also who sells call contract shares, the broker or the hedge funds to the broker?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Reddit has a new paid team called **Anti-Evil Operations** which goes around permanently banning accounts for saying bad words.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The bid and the ask will change according to the stock price. If you buy a call and the price goes up your contract will go up and you can just sell it for a profit. Your potential for profit is unlimited.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Only if you let them expire in the money
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Realistically there is really no reason to ever exercise an option rather then just selling it. Watch some YouTube videos or some shit I’m not going to explain intrinsic and extrinsic value and how they relate to options.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"40% of biology students who graduate from Ivy League schools end up going into finance. I think the reason why they hire people with that degree is that they know a) no one is actually fucking *studying* finance in undergrad anyways so all that matters is you're willing to learn later, b) biology majors are clearly willing to read and read and read, and c) they're used to doing it with significantly less cocaine involved so that's a real bargain."

That's Canadian Dollars by the way, so that's US$37k to US$77k in a city where you will spend $1700-$2000 on rent for a one bedroom apartment and a [house starts at about CA$1 million-1.5 million](https://www.straight.com/news/vancouver-real-estate-detached-homes-priced-below-15-million-benchmark-show-some-affordability) for something that doesn't need work."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is where the IV and theta decay come into play. If your contract is ITM but still has weeks to expire, and the stock is highly volatile, your option may sell for even more than $5k since the IV suggests the stock can continue to climb in value, making the contract worth more as well. If your contract expires in an hour and the stock is ITM but seems to be trending downward, your contract may be worth less than $5k."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Here I’ll give you a real example. Bought a 65c 3/12 on Friday last week for DKNG (Draft Kings) for .80. It cost me $80. DKNG shot up and ended the week at $71. I was $6 in the money. But on Thursday that contrast was selling for $8.00. So selling it would have net me $800 rather than waiting it out and seeing if it keeps going up.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,ITM is when the strike price is met. This doesn’t always happen. And no you don’t have to exercise a contract. You can sell it to someone else or just hold it until it expires. So if you had a 3/12 contract and it never got ITM you likely had to hold it to expire. Now it’s worth nothing.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you have an deep ITM call near expiration it’s worth more sold. Example, I had a DKNG 65c. DKNG was worth 71 on Thursday and the contract ended Friday. If I exercised I’d get $6 per share. But selling the call was worth $8 a share because it had a day left to grow."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Edited this out because I mathed wrong. Your 5k is correct if you subtract your premium from it. The premium was the cost for the lotto ticket but you get it back if it goes ITM.

In a simple call explanation...

Buy $10c 2/19 for .17 is .17x100 so $17 lotto ticket. This means $10 strike target by 2/19 that costs you .17 per share (100). Your target is not actually $10 it is 10.17 because premium and I believe theta and all that will make it a little higher so just say 10.30 by expiration.

stock is $8 x 100 you imaginary own 100 now before the expiry date it hits $12 you either take the 100 for $1000 because you strike at 10 and immediately sell for $1000 plus $200 because 2 over strike x 100 or if you don’t have $1000 to do that you just sell the contract for 150 or whatever the offer on sell is. 

If it’s under your strike + premium = 10.17 + bullshit numbers. You just lose your $17 and move on.

There’s a lot of bullshit metrics that change the price though and they vary on a lot of factors so the numbers are rough estimates.

Fidelity has a profit loss calculator in active trader pro that lets you setup similated options if you want to experiment.

Edit: why is automod Meme mode on my comment haha feel free to reply if I goofed anything and I’ll correct it!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok thanks. So the price you’re able to sell it for will just pop up on whatever platform you’re using? I got it. Thanks a lot for this. I’m in no intelligent condition to play with options anytime soon, but I’ve been trying to learn about them. Thanks man"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Most people who trade options don't actually exercise them though.. The profits come from the time value left on the contract/volatile and some other factors otherwise known as extrinsic value as he mentioned.

 The reason you would buy it without being able to afford the contract is because you have no intention in exercising it and can't be forced to and essentially get to make the profit that 100 shares would make with only risking the cost of the contract. Does that make sense? 

You absolutely would be better off buying and selling a call than simply buying the shares due to the extrinsic value of the option.

Edit: just to add a bit more clarity, you aren't agreeing to purchase anything, you are buying the RIGHT to purchase the shares at a certain price."

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok that makes more sense. So in OPs explanation, the $2 premium per stock (so $200 for 100 stocks) is paid up front and not when you decide to exercise a call option?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. He gets the good end of the deal if you don't exercise or sell the box at a loss. Part of the contract is that on expiration if you don't buy the shares (exercise the contract) or sell the box to someone else then you lose the money you paid him to hold it.

That's what people selling contracts hope for. They hope it'll go down and you won't be able to sell it to someone else. They keep your dibs money and still own the shares. Selling contracts can be a regular source of income. It's less money than buying the calls if it goes up, but it's something"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Just added a new brain wrinkle. Thank you.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here is what I still don't understand. I know options traders almost never exercise, but rather buy and sell the options themselves and pocket the difference. 

So, you are an options trader, you buy a call option, stock price goes above strike price, you are ITM, you sell and pocket the difference 3 days before expiration . 

Question is, who the fuck buys when you sell ? why would someone want to buy options just to exercise when they can just just buy the stock? given the fact that the option now only has intrinsic value and almost no extrinsic value.

I keep hearing that options traders almost never exercise but somebody has to be exercising those call options with intrinsic value. Question is, who and why?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought an option where the premium went up 6x the value that I purchased it at, but I held to near expiration because I didn't understand lol. I see that if I exercised at that point, it would have only been a gain of around 61%, but if I had sold the call option it would have been a gain of 400%+. That extra value in the premium must have been IV and time remaining on the option then? That is a big difference in profit."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Selling a call is not the same as buying an existing call option and then reselling it, though, correct? Like if you buy a call and then sell it before expiry for a profit, if the buyer chooses to exercise, you’re not on the hook for providing those shares because you didn’t write the original option, right?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Break even Price..I didn’t go wit the dollar call symbol like 15c or 15.5c cos sometimes it could be a $15 call but the break even price could be $30 depending on the algorithm

Banks and brokerage firms DO NOT GIVE A SHIT WHAT YOUR DEGREE IS IN. All they want to know is if you can sell. The whole world revolves around selling goods and services. If you can talk people into investing money with your firm, that’s all they care about. They also don’t care where you went to school either. The only time the degree and school might matter is some non sales jobs. Those are the ones at the home office. The cubicle jobs. Stuff like that. Unless you’re lucky and get into the investment banking level literally on Wall Street and even then, not all of those guys and gals had cookie cutter degrees.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"How do you determine best time to sell contract? 

If lot of time remaining and stock volatile, then it would decrease in value as expiration date nears right? Or is their a peak that could be reached if you're already ITM early in the contract?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Who/what determines the price of the contract at any given point after you buy it? Is there an internal algorithm that calculates IV and theta decay into the price?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Where did the $8.00 come from? You paid $0.80 per share for 100 shares to buy the contract. So it cost you $80. At that moment, before the price of DKNG changed, what was the value of the contract?

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"When you sell your contract, who do you sell it to? Your brokerage, who then sells it to someone else? Or does someone else have to actually buy it?

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I meant: when the contract exceeds the strike price, then one would ideally at some point sell the contract to make a profit. Suppose the stock stays above the strike price until the expiration day, then all the owners of the contract will keep selling it it around, but there has to be a final person that exercises it, right?"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good question. Let's look at a hypothetical

Transaction 1 : 

Person A 🐒 sells to open (short call) the call to you🦍


You 🦍buy to open (long call) the option. 


The guy who sold to open is person A🐒



Transaction 2:


The stock has gone up and you want to cash out. You🦍 sell to close your option. You🦍 close your long position. The end.


Person B🦧 buys the call from you, buying to open their own position. 


If person B, 🦧the new bagholder, wants to exercise the call option, the person who has to sell the 100 shares at the strike price is still person A.🐒

I hope this makes sense


Also, alternatively, person A could buy the call back to buy to close his short call. If the option price has gone up, he loses. If the option price decreased, he can buy it back for cheaper, close out his short call, and profit on the difference."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you write the options contract, then you’re on the hook to deliver the shares if someone exercised it. Writing an option means you created the contract. 

If you BOUGHT the options contract in the first place, and then sold it back to the open market, then no—you’re not on the hook for delivering shares, because you’re not the one who create the contract."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think it works like this... Could be wrong, learning too. 

Albert has 100 shares of X and sells 1 call option for 5$. Since Albert owns the shares, this is a covered call. 

Berry buys the contact for 500$ (5$x100). With like 5 days on the clock. Goes ITM, looks attractive to whales looking to buy. 

Carl is a whale. Carl buys the call from Berry for 1000$. (Berry sells the call for 10$ premium). Carl decides to exercise cause he likes the stock or whatever. 

Since Albert started this whole mess, the shares would come from him. Berry was the middle man, just holding the contract until it rose in price and a willing buyer took it off their hands. 

This might be too simple to be right. I'm sure there is way more too it, but I don't think the middle guy buying and selling contracts are on the hook unless they exercise. I think the original seller is on the hook no matter how many times the call contract changes hands before it expires or is exercised."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,If you simply sell the contract without exercising it whatever happens after that has nothing to do with you. It would be whoever wrote the contract as far as I know.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just started playing with calls. I’m not ready for puts yet, but I’ve made some decent gains and some horrid losses in the two weeks I’ve been playing them. The swings can be awesome and dreadful within the same hour. It’s super high risk, but a hell of a drug. Reminds me of playing no limit with 4 people in the pot and being the small blind."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. Otherwise the person selling the Call in the first place (the person who ultimately would have to provide the 100 shares) has zero incentive to ever do so (it would only ever be risk with no potential profit for them).
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Often, ITM options are bought by market makers and used to offset positions.  Let's say you bought an option from A for $200.  You then sold the option to the market maker at a profit.  At some point, the market maker sold an option for $200 to C.  Now, the market maker owns an option to buy stock for $200 and an obligation to sell stock for $200.  The offset and effectively closes the market's position.  Instead, now when C exercises, the shares effectively come from A.

This is done over and over again in increasingly convoluted ways to offset options so that by the time exercising happens, the people who want to buy the stocks are the ones who end up with the options.  

Now let's say that the market gets stuck with ITM options for stock that it doesn't really want.  In that case, they'll  exercise the option themselves and then immediately sell the stock that they didn't really want in the first place."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Because it gives them the right to buy the stock at a price that's lower than the current price but they can sell whenever they want. Obviously they would think the price is going to keep going up because yes there are times when the profit they could sell the shares for would be the same as the premium they paid for the option and in that case there wouldn't be a point.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct.  Since this has been received well, I'll likely do a couple more, and will talk about selling your own calls in one of them."

I love tricking myself."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"(You might not be talking about selling calls, but I'll tell you what's up anyways.) ""Naked"" usually refers to selling options (opening a short position). I guess technically buying an option is also ""naked"", but people don't usually say that. Whenever someone buys a call option, someone else is on the other end of the trade selling it to them. If you sell a call, you collect premium while giving someone else the option to buy 100 shares at the strike price. If you own 100 shares of the stock, then your call is covered; if you don't then it's naked. You can also technically ""cover"" a sold call by also buying a call at a different strike price to make it into a ""vertical spread"".

Selling naked calls is an especially bad idea if you're a smooth-brained 🦍 because it essentially has infinite risk. Imagine a few weeks back when GME was trading at $60.  Pretend you decided to sell a $100 call expiring on 3/12 because you thought GME was NOT gonna go up (we're playing pretend, remember). Well, GME went up over 160 points past your strike price of 100, so now your call that you sold has gone up (100 shares x 160 points =)$16,000 worth up value. So if you didn't close it and let it expire In The Money (ITM), you're forced to sell 100 shares of GME that you don't have. Your broker will take care of that part for you, but you stoll got fucked in the ass to the tune of 16 grand that you probably don't even have.

If you just see a big loss in general, it's usually people buying OTM calls or puts that expire worthless, though.>"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Possibly, but without knowing what post you’re talking about they more likely bought calls. If you use calls speculatively, they *are* high risk. Sure, your risk is limited to the premium, but it’s all-or-nothing. You either profit big, or you lose the money you put on the table *very quickly.* Lambo or food stamps."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not necessarily. They could have just bought a fuckton of contracts that expired worthless.

Was it 20 k ---> -100k? You'll know someone was effing around with naked calls and puts when they post their loss porn of an account with 7k in it going to -170k.

I wouldn't recommend it"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"There’s a buy side and a sell side.

Buy side — your risk is limited to the premium paid, i.e. price of the contract. If it expires worthless, that’s all you lose.

Sell side — you risk the asset used to secure the contract. Be it cash, shares or otherwise. If you don’t secure the option (selling naked) it’s theoretically an infinite loss potential scenario."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this IS a casino 🦍🍌"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buying only costs the premium. Selling naked costs you unlimited if the price gets high. You sell a $400 naked call on GME and get paid $10000 for the contract. Feels good. But oh no GME squeezes and is at $800. They exercise and pay you $400,000 for the stock. You have to go buy them 100 shares so you spend $800,000. So you lost $399,000."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct. Just in comparison to normal stocks. Regular Call options look high risk. However, you’ll only ever lose the premium and nothing more. Which isn’t as bad as some other options strategies where you can lose theoretically infinite money"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes BUT you lose a lot of money when many call options together or one after one goes down

Also the premium can be very significant"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's a lot more risky than just buying a stock, because with a call the possibilities are make some money or lose it all. You can't just lose a little bit of money, you lose all of it every time your ""bet"" is wrong."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Compared to just buying regular shares, calls are still very high-risk. 

You're correct that you can ""only"" lose your premium. But that's still much worse than if you just bought the stock itself. Options have an expiration date, shares do not. If you buy 10,000 dollars of shares, and then price dips 10%, you've ""lost"" 1000 dollars, but you can always just wait patiently and hope it goes back up before you sell.

If you buy 10,000 dollars of call options expiring next week, and the price doesn't recover quickly, you'll lose all of your money. 

Keep in mind that most (like 99%) of options traders have no intention of exercising their option if they end up ITM. They don't actually want the stock. They just trade the options themselves. So if a trader has $10,000 to blow, and 1 call option (just for example) gives someone the right to buy $10,000 worth of shares, for a $50 premium, that trader isn't going to just pay that $50 and then sit and wait for the call to be in the money. 

 Instead, they're going to buy $10,000/$50 = 200 call options. Which, technically, means they have the right to buy $2,000,000 worth of stock. But they don't have $2,000,000, and they don't want the stock anyway. They just want to wait until the price of the premium for their 200 contracts increases, and then they sell them to someone else, who will probably do the same thing, and then it goes on and on."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. But the premium can be thousands if you yolo your whole portfolio into one play, and it either pays off or you lose it all. 

So buying calls is not as risky as, say, shorting a stock, but it is still an “at least break even or lose it all” kind of game. 

With stocks, even if they tank in value, you can still recover *something* from your initial investment."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QO2uSjMEcfo
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Basic calls, yes. Covered calls are a bit different, there are more risks associated than just your premium (could be wrong on this)"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Naked calls means you sold a call without owning any stock.  So if it reaches the strike price and gets exercised you have to go buy 100 shares for whatever the price now is but only get paid the price you sold them at. You can lose unlimited money this way.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"As somebody who works in fields where nobody ever gave a fuck about safety and people have gotten killed I say they are bullshit jobs. Right now we use extremely sketchy tools and we have tons of safety members. They are there to quickly fudge paperwork and shit when they’re amongst a lawsuit from injury. They don’t improve anything. We have had forklifts not properly grounded that shock the shit out of you for years.

Edit: fuck seven years ago I worked somewhere where a large machine upstairs fell through the floor and crushed an employee. He reported the machine knocking the ceiling so hard debris fell on him for a year straight and they kept saying it was fine. One day the fucker hit it’s last shake and within a blink I heard a man die that warned them for over a year that the ceiling was weakening but our “quality and engineering team” constantly reassured him it was fine. They didn’t want to shut production down for a few weeks to repair the structure on the second floor is reality. That million they paid his family is cheaper than six weeks of no production. Our life is not valued by corporations don’t let them fool you."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Y’all got safety people?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Not saying I agree with it but that’s not how the world views it
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Never said it was bad. Op has a masters and like ten years experience and makes less than half of what actual morons I know make. Just seems a little ripped off.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a high school history teacher, can confirm."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Jesus. Subs in the states is barely more than retail and not as much as waiting tables.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm also in Canada, and I know teachers here, and you're forgetting that their work isn't limited to 8 hours - they also do things like marking homework and creating lesson plans outside of those hours.

Yes, benefits (and probably pensions now that you make me think about that) are ok and worth mentioning, but the salaries still suck when you consider the cost of living here.

At $47k starting out you're spending between one third and half your income on rent in Vancouver and even the most experienced at $97k wouldn't qualify for a mortgage on a house based on rough calculations here: https://www.ratehub.ca/mortgage-payment-calculator"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depends on your level of risk (greed). Generally, theta grows exponentially closer to exp date. I don't know the exact math, but the further out you are the theta decay is inconsequential, however, the week of expiring things ramp up quick and the contract can evaporate especially during the last 3 days. Good rule of thumb for beginners, if the contract is worthy enough to screenshot, just sell.

But let's face it, having an ITM option 3 days out from expiring betting on more IV to kick in is the heart of WSB retardism."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ultimately, the price is determined the same way stocks are: supply and demand. Every time you buy or sell, whether it’s shares or options, someone is on the other side of that trade. IV and theta decay are really great things to watch to determine whether or not you want to buy contracts, but shares or contracts are only worth what someone is willing to buy.


Researching bid/ask spreads is important as well. I’m still learning all this as well, but a bid/ask spread will indicate the ease or difficulty of selling a contract."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So when you buy a call contract you now own that contract. It is yours. That contract constantly changes price because other people buy them too. When I bought the .80 65c 3/12 someone sold that to me and got the $80 from me. 

Now as time goes on the value of the contract changes. If the stock goes up it goes up too. The amount it goes up varies but once it changes from OTM to ITM is the biggest jump. So as DKNG went up my contract’s value went up until that Thursday when it hit $8.00. Because again people buy those contracts. So I could sell the 65c I had for the next day for $8.00 a share or $800. 

Option contracts constantly change and a lot of factors go into it. The simple answer is stock go up, option sell value go up. Stock stay the same option value goes down. Stock goes down option value goes down a lot."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You sell it to whoever buys it. Most contracts can be sold unless you held onto a failing one too long. Usually someone will grab it but as it gets closer to expiring and more OTM the more likely it is nobody wants it.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"An *option* buyer is not required to exercise their option, and often won't if the difference is <$0.05 from the strike or so.

Most brokers will automatically have you exercise your options if they're ITM (you may have to call yours if you don't want it to mark it do not exercise).

You have the option (but not the obligation) to exercise at any given point in time. (European style options (mostly traded on indexes and such) are slightly different in that you only have the option to exercise at expiration.)"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Roger roger 👌🏻
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I edited it a bit for you. Doing this while I was driving so I may have goofed. Definitely reply if you need clarification, I’ll run you a simulated buy call later if you’d like."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re correct I am stupid. I did $40 because I never do any call on a $400 strike haha

So yes the 50k - 45k gives you 5k but you have your premium which on a quick flip gme bet can be fairly high. Say it’s $17 a share so you pay $1700 for the contract. This means the 5k - that 1700 will be your profit if you were to buy the 100 shares and sell. Or you could just sell the contract for usually a little less."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I held a Tuesday night poker game at my house for like 7 years; tournament style... I know what you mean there 😂
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you so much for answering this.

So, effectively, when you sell call options near expiration, usually its the market makers who are buying, correct ?

Doesn't that mean market makers are taking a risk here since the call option would have its intrinsic value priced in + option primum + whatever small extrinsic value it still has.

If the stock doesn't go up (or goes down). and the market maker ends up exercising the option, they will be losing money.

Am I missing something here ?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You have done an excellent job at wasting my time.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Dope! Thanks for the clarification. That’s the one part I was unclear on.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hmmm ok. What determines the current value of the contract?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hmm ok. What determines that worth?

Trying to start a business with $10,000 to $100,000 sounds like a fools errand when similar gains can be made with sound investments in the stock market. 

Why work when I can make more money with money? It’s getting that seed money is the key to success."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"How about in this situation: I buy a call for next Friday. Its otm now but next wednesday it rises enough to be itm. Can I just sell the option itself for the difference of the premium and pocket that or do I HAVE to buy and then sell the shares? And if I can just resell the option I bought, is it still the original writer who needs to sell the shares if it's exercised  or is it now me who needs to have the shares to cover if the person I sell to decides to cover?

I hope that makes sense."

That's kind of overstating it though. I got GME 0.20 $800c 19/3 about 3 weeks ago - so that's $20 per option. 

If $20 is what's putting you into food stamps then you're probably... actually... nevermind, you're probably a regular here."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Which is why Ken Griffin is sweating fucking bullets right now
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Selling naked calls is an infinite loss potential scenario. The worst case selling puts is that you have to buy worthless shares for the strike price

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Using the same scenario if my call for $750 by May 15 doesn't happen I don't have to buy the call i just have to pay the fees associated with placing the calls which is a couple bucks?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Please correct me if I'm For example if I bought a $700 call for GME for a total of 100 shares in which the call expires on May 15 and GME hits $1,000 I make money if I sell the option or buy the option correct?

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Covered calls are only for selling calls. It’s called covered because it means you already own the 100 shares of the stock. So even if the price shoots up youre not screwed because you have 100 shares ready to sell. You’re just selling them for less Rh an you could have.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh I see it's the other end of contract, selling a contract but not owning the shares.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"own 100 shares. sell a call (using the 100 shares as collateral) at a by a date you pick at a strike price you won't think will be hit.

if the contract expires worthless, you keep the premium you gained from selling the call as well as the shares"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Absolutely but his post didn’t go deep enough into theta gang to clarify that. I always use a calculator if looking at a buy call so I know my targets day by day.

That process didn't start for me until late 30's and then accelerated hard ... I'm sure it's different for everyone but you'll hear older comedians talking about it.

You gotta have a balance man, lot of stuff is better when you're young but there is no perfect path in life ... our brains are literally wired to the same level of happiness almost no matter what. It's the variance from that baseline that makes you happy or sad for a short time, not the baseline itself. So you can win a million, be happy for a bit, but now not having a million would make you sad .. and having a million doesn't make you happy anymore because you have it.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Two years ago I was broke as hell and got a speeding ticket out of the county I was living in. They offered me to either pay it up front (about $200) or pay it in monthly installments over the next six months. They were unclear about the fact that even if I paid the first installment on time, I would be charged a $150 fee for not having paid it all upfront. In fact, I would say they misled me into believing that the fee was only if I didn’t pay the first installment on time.

I pay the first fee, I check that it goes through a month later, and I see the $150 added to my total cost. I call to ask, and “that’s just the system, it’s how it works”

 “Well, can it be waived? Obviously I’m paying it in installments because I can’t afford to front that much money all at once right now. Why should the punishment for being poor be to owe more than half of the original ticket on top of the ticket price”

 “That’s just the way it is.”

“Okay. Then why offer the option to pay it in installments at all unless the intent is to extort more money from the people who already can’t afford to do anything about it”

“Because that’s the law.”

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Somehow this left me more confused and I wrote the original comment
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You normally sell the option a lil bit lower price from the buyers to make some little profit

So gme is at 300

Your call is at a strike price of 200 for Monday 15/03

Then you have the right to buy 100 shares for 200 (spend 20k) but make an instant profit of 10k when selling at 300.

So if you dont have the initial 20k you can re sell the option at lets say 290 per share (29k) so when the other person that does have the funds exercise the call they can profit at least 1k for easy money (actually 1k I thinks its a lot, and as OP said the value close to th date depends on a lot of variables)

For your question: if you sould the option you are out of it forever, you dont have any obligation with the stock, so the original seller still has the obligation"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but that’s about the same as scooping up lottery tickets. Any dirt-cheap calls of that magnitude are cheap because they’ll almost assuredly expire worthless.  

I’m sure a lot of folks here are looking at similar hail-Mary’s because they see astronomical gain porn posts off of GME calls, when options are the quickest way to go broke."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Keep buying calls looking for the next big win and the losses will add up. That was my point.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I did didn’t I. Well the point remains.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Papertrade my man till you figure it out. There are lots of places to get simulation accounts including investopedia.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"A couple bucks per share, in bundles of 100 shares per contract. 

So if the call that you’re looking at has a $2 premium, you’re paying $200 per contract to play the game. 

Now multiply that by 100 contracts and things start to get gambly in a hurry... AKA you’d better be right, or your wife’s boyfriend is going to be annoyed that you lost his pocket change again!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"A couple of terms that you might be misusing here:
You *buy* the contract for the premium price * $100. So if it has a $2 premium, you give the person who wrote the contract $200.

If you bought a contract like you described, 700c 5/15, and the share price hits $1000 per share some time between now and May 15, you can *exercise* the contract and pay $700 per share to own them all. But as you noted, you need you need $70,000 in cash to do this. 

So your other option is to *sell* the contract on to someone else. It’s worth the difference between the current share price ($1000) minus the strike price ($700), multiplied by the number of shares (100), plus or minus some amount that factors in the Implied Volatility and how far we are from expiration. This extra bit approaches $0 as we get closer to the expiration date. So you’d sell the contract and get $30,000-ish for it. 

So, if you put down $200 on a bet that STONK would go to more than $702 per share, and it does, you get big money. But if it doesn’t, the value of that contract gets lower as we approach expiration (the only value that the contract has while it’s out of the money is based on the chances that it will go into the money, so more time = worth more, and more volatility in the share price = worth more). Once we’re at the end of the trading day on which the contract expires, if you haven’t exercised or sold the contract, it expires worthless and you lost $200. 

Hopefully that helps. If you want me to clarify anything, let me know :-)"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right, now talk about what happens if the price drops precipitously. 

There is also the risk that your option gets exercised and you lose the 100 shares if you are actually bullish on the stock. The hope with selling a covered call is that the option expires OTM and you get to keep the 100 shares and the premium. If you want to keep the underlying stock regardless of price action through expiry, a covered call might not be the move for you. Incurring the additional risk of losing your 100 shares in addition to having a capped max profit is not nothing"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep. Never do it ever. You can get screwed. Like lose your house screwed.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Know how HFs can lose a bunch of money if GME gets super high because they have to buy the stock even if it moons?  Naked calls make you in the same position.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"And only do this if you don't mind that the stock gets called away. This may seem obvious but trust me the first time it's going to suck. Personally I hate covered calls because of this as I like to keep owning the stocks, but I love selling puts and they usually give more premium anyways."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don’t think this is what always happens. A lot of research went into finding out that DKNG was worth it. And many times you end up selling your option at a loss or only a small gain. You try to sell at the smallest loss and biggest gain. 

Another thing with options is someone has to buy them. If a contract goes bad you can be stuck with it. I bought a GE 3/19 15c last week when the stock was worth 14.50 for .28. GE drilled on the back of bad news to 12.50. My contract was down to .04 in a day. I have tried to sell that contract multiple times and can’t.  I’ll likely have to hold it to expire and have it be worthless unless GE somehow makes $2 over the week (it won’t)."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,When you sell a call you don’t choose when that contract is exercised the contract holder does. So I sell a GME call at $400. The contract owner has it. GME hits $500 but they think it has more potential so they hold. GME continues to go up and is now $1000. They decide to exercise. Now I owe them 100 shares and they only need to pay me $400 a share. I give them the 100 shares (hopefully I already had them so I’m not screwed and buying them for $1000 each). The contract is now complete. If GME goes up more it doesn’t matter. Once it’s exercised the contract no longer exists.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"When you buy an option that sell price is now tracked in real time for you. A lot goes into the value of the contract, how close is it to ITM, how soon does it expire, how often does the stock actually change price which direction and how much. 

But for you all you do is watch the contract sell price that you can sell the contract for. That’s the value because you don’t hold these to expire. You sell the contract for more than you bought it for ideally."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, you can set a sell limit price on your contract to see if anyone buys. You can see some call options show a ""price"" of $.49, but you look at the bid/ask and it's $.01/$1. So someone is trying to sell that for $1, but nobody is buying it at that price. You can't just sell at $.49 because the bid is only $.01."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes when you buy the contract you are making a deal with someone to sell you 100 shares of that stock at an agreed upon price. They’re betting the stock won’t hit that price you’re betting it will.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"They have that right yes. But when you’re dealing with options you don’t want to be that person. You want to buy the contract, let it go up then sell it."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah.

options holders have until 5:30 PM on Friday to decide whether to exercise or not (by default, you will auto-exercise if you're ITM), which is after when the options market closes, but after-hours trading is still in session."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. The call option will have a price bid ask just like a stock does. It is called a Premium. I don't know the formula for how it is decided but if you looked at an option chain you would see Strike $100 and last bid ask volume just like a normal stock. So strike $100 last .90 bid .87 ask .93 you would know people are wanting it for .87 x 100 so $87 and some are offering it for .93 x 100 $93. This $90 is your premium price to purchase the call. You lose this if your call does not go through. If your call succeeds you will get it back.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"EDIT: Nevermind I just saw your response to the other guy, I get it now. I didn't realize there was a difference between call and call contract. Thanks!

Am I understanding this correctly? I should own the shares first before selling a contract? In case of what happens in your scenario.

Here's where I'm a little confused, lets say (please forgive me i'm not using the terminology correctly):

1. I currently have 0 shares of GME; I buy a call on 3/12 for 100 shares of GME - 1 $2 GME $300c 3/19 for $200 (are number of shares not listed?)
2. Next day 3/13 the Share price goes up to 330 and premium goes up to $5

At this point lets say I sell the call and make $3 profit/share for a total of $500. Now lets say the share and premium go up the next day and the person I sold it to exercises it.

Do I owe him the 100 shares? Or does the guy I bought the call from owe him the 100 shares?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait so if you sell your call, you could potentially be expected to give away 100 shares to the person who bought your call? So does that mean to mitigate the risk (of needing to buy 100 shares at a much higher price if the person you sold to exercises) does everyone who sells call options buy 100 shares at the same time they buy their original call option?



I'm assuming almost no one actually buys 100 shares to mitigate their risk, but I mean... isn't that a huge amount of risk to assume the person you sell to won't exercise at a much higher share price?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So who sets the price of the contract? Is it  by the exchange where they apply a formula that takes in all those factors?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah I see. I guess that if you don't have enough money, you just cannot exercise it and loose it. It is correct to conclude that this gives an advantage to those with enough money to exercise the option when it approaches 5:30 PM on Friday of the expiration date ?   


Since those without enough funds do not plan to exercise it, it is like a hot potato. Maybe there are so many option traders with enough funds that this is not at all noticeable?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait. You purchase a call, what do you mean by it not going through? The seller now has the $90, they can lose it if your call succeeds? I'm super confused now 😄"

Similarly, if you're short a call and you close the position early then you're actually ""buying to close"", which is different than ""buying to open"" a long position.

That's where your confusion is coming from, since short and long positions make this shit confusing. I guess an easy way to think about it is that if you don't have an open position on an option, then there's no way you can get assigned or have your option exercised."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh, sure, now you ask questions that I don’t have answers for :-P

I *think* that the premium on a contract is the value that represents the odds of the contract going into the money before it expires. So, let’s pretend that STONK is trading for $40/share and is kind of volatile, maybe swinging $8 in an average day, and you’re thinking about a $50 call that expires in a month. Odds of that contract going ITM between now and a month out are high, so the premium is going to be high as well. Whoever is on the other side of the trade, the person who wrote the contract, is smart and doesn’t want to get screwed. They know that odds are good that the price will swing and they’ll be out $10/share, and so they price that in as the premium on the contract. 

Now, let’s look at another setup: STONK is trading for $20 / share, and you think you’ve found the next GME. Your research and due diligence (or your magic 8 ball) tells you that it’ll be trading at $100 / share in a month, but nobody else has figured that out yet, so volatility is low and even though time is kind of far out, the low volatility is the major factor in pricing the premium. You might be able to buy $50c contracts for pennies per share in premium, because the person writing them is thinking “yeah freaking right, these will never get executed, I’m perfectly safe”. And you’re thinking “this is a sweet deal! When this thing memes and goes to $100, I’ll walk away with $5,000 in profit and it only cost me $5 to buy the option!!”

Ok, so let’s play the second scenario a little further. You bought the contracts on March 15, we’ll call them $0.25 $50c 5/28. The seller thinks they got a sweet deal and made $25 in premium for a contract that will expire worthless. You think that you’re the smartest ape in the troop because you know STONK is gonna pop in May, and it only cost you $25 to get into position. 

Now, maybe in mid April, things start getting exciting. Some crayon-eating chucklefuck on WSB figures out the same thing that you did, tells all the other apes, and prices start to rise, stabilizing around $40. People who have held the stock as part of their well diversified long term boomer portfolio see it increasing in value for no reason and think that now is a great time to lock in some profits and go buy a new set of golf clubs or some shit (what do boomers do with money, anyway??). So they sell, the stock drops a bit, WSB tards buy the dip, and boom: You have some volatility. This stock is alive and kicking and volatile and your options option contract is near its strike price. Still not in the money, but we’re close!

What would you sell that contract for? It’s not worth anything from an “I can buy STONK at a discount” perspective, because you’re not yet ITM. If you hold onto it for another week or three, it probably will be, though. But guess what? It’s worth more than the a $0.25 (per share) that you paid for it. It’s probably worth more like $5 per share because it’s close to its strike price, the share price is volatile, and you’ve got a lot of time before it expires. So if you decided that you need the money because your wife’s boyfriend is demanding that you pay for cleaning after you spilled orange soda in his lambo, you could sell your $0.25 / share contract for $5 / share and buy a heckin good upholstery cleaner. Or maybe you just lost faith in the company, realized you forgot to carry the 1 when doing your DD and STONK is probably going to top out at $40, whatever, you can sell that contract that cost you $25 to some ape for $500 and walk away with a tidy profit. Paper hands schmaper hands, you’re $475 richer than you were when you bought the contract. Lookit that, you made profit AND got a new wrinkle on your cranium!! Now get out of WSB, because we don’t do either of those things here. 

Now, maybe I’m the ape who buys that contract. I know for sure that STONK is going to moon, and so paying $500 total for a contract that’s going to be worth $everything is a steal of a deal. Remember, of course, that the only value the contract has while it’s OTM is in its premium, and that premium is worth more when the stock is volatile and when we’re far from expiration. 

So, Diamond Hands that I am, I hold onto the contract and wait for STONK to cross that magic $55 / share line ($5 premium + $50 strike price, so I’ve gotta see $55 to profit). But it plateaus at $40 and just trades sideways for a few weeks. 

It’s Monday, May 24. Everyone is comfortable with STONK’s new value, and the volatility is mostly gone, so premiums on new contracts are down, because the contract writers are smart and are 98% sure that $50c expiring at the end of the week won’t be in the money, so they’re writing them with $1/share premium. 

Guess what my $5/share contract is worth now? Yup. $1 * 100 shares. And by Wednesday it’s really obvious that there’s no way this lifeless $40 stock is going anywhere, so you can get the contracts for $0.50/share. Oops, I’m bleeding money, but I truly belong here and hold anyway. And on Friday STONK is just kinda plodding along like a sloth that got into the indica, stuck at $40, and my option contract expires worthless. The only thing I’ve got going for me is a few updoots on my loss porn post, so I wander out to the garage to find a $ROPE. 

——

Wow! What a ride!

Anyway, hopefully that helps you understand how premium prices are determined, why they’re so volatile, why they drop fast as expiration date approaches, etc. 

Or maybe I just confused you. Either way, you win!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Well if you sell them and the contract never hits the strike price free money. The contract expires worthless and you’re good. But again dont do it.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah you were being a whiny lil bitch but that’s alright I was too my wife and I both had fucked childhoods. We big chillin now
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep that’s it. The nice thing about buying calls is you can only lose at most the premium you paid. So just a $28 loss. Nothing more.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"First do not buy a call contract on GME. It’s too volatile and the contracts are way too expensive. There’s a lot of complex math that I won’t get into but just trust me options are not for the meme stocks. 

Calls don’t say how many shares because all options are sold in groups of 100. So 1 option contract is for 100 shares. 2 contracts for 200 and so on. 

In your example only the person who wrote the initial contract is on the hook for the 100 shares. You bought the right to buy 100 shares from that person. When you sell the contract you are selling the right to buy those 100 shares from the original person. At that point you’re done."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So to clarify. 

Selling the call contract you buy is different then selling a call. 

Selling a call means you are selling someone a contract with the a right to buy 100 shares of a stock from you at a agreed price. You collect a fee to do this. 

Selling a call contract means you have already bought a call contract and are now selling the contract you own. You don’t need any shares because the contract you have is already worth 100 shares. 

Call contracts can be sold multiple times and often are after the initial contract is made. Hope that clarifies."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,More or less.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It also gives a slight advantage to the people selling calls, because they may not be exercised even if they are ITM."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,">Ah I see. I guess that if you don't have enough money, you just cannot exercise it and loose it. It is correct to conclude that this gives an advantage to those with enough money to exercise the option when it approaches 5:30 PM on Friday of the expiration date ?  

correct, although you may be able to be able to borrow money on margin, but that depends on a few factors like if you're using a decent broker, how much money you have, etc

>Since those without enough funds do not plan to exercise it, it is like a hot potato.Maybe there are so many option traders with enough funds that this is not at all noticeable?

pretty much. a lot of options trading is hedging (rather than using options as lotto tickets as is common in WSB) and the people/institutions hedging these trades have a lot of money

> I guess that if you don't have enough money, you just cannot exercise it and loose it.

yeah pretty much"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"https://imgur.com/xvMmmw5

By not going through I meant it not becoming ITM.

Notice the left are various choices the right side is simulated at a few price points. Once your strike is getting ITM you can sell for profit and offset that premium. Don't worry about the seller, fuck the seller. Don't sell calls until you are much better at this. Worry about buying call and put and none of the other options, these will get you in the hole if you fuck up.

Notice it hits your $29 strike on the day you made the call, you can cash out for a profit. Notice at the $29 strike on your expire day you don't have your premiumx100 back until you are at strike + premium. Hopefully this doesn't confuse you even more. That image should show you a lot of what you need to see. Ignore all the shit on the right side of the simulated trade at the bottom, it will confuse you. The right window bottom says march 19 21 $29 call you call that a CCL 20c 3/19."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s just extra for all the different orifices.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,thats why it affects the poor. the rich dictate the laws.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"% of what? Your previous years taxes? Those are technically confidential personal info and only the IRS and local state tax agency have access to that. A random judge would have to get a court order.

Also rich people have a lot easier ways of hiding their actual worth than poor people so you're still going to fuck the poor more."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks so much! This thread really drove home some concepts I loosely understood.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can you explain to me the guy that lost 90,000? Is that the premium he initially paid?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks , wasn't going to buy gme unless it went way back down again.

These contracts, are they all a length of a week? So like on Mondays they're created and all expire on fridays? Thought I saw another response saying to make sure to always sell/exercise by 2pm friday."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,In short: selling a contract without the shares to back it up is a naked short.  Selling a call contract I previously bought is selling to close?  Am I getting this right?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Confusion like this is why I prefer the terminology of option writing and selling, vs using selling to describe both the creation of the contract and passing it on to someone else."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the explanation!

They can possibly announce something related to the shares, I mean they have to cash out something (might sound bad for the price but would be good long term as it's an investment in the company)."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It will include the next gen sales and the holidays from November through new years. There could be a big bump from the holidays as gaming grew even bigger eith everyone not doing much.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"My non expert opinion, earnings report won’t affect the stock too much because the value of the company isn’t what’s keeping it at the price that it’s at."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"In my opinion, the Q4 Earnings report coming out on 3/23 is almost irrelevant to the current situation.  The sales numbers will show what everyone has already known, GameStop is doing OK in terms of $$’s, but not spectacular.  The past legacy business (which is what they’ll be reporting on for this earnings report) does not justify a $200-300 share price valuation.  That shouldn’t be surprising for anyone who’s been following along...

BUT the real HYPE and what every true GME bull should be interested in is the CONFERENCE CALL afterwards.  And what gets said on that call about their future strategic planning and capital allocation.  How are they going to turn the business around? What other business areas are they going to pursue? Where do they see themselves in terms of the gaming industry in the next few years?

I’m assuming that this will be the first time that Ryan Cohen speaks from an official position on the board.  And if he does, the **HYPE** will be unreal.  We should all care about their FUTURE PLANS! We already know about their legacy business that is still bringing in steady money, just nothing crazy. 


My positions: shares bought at a low price (avg cost basis $14.83) before January.  Sold some to take profits during the first and “second” squeeze, still planning to hold at least some through the earnings call.  But I will sell some more if we see another insane squeeze this upcoming week..."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stock had gone from $4 to almost $20 in December. 

We are hoping to see not necessarily a spike in revenue, but debt consolidation and EPS rise...or that’s what I’d be looking for."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Doesn't look like anyone has said it yet, but their fiscal Q4 ended on 1/31. And I did see a ton of people saying to sign up for their subscription and go buy stuff at Gamestop before then to get it on the Q4 earnings.

I wouldn't count on that making earnings blowout, because they do $1-1.5B a quarter even in down times. It'll be an exciting run up before earnings and then who knows what earnings will do. Hopefully they're saving some announcements for it 🙂"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"They didn’t exercise shares, they didn’t do this because they knew company information that may affect the stock price. I think they had a great q4 and they have good news to release."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It also removes the blackout period for them allowing them to make a whole bunch of forward looking statements they haven't been allowed to make.  They can also make forward looking projections for future growth and direction.  The only thing that would be better is if it was Monday of this week.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,GME hasn’t traded on fundamentals for some time now. It is traded on hype and whatever the report says the hype will continue.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The earnings are going to be totally useless. The big take away will be comments from q&a and them pretty much being forced to address the stock price situation along with the possibility of a revised and massive issuance of shares.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I’d tread lightly on the hype of earnings as even RC said in his letters that the next earnings (ending q4) won’t be spectacular but the future is good. I think they will be good in proving the upward trajectory and we should be looking at how they’ve further cleared overhead expense and percentage gain in e-commerce along w yearly earnings.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tbh I’m expecting absolutely nothing special or out of the ordinary, but I am expecting anyone and everyone to utilize this as a catalyst nonetheless"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I guess what you're looking for in these earnings reports is not so much what they did in the previous quarter as much as you're looking into the tone of how they address the past, current and future expectations."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"One of the other key factors is that the current CEO was announced a few days before an earnings report a few years ago, and it could be that Cohen gets announced as CEO at some point before this earnings report. Current CEO is sitting on shit loss of shares that are worth more than they probably ever thought they would be worth, but they can’t sell them easily at the moment. Cohen has discussed before how he is a ‘business builder’ and a leader. With the resignation of the CFO, pivot to digital etc. the earnings report could be the moment when a lot of these changes go from speculation to actual business realities, which in turn could bring in big money buyers."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"What happens if the CFO jizzed a sheet of paper and drew an X/Y axis labeled ""stock/time""?

I'd be retarded enough to understand it

Would that mean the CFO loves the stock too?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s more about Ryan Cohen speaking on gme’s transformation and offering strong guidance. Some solid numbers from the console cycle would help
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait, y’all invested in GME for the fundamentals?? 💀"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Doesnt matter. Its going to be a good report because of next gen console sales and holiday spending and all that, but GME is pushing $300. The media will accurately report that the numbers do not justify its valuation. It will be worded in a way that is technically truthful, while they shit all over the stock. 

Gamestop could have ten times its record earnings and it still wouldnt come close to justifying its market cap, and the media is going to be screaming exactly that. 

This thing being at 300 has nothing to do with fundamentals, so I dont know why the media or anyone else gives a single shit about earnings. 

Its a meme stock. Internet chatter and news feed saturization has ten times more to do with moving the price than what any bean counters have to say. 

GME is a cultish socio-economic movement, being driven up by hype, options chains, hedge funds trying to screw eachother, and a billion others who just want to get in on the action to make a buck. 

The best thing for GME is to close in the green even if its only pennies. Its more about protecting its image as a rampaging Bull on a warpath than anything else. Im telling you i think all it would take to tank this thing sub 100 in a heartbeat is two consecutive days closing $1 in the red."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If the company doesn’t massively dilute its shares and raise tons of cash like AMC , they got to be the dumbest kid on the block! Seriously, they can priced a secondary offering at $250 and there will be ton of retards I mean buyers buying :-)"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve got puts for the earnings report xD they will tank this thing for earnings unfortunately.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holiday season numbers were announced a while ago so those probably won't be much of a surprise. But January probably was exceptionally strong and RC being able to speak _for_ GameStop and not just _to_ them will probably be huge. They canceled ICR once RC got on board so we might hear much more than ""Omnichannel, transformation going okay so far and also omnichannel."". 

Regarding the shares: They might cancel the shelf offering which honestly does not do much to the overall dilution but would be _huge_ news and probably cause the stock price to explode. A split would also be crazy good. And announcing share dilution to acquire some eSport company would probably put a small, inconsequential dent into the price but turbocharge their transformation."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"See other comments, but this is not correct. GameStop's fiscal year goes through the end of January.

Edit: the comment above *is* correct, but people should also know that the earnings report does cover January as well."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly you’re probably right, fundamentals hardly apply. It could be a catalyst, but idk. I think the hope is that there’s good news that shows the hedges they will never get those shorts back and they have to cover eventually"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I was thinking the same. If anything it may deflate the price. The few fundamentalists that are left will probably find console sale earnings to be underwhelming and this is one of the few days that institutions will control inflow/outflow of GME much more than retail investors
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I'm surprised at how many comments there are with no one acknowledging that this goes through the end of January. ""Our fiscal year is composed of the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to the last day of January."" - that was quoted from their last q4 report. That logic would put this fiscal year as ending on January 30th, right?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Very good clarification on the Q4 end date.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This popcorn tastes like someone jizzed all over it
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You could have saved time and typed ""I'm a retard"""
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely. GME is not worth 300 a share, it was hardly worth 60$ at its peak when it was profitable. 
I think GME is fun because it’s a meme, but any rationalization about GME being worth it’s price is just happy think and not grounded in reality"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So if it goes to the end of January, how does it not include November through New Year's?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got a snake, man! One time I fed it some beer!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"No doubt. Maybe if it became one of the most successful turnarounds in history and turns into a massive hub for ecommerce and everyones dreams come true, It might  justify a market cap of about 50% of what it is right now.

As far as ecommerce and gaming goes, even Steam would be worth far less than gme right now if it were publicly traded. 

I love the stock, I plan on making alot of money on it. But im not so delusional I think its actually a good company. You gotta see it for what it is. A meme. Sooner or later the squeeze will finish being squozen and its all gonna be over. Fundamentals and earnings mean fuck all."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're right, what you said isn't strictly incorrect. But I was working on the assumption that, as a response to OP's claim that the earnings wouldn't be significant because it didn't include the swell of ape support, your response meant roughly ""Yes, but it will include the next gen sales and the holidays from November through  new years."" So I wanted to make sure people understood that it \*would\* actually include the January ape support."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Kathleen turner has big fucking tits!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I believe that if it could become a massive hub for e-commerce, it would have done so by now. 
That being said, if it did happen I would shop there, I just don’t see that being feasible with the competition and no clear competitive advantage.
But yeah, even if it did accomplish this it would be valued around 50$ a share IMO"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats. Oil has been my biggest play this year and I’m still all in. Gas is gonna be 4 dollars a gallon by late summer . Maybe then I’ll sell
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Think it’s still got some fuel (ha) left in it? Considering picking up some calls for late summer with gas prices on the rise.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can someone explain the contract thing to me ?? I just buy shit if I think it’ll make me money . Can you explain to me what this is or how it’s done ???
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ve got some LEAPS on BP and XOM. They’ve been shitting the bed lately
GUSH has been printing though. I regret not jumping in"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Not a bad rip!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The GUSH tattoo definitely needs to be a tramp stamp
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you DD yourself on this one? Impressive ape.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I lost 50K on a PLTR  YOLO. took 15K of my remaining portfolio  and  put it all in GUSH. it dug me out to break even.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I think if you get in before July-ish. it'll still be a great price
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Contracts refers to an Options Contract.

An options contract *always* refers to a lot of 100 shares.     
1 contract = 100 shares of the underlying (stock).    
2 contracts = 200 shares of the underlying (stock).

If you buy an options contract, you're buying the right (but not the obligation) to purchase 100 shares of that stock at the contract price (strike price). This contract costs less than actually having to buy the 100 shares outright. 

Whats the trade off?

Time.

If you buy 100 shares of a stock, you have (basically) unlimited time to wait for that stock price to go up and make you money. But with a contract, your time is limited (depending on the length of the contract you buy). If the stock price does not rise before the expiration date of your contract, it ""expires worthless"". And the amount you paid for that contract is gone (the seller of the contract keeps it.)

So the advantage of options is you pay less money to control multiples of 100 shares of a stock, but the trade off is time. 

Thats the down and dirty of *buying* an options contract. There's *a lot* more to it, including selling to close (versus exercising your contract) and selling contracts, puts, calls, spreads, etc. Options can be a great leveraging tool, but like all things, the knife can cut both ways. Meaning, you can really fuck up in a hurry with options. 

If you're interested in learning more, you need to spend some time learning and watching. Check out ""InTheMoney"" and ""ProjectOption"" youtube channels. 

Do NOT start buying or selling options based on the bit of info I gave you."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you know what Options  Trading is?

I like the stock. I didn't come for a movement but I did become enamored by it and what it showed me of humanity. It isn't just the willingness to say fuck you and fight back, but also to be the rising tide that raises all ships, because at the end of the day...

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So you're saying me buying the falling knife at $33 avg wasn't insanely retarded. Got it
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey. Just want to say that this is the way it’s been since January (RKT was added more recently, AMC was removed) and this is not a progressive way of preventing the market makers, banks, and hedge funds from making the trades, it is actually a way of limiting TD’s risk by offering less options to retail investors.

If I want to sell a cash secured put on GME or RKT, which are LONG positions, by the way, (bears r fuk, they pay ME the premium) I have to call, sit on the phone for an hour, and speak to a representative of the trade desk to open those positions. It’s because they’re “hard to borrow” securities, and they want to mitigate risk.

This is nothing new, nor does it have ANY indication over what is going to happen with the stock. It is simply TD Ameritrade mitigating their risk. I love TD, and I’m not leaving the platform, but it’s important to not conflate a rule that is taking away ability from the retail investor with a rule that is intended to limit hedge funds’ ability to make trades that I can guarantee you they are absolutely still able to make."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just went through refinancing my house because of the rates going so low. Since it was a pandemic I also didn’t want to go into a bunch of banks and talk to people. I emailed places and got on Rocket. I was weary about Rocket bc I thought it was for people who struggled to get better rates from traditional institutions. After everything was said and done, I compared all the offers I got and went with Rocket. Best decision ever. I could do everything online, I had someone who emailed me and called if I needed and walked me through and explained all the numbers. I only had one person drive to my house at the day of closing to sign all the paperwork for 15 minutes. They charged a tiny bit more but being someone that doesn’t like to deal with slick haired Bob at the bank, I decide it was worth it. 

I like the stock. I think they have a great product. Their biggest hurdle is boomers and others who thought like me in the beginning (only for people who can’t get a traditional loan). But their process was so easy, I can see this being what younger people lean towards as banks struggle to keep up with technology.

I look at it this way. If they both shorted about the same, and now looks like RKT shorted more..  it feels much easier for RKT to go 3x and more, then GME to go 3x or more at their current prices.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're claiming short positions are over-leveraged but even on IBKR's data, right now there are 5 million shares to borrow and the borrow fee is a measly 1.8%. Keep in mind that IBKR's data is technically incomplete because its based only on input from one broker (IBKR) and doesn't represent the full market float; there's likely significantly more than 5 million shares available to short.

You really think large scale funds that actually move the markets use TDA? Those restrictions are for limiting retail risk, not the big boys.

Also, short interest is 20% with 20m shares shorted, and shorts have been gradually covering all week. https://i.redd.it/g7n88sv5ymm61.jpg Is it still heavily shorted? Yes. It is shorted enough to be squeezed without some HUGE moves from whales, whales that have no reason to act this week or any other week? NO.

All of your data on this post is old data from before 3/2's 70% run-up which was combination gamma ramp and shorts in the weakest position getting squeezed out. Squeeze was squoze, new ones opened at $40 and they paid the dividend because it was profitable enough to do so, and if they want to keep RKT at maximum pain to eat up premiums, they have more than enough ammunition to do so.

Look, maybe I'll get some long ITM calls because I think RKT has some legitimacy as a long term hold and it's more likely to trade sideways than downward. But there is NO CATALYST for this play in the short term. None, zip, zero, nada. You are throwing pigs off a cliff and hoping one of them will eventually fly by hoping a whale will buy in 20% of the float for a squeeze and gamma ramp after a substantial decrease in short interest. Gambles are gambles but if you are thinking about buying in, consider the risk and opportunity cost realistically. 

If you're gambling on a short term play (within the next ~2 months until earnings in May), there's literally no catalyst for another spike at all unless you think some fucking magic will happen for 3/19's quad witching. Lottery tickets are cool and all but you might as well just get calls on Disney or Ford at this point."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I could never short sell HTB stocks on TD anyway this isn't new?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So should I buy those $62.89 3/26 calls??
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How would I put in calls? I really want to try that with this.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I think I’m good. Gme is a better play because short interest is worth nothing if the people don’t hold the stock.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I gave up on RKT when the CEO didn’t buy back their shares strategically. I mean all he needed to do was buy back $100million worth every time the short interest increased. He could have done this 10 different times in combination with the dividend announcement.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What does that mean for gme?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I expected some gme, but this was all RKT. Nice bait OP"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol don't you disrespect GME by slapping it's name on your RKT shill post.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,RKT is a bullshit play. It has a 51 billion market cap. Not everything is a short squeeze waiting to happen. Unsurprisingly there’s suddenly more ‘short squeezes’ being pushed on WSB with the stimulus check coming.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME is a time bomb one way or the other 

&#x200B;

not  sure why RKT is on the list, cept the big move the other day, scared ameritrade"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wish I had cash left to put into $RKT but I've already picked my horse in this race.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Stock price means literally nothing. Show me why you think they’re worth 100 billion lol. Or is your dd essentially ‘high short interest - buy’? Gme ruined good dd on this sub you’re all just chasing short squeezes even after they already happened.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you think RKT price being where it is is because of short sellers and not the fact that the mortgage market will never be as big as it was last year, I don't know what to tell you."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Okay so what about GME?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Clickbait title and terrible analysis on your part. GME only over here
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,*PLTR has entered the chat*
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So is this the new Hedge tactic? To get y’all distracted by RKT again (which is nothing) right when GME is about to take off and millions are getting their stimulus checks?  Don’t fall for this. GME is the only move right now.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Op is pushing Nokia, bb, rkt and other distraction stocks. Yet nothing on GME. 😂😂"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,All this whole article tells me is your down a lot of money and need help !!!!!!!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"MACD in your frame is crossing back over. RSI is what at that point below 50 I bet? Momentum is shifting because sentiment was it was a shill play to distract from GME. 

I am happy for RKT gang but what ever short squeeze potential exists it is highest with GME. 

Period. End of story. 

If you want to go parabolic on a log scale then the best bet is GME.

For smooth brain ape

Parabolic means straight up 

Log scale means multiples of 10 like this

1 10 100 1,000 10,000 100,000 1,000,000

That is how finance works.

It only looks linear on the day to day but finance works exponentially."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel they are doing the same to AMD and UWMC

This mortgage thing is not something I understand. I get that there’s short interest in but I also know that I don’t know fuck all about mortgages or houses. It seems like a boomer stock to me and I don’t wanna get into something I don’t believe in."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean people are what determine the worth of a stock. So you basically just said if this stock wasn't this stock it would be the clear move.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"honestly the fact that CC and CSP selling on GME is restricted is completely dumb

i get the restrictions on naked selling (even if I don't agree with it fully), but the CC and CSP restriction is really dumb since in both cases its either covered or we're using collateral"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why would you think they would want to mitigate risk unless it indicates how much huge risk they see in GME and RKT?

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy fuck I'm hard
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The CEO has the ability to buy back his shares at a huge discount if he feels this way... if he does buy back I’ll dabble as a long term investor but not right now.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,the greed is what truly brings out our inner retard. its happened to me countless times also not to worry 🚀🚀
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I can see why you held... It looked like $40 was the floor and the price was getting normalized. Then the shorts came back.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ikr. Held 200 contacts when it boomed a couple weeks ago. Was up like 160k but decided to hold overnight. Well, the shit tanked pre-market and I had to settle for a 30k gain. Greed is a hell of a drug. I try not to revenge trade though, so I’m not sure I’ll get back in again. Haven’t decided."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I just looked at the calls on RH. Why are the strike prices ending in either .39 or .89? Is that a bug?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Get greedy with shares but in my experience i always get fucking burned being patient with options to the last day
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably better to spend a little more for something with some time value
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed! Assuming the squeeze never happens, Rocket is actually worth the price that it is right now unlike Gamestonk."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shoot me a good one. I’m long selling cc’s. I do think it’s been manipulated over the last few months. Too many crazy 5-10% jumps that instantly get traded down.

That said I’m bullish thinking it should trade in the 30’s and wouldn’t be overvalued in the 40’s."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"PT is generally $33 - $39.  So, unless the housing market implodes it is all rainbows.  But with so much money chasing unprofitable moonshots, who knows how long until the price action matches the business."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Great insight!!!!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So if I don’t have anything in RKT and wanted to get in on it, I would need to buy call options— not just stock for it to be really beneficial?"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed. I started buying at low $30s and thanks to the panic selling + shorts I made it down to $25. 75 shares in and ready to buy more at $21.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,24.89 3/19 to help the gamma squeeze.  Up to $32 has good delta
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep and if it goes to $32 it keeps going because of all the other reasons discussed. Truly an early opportunity!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME is relying alot on the turnaround story for sure, which I have faith in as a GME holder. But wow, RKT has already bagged $9B net in 2020 already if I'm reading that right. That is impressive."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Gamma squeeze needs 24.89 3/19 activity.  Monthlies between 20 and 30 look good if your looking for something further out

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hard to say. There’s not a known catalyst right now so timing is hard to say. I was thinking two weeks out. Could be Monday could be two months from now. I’m debating what to do myself.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's really not true at all. You need buying interest to squeeze shorts. It doesn't matter how long you hold. What matters is that you have more buyers than sellers over time. That's it.

Moreover, institutional holders will absolutely sell to the shorts when needed. Retail shares barely matter. Deluding yourself to think otherwise is the wrong kind of retarded."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Right?!  Japanese twitter has been all over this for the last couple of weeks.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,And they are WAY smarter than us with our shitty school systems. I'm in.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"OK. Great comment! Thanks for your honesty.  Let me give you why I am in.

You are sitting on your couch at 3am.  You really want to buy a book, but you don't want to try to call bookstores to see if they have it, or drive to a bookstore, and how would you do that at 3am anyway?   So you buy it on Rocket... Um, I mean Amazon.com

Rocket has Mortgages and refinances available 24 hours a day, almost as easy as buying something on Amazon, without having to talk to anyone or leaving your house. Just like Amazon, you pay a little bit more for that service, but the service is amazing. 

Just like when Amazon was just known as a bookseller, Rocket is known as just a mortgage company. The thing is, just like Amazon, they are not planning on selling just one thing.  Their services are currently most of the back bone of Vroom, a company/website that let's you buy no haggle used cars in your underpants at home, and have the car dropped off in your driveway. 

They are building Rocket Homes, basically a website that is, ""Hey look at this house, like it? Let's set up an appointment to go see it, and here's your pre-qualification for a mortgage, and this is Cassie your new real estate agent. Oh yeah, Cassie just texted you to say hi. 

Just like Amazon and Amazon's web service, Rocket is the backbone of many transactions that they don't own. Businesses pay them to make their business more efficient. 

So if you flip books with mortgages, and then see that this company is putting itself wherever it can to be a tech juggernaut, you get Amazon... When the stock was affordable. 

This is anything but a Boomer stock.  Boomers call their mortgage guy Larry, but I want to borrow some money so I go to Rocket. I can do it while watching BoJack Horseman, and on my second sleeve of Oreos, and not talk to a single person. 

The plan is for me, you, and anyone born after 1975 to be able to buy or sell a car, a house, get a loan, make a payment, see that rates are better and get a refi, all from one place. Rocket. Basically Amazon for all the stuff you can't get on Amazon. 

Oh By-the-way, when Donna and Ronald call Larry to get a Mortgage because hipsters use the internet and get off my lawn? Larry is using Rocket's system to find them a loan. 

In closing, I'm not a financial advisor.  I hope this finds you well."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This isn’t investing. This is wallstreetBETS so that means we bet. Those 3/26 deep OTM calls are dirt cheap. $47.89 strike price would cost you $27 per contract. You’re telling me you’re afraid to lose $27? This is not financial advice- I for one am willing to lose out on like $200-300 if it shits the bed. So after working an overnight Sunday into Monday- I am going to stay up an extra few hours to market open and try to buy about 10 OTM call contracts (probably 3/26 or 4/1 for extra time to lift off). Just remember- when Robinhood wouldn’t let people buy the price tanked- what do you think will happen if trading platforms do the OPPOSITE and don’t let you short sell. I’ll leave that up to you to figure out. In conclusion all I’m saying is this... I’ll respect your decision no matter what you do, but buying 1 call option that’s max risk of losing less than $30 will not be a risk for for 99% of members here."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You don’t believe in mortgages?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought so too initially but started doing some DD on them a couple weeks back and liked what I saw. To be clear, I know jack about mortgages and stuff, but I liked a few things I found out doing research. For one, they have kind of a vertical integration thing going on where they have different companies that are all involved in different parts of the housing market, from mortgages to advertising homes for sale, which means they kind of own a corner of that market to themselves and don’t have to rely on outside companies as much, rocket can theoretically handle pretty much everything involved in a home buying process in-house. Another factor I liked was that the execs haven’t taken the shorts laying down, they found ways to fight back, like announcing a massive stock buy back that will take place this year as well as announcing a special dividend of $1.1/share paid to all holders as of 03/05. These counterattacks showed that management has a good sense of strategy and is willing to actively defend the company’s interests instead of being at the mercy of the market; they also are a big part of what caused the last huge squeeze on the shorts that shot the price up to $40+ as shorts had to struggle to cover ASAP. Do your own DD obviously but personally I like what I’ve seen so far and will likely buy back in this week."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You might ""get"" GameStop but do you ""get"" company valuations? RKT is a far superior investment from a fundamental perspective. It has a future, is growing its competitive advantages, and best of all, the stock price is based in reality, unlike GME."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"While I have, and will play RKT again, your assessment of your situation is spot on."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do you like ordering stuff online?

Would you like to get a mortgage from your home in less then a half hour without ever putting clothes on?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"“The short squeeze is a bonus”. So I take it you’ve been holding GME for years. No need to bs us bro, you’re in GME for the squeeze. The fact that you buy a couple games from them every year IS the bonus."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I refinanced my house through Rocket Mortgage, and honest to god, it was so damn simple and easy that my refi was an actual pleasure. The front end of my website was so easy to use. Simple instructions on what to upload and easy as heck to follow up on status. I'd get an email ""please upload a copy of your last W2"" .. click, submit, done. 

It was such a painless process I have since got 2 people to refi with them. I am not a paid spokesApe nor anyone affiliated with RKT..just a dude who refinanced his house using a product and company he believes in. I can see this stock making more money

easy as pie."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly agree with you mate. Everyday we've pushed on RKT and GME( RKT doesnt have the full ape army) qnd they've pushed use back down but i keep holding praying. GME/RKT to the moon!

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you cry 30k tears I don't think so.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s from their $1.11 per share special dividend. All cost bases are adjusted down $1.11
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,corporate actions such as special dividends adjusts the strikes of all options
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Minimum is 33, 39 is still reasonable.  People have it in the 40s with moonshots in the 70s. It will probably get there but that's long term investing."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Forgive, don't know what that acronym is"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,My understanding of it is that buying the stock is more effective at causing a squeeze.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Options have a strike date.  You can pay another premium to reload them.  So, it costs money to hold them.  Shares don't cost anything to hold.  A short squeeze happens because the shorts have to be reloaded.   It costs money to reload them and eventually they need to cover to stop leaking money.  So, to outlast shorts you need something you can hold without cost.  Otherwise, you will end up bailing first since you have less money than they do."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would be careful with options that are short term. Am I hoping the stock takes a jump this week...but there are a lot of uncertainties and a lot of players involved right now. If I wasn’t already invested in RKT I would wait until after open on Monday, see if it dips, buy shares on the dip and then be happy knowing I just bought a stock that is primed to grow. This is not financial advice and I am just an idiot who is long on RKT because I believe in the product/service."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Both help but buying shares in a brokerage account that does lend your shares out probably helps the most.  There are already a lot of options open for 3 19 for a gamma squeeze just need enough shares being bought to ignite it.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The reason I feel more confident about this play (outside of the current situation with the stock) is that I am in the industry as a vendor.  The housing market will always be an incredibly unique industry as it maximizes both a desire and basic human need.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Brokers are on the hook even if their clients can't pay. Brokers owe the clearing houses. In fact they can't even use their customers money for collateral.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That is not the consensus! It is only for the new people that joined about a month ago. I’d argue we were getting a lot more quality posts pre-boom era

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Main thing about Ford is that the calls are extremely cheap, even when paying for Theta, and it only requires minimal price action to get a profit, so it's very easy to load up on far ITM calls and just wait with fairly minimal risk."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depends entirely on how good you think their chances are of winning their ultimatum with RKT. So far the signs are in UWMC's favour; not every broker has picked a side yet, but of the brokers who HAVE picked a side, 93% of them chose UWM. https://scontent-sjc3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/155839660_10157497180357000_5013949324169737153_o.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=8024bb&efg=eyJpIjoidCJ9&_nc_ohc=9z6zCO2c7y0AX-TzxAv&_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.xx&tp=14&oh=a8a7f537be79f4df6314aecb570a9068&oe=6071743D

I might buy some shares. Long calls aren't bad either but you'd be paying a lot for theta and I don't have a good time table for growth. Might pick up a few 4/16 9c if they're cheap, otherwise maybe May or longer.

On the other hand, in 2021 why would anyone touch a mortgage originator? Refinancing is at an all time low, as little as 2%. It'll be a while before originators like RKT or UWM see earnings like they saw in 2020."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Actually none of the strikes I can find are whole numbers. RKT had a special $1.11 dividend and they adjusted all the strikes. Is it still a bad idea to buy them?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I may just need to double down on my shares.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The buying interest comes from covering the shorts. Sure other pressure does help and does exist but is not theoretically required. 

A lot of institutional investors actually have been buying gme because many active funds have been underperforming passive funds that include meme stocks. 

Additionally, if gme even keeps HALF of it's value for the next 3 weeks it will be rebalanced into the Russel 1000, which will cause many passive fund investments, which account for 70% of the market"

I also doubt they have to worry about 7 day periods to move money around to different accounts which is what really hurt the RH traders and stopped the buying.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/quicken-overtakes-wells-fargo-as-nation-s-no-1-mortgage-originator-59432542

Quicken is Rocket's old name. So yeah they probably aren't at 3AM, but people do want this. Rocket is America's top mortgage company. They don't have buildings.  People want to do it when it is easy for them. For me, that is while binge watching Netflix."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"True. But IMO the traditional route to securing a mortgage is unnecessarily cumbersome. Any company that can make that process easier, gets a thumbs up from me."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I think my play will be purchasing without expecting it to be ITM and simply can make some money on premiums. I’ve had some deep OTM GME contracts that were up 350%+ and held them just to end up selling for a loss. This past Wednesday I could have collected an easy $1100 profit from $398 in contracts but then we all saw what happened with the stock price at noon. Learned my lesson there for sure
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well in short- they are a mortgage company during a time where people are buying houses/ refinancing like crazy to take advantage of crazy low interest rates. More mortgages/ refinancing for them means money in the bank with fees, plus higher online traffic to their site so more money in advertising as well amount other things.

Edit- rising interest rates down the road could certainly slow this gravy train for them but that will take months or years to rise to previous levels"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wish I had thought of this before I got my mortgage. Who knew I had the option of just taking my 5% down and buying a house outright instead?

Oh right, I couldn't afford it. And neither can 99% of Americans."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude, people didn't get screwed over in '08 because they had a mortgage, they got screwed over because they got more of a mortgage than they could afford because they simply trusted the person selling it to them that they could stretch themselves for a bigger/better house.  

So sure, don't trust the agents telling you how much house you can afford. Do your own math, but the mortgage itself still makes sense.  No point putting hundreds of thousands into an asset that barely beats inflation when you could mortgage it at a super low rate and invest the rest in something that can easily beat inflation and your interest rate on the mortgage."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ahh, we’re buying @ over $60 for the fundamentals. Got it."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ew, gross."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,But every time I do the math you're wrong so show me your math
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol all ill think after this is could i have bought more😂
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hopefully you'll make that million back
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wish I had been holding long like these $12 and $40 yodelers.   
""Oh yes I have 10`000 shares because at the time you know it was so cheap...""  
And you're like, ""Is that ten.. thousand.? or ten but metric?"""
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Worth noting that the share price should have traded $1.11 lower too but the dip got eaten up right away
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"$28 realistically, $34 hopeful, low $60s emotionally. They have been artificially capped since debut. They're having a baller year, and the next year is going to be booming with recovery, and prices coming down, interest stagnant for a while. They're market cap and business strategy is to solid for them to be priced in as low as it is. Just my opinion.
Riding this one for the dividends and just fold it back in for more."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Fidelity for example only does if you apply for higher levels of options trading.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Aye.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, big money on OTM calls doesn’t really mean anything, since GME had a absolute cock load riding on 3/12 . Thank you for the response! I’m so torn on this. I find a lot well written pro and con DD on RKT. I appreciate the post though!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Believe what u will, wsb ogs will remember me blowing my entire acc and going on hiatus."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"No they did not push rkt, it had had huge short sell position since ipo. They go directly against one of banks most valuable source of income. It would be detrimental for them"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wish u could read Japanese, I would send u an  article I found on Japanese Twitter that really well explains the situation I’d be happy to translate but I would not know how to go about translating some of the harder jargon into english"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Banks like bofa same banks that have always went against Gme, has also done the same to rkt. U can also check Dan Gilbert’s history w banks n u might see y they might be in opposition"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The majority of institutional owners are etfs and pension funds.

All the active institutional's would have sold off in January unless they are holding for the moass."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah yes, jumping into a play that’s already peaked, classic wsb."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do it, you won't."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here's a banana. 🍌

I took this action independently of any advice."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What you smooth brain apes do or talk about is up to you. But this smooth brain crayon eating fully retarded ape just likes the stocks and thinks they are criminally under valued. I make my decisions myself and nobody here has any influence on me. If we all end up on the moon together then damn good for you apes too!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"we all are independent agents with our own investment strategies that happen to have similar conclusions on what we believe to be reasonable positions.

most of the GME retards will (probably) roll right into RKT or AMC.

Should be glorious."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Well I might just happen to have the same plan
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you read his post history, the moron was saying GME was definitely done for after it went down the first time, saying the “squeeze is over”. Yet here us 🦍 🦍 🦍 are back at 270. 

Guys an idiot."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"And thats perfectly fair, your money your decisions, hindsights 20/20 but that means nothing when talking about today or tomorrow, im rooting that you get yours back up and you profit in the end"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I think both will print 

I’m on only amc n hopping onto rkt just bc I think they are safer plays.

I got in on amc earlier on and I like them as a company better than gme"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That would be bold since I assume you're a melvbot
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's the bet but not everyone can afford it, unfortunately."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I just realized I can use money in exchange for goods and services
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Troll or not you just did a great job explaining Rocket. 

Idk though. I tried to refi my mortgage through them and it’s no where near that easy. Phone blew up 30 times a day from Quicken calling me and there was no way to do it “all from my couch while watching tv”. Which is really, really frustrating because the hours I work aren’t really conducive to having to be on the phone during regular business hours."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Reddit has a new paid team called **Anti-Evil Operations** which goes around permanently banning accounts for saying bad words. We made automod block them so you don't lose your account for saying a word and getting reported. It's not our rule, it's the entire website now, we're just trying to look out for our people. Sorry.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Tell me about rocket vs uwmc
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bundling bad mortgages up into securities nearly ruined the economy once, what's the worst that could happen if we lower the bar and automate the loaning process? Nobody can seem to keep the bots and scammers off of every other online platform and service why not extend that on into the housing sector?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So I'll admit I don't fully understand options but how are you going to buy options and expect to make money on premiums?  Don't you get premiums by selling options?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I actually think $60 on fundamentals is a fine price atm. You’re still paying the Cohen premium there, but you’re going to be paying that until he proves he can’t turn GME around. You’ll be paying that for the next company he moves into as well."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"For me, yes. I got in it for the squeeze but after finding out more about the companys coming transition into e-commerce combined with all the press it's been getting this year I'm actually hoping the squeeze will be over soon so that I can reenter when it bottoms out (in the 50-100 range)  and build a bigger position over the coming years. I like the stock."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"ok i will, give me the details on ur gme position u hold as of rn"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"As my post said the downside is minimal and the upside sexy. So, never too late..."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but are you saying it’s better if they do lend them out or don’t lend them out? I was confused by the wording. Also, I eat crayons, so keep that in mind."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It's just a piece of the story. Follow the breadcrumbs!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Cool story bro
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"their MC is like 80bn in their revs were 16B lol theyre guiding low at 32bn next year.

and are profitable. PE is 6.

its not a momo trade is a value play"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,There was no financial advice. I never saw any
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"instructions unclear, banana now in tailpipe"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m retarded.  If I made good decisions I would have known about wsb last year and never sold my 2100 shares of GME at $19.50.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah idk man, I have absolutely nothing to lose because im already poor"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So you're telling me that I've failed the tuning test?

Edit, yes i misspelled turing test. No, I'm not going to change it."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Money for stonks . Stonks for more stonks. Stonks all the way down.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Explain!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,More money means more beer!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,When I got my house I used rocket’s pre-approval process and it was super simple and low hassle.  A year later and I’m getting my phone blown up with then trying to connect me with someone to refi so I feel you there.  For home buying though it was quick and easy.  Reminds me of sofi. These companies are financing moving away from the old brick and mortar while still providing excellent service and I see it as the future.  I’m putting what I can into RKT right now for a long term play.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for your feedback! What year was this? I had issues with my mortgage too, but not from RKT."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"if the argument is that the p/e ratio is underpriced, then wouldnt UWMC be even better than RKT? and what's this other company CCIV? I'm unfamiliar with mortgage fintech, sell me"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"UWMC=Melvin RKT=Elon
Thats my understanding"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Valid points. I guess I didn’t really look at the bigger picture.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So options premiums are determined based on a lot of  variables. One of them being implied volatility. Now to be completely honest I’m not sure of all the variables that change the price of premiums but I do know that the higher the IV the higher the premiums (usually- unless the stock tanks). That being said, I bought 2 800c Wednesday’s around 10am for 1.99 premium so 1.99x 100 shares x 2 contracts is $398, by noon eastern time the stock has shot up very high and the same 800c hit a high of $7.50 premium right before the stocks crashed. So basically I could have sold my contracts back into the market to close my position and collected the difference $1500- initial $398 invested.

Edit- Wednesday was actually the second time I got burned by holding onto GME contracts after being up over 300% on them."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,feel free to dm/pm the info or post here ill do the math n send u
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,My average is 78 and so far I've tripled my money.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I have as many shares as i can afford. Got another 80 dollars for monday morning see if i can buy the dip before take-off the wife wont be happy but thats what her boyfriends for anyway
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s better for us for our shares not to be lent out so there aren’t as many for shorters to dump on the market.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh, another thing I would like to get your opinion on... The whole ultimatum that UWMC put out. It seems petty and makes me personally want to steer clear of UWMC . But it seems like a lot of these brokers are agreeing to it. Are you concerned about that? Why or why not?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Aii bro hope u learned how to transfer ur money of robinhood. Talkin abt investing when u still don’t know jack abt that
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Parents money headass

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Quick digestion you have there.

Oh wait."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly like I have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Hedge funds are playing a dangerous game with us
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Not sure if this is a bot who is smart enough to spell turing wrong for credibility or an ape who thinks it is actually tuning.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s not just RKT, I have my home loan services through Freedom Mortgage and I get non-stop calls and snail mail trying to get me to refi.

I actually am going to refi but I will try to go through RKT this time and see how that works."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just recently, trying to take advantage of that low interest rate before it goes away."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought a house in 2016 and tried Rocket/Quicken, too.  Had the same issue.  Ended up deleting my request and account to stop the calls, got a better deal elsewhere though face-to-face interaction.

I might give it another go next time I buy a house in a year or so and see if they've improved."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh, I see. Premiums = price of the option, so as it's looking more likely the strike price could be met, the price of the option goes up and you sell based on that gain. Is that right?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"if u buy just 11 19th Mar $26.50 Calls at 1,782 and it does it 65 u walk away w 40k"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You don’t give your customers/agents ultimatums unless you’re losing money, losing market share or becoming less competitive."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sort of... that’s kinda a way to look at it. But yeah, a lot of people will buy very deep OTM calls and can still make money on them even if they don’t become ITM as long as they sell them with enough time before expiration. If you’re buying weeklies and they are deep OTM it will be hard to make anything on them by Thursday or Friday unless the stock is REALLY moving on one of those days- like the first contract I bought was that Thursday like a week and a half ago? When the stock shot up like crazy around 3pm, if I would have sold Thursday I would have made a profit but I held until Friday and by then the contract was barely worth anything"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Correct
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,There’s definitely risks in using options to make money that way with super volatile stocks but it can be profitable. It’s just so random not knowing when a volatile stock will pop off- that being said- buying when premiums are low and IV is low limits your losses
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,if we hit 31.5 u get 4.6k progit
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree 100%. I just don’t understand why these brokers seem to be agreeing to it.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ayy man, sorry for acting out of character. I did not mean to be rude. But hopefullly u take the time n do ur own dnd that is all. Thank you"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm going to pass on risking $1,000 to get 4,000 back

My GME play was to risk $200 and get back 2000. I've been putting profits from small sales of gme directly into a undervalued stock which I plan to wheel into a million dollars by 2023.

2021-03-13 17:39:21,wallstreetbets,"The Neurobiology of Autism and its link with the GME saga. My dear fellow apes,

I couldn't find any thread discussing this but I believe this is a topic that can't be overlooked as it surely explains why many of us are bonding and showing similar behaviours in this GME / AMC saga. Plus, it may also explain why this is probably one of our greatest strength.I'm myself diagnosed Asperger myself and have spent years researching on the matter as I needed to understand why I couldn't feel and think the way my friends would. I'm sure I'm not the only one here.

SO...

# What is Autism and what is its prevalance in humans?

&#x200B;

**Autism Spectrum Disorder**\- Autism is a [developmental disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_disorder) characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism#cite_note-DSM5-3)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism)

\- ASD manifest in different forms and degrees. It can be low, mild, severe and isn't always manifesting as a severe mental disability.[https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/autism-spectrum-disorders](https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/autism-spectrum-disorders)*eg:* [*Asperger's syndrome*](https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/mental-health-aspergers-syndrome) *is on the milder end of the* [*autism*](https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/default.htm) \*spectrum. A person with Asperger's may be very intelligent and able to handle their daily life. They may be really focused on topics that interest them and discuss them nonstop. But they have a much harder time socially.

&#x200B;

**Prevalence**

\- About 1 percent of the world population has autism spectrum disorder. ([CDC, 2014](http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html))

\- Prevalence in the United States is estimated at 1 in 54 births. ([CDC, 2020](https://www.autism-society.org/releases/cdc-releases-new-prevalence-rates-of-people-with-autism-spectrum-disorder/))

\- More than 3.5 million Americans live with an autism spectrum disorder. ([Buescher et al., 2014](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-09/autism-costs-more-than-2-million-over-patient-s-life.html))

\- Prevalence of autism in U.S. children increased by 119.4 percent from 2000 (1 in 150) to 2010 (1 in 68). ([CDC, 2014](http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html)) Autism is the fastest-growing developmental disability. ([CDC, 2020](https://www.autism-society.org/releases/cdc-releases-new-prevalence-rates-of-people-with-autism-spectrum-disorder/))

\- Prevalence has increased by 6-15 percent each year from 2002 to 2010. (Based on biennial numbers from the [CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html))

\-  25% of 4500 children showing ASD symptoms participating in a study were not diagnosed and didn't know know they're affected. [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/aur.2255](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/aur.2255)

\-  ASD can be seen on brain MRIs, ASD brains physically developed differently.  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3081653/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3081653/)

# ""Ok that's a lot but not all of us here have ASD... Even if one 1/54 or 1% of us on here did, how could this be proven and mean anything anyway?""

Well, the pourcentage of ASD apes on here is likely to be **higher** than in those studies... Why?

**Social Media Use and Happiness in Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder**\*""Social Media use by adults with ASD, specifically Facebook use in moderation, may enhance well-being and may be a protective factor against secondary mental health concerns common in this population"".In a 2013 study\*[*,*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563213000708) *researcher* ***Micah O. Mazurek*** ***found that the majority of adults with autism use social media to meet friends.***[^(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29485900/)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29485900/)

**Social media use among adults with autism spectrum disorders***The purpose of this study was to examine patterns and social–emotional correlates of social media use in adults with ASD. Participants completed self-report measures of social media use, friendship quality and quantity, and loneliness.* ***The results indicated that the majority of participants (79.6%) used social networking sites (SNS)****, and that the most commonly cited reason for using SNS was social connection. Adults with ASD who used SNS were more likely to have close friends, and those who used SNS for social engagement reported closer friendship relationships.*

**Social Media help autistic children navigate the world***Dr. Szatmari: the human face doesn't have the same drawing power for an autistic child, and that something about technology triggers the motivation that's lacking in face-to-face contact.* ***This can really have a big impact in helping people with ASD navigate the world and be able to do things that we never thought possible before.***[^(https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/social-media-helping-autistic-children-navigate-the-world/article4358736/)](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/social-media-helping-autistic-children-navigate-the-world/article4358736/)

**Yale study: 'Social media boosts friendship quality in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder'**[^(https://medicine.yale.edu/childstudy/news-article/15234/)](https://medicine.yale.edu/childstudy/news-article/15234/)

If you do some research, you will see that there's many other studies explaining why social medias are one of ASD favorite way to connect and communicate.

Maybe it would be interesting do a pol to see who's diagnosed or feel like being misdiagnosed here...

# ""Yeh ok but what's the link with GME or the stock market then?""

That's where things get interesting...There are hundreds of studies out there showing that **reward pathways** of autistic people are altered and therefore their social relationships but also their **relationship with money** is totally different than the TD brains.

**Reward Circuitry Function in Autism During Face Anticipation and Outcomes***The aim of this study was to investigate reward circuitry responses in autism during reward anticipation and outcomes for monetary and social rewards.* ***During monetary anticipation, participants with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) showed hypoactivation in right nucleus accumbens and hyperactivation in right hippocampus, whereas during monetary outcomes, participants with ASDs showed hyperactivation in left midfrontal and anterior cingulate gyrus.*** *Groups did not differ in nucleus accumbens responses to faces. The ASD group demonstrated hyperactivation in bilateral amygdala during face anticipation that predicted social symptom severity and in bilateral insular cortex during face outcomes.* ***These results add to the growing body of evidence that autism is characterized by altered functioning of reward circuitry.*** *Additionally, atypical amygdala activation during the processing of social rewards may contribute to the development or expression of autistic features.*[^(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-011-1221-1)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-011-1221-1)

**Risk-Aversion and Rationality in Autism Spectrum Disorders***Risk-aversion and rationality have both been highlighted as core features of decision making in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). This study tested whether risk-aversion is related to rational decision-making in ASD individuals. ASD and matched control adults completed a decision-making task that discriminated between the use of risk-averse and rational strategies. Results showed that overall, ASD participants were more risk-averse than control participants. Specifically, both groups made similar choices when risk-aversion was the less rational strategy but* ***ASD participants chose more rational options than control participants when risk-aversion was the most rational strategy. This study confirmed that risk-aversion is a core feature of ASD and revealed that ASD individuals can switch their decision-making strategy adaptively to avoid negative consequences.***[^(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-018-3616-8)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-018-3616-8)

**Reward system dysfunction in autism spectrum disorders**\*“Participants with ASD showed the expected hypoactivation in the mesocorticolimbic circuitry in response to both reward types. In particular, diminished activation in the nucleus accumbens was observed when money, but not when social reward, was at stake, whereas the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex were hypoactivated within the ASD group in response to both rewards.\* ***These data indicate that the reward circuitry is compromised in ASD in social as well as in non-social, i.e. monetary conditions,*** ***which likely contributes to atypical motivated behaviour.”***[^(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3682440/)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3682440/)

# ""Cool but it says ASD individuals can switch their decision-making strategy adaptively to avoid negative consequences... so it could also mean you could paperhand?""

Well, not exactly...

**Emotional decision-making in autism spectrum disorder: the roles of interoception and alexithymia.** [^(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5062918/)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5062918/)""*These results demonstrate that although framing effects are associated with interoception and alexithymia in the neurotypical population,* ***emotional and interoceptive signals have less impact upon the decision-making process in ASD***\*.""\*

**Trait Autism is a Better Predictor of Empathy than Alexithymia***The study found that having more autistic traits is associated with lower empathy – even after factoring alexithymia into the analysis. In fact, the study provides some of the* \*\*\*best evidence so far that autism is definitely linked to lower empathy.\*\*\***Autism and Reactions to Provocation in a Social and Non-social Context**[^(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-019-04257-w)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-019-04257-w)*Compared to Healthy controles, individuals with ASD showed similar externalizing behavior in the social context.* ***In the non-social context*** *(meaning non physical environment)* ***reactions after provocation were enhanced relative to non-provoking situations.*** *The findings implicate that the context is an important influencing variable when comparing individuals with ASD to HCs after being provoked.*

See where I'm going?

# ""Ok but it still doesn't mean you wouldn't give up at some point?""

ASD mostly characterised by Restrictive and Repetitive behaviours. We get even more obsessed when it comes to things we enjoy and distract us... or rather keep us in focus.

And what do ASD love more than everything? Yes Cramer, that's exactly what we like, the stock... because we love video games!

**The risk for pathological video game use appears larger in adults with ASD compared with TD ('traditional') adults**[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29485900/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29485900/)

**Video game use in boys with autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, or typical development***Boys with ASD spend much more time playing video games than do boys with TD, and boys with ASD and ADHD are at greater risk for problematic video game use than are boys with TD.*[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23897915/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23897915/)

**Video games from the perspective of adults with autism spectrum disorder**The most frequent all-time favorite video game genres were Role-Playing (31%) and Action-Adventure (19%).  *To the moon, right?*[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563215003581](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563215003581)

**Restricted and repetitive behaviors in autism spectrum disorders**[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21574682/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21574682/)

# ""Mmmmmh... but if all of this is just a game to you, you'll still end up turning off the console when you'll realise you might not get what you want?""

Nope, not really... the funny thing about ASD RRBs is that we are excited by the reward anticipation itself, not the reward. As long as the adversaire isn't down its knees giving up, we won't turn off the console. Plus, the thing we'll miss the most and regret while being millionaires is the entertainment and excitement itself.

**Common alterations in sensitivity to type but not amount of reward in ADHD and autism spectrum disorders**\*'The results, while not supporting hyposensitivity to changes in reward amount in ADHD and ASD, do suggest that both groups are generally less motivated in settings where social as opposed to monetary rewards can be earned.'\*[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21223259/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21223259/)

**Money motivates in autism, attention deficit**'*They also perform better when the reward is greater: for example, 15 cents rather than 5, or comments such as “You’re a star” as opposed to “Well done.”'*[https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/cognition-and-behavior-money-motivates-in-autism-attention-deficit/](https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/cognition-and-behavior-money-motivates-in-autism-attention-deficit/)

**Autistic Traits Affect Reward Anticipation but not Reception**[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-65345-x](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-65345-x)

I've lost a link to an amazing study showing that ASD individuals were more generous when it came to sharing their monetary reward with other participants compared to control. If anyone finds it, please post it in the comments :).

# Conclusion

Hedgies can try manipulate the ASD apes we are with FUD or any other techniques; ASD brains won’t react. We don't show improvement with hours of therapy not using reward as stimuli. And our stimuli here... well they are trying to take it away from us so all it does is increasing our obsession and make us buy more.

Anyway, I have no idea if all I just put together makes sense or is accurate but as having ASD, I'm relating to all of these facts 100%.

I also understand that there might just be only 10 of us with ASD here, as well as there could be 100k  but if you are not ASD and call yourself autist, make us proud with your diamond hands!

There's one thing I'm sure tho, it is that I love you all beautiful apes.

See you on the moon with unlimited crayons and video games.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,As someone with Aspbergere and GME I agree with this post. I didnt read it cuz it was too long but I agree.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Female  ape with literal aspergers checking in. There is a lot of truth to what you are saying. My psychologist called my options trading a ""special interest"" and gave me a bunch of tips on how to be less obsessed with stonks and how to try to find a new hobby. I fired her.
Also wanted to say that I can't speak for all autists, but I find the terms used here hilarious. I am already dreading when reddit cracks down and we can't call each other autist and retard anymore."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Female Aspie here.    I have to say I really love how the term autistic is now a compliment.  I think a lot of that is thanks to communities like this one.    People being brave and owning the label.   
My son is also an aspie.  And he uses the term “autistic” like a badge of honor.  He is proud to be autistic.   It warms my socially awkward heart!    
Keep pressing on my fellow autists!   Very well done."

Let's not forget that 2nd and 3rd world countries will not test their people as much as first World (it took me 2 years to get tested in the uk). I read recently about women not being tested in China due to the 1 child rule and a woman with this ""issue"" not being a desirable potential partner."

I just want to emphasise that, as said by many before me, hedges can see us hype so please do not get disappointed if after a bit of a boost they immediately push it back down again. All we have to do is buy and hold, then we can enjoy the sweet tendies of £100k per share.

Diamond hands apes, Diamond hand 🙌🏻 💎💎🚀🚀🚀

I also want to add that I have been using the Etoro app for a little while now (trash I know) but there is one mega ape invested who has been giving daily predictions and warnings and has been literally bang on every single day.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that shits gold. Currently AMC is sitting at 11.34. If the stock addition happens, the higher tiers are going to be what's knocked out. 

AMC is more of a ride up, let slide down, ride back up stock because throughout all of this, the AMC board has been putting more and more stock onto the market (for example, their response to the Jan. Spike was to allow a shit ton of shares to convert so they could be traded, wiping out hundreds of million of debt for the company). 

AMC is making smart plays around this to support AMC. Awesome, great. However, those plays are also massively increasing the risk for people that are buying in while the momentum is going. 

You want to stick into it, your call, just be aware is all I'm saying."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"They aren't working to undermine the rocket persay. What they are doing is using the momentum of the rocket to push the company into a better position (for example, pushing people that have senior notes to convert them into shares) in order to build up their cash holdings and to eliminate debt (mostly the latter). This is really good for the company overall and is why having a good stock price is important, but any addition of new shares into the market inevitably causes the price to go down due to higher supply. Thus, while their actions aren't explicitly because they want the rocket to not blast off, their actions are slowing down the process."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Bonuses are meh. I’m more concerned with serious share dilution. Board killed any serious short squeeze potential.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Isn't this process enabled by the retail investor though? The very strategy you are mentioning is fueled by the people like me, looking to squeeze the shorts. 

This goes full circle back to the DD stating they have no intention to actually dilute the shares, rather they want to get an accurate count of the shorts. Triggering a huge increase in stock price. I  find it hard a business that was on the brink of bankruptcy and had to be shorted to survive, would dilute their positions. I have a MBA in business, however, I am realitively new to stocks. I might not be seeing things from the prespective needed, as my focal point is business. 

Dilution would just put you back almost to where you started. I would so what GME is doing. Using this once in a lifetime scenario to hire new management and probe different avenues. For AMC, this would be streaming services or different means of revenue. You have more cash flow than you've had since 2017."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"No idea why you're downvoted. 

AMC has always been risky. Absolutely fed up with people going ""wElL tHeYrE rEoPeNiNg AnD pEoPlE lIkE tHe MoViEs"".

Morons. Everybody likes everything. Everyone knows when and how they're going to reopen and how much money they'll make.

They were *paying off debts and needed 2020 to be another record year*.

It wasn't.

They're back at where they were in 2015.

They're going to absolurely take advantage of an overvalued stock to pay off these debts. Again. Because getting mugged once wasn't enough for AMC holders.

I'd buy AFTER this happens. Not a fucking moment before. Because THEN they might be a safe purchase.

You either bought at 3 and sold at 20. Or buy when it drops back to 3 and hold for a couple years.

Nobody else is bagging serious cash. Nobody. Stop telling people AMC is the rocket to 1000. Let it go."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This post doesn't know what they're talking about.

They're literally saying the opposite of what is going to happen. They're collapsing all stock into a single class. The class you own.

Get. Off. Of. AMC."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So the main thing to think about this is supply and demand, you say you have and MBA in business, so I trust you'll be able to follow along without me having to dive into the intricacies of S&D.

However, it applies here in an interesting way. The first thing you need to do is conceptualize that the number of shares is usually largely fixed. There is normally only a certain amount of stocks in circulation. Can largely be summed up as Total stocks released - those that are unwilling to sell = the total circulation, or the actual float.  When someone shorts a stock, essentially they are adding another subtraction on the amount of floating stock, because they will HAVE to buy that stock back at some point to cover the short, so its already ""claimed.""

You can roughly think of a squeeze as happening whenever Total stock - long term holders - short positions = a negative number. When this happens, the short positions still HAVE to get those stocks, so they have to force the long term holders who would normally never sell to sell, at whatever price they are willing to do so. This is what causes the price to skyrocket. That skyrocketing price in turn causes a lot of the people that would normally be content with selling their share at a normal price to suddenly flip to the long term mentality of ""If you want this stock from me, you will have to pay exorbitantly"" (Demand >>>> Supply), allowing the squeeze to take flight.

By releasing more stock through various mechanisms, yes, they are playing off the sentiment of the people that are already looking to cause that squeeze, but they are actively increasing the first number, meaning those who want the squeeze to happen have to buy up MORE stock, just to keep the percentages the same.

Rising stock prices are great for companies for a couple of reasons. One, it makes your company more attractive to direct investors (loans, senior notes, basically IOUs to the company directly) BUT it also opens up a very attractive option for corporations with high stock values, namely releasing more shares directly to the market. This results in direct funds to the company (essentially is what an IPO is).

As the average investor, you are sortof kindof neutral about this, because while it does reduce the overall value of your shares, it also, as you stated, afford the company the chance to spend said money on things that would also result in the value and share price of the company to go up, such as hiring new execs, investing in new factories, or building digital platforms.

People who are hoping for a short however don't benefit from this, because that is extreme long term. The releasing of new stock, from the short perspective, only forces those who want the short to happen to buy even more of the stock to help the short along."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Who the fuck argues this point. You’re weird.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The issue is the float on AMC keeps changing because they keep flipping new stock into the marketspace through various methods. Every time it gets close to squeezing, they release more. Note, this is not an effort to protect hedges on their part. They are trying to keep their business up and reduce the debt burden on the company, so are flipping a lot of their obligations over to stock and w/n. I'm not saying that this alone is going to tank any hopes of substantial profits from AMC (I alone saw 30% gains from riding AMC's cyclic nature), but it is something that you must keep in mind and weigh before making any decision to invest. AMC has a lot more going on with it than some of the other stocks of focus atm."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"SI is irrelevant.

Amount of float % available is what matters. THAT is the trigger for a squeeze."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"... Google ""AMC dilute shares""

Float now has nothing to do with the float during the gamma squeeze. Also, option chains. Also, hearings. Also, not being a brain dead moron.

You're lucky I'm wasting my time replying to you... since you didn't know AMC already diluted your shares once and clearly aren't aware they're going to do it again."

I assumed the swings were hedge funds manipulating as the charts align PERFECTLY with the GME dips. I feel as if these are coordinated attacks(ladder attacks) but HF. But, if you can prove it's AMC, I'd love to see this data.

2) No such thing as a ladder attack.

3) algorithms trading trending stocks with like-people holding varying degrees of both is **not** evidence of manipulation.

3.5) further evidence of it not being manipulation is the increasing decohesion between AMC and GME. This is absolute bullcrap they are identical. They have been wildly different, to an actual keen eye paying attention to both tickers and the wider market.

3.5.5) It shows people are less interested in AMC (for good reason)"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're missing the point about ladder attacks.  A selling to B selling back to A to close the position is an example on how it could work in a fantasy world, in actuality there is no reason for B to sell back to A.

In actuality it would work something like this:

* A naked shorts and sells it to anyone, doesn't matter who
* Repeat as many times as desired to capitalize on currently high prices, no share is ever borrowed it's completely counterfeited, 100% of the share sale price is profit
* Counterfeit shares need to be bought back within 3 days for normal traders or 21 days for market markers or they end up on the failed-to-deliver list.  Side-note: being on this list doesn't seem to matter at all.
* If they want to kick the can down the road they only have to short again to close the previous positions.  If they think the price is going to go down they can keep doing this forever at no cost (no cost because they aren't borrowing, they're fabricating)

They are fine in doing this if the company goes bankrupt, they never have to reconcile the shares they fabricated.
If the company doesn't go bankrupt it'll take some serious pressure from the SEC to investigate the failures-to-deliver to put any focus on the issue to try to balance things out in the DTCC.  
Bill Ackman has been in years-long lawsuits trying to get similar situations resolved - the SEC is a group of crooks and have no interest in biting the hand that feeds them.

You can call this Qanon tin-foil hatting.  If you believe that Wall Street isn't corrupt I'd lean towards you being the tinfoil hat.  The [counterfeiting stock](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) website explains all of the complexities of how they would attack a company during a short.  

If you want any more proof of how fucked Gamestop is just check out yahoo finance's summary of the shares and shareholders:

* 69.75M total outstanding shares
* 27.33% held by insiders
* 122.04% held by institutions

150% of the shares are already accounted for without even considering any free float.

Dr. Michael J. Bury deletes his tweets all of the time, but they do live for brief moments in time.  He holds 1-2M shares of $GME and a week ago or so he tweeted (I'm paraphrasing): ""I called in my shares of $GME in April of last year, it took them weeks to find my shares.""

This stock is fucked.  I think they fabricated shares thinking it'd go bankrupt and they'd never have to the pay the piper and they are racking their brains


Further, to think that people with BILLons on the line would not manipulate thess stocks makes me questions your beliefs. They are doing it in PLAIN sight, imagine what they are doing behind the scenes. But hey, life is definitely planned on an even field."

There. Is. No. Such. Thing. As. Ladder. Attacks.

Short attacks work by creating uncertainty in the stock and triggering stop losses.

Makes holding a lot easier though."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity has to pay to submit orders, and since it's $0 commissions they'd rather not enter orders that have low chance of being filled (aka over 150% of current price on most stocks)"

2021-03-13 17:30:08,wallstreetbets,Blatant CNBC $TSLA FUD. It’s literally north of 80% IRL 
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Toyota has no straight up EVs they must be including plug in hybrids
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Rest of 41% must be NKLA
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Op you are a retard I watched this on tv and you got it all wrong. They were talking about EV market share, but they wanted to juxtapose it with the current market share for all cars. This was only up for a few seconds to show that Tesla cars make up a small percent of the total car market, either you somehow missed that or just want to farm some karma getting mad over nothing."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"On a guess this is likely a snapshot of total vehicle market share in NA. For instance: https://csimarket.com/economy/Market_Share.php

Approximates these numbers. GM is still way overblown ofc."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,CNBS. They are absolute puppets.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Why are the boomers all so negative? Why can’t the just go along with it?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not give Tesla -10%? Pussies
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck you, GM. I want my Saturn back!

Otherwise, I'm gonna keep buying anybody else."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'll be the FUD Fucker on Tesla. It's just not a very quality product, and the ability to move past a niche brand is extremely hard. Their fit and finish on their vehicles is less then Chrysler. ""and thats a pretty low bar.""  Coupled with increased competition, and a lack of a dealer/repair network, it will cost Tesla more to put a car out then they will make on it.   


So yea, I would be bearish on Tesla stock."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What is FUD?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,lul wtf
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look at Ford and that stock is at a 4 year high.  Its affordable, has upside, and yes I know its a boomer stock.  Not financal advise."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Meh, im still short tesla. I kinda wish I had bought $Rope instead because I didnt close on friday morning like a smart trader would have"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh please do check these numbers and find out for yourself how fast their market shares around the world are falling.

Shrinking market share and shrinking margins."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tesla isn't even primarily a car company. It's an electricity (batteries/solar) and automation company, cars are just a part of it."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,TSLA rolls over 800 next week with stimmies. Little ape buy big fish stonk and big fish buy TSLA
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,They count hybrid as EVs. As a guy who works in a manufacturing plant i can tell you they are very much not the same. You can adapt a very old platform to make a hybrid on it. But EV you need a more modern platform.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I checked the math like 420 times and those numbers do not add up to 100%. Definitely something sneaky happening here
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What is FUD
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"TSLA sold 200,000 cars in the US last year, so this is accurate. Anyone that thinks that Tesla isn’t in the car business must think that most people buy a car and then buy a Tesla, too."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"They're obviously including Hybrids. TSLA is a good company, but their overall reach is tiny because their cars are just not attractively valued for the general car owner without any EV tax breaks. I know Elon understands this and realizes that the battery tech is the vital component to bringing prices down. I just don't know if he's going to be the one to deliver  everyday cars to the masses at scale. Model 3 is a good start though."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Forreal
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm so mad seeing this. I need to start watching CNBC just so I can see the bull shit that is being spread.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,this must be why GM shot up recently
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"yup.

more like,out of total EV, what % do NOT use a given brand"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"uhhh....only one of these companies manufactured, sold and delivered 500,000 truly electric vehicles last year....soooooooooo"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Botched stats; using ‘EV’ sales rather than ‘fully electric’ to ensure hybrids can be included, “As of December 2020, cumulative sales in the U.S. totaled 1.74 million highway legal plug-in electric cars since 2010, led by all-electric cars with more than 1 million units sold.” In 2020, Tesla delivered 292K cars, that’s fkin 30% of the market share, not 2%.... what they fear is that fully electric vehicles will fall in price to be competitive w/ gas powered as you would see Tesla begin to dominate as fully electric vehicles are adopted (in which case Tesla would comprise at least 30% of market share if not continue to grow as other competitors are slow to innovate & lose business)"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Missing 61% from this chart.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,GM and F😂😂can’t think of two shitter car companies
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Boomers are the cancer of this world
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,😂
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it just me or is there alot of Tesla short and distort going around? Have the wolves declared war on Tesla again?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,\*GASP\* The mass media machine lies to the common folk yet again.  Remember the US government ended the ban on domestic propaganda back in 2013.  Question EVERYTHING they report on ...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This must be some twisted headline, the google machine says 79% as of 16 FEB. This may be an EV producing company overall valuation comparison. So apples to oranges. Yes Ford overall is more valuable than Tesla and they both make EV, it doesn’t mean F has more EV market share than TSLA. Nothing to see here just FUD, move along"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,where’s the other 41%...? wtf?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Mainstream media just doesn’t like Elon because he is always fkn around
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I saw this too and scratched my head
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,its 80% for $TSLA lol fake news cnbs at it again
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Cherry picking data...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,FUCK CNBC & JIM CRAMMER.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait 2%, that’s an obvious lie, why they’d bs like that"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is GM so high and the percent doesn't even add up to 100%?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think Tesla is showing as so low because even though they are entirely evs, very few people own Teslas, outside of California and a couple other states, it would be a rare occurrence to see a Tesla, however, Tesla is definitely leading the charge and will continue to up their sales year after year while other companies are slowly trying to phase in EVs"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you add up all the percentage you get 59%. The real question here is if the data is right where is the other 41%? If tsla is at 2% why aren't the other one near the same percentage on there? 

Have they stopped trying to do some good FUD and now they just do shitty one?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,They're actually pushing gm so hard this last week. I'm about done with cnbc to be honest.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you know posting actual fraudulent information is the definition of market manipulation? Someone sue CNBC for damages to the zoo.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. Tesla have a big share of the BEV market. But Toyota, GM ect... have a lot of HEV and PHEV."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hybrids are super  🌈. Imagine paying for a car with both a battery and motor, and an engine, which you gave to service and maintain.

Edit: bUt mUh SaViNgS. How about you just send it and buy a Tesla and pay almost nothing for fuel.

Edit2: anti Tesla boomer brigade ITT. BuT mUh rElIaBilIty. Who ever got a handjob in an accord?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Was thinking the same.  
I've got a Prius (not an EV), my next car will be an EV."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can some one check their sources? In the images it says CITI but I can't see the other half.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Prius Prime is an EV
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean the hydrogen cars are technically electric.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Must live on a hill is a requirement.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It's pronounced Nee**phlegm**holaaj
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,this got it lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,OP doing the real FUD
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I saw this pic on TIC man I don’t watch tv
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It says EV though so if that's true they are lying.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,GM is churning out a lot of Bolts. I see them everywhere now (I have one too)
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I looked up 2019 and the number were similar to what's shown so I think you re right.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"the 1% lost big on tesla, they wanna see it fail"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lead poisoning and lack of critical thinking skills.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Many rich “smart” people like bill gates lost a lot of money on Tesla, and they don’t like Elon."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nothing against the hardware, but calling something that will never be more than level 2 driving assistance ""full self-driving beta"" to consumers and investors up until this week is very misleading."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Also an American car. Isn’t that something boomers love?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,F Saturn. I miss my Firebird.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ford has a lot of future ev sales prices in. I wouldn’t wonder if they miss it in nearest quaters. Same for GM.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah yes, only 5 EV car brands in the world. Gotta be the rigged system"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,They forgot to add NKLA and their 99%
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Fear uncertainty doubt
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,GME hype trigger word for any criticism of your ideas
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah? Who sold more than 200,000 EV‘s. Can you read"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,They will never be the mass produced cars. But if everybody uses their battery tech who cares? They could be the Samsung of cars. Everybody else uses their screens.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"> but their overall reach is tiny because their cars are just not attractively valued for the general car owner without any EV tax breaks.

Is that why demand for their vehicles is so high all the time? And there are waiting lists? Because they're not attractively valued?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Both of those companies are up 40% in the last 6 months, have done quite well for me but maybe it's time to sell"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,We have a 13 year old focus that is still going strong.  It's been great.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea, but that is why TSLA is worth 10x the two of them combined."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I work with a lot of cars, North American cars feel cheap with Ford being the worst culprit. Although the new Mach E looks great they are still legging behind significantly. Tesla’s close, very cheap. Go sit in a 5 series and a model S and try to tell me they feel similar, it’s not even close"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Their r too eyes in shittier
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bruh, small block Chevrolet engines are literally a meme in the car community. EVs are infinitely more simple, and it's just a matter of time until GM or Volkswagen (the two I'm betting on) make a mass market EV for Gen Xers and Millenials once the Boomers die off and stop fucking over the car market with their overpriced unreliable status symbols.



You ain't wrong, but GM makes an ass load of cars every year."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Chevrolet? Lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So that means your parents (or grandparents) are just giant lumps of carcinogenic tumours. Life must have sucked for you growing up. Sorry buddy.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. 100%. Most heavily shorted stock in net terms not relative terms.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,">Yes Ford overall is more valuable than Tesla

Tesla has a market cap of 655 billion
Ford has a market cap of 52 billion
Gm has a market cap 85 billion

Tesla produced around 500,000 cars last year
Ford produced over 2 million.
GM produced over 2.5 million

So the car company that produced the least is only worth 5x the top 2 combined...  seems under valued if you ask me."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"> apples to oranges

But you can still compare them."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nissan probably, leaf sold like crazy

Then Porsche and Kia"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,">	and the percent doesn’t even add up to 100%?

Think it through and you’ll figure it out. Hint: there are more than 5 car companies."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Leave your bubble
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Because GM is the best positioned for EV high capacity at the moment. They have lots of plants and have shown clear direction that they are hyper focused on EVs.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,">Who ever got a handjob in an accord?

*looks at daily driver*

Well shit."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got a number of handjobs in my accord on college. So, there's that."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have owned every Toyota Prius (Non plugin Hybrid) till gen 4, including the intermediate versions. There were ZERO maintenance on ALL of them, except oil change and tires. ZERO."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm issuing a smug alert in this thread.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m a fan of TSLA and want one but I for real do know a guy who’s TSLA wouldn’t start in cold weather in the middle of fuckin nowhere and support was OD rude and unhelpful and hung up on him.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Imagine not understanding why a hybrid is different: no range anxiety. 

Paying ‘nothing for fuel’ takes forever to offset the much higher price, not to mention the shite build quality.

Personally I like the roofs to stay on my cars, and for the bumper to not pop off when I drive through puddles lol"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actual proven Reliability?

Toy has upcoming battery tech."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because Tesla has one of the lowest, if not the lowest, reliability ratings of all ev's? https://thenextweb.com/shift/2020/06/25/study-tesla-likely-us-worst-carmaker-reliability-build-quality-paint-battery/amp/"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,because teslas are junk. terrible quality control.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have two PHEVs, oil change intervals are 20K miles.  Yes you have a ton more parts, but the gas side gets used like 20% of the time.  Think of them as the CFL of EVs, they're a lot more efficient, and suck in their own way, but you're sure as hell but going to buy an incandescent ever again.  They're good for the transitional period between gas and EVs, that's all.  Where I live there's almost no chargers and I watch my friends with a Leaf struggle.  Me?  I charge at home, charge if I can, but it's not the end of the world if I can't get to a public charger.

I'm constantly looking for what will be my next car and it's EV or nothing.  If the rebate starts again then it's pretty much Tesla all the way."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Eh, my 2020 Rav4 Hybrid xse looks sharp as hell with the black 18s and sports package, is pretty damn fast, spacious, and get 38mpg. Idc about buying some fuel, but any other comparable car on the market would have me gassing up almost twice as much and that’s just annoying more than anything."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let us race from Miami to Bangor, you in a Tesla Model S, me in the Accord. I would still win since I don't need to wait ages for that garbage to charge. Not to mention the fact that you will most likely break down on the way lol."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Hybrids are super 🌈. 

Anything that's not an internal combustion engine is super 🌈. They don't even make cool noises. 

Yes, that's my argument"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree with these statements except, Honda accords are great for teenage debauchery."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I want a Tesla in the very near future.... But my Honda insight gets over 40 mpg 7 months out of the year and the maintenance over the last 100k miles has been almost 400$ including tires, which are wayyyyy more expensive on a Tesla. You buy a Tesla for the computer"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have a volt, love it. Tying in a motor/battery to the drive train can give you big gains, instant torque, primarily electricity for commutes, gas for everything else."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You do realize electricity isn’t free?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,">Hybrids are super 🌈. 

What about LaFerrari, p1, 918, nsx, i8, sf90, artura?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,My Fusion is the best vehicle I've ever owned by a landslide.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tesla is still more expensive than getting a hybrid over the course of it's life. Even after calculating all the money you'd ever save on a tesla they still come up short. It's a fucking luxury brand and you're trying to pitch it as a money saver. Oh, and if you need to ever replace the batteries on a tesla that pretty much trumps any savings you might have managed to squeeze out of it."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"my wife's 34 mpg is basically the same cost as tesla to charge and was 5x cheaper msrp...  EV is failing upwards using FOMO crowd marketing such as trend following the idea of TSLA = wealthy; IMO.  Biden nuking the oil production sector will be the only reason this may change to benefit EV ""costs"" (in the short term I might add...)."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It hasn’t been sold for a long time AFAIK.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a plug in hybrid ... 25mile range on battery only .
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Unsubsidized hydrogen is like 3x the cost of gasoline. Electricity for a Model 3 is like 1/3rd the cost of gas for a similar gas car.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I spat out my food reading this comment
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t know what TIC is but it misrepresented what they said on tv. Cnbc is retarded, but they aren’t *that* retarded lol."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh absolutely, I’m just guessing that’s the numbers they are misrepresenting. So they can say “Oh they mislabeled the graphic, it’s not illegal to make a mistake”"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cnbc is a TV channel, so the images move (I know crazy right?)

I watched this on TV and OP is a fucking retard or just wanted to farm some karma. They were talking about market share and then cut to a stat showing all the current market share percentages, they didn’t change the title because it was only up for a couple seconds."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"First time dealing with US media? People have forgotten the ""don't believe what you see on TV"" rule."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"GM beat the Model 3 to the market and started out as a better range v. cost.

They still have never reached 1/10th the sales Tesla did.

It's why I laugh at anyone who thinks Tesla won't be a major player in the EV market for many years to come."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can confirm. Had lead poisoning. Somehow I ended up here though thankfully, and not at CNBC."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How so? Simply from the stock's volatility?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,They only call it “full self driving capability” and so that readily implies that it is capable and on the website it says “coming later this year: turns on city streets” so it’s pretty clear that it’s not done yet. The beta that is out to a select few is very very impressive!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Misleading to whom?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol and the retards still upvote him.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe if you knew what FUD is you'd realize how dumb this comment is

Same deal with extreme heat. I live someplace when it can get to 110F+ in the summer. Normal car batteries do not have any issues with that, but they do degrade faster. Maybe EV batteries hold up better, I have no idea. But if they don't, I bet they are harder and more expensive to replace.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Misleading for people who make up their own definitions for English words.

Autopilot for decades has meant velocity and direction only, and nothing more. It's been used in trains and planes for decades. Autopilot on Tesla is cruise control (velocity) and autosteer within a lane (direction) only. More advanced features are called something else, like navigate on autopilot (which changes lanes by itself to reach a destination), and full self driving capability (which has had disclaimers on the website for years that it will be a while until it's available).

Full self driving specifically refers to the ability for the car to try and drive everywhere a car can go. It is, however, not autonomous. Autopilot in trains and planes never implied autonomous. Autopilot in Tesla never implied autonomous. Full self driving in Tesla never implied autonomous.

There's a good chance that it *will* be autonomous in the future. At that point, Tesla can start selling Autonomous Driving packages instead of full self driving capability packages (which again, do not guarantee autonomous driving and do not suggest it is possible any time soon)."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I heard that regen makes the tires wear a little quicker.  Is that true in your experience?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agree. But read his comments. You think he's one of those DIY guys. He's one of those ""more  number of masks I wear more safe I feel from covid"" type of guys."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,NV here. You guys I believe are usually slightly hotter than we are. Maybe 5-10 degrees.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am sure that is true, and I do believe electric vehicles will become the norm someday. I just think it is further away than many people think."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Interesting. Maybe they are more feasible in the cold than I think.

However, I do wonder how the adoption there is concentrated regionally. Are they as common in the far northern regions as they are in the more southern ones? Also, what is the culture there like in terms of driving? I have only done some surface level research and pretty much all I can find is about their tax incentives with them, not so much about how it has been working out for them in a practical sense."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao how brain dead do you have to be to think the USA is going to create the necessary country-wide infrastructure for this to be possible here. Tesla fanboys are incredible.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,They also don't corner well and imo a car can't be a sports car if there's no gearbox. There's almost no driver involvement in an EV
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I drive a 3 and it’s just as reliable as my sonata and Passat

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I also work in the Auto Motive industry and this doesn't surprise me. Pretty much everyone who been around the block for a long time knows that American cars is not = quality. So i guess Tesla is no different. Personally i cant speak for TSLA myself as i only really drive Volvo's and Volkswagen. Cause those are the cars my company finance for me. Wouldn't call those cars quality either, but at least they have good shelf life. My first car was a used Volvo 480, which was 15 years. My sister still has that car today and it is now 25 years."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, what else does your gas car have? It feels 10% more comfortable on your butt or has a 0.01 inch tighter door gap? Does it have a physical slide out keyboard too, DVD delivery, or physical film too?

Mine can clear itself off of all ice and snow with no wait, even after several inches of snow. Just a quick wipe of the hood and tailgate, and I can drive off. One tap on my phone half a mile away from my car ,before I finish my work day (before work from home), and it's ready to go when I go out.

Mine has magic particles that refuel it from my wall while it sits in my garage with no weekly gas station trip.

Mine is toasty warm when ready to pull out of my garage in the morning.

This isn't a Tesla thing either, even trashy econo EVs are still way better than gas cars and can do all of the above. Those just can't road trip.

I view gas cars just like flip phones now, and the  people who use them the same as the ""My flip phone makes calls just fine, why do I need a smartphone?"" crowd."

Also, if the money saved from not buying gas was offset by repairs costs...even you are suggesting it breaks even in a worst case scenario.

Add onto this that a Tesla 0-60 is ridiculous (ludicrous even). Let's face it, we want our cars to be fun. A Tesla will smoke a pony car off the line. In addition to economy environment etc, Teslas are obnoxious fun to drive.

Your bad reasoning is actually a pretty good sales pitch to buy a Tesla."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's not true either. I'm not going to say they're fast because I worked in the auto industry for 6 years and have driven zo6 corvettes, Maserati's, bunch of BMW M classes, etc. Electric vehicles have no torque curve like petrol motors. They can go from 0 to full power, quite literally at the speed of light. What they're doing is coasting to charge the battery more. If they were to put the petal to the floor, you can get to 60 without much trouble. Again, it's not a corvette or anything, but they're by far not the slowest out there."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Prius has decent a acceleration. I own one. Not like my non performance LR TM3, but decent. Only, the Prius is not happy when you floor it. Whines and screams out loud, but will speed up."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Not if it becomes a super smug front!!! Rabble rabble rabble!!!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That wouldn’t make sense. Regen only comes into play if you are trying to decelerate so I don’t see how it would make tires wear quicker than mechanical braking when used to achieve the same result. As far as the tire is concerned braking is braking no matter which method is used.  On top of that most hybrids and efficiency oriented EVs use low rolling resistance tires which are harder and last longer than regular tires.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wouldn’t doubt that combustion engine vehicles remain in use for quite a while. Decades. EVs will become dominant quickly though, imo."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s anecdotal. The prius (with its batteries motor AND engine) is consistently rated as most reliable car and has been used by taxis since they came out. 

https://www.google.ca/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/6337648002

The sonata also starts at 23k and the tesla 3 35k. 

And sonata is still rated as more reliable.  I’m for tesla. I’d buy a 3. I just wouldn’t go around saying things that aren’t true to justify my bias. Its a fuckin car.

Passats are nice but never even attempted good reliability ratings. And ya I’d own one of those as-well. Love the design."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I drive a chevy Bolt. I leased it for $0 after rebates. I zoom past supercars at red lights. Having electric motors will let you do that. Not unique to Tesla at all.

I leased my car for $0. 3 years, 30k miles. I literally did a one-pay and then the EV rebates paid for it entirely (and then some). 

If course I don't have the ipad or the farting features, but in terms of driving dynamics it's not that much different than the Y I test drove. It's also nice that it's narrow and small because I can park it really easily.

This car is actually pretty damn good for the price, it's definitely not worth MSRP but the dealer never sells it for that much anyways. That's probably why not many people are talking about it."

Also the highways where I live are basically a free for all. Speed limit is 65 most places, but in reality you are merging into 80mph traffic from the on ramp."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hard disagree, from experience."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Some tesla models are 150k that's a rich person car by definition. Because they launched with expensive cars first that's what they are associated with. They have cheaper cars now but they are still more expensive than consumer brands.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m sure it’s a fun little car but the Prius weighs a lot more than Yaris too. Nothing against a Yaris in that regard. HAving 100 lb-ft torque and 100 hp is ok for 2400 lb car I suppose. Put those same specs on a car that weighs 800-900 lbs more and you have a Prius hybrid. Then start putting in passengers and cargo and you have Prius hybrid performance. It’s truly fine but not the rate of performance most people desire. Definitely gets one from point a to point b safe and sound though

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The Prius is geared far different from the Yaris also. Yaris really is peppy but only gets mid 30 mpg. Prius gets much better mileage not only due to the hybrid motor but also the boring gearing
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Rich person car =/= good quality for the price. Tesla isn't a perfect companies but your argument is all over the place.  If you want quality for the price get a Toyota. If you want to burn money to show how rich you are buy a model S and jerk of while getting self driven to your coke dealer.

(IMO)"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"These are not LEAPS, a leap has an expiration that’s at least a year out. July is only 4 months out. Also you don’t have to hit the strike to profit on an option lol you just need the stock to go up and have enough time left to where it’s possible to hit the strike. The sooner the stock goes up the better, and then you can do what I would do and get the F out of that position while it’s still in the green. :)"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"True, but it depends on how GME gets to that strike price. Very slowly over the next three months? He’s fucked, because the IV is crushed. Not at all for two months, then all at once a few days before expiration? He’s doing great, because IV has returned to the level he bought it at.

This week? He did great.

But options on a stock at this high of an IV have an increased risk, and it’s always fun to watch.

Me, personally: I think this is a ballsy trade, and I really hope this guy walks away a millionaire from it. It’s a bit higher than my personal risk tolerance, but that’s the point of the subreddit.

I think that 75% plus chance of profit is an insanely high chance and I don’t personally agree with those numbers."

2021-03-13 16:58:35,wallstreetbets,"GME - option flow by the number - JUST HODL SMOOTH BRAINS **$GME - Option flow by the numbers**Aftermarket close yesterday I was feeling fried - not so much because of GME (-15k on tsla options woof). So I unplugged, and hung out with my family. I’m an Old  Ape. I’m an ape with wife ape, a child ape. I’m an ape that owns a few businesses, and properties. But most importantly - I’m an ape that is completely over the looseness of regulations in securities exchanges, and this ape isn’t fucking selling.Feeling recharged this morning, with a couple cups of coffee - I decided to jump into Option order flow from Cheddar Flow.

&#x200B;

I used the following parameters:3/1 to 3/15 OrdersRemoved everything that has expired and decided to do what gives me comfort as a wrinkle brain ape and just look at the concrete data.

&#x200B;

The Excel sheet I provided shows many things, is it accurate? No - probably not. This ape may have some wrinkles, but is too smooth calculate IV.The bulleted point of the sheet is this (NOT BANANA ADVICE, JUST WRINKLE BRAIN APE LOOKING FOR ANSWERS)

There are: 111,204 Volume picked up in options that have yet to expire - between calls & putsThere is: 538,434 Current option interest on the strikes in this sheet The Average strike price divided by the total number of contracts purchased is 18,665 (this accounts for puts as well as calls)

.Because ape only has some wrinkles, not all the wrinkles I can’t account for IV - but I can account for a banana to banana value at volatility less cost. So ape decided to account for that, to give himself a bigger view of the overall picture.

There was: $24million in buys in deep ITM and slightly OOTM options picked up on 3/4 (ape things hedges for hedges (double fuck you scumbag funds if you’re reading this btw)

On a banana for banana basis ape determined total value of all options right now is 94,854,461 bananas.

So wrinkle brain ape took out the value of the puts, and hedges - and determined that the actual value is 140,017,514 Bananas in value. That’s a lot of bananas. Like a lot.  


 **(( EDIT: $99,965,839 spent on these options. // Shorts/Hedge removed is 116,463,553 ))**  


With ape baseless speculation - I value The shorts/hedge (fuck you again btw) as -45,163,053 bananas. That’s quite a banana deficit before you account for IV and Theta.  


**(( EDIT: -16,497,714 with adjustments to formula  still not sure how to account for IV / Vega / Theta in all of this))**

&#x200B;

Other information I like:65.2 million outstanding sharesshort float is 54.16 million cccording to whale wisdom q4 filings there are 74.474 million shares held (LOL what? More shares than available - keep this in mind),short interest according to Morningstar is 52% . (**EDIT: updated to 26.22%)**

There are currently 8.2 million more shares than outstanding (before apes and dfv of course).Short total should be around 28million shares.**Meaning 36.437 million shares need to be bought in order to cover.**  


**(( EDIT: -22,474,752 total shares to be covered after adjusting SI -))**

**TLDR:** Just fucking holding your shares, they bring bananas.Stop bitching about gamma, stop bitching about options, stop bitching about the day to day - wrinkle brain ape says this. Shit is going to hit the fan. Be apart of history apes.

Go long, and stay strong

\*\*Positions:\*\*Was holding 365 shares, told wife i'd withdraw more money this weekend because she's sketched out as fuck about all of this (bigly bananas up for the year), down to 265 shares now.  with $30k in bananas to continue to add

And the shares must be bought on cash accounts, no margin. With lending prohibited wherever broker has that option enabled.

Look again at Ken Griffin’s testimony to Congress: he says - and emphasises - that options MUST be registered at the ‘public exchange’.

Why did he bring it up? Griffin thought that slipping that titbit into the discussion helped absolve Citadel of accusations of manipulation, because options ‘must be registered at the public exchange’. Because this means the INFORMATION becomes public knowledge and the competing market participants can see it. It’s supposedly transparent and accurate. It allows OP to look at the data and compile this post. 

Now ask the question: which market participants know exactly how many GME shares are genuine, who ‘owns‘ them and how many are ‘synthetic’? Hahaha!

The quants can ‘model the options’, but shares? No chance.

We stand a far better chance of making them miscalculate by buying straight shares."

The average strike price divided by any number greater than 1 should not be $18,665.  It should be somewhere below the average.

Why are you using trade flow to calculate outstanding value when open interest is sitting right there?

The options market is not an indication of shares are shorted.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So we know that the shares outstanding are 67MM. Its also been estimated that like 50MM of these shares are not publicly traded so that makes the float is like 27MM.  Your saying 22MM is the short interest so that is like 80% of the float. It seems likely to me that reddit alone holds 20MM shares and then theres the rest of retail too to consider. Theres also speculation that now well over 100% of the outstanding shares exist because of the creation of synthetic shares. So am i correct in thinking that the 22MM needed to be covered can come from the synthetic shares? But actually this is just prolonging the inevitable short squeeze? However unless there is a share recall or a gamma squeeze, the HFs can prolong forever because of the synthetic shares they have created and they will just hope that reddit paper hands. But if we dont sell, then the squeeze will have to happen at some point. Is a share recall likely to happen?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,so you sold 100 shares (I imagine to cover your initial investment making it a no loss gamble for you if that is the case) & you're telling other apes to hold?

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fellow older ape appreciates your wrinkles.

That's all good work.

I had done a much more simpler calculation about a week ago on so looking at the public end of the float and: 

If I had to throw a number at it based off of just the vacuum that is reddit - and let's pretend for a moment that reddit represents 70% the world public portion of the float.

GME has 163K members - let's say 90% there have an average of 5 shares = 733k. I would presume that /GME would represent the die hard fanatical diamond hands for the stonk, thus the super high assumption of 90% ownership within just that sub. GME came out of WSBnew which came out of WSB.

WSBNew has 799k members - let's say 50% there have an average of 5 shares = 2 Million

WSB has 9.4M members - let's say 25% there have an average of 5 shares = 11.75M

So /GME+/WSBNew+/WSB = 14,483,000. Now...multiply that out by 1.3 - and - well, there it is: 18,827,900.

That number was from last week. Since then, WSB has added another 100K members, WSBNew has added another 3K, and GME has added about 31K.

Also - if apes are doing their only two jobs that they have (buy and hold)...(LOL I actually averaged up right during the monster dip on Wed), then that 19M has only grown. 22M?"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"All short interest reports are incomplete because it was not an important metric to use until now. 

We only know that FINRA was the most reliable barometer of short float and they posted 140% float shorted which was reporting that is only from dark pool exchanges. 

That doesn't include other exchanges short percentages.

Also market makers can move their order flows around to different exchanges and cover shorts with the same share multiple times.

So all short interest is unreliable data.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you're not in yet, I would buy as many as you can next time it is at $40. I sure as hell will be. FOMO buying is generally not a good idea. But this is not financial advice.

A few weeks ago, if you said this would be at $265 again, most people would have told you to gtfo. Now people are complaining it isn't at $300. I was a bagholder at $230 last time. Once it was down to $40, I couldn't believe I had spent $230/share. It's all relative. Some people think $265 is still a bargain, but once it deflates, $265 will seem crazy again. All I'm saying is buying in at $265 is a definite gamble -- obviously if it ends up squeezing, a great gamble. But you could buy way more shares once things settle down, and be ready for the next run up."

Their problem is no one knows how many ‘real’ GME shares are in whose hands at any one time. The synthetic share problem.   


That’s why I wrote above, we need to buy shares and hold. The more time goes by, the stronger your claim of ownership of shares consolidates and becomes impossible to ignore. Whereas at the instant you ‘buy’ GME shares, no one is completely sure exactly what you bought! It’s a game of TIME."

Some feedback for OP: if someone tells you your content is garbage, don't say ""if that's a problem .. move on"" and ""I was looking for answers"" in the same breath. It comes across as defensive and closed minded -- basically saying 'I'm open to feedback, but minor tweaks only please because I'm pretty sure I'm 99% right.""

I get it: it sucks to massively miss the mark. That's your ego getting ass fucked by your wife's strap-on while she sucks off her bf. It's a hard pill to swallow (no pun intended).

Could the other guy have delivered the original message a teensy bit nicer? Maybe. I didn't think it was anything to get butt-hurt over but others seem to think so. Personally, I'm more interested in the truth than how it's delivered. I probably have a bit of a humiliation kink too.

Lot of difference between ""hey I noticed some mistakes, here's how to fix them"" and ""fuck you and your analysis"". They also wanted to move on from Gme a month ago yet here we are. Will it moon? Who knows, but this person is, for a fact, a dick."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The initial flaws:

1. Options aren't shorts
2. Volume isn't open interest

Because of this the rest of it is moot.

You make statements like 

> There are currently 8.2 million more shares than outstanding (before apes and dfv of course).Short total should be around 28million shares.Meaning 36.437 million shares need to be bought in order to cover.

But you don't know that they haven't already hedged their positions.

Again, options is *not* stock shorting, this is the options market which I and many others participate in to generate wealth.  Just because somebody doesn't believe in the over-hype doesn't mean they're short.  I wouldn't be that hesitant to buy PUTS on GME because with the right expiration they will absolutely print money.  I assume since you've dug up option flow that you are knowledgeable enough to understand how MM's delta-hedge positions with the goal of ensuring that by the time the closing prices exceeds the strike for calls they've sold, that they own 100% of the shares required to cover.  Gamma is acceleration and if they are over-exposed during a market with poor liquidity gamma's impact on their delta's enters them into the infinite feedback loop that they need to escape to control their hedging risk - this is one of the reasons circuit-breakers exist, to allow the market makers to re-base and determine how to get ahead of gamma since it's their job to make the market they should at least be protected from chaos.

There is far more at play here than 99% of you seem to realize.  This play was identified by HNWI's in December and it was executed in January.  There is evidence that the investment banks offered the shorts an exit-strategy that didn't end up in a squeeze and the shorts refused to take it - then the stock squeezed.   I don't pretend to know what's going to happen next here but many of you are very disillusioned into thinking that you hold the HF's hostage.  They are protected.  They were protected when the brokers stopped allowing buying and their positions are protected now because they aren't just going to let that happen again.  These people aren't stupid, maybe greedy, but they understand how the market works and have access to information and liquidity that retail does not.  It's not as simple as pulling option flow or yahoo finance data and going all CSI on it.  

Long story short: Calculate and estimate all you guys want, I don't mean to rain on your parade but enough with this confirmation bias."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that'd be helpful.

This stuff isn't a guarantee, I'm being a bit saucy, but if you had the dough for those expensive ITM calls you'd def be contributing to gamma that is pushing towards moon. The unfortunate part is they are very expensive. Buying $26,500 ITM contracts isn't for your average trader. It's def not for me."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I made the script. You are correct on what pain is in this context . Just one of the many considerations I make when trying to time trades since I'm more into thetagang than gambling.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This isn’t a debate. Morningstar is using 27M as the float when it is actually 54.5M as you yourself quoted. Thus their 52% number is inaccurate. Period.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate your feedback. I don't think options are shorts - i think the deep ITM options are a hedge for the shorts. The reason I quoted Volume is because i just wanted to know how much money is being thrown into this pot and I don't have access to any better source of information - will gladly take advice or suggestions on where to find it.

I'm also not playing options, I think that's a gamble that's not worth taking unless you're buying ITM verticals and selling OOTM calls to capture premium. 

I would caution anyone to only risk what they're comfortable losing. I have pulled out enough in gains this year to pay off my student loans, my mortgage, and keep my checking account at twice the value of my trading account.  I'm in a position where the end result is kind of meaningless for me, and i'd like to see this through - but will do so by holding my equity.

Not trying to go all CSI haha, i just wanted to look at real information and real flow.

Since i primarily day trade, i use option flow as barometer for the levels i'm trading - i find my targets, and use the flow and dark prints to give some confirmation.

I do find it curious that some large funds (blackrock, morgan stanely, for example) increased their holdings in q4, but also realize that this data is now old and those positions could be very different.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think deep ITM calls make any sense for HF's covering shorts, I think it's more likely they were purchased by HNWI's or HF's that want MM hedging to propel the stock price upwards.

I still the trade has some legs to it for the next few days - I'm still in but I think people need a reality check on this one.  People buying-in at $265 with money that they can't afford to lose thinking that shares are going to $1000 is a sure thing is just poor risk management.  Maybe it will, I hope it does, but from my analysis if it doesn't happen this week I strongly doubt the trade will continue to be profitable from these entry-points.  

The problem is, and this is where I take issue with your analysis (and others as well) is there is no way to be accurate and such analysis propagates the belief that the hive wants to hear: HF's are short a % of float that isn't tenable and the squeeze is still on.  Just as much as I can't say that it is, I can't say that it isn't, I accept that, but I tend to be believe the results from S3 partners who does this for money and has clearly stated that the SI is below 20% at this point in time.  In this sub stating these thoughts is considered shill behavior, which is scary itself.  ""Don't fight the crowd"" is going to lead to a lot of disillusion and bag-holding.  The number of ""Why $100k isn't a meme"" posts that get upvoted into the stratosphere scares the shit out of me for some of these young traders.  In reality while the SI is estimably still high, it isn't necessarily squeeze-material without more capital - and how much more capital is going to be thrown into this?  When the shorts can borrow shares at 1% annual interest and ladder-attack the price down to price-pins that limit their risk to prices where they've sold calls/puts in order to pay for their borrow cost.

That's where my graphic from earlier comes into play.  3/19 has an incredible amount of open interest.  The value of all open interest is in the billions, whereas every date following this Friday pales in comparison.  This is an important message - if you're still in after this week, your odds are significantly worse than they are this week."

Feel free to ping me and I can check BB if I’m sitting at my computer.

is the biggest take-away I have from what i was looking at as well, and the reason i watch the order flow is because I believe that monday can make or break us. If we're not seeing high OI and money being poured into - then I agree it can go back into hibernation mode. I started picking up shares again between 42 and 46 this round - and it's entirely possible that we go right back down.

i have no idea what's going to happen, I think anyone entering options right now without a clear plan or strategy is destined to lose money - why even set a date on this? 

I really want to see what happens with earnings, but like anything else - it could be a nothing or it could be battery day 2.0 

If we're not seeing major moves on monday, it's definitely bleaker.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,">confirmation bias 

this is what it is and when its found to be bullshit people need to be brought to reality because youll only go deeper down the rabbit hole. 

WSB is wholesome yes, but being wholesome about someone giving a bunch of completely false information about money that could make or break people.... This has always been the nature, to quell retards enough to let the true autists shine"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah, so being an asshole to someone trying to provide DD is protecting people from themselves. Not the actual correction itself.

There's a difference in deliberately misleading and posting inaccurate info. Since that line can be* blurred, I'd bet on changes being made to the OP through productive callouts rather than just being a dick.

I've never said OP shouldn't be corrected. It's just unnecessary to try and belittle them in the process.

I didn’t get no picture of goat 

I didn’t get a pen pal friend to write to be about the goat 

I didn’t get any updates about the goat if it was turned into goat jerky or he made cheese

I told mum she was scammed

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"These guys seriously need it, too. Mountain gorillas are in a precarious position right now and it looks bleak. That coupled with the fact that it takes a long time to sexually mature, it takes a long time to reproduce, and their investment in raising their young is very long so they only have a newborn once every several years. It gets harder and harder for them to recover their population, and the extinction snowball starts earlier, rolls faster, and is more difficult to stop. 

It's a similar problem that orangutans are facing in Indonesia because palm oil plants are tearing down the  forests faster than the orangutans can bounce back from. 

I literally wouldn't care at all what anyone names them. If there was a sudden flood of money then it would be worth it considering it might literally save a species."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Are there any ways to donate and adopt an orangutan?

That's from orangutan.org, the organization founded by Birutė Galdikas, who is arguably **the** leading authority on orangutans and is the woman who pioneered their research. She was also a ""Trimate"" and was counterpart to Dian Fossey (gorillas, obviously) and Jane Goodall (chimps)."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Think Birute Galdikas has an org for it. In fact, all three Leaky's angels (Dian Fossey, Birute Galdikas and Jane Goodall) have respective organisations for Gorillas, Orangs and chimps respectively. Any money going to them is worth it."

The first image is balance history. The 2nd and 3rd images are the positions and cost basis for 2 accounts as proof.

I entered GME with only 100 shares at $244. GME plummeted the next day. I bought another 100 shares. Two days later, it sank to $65. I went in deeper and kept 20-30% of my capital on the side.

It turned out better than expected. Thanks to the community!"

Please consider talking to an actual financial advisor who you have to pay if you think the play I listed below might be of interest to you.                

If you have made significant gains in your retirement account, have you ever considered using your retirement account to buy a property? I’m not 100% sure about the legalities, but I’m pretty sure if you already own a house you can buy it back from yourself at a reduced cost via your Roth and claim a loss(likely has to be within reason after being appraised). That way if you make $300k per year, you can deduct your taxable income to $50k while buying your $500k house for $250k(assuming you can find a reasonable appraiser that is willing to claim the property is on the lower side of valuations). In short, you might be able to keep your house in a retirement account/trust, pay less income tax this year, and still have significant amounts of cash in your bank account that would’ve been tied to a retirement portfolio assuming a significant portion of your mortgage has already been paid off."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean probably, but at that point the market is a bit of a side effect lol.  Plus if the dollar collapses other exchanges could still bolster stock prices I think?  I mean it would totally fuck the nyse and stock prices in general but China would just take over.  The Chinese exchange wouldn't suffer as much.  Pretty sure thats what the great reset is, the fed has to know they've lost and the usd is dead and the neverending stimulus packages where the print free money is just morphine for the dying currency and eventually the whole thing will collapse.  I think they're just printing and giving away money to buy up all the real estate and means of production and assets and by the time it trickles down to normal people the whole system will collapse.  Maybe not, but that's kind of what I'm seeing.

Edit:  like they print this money and these corps get to spend it at face value that day but then when its in circulation, that's when the hyperinflation hits."

2021-03-13 16:40:51,wallstreetbets,"Wanda AMC hypothesis AMC filed Wanda's intent to convert it's class B shares into class A shares on Feb 5th to the SEC. AMC's CEO recently stated that this was triggered by share dilution causing Wanda's majority shares fell below 30% and currently only sits at 9%. On March 10th it seemed like shares appeared out of nowhere and the cost to borrow rate plummeted. If you assume that the filing becomes official on the first business day after filing then it would have been official Feb 8th. If you count 30 days from Feb 8th then it would be March 10th. On March 10th it seemed that shares appeared out of nowhere and the cost to borrow plummeted. 

Is it possible that Wanda had a 30 day period where they weren't allowed to sell shares? As a matter of fact it seems that Wanda may have sold ALL their shares all together. Motley Fools' website lists institutional ownership as of March 13 and Wanda isn't listed at all. 

Another thing I read is that Class B shareholders are the last to receive any compensation if the company goes bankrupt. Why would Wanda ok the dilution of AMC's shares knowing it would cause them to lose the majority control they paid 2.6 Billion dollars for? Could it be that AMC fully anticipated going bankrupt prior to the reddit rally? I know that hypothesis doesn't jive with what was said in the shareholders meeting but I don't think anything they said necessarily disproves anything I've hypothesized. Nor would anything they said be a lie. They did very specifically point out that Wanda's position was held as of March 3rd. 

Why is March 3rd significant? That is 30 days from Feb 1 which is the day that the original reporting states that Wanda announced to AMC they would be converting shares. Would the same 30 day rule apply? They had to wait 30 days to disclose to the company their intent to sell and then 30 days from the SEC filing date to officially sell?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What are you getting at? Buy more AMC?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hmm it’s very possible Wanda sold. As you said borrow cost plummeted and shares available spiked. Or that was due to shareholder meeting. We’ll see in the next quarterly filings or if they file an amended 13D. 

Either way people should assume Wanda has or will sell. They went from being a majority owner to owning 9% of the shares. They are not in this for the long haul.  

It will be peak retardation if this sub ends up paying Silver Lake $16 for their shares and Wanda $12 for their shares."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wanda vision?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So i think a lot of big dogs went from bankrupt amc and gme and then saw the public is like no way we love video games and movies, there not gonna take this from us!!!! And we all bought then they had to switch there positions....u cant fight what the public wants , so now NO bankruptcy, they now have money and public support of reopening, and now everyone is on board for it going up.....my opinion im just an 🦍"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Okay a great theory ! But my issue with that would be why did GME drop the same exact time ? Or is there no relationship there ?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wonder how long the share recount they're doing will take. It'll be interesting
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the DD
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well it's kind of nice that China no longer controls the voting shares of AMC.  So now it's just class A shareholders that control the vote.  So based on my half assed reading of an article a few days ago, you could in theory buy half of all the shares of the company and then you'd could control a company losing billions a year with a questionable business model post Covid.    But hey that could make up for the four or five times dilution of AMC stock over the past year, someone could want to own a theater chain.  Market cap is relatively small, I know there are antitrust laws not allowing it but what if a studio bought them out.  Maybe a streaming company, maybe a social media company wants new offices.    Again I'm just thinking out loud, I'm just wondering why shares are above two dollars.  I no longer think that shares will fall to the five or six dollar level anytime soon.  And that's why I always had puts on AMC the past two month, five bucks or below seemed like it's natural level."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I think he's saying buy Panda Express so you can read the fortune cookie and forecast the stock price

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"But now they diluted their shares by four or more(now that Wanda converted their shares) times since that time.  So right now it's being valued as a 44 dollar company.

But on the flip side, I cant tell you how many times I've sold out of a great company after a pop with the intention to buy the dip, but then the dip never comes.

Those kinds of posts almost never get made here, but there are plenty of people that bought into GME at $20 and sold at $30 thinking that they were geniuses, nothing wrong with that, but they missed out on the truly life changing gains.

Good luck trading boys!"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How did you identify this as an opportunity?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha yeah it’s a touchy subject when you sell GME. But as long as you find ways back in, less hate. I truly believe it can reach 1000/share. Therefore I’m playing chutes and ladders but always making sure I have some skin in the game before the “big one.”"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because many people on here are unironically stupid af and want the memes to succeed more than their wallets. This will get downvoted to hell by the same people reading this, lmao"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah absolutely. I’m a complete open book here and happy to give any info of what it took. I saved up 60k in my savings for years. Once I saw this opportunity, I bought tons of call options for GME when it was around $14/share. Then I sat there a patient as possible. Once it got to numbers I could barely believe, I started scaling out piece by piece. The first squeeze has allowed me to now disperse my investments instead of all my eggs in one basket. I’m very big on PLTR and got in on TLRY real early. I do believe BB will make a big impact in the future and I have always been a fan of DKNG (mostly bc they took a lot of sports betting money from me haha)."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I was upset. Set my sell limit @ 360 at Tuesday close because of Fidelity's 50% BS which I just keep bumping up as the stock increases. It was $12 away from triggering the sell during the spike and could've bought back in at $230 when I looked at my phone again. RIP

2021-03-13 16:09:07,wallstreetbets,"Get away from the screen for a minute... Hey everyone, it’s been a stressful week staring at GME for the entirety of the week, the past few weeks. 

Here’s some ideas on how to destress: 
- Go for a walk in the Forrest, woods or just around the city. (Depending on where you live)

- Feed the homeless 

- Talk to the Humane Society about volunteering

- Listen to your favorite music while on a drive 

- Call your mom/dad for a chat, they probably miss you

- Thank someone who helped you in the past

- If you were a paper handed boy, Donate some 
tendies to help your community. 

- If you are a Diamond Handed Man, donate some money to your community (GME will pay you back in the near future)

- Learn to knit

- Paint something, and it doesn’t even have to be good because “there’s no such things as mistakes, just happy accidents.”

- “Don’t forget to tell these special people in your life in your life just how special they are”

Seriously though, get your face out of your screen. You only have one life to live, enjoy yourself. 
I love you all the same way my wife loves her boyfriend. Take care tards’"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,1. It wasn't stressful 2. You forgot bj's

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,FedEx lets gooooooo
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,FedEx and ocugen are the only ones I recognize. I’m expecting FedEx to beat earnings. They the best play for the week?

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Always a pleasure
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,But u have to buy right before. Usually they go up right till earnings then good numbers come in and it tanks.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So far it has earned me negative $500

Does that help?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s like waving a flag and saying you’re new. Sometimes the best play is the one no one is talking about. 

Best to do DD on a few you don’t recognize and then watch what happens. It’s a good way to learn and start to get a feel for things."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,who the fuck doesn’t recognize Nike??? 🤨

Ah ignorance breeds malice."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is hilarious. If you don’t know what earning reports are, you are going to have a bad time trading my dude."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I always enjoyed earnings threads before, but retards like you that don't know what an earning report is are my favorite addition to them"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,GME earnings are on the 23rd........

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wasn’t saying it in a dick way there’s just soooo many new people with only 1 stock in sight that I started defaulting to assuming someone is about to destroy their account. 

I was playing dollar general for a run up to earnings but gave up on it. I’m curious on how it’ll play out. Duluth is a weird one that sometimes goes up after earnings - it can really surprise people. 

Crowdstrike will probably blow earnings out of the water and tank 7%, I think Nike will tank after also only because last time they soared and more people will be in it. Very curious on how MP behaves also."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wasn’t being a Dick either. Am relatively new but do genuinely like a bit of actual discussion between shitposting. 

But there’s been a pattern of shit tanking after killing earnings, which is beyond my ape-level cognitive ability to figure out."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,All good! We can never have enough weekly earnings threads in here though. :D
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s the “priced in” type of thing mixed with the volume of people that expect that a company will do well and buy in only for that short period of time. Playing earnings is so hard for that reason. Especially with options because the IV goes down which lowers your profitability even if it does do well. It’s simply because most people will buy before earnings and not want to buy after, after earnings they want to sell."
2021-03-13 15:40:13,wallstreetbets,"Late to post in the lunch time rally earlier this week, but I think this is a sign for me to change my license plate "

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve been eh with Tesla.  Things looked great until July 2020 where I gave back a lot of my profits from the JPow speech 🌈🐻
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That did cross my mind, but was debating on hold since it’s a stock"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"My #1 rule for tesla is, never sell. I made the mistake in early 2020 and missed out on hundreds of thousands of dollars in profits. Have been basically holding ever since it was at $600 (pre-split) and will keep holding for the next several years. My first buy in TSLA was back in 2012 when the stock was at $29/share lol shoulda just held the entire time 😫"
2021-03-13 15:39:00,wallstreetbets,"CNBC's new spin on how short sellers are important to the market because they can expose fraud. They don't mention that firms like Citadel, Point72, and Melvin can use short selling to commit fraud. "
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think it's more interesting that discount brokers can borrow your shares out from underneath you without telling you (they literally hand your shares over to a short seller who then immediately sells them back to the broker, making a notional entry in the broker's order book that the short seller owes them the ""borrowed"" shares and then the broker immediately turns around and re-lends these exact same shares to another short seller... wash, rinse, repeat until you have 170% of the float tied up in short interest order book entries)

...and when their short selling spirals out of control, they can limit market activity outside of exchange circuit breakers until their risk has been managed down to a point that their short counterparties aren't going to need to file for bankruptcy.

Next, let's talk about the DTCC failure to deliver corruption."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you have a cash account it should be automatically illegal for your broker to lend your shares to shorts, should be an opt in imo"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"They're astroturfing the damage control for what's right around the corner.

Short selling, in theory, should be fine. But concealing FTDs to dig deeper is madness. They thought for sure gamestop would go bankrupt so they'd never have to buy back the shares they sold 5-10x over. 

Once the story is out, confidence in the markets is in for some serious shit. Their whole house of cards was built upon a thesis of profiting off struggling companies until forcing their failure. That's a fucked up financial philosophy down to the core and it needs to end."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,let's short CNBC
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The ""game theory"" or whatever you call it is kinda shady regarding all short selling.

On a small practical level...

John has a carpet cleaning company.  He has a parking lot full of vans.

I ""bet"" they wont do well in the coming months.

I pay some yahoo to go set their fleet on fire.

I guess I won the bet, eh?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I could read, this would be my message to the CNBC-muppets:  


No-ones arguing about abolishing short-selling, only that it needs to be more transparent and that shorting more than the existing float should be illegal. It's the same as diluting a stock by stock-emissions except the company the stock represents did not issue it. In that context, shorting more than the existing float is fraudulent by nature.  


That said, please tell your hedgie friends to short GME more, I want a discount on the dip!!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Does cnbc have an app with 4.3 stars rating? Asking for a friend
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You expect main stream media to be honest?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Begging the basic follow up question which I’m sure wasn’t asked: so what fraud fraud was exposed by shorting GME 140% of its float?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You dont need short sellers to expose fraud you could just INVESTIGATE fraud, you could PROSECUTE fraud."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I ditzed around in the market for years and religiously watched CNBC.

But I only began to make serious money when I decided to turned CNBC off and rely on the internet for my information."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,i always knew the media was owned.. This journey we are on has really drove it home for me. I no longer even watch or so much as read an article. I buy stocks in companies i believe in and turn the bullshit off.. 💎🙌🏻 GME/PLTR/NVDA/PYPL/SQ. my shit is not for sale. 🦍🥂🍤
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The analogy used is completely incorrect.  ""It’s like if you took out an insurance policy against your neighbor’s home and your neighbor’s home was destroyed.""

It's more like you buy a condo in a 100 unit complex for $100,000 expecting it to appreciate.  One massive hedge fund thinks this is over valued then ""borrow"" 50 properties and sells at $100k. Two more hedge funds Jump in for 100 more properties driving the price down as panicked owners begin to sell.  They now are selling 150 properties of a 100 unit condo, but it's all okay.  The price goes down to $50k and they close their positions.  The price goes back up and it starts all over again.  This would never be allowed with real property. 

Naked short selling is an unfair trading practice that must be stopped.  Either short selling is for intraday trading only or Actual borrowed shares must be accounted for in real time or the position has to be closed and transferred into a put option with a definitive expiration date."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait, they expose fraud by getting caught committing fraud?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Short selling isn’t unethical and IS a vital part of the market. Look at companies like Theranos and what Elizabeth Holmes potentially could’ve gotten away with if she was never held accountable. Granted other forces ended up taking them down but ethical short selling does exist and is vital to the market.

The problem is you have fucksticks like Citadel, P72, Melvin, etc that are naked short selling. Naked shorting allows for us to be in this situation, where there were/are more shares than the company has issued. That is unethical and only exists due to a loophole in the system."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Short selling is used to create fraud significantly more often than it is used to prevent it. Think about Bill Ackman going on CNBC last year and this year to cause panic and buy dips... literally goes on tv, stock plummets, he makes tons of money on puts, and reverses into long positions but won’t talk about it until his positions are filled in again which would likely drive momentum higher. CNBC and the people that go on that are fraudulent in my opinion and I truly feel that on a daily basis you can see fraud being portrayed within the channel.        

Short selling should be banned. Puts should be sold by people who feel like they are buying a stock at a cheap price if it fell to that price and not sold by a corporation looking to delta hedge the position. You can allow buying and selling of puts while banning short selling!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The irony is WSB has no problem with short selling at all. Just a year ago this sub was eight hours of drill gifs and DD about which companies to short to oblivion. The hand holding circlejerk is just a fad until the next dump.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,CNBC being good lapdogs as usual
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is not even funny how they all lie openly, everyone in charge knows they are lying, yet the fucks turn their airheads away to make it disappear. I guess if everyone looks away the crimes disappear? The shear brazen corruption is absolutely sickening."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Never trust the media
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Imagine discovering fraud, and instead of reporting it to the news or police so action can be taken, your first thought is to short the company so you can benefit from the fraud.

It would be like if you research into finding people who are at risk of a heart attack, not so you can treat them, but so you can know who to take a life insurance policy out on.

These people are psychopaths."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Short selling is important to the market.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Why are you people still giving them attention? Every click is revenue for the network you despise
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Is there a way we can short CNBC?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56357526 look a not completely bearish news article on RH news feed. Makes me nervous.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Of course. Some short sellers actually do this. A great example and someone to applaud and follow would be Fahmi Quadir Safhket Capital. Had humble begins like many of us, and does have an activist approach. Was harassed and threatened for exposing wirecard.

Than you have citron. As someone pointed out every prediction they had or many of was wrong and based on hearsay. They tanked NIO's price but NIO is a good company. There claims on GME were unfounded and unsubstantiated."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy shit - it’s amazing that these news networks will just throw their reliability right out the window.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,They’re not wrong
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess they chose to overlook Point72’s insider trading scandal.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"They are not wrong here.  Short sellers in aggregate getting bad wrap.  WSB is fucking dumb sometimes and doesn’t understand much.  The big shops shorting fuck over the good ones.  The big shops are not short shops they run a new neutral book often.  Many actually short firms put in real hard work to expose fraud, which is a good thing.  If short selling was outlawed or continues to be attacked as it is, there will be much more fraud companies as it is not worth it for short shops."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"They fill no function. Yes if you short a company that commits fraud it is good business. But you're still only doing it to earn money on other peoples expense. But when you short a legit company because you think you can make some money, you're only helping yourself at the expense of others.

Now i am not saying short selling should be illegal. But imo, there should be more regulations, since the fact that gamestop got shorted more than 100% shouldn't even be possible."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you really think they would say anything like that?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You do know that this happens pretty regularly, right?  Look up who exposed Lukin Coffee's fuckery (It was Muddy Waters Research).  Or the whole Penumbra thing (QCM).....  Or Nikola's fraud (Hindenberg).  But short selling is for more than just exposing fraud, it's a valuable tool in price discovery, and hedging.  

But noooooo all you fucking smooth brains want to completely ban short selling.  Great let's see how well that works out for you during the next bear market when you try to hedge your over-leveraged ass w some index puts.....  Fucking sharty-pants retards."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not spin. Short sellers are incredibly important to the market, and this recent GME-driven ""shorts are evil"" thing pushed by novice traders is dangerous.

You say ""they don't mention how hedge funds can use shorts to commit fraud,"" but that's nonsense. They can also use longs to commit fraud, too. 

Fraud is fraud, and it's a separate issue."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Short-sellers do have that function. It’s true. But GME is an extreme.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It's pretty dumb lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s like the rich people and their friends who own and run hedge funds are the same people and friends who own and run NBC.... or something something charlie sheen wolverine shrink to the size of a lima bean.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"How does shorting expose fraud? It’s not like a company will go out and say ”We admit it, we commited fraud” just because it loses a certain % of its worth"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,They dont mention that Steve Cohen was all but indicted for insider trading.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"A key part of shorting strategy is to manufacture FUD and send “analysts” to the media to share lies and misinformation. 

We have Cramer admitting to doing this directly on tape although not exactly revelatory information, it’s nice to see Jim say it in his own words."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can commit. No my friend they did commit. Steve Cohen’s entire net worth exists because of fraud and evading the SEC. dude has been dirty since the 80s but because he’s Teflon he keeps getting away.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, the headline itself is not completely wrong. But when you short sell 140-250% of the float, are you REALLY doing it for price discovery, or are you sitting on your ass on Wall St. wringing every red cent out of 50k+ American jobs."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,short selling isn’t fraud. Naked shorts are. Nothing wrong with betting the share price is gonna go down. But doing so with no intention of covering? That’s NAGL.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,SYNTHETIC / NAKED  shares are being used to Manipulate the market on a Daily basis. Gamestop Board  of Directors needs to call ALL shares in. Let's just see how much a single share will be really worth then. 4-5-6 digits.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Short sellers stop the fall of a stock by covering. Short selling is a valid mechanism
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean yes, outright banning short selling can lead to stuff like china stock market which always go up no matter what. BUT the current way of short selling, its been abused for method of killing companies for profit then actual benefit of discovering fraud like Enron, housing market of 2008, etc. hedge funds should use it for its actual purpose, calling out fraud of companies and value way too high, rather then trying to kill struggling weakened companies."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think with a few significant legal tweaks short selling would be a fine strategy.

As it is now though, it is just predatory."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"They will never come out and admit that they naked shorted GME into the ground. Naked shorting is fraud, and disrupts the basic law of supply and demand.

GME was supposed to hit $0 and they would run off not paying tax or having to deal with all of the counterfeit shares they pumped into the market. 

What is happening now is the direct result of this backfiring on a MASSIVE scale. They didn’t take into account that the access to trading and information available to general public is much much better than it was in 2008. 

They have made a grave mistake and unlike in 2008, we KNOW what should happen from this before the damage has been felt. They are fucked. All eyes are on them, and one wrong move could shatter all trust in the market.

Every news agency pumping this false narrative is going to feel the impacts from this as a generation moves away from their business. Boomers are dying and a generation much more in-touch with today’s media trickery is moving in."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Shorting is awesome.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This isn’t wrong in theory.... but like much of our system it’s transformed into something very different and grotesque.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, short selling IS completely essential for price discovery and a healthy market. Otherwise stocks would basically only go up, lol.

One thing is the shady practices that Melvin and some hedge funds do, another thing is short selling which literally anyone, any retail investor CAN and SHOULD do (you, who are reading this, included). Otherwise you are only taking advantage of a bull market and never a bearish one... I don’t understand why someone would only take advantage of 50% of the market? Don’t mix things, please."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"As far as I understand it, short selling artificially dilutes the market cap. A single share can be bought, then short sold, then bought, then short sold, repeating the cycle thereby creating multiple copies of the same share. If I am misunderstanding this because of my retardedness, then correct me. So of course, it will create a downward pressure on the stock. Anything, other than more share offering from the company, that dilutes the market cap doesn't sit right me. It makes my shares worth less through dilution of market cap."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I've never understood the logic that short selling exposes fraud. That's like my rationalizations that cookies are a health food because the flour is made from wheat.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well they are right about short selling being an important activity of a healthy market, because it promotes price-discovery and liquidity to large extent. 

Think about a rich CEO who’s inflating his own net worth by manipulating his own company’s through aggressive buying, for instance.

If you BELIEVE in a stock you can BUY IT WITH CASH. That's it! Now you OWN it. 

If you DON'T BELIEVE in a stock you can SELL IT, even though you don't own it, and BUY IT LATER CHEAPER (you hope). 

Shorting stock increases the float of the stock artificially. You can't do that by BUYING shares. Shorts have a weird advantage that their selling can dilute the real buyers/holders of long positions.   


If you want to be against a stock then a) Buy Puts and b) don't buy the stock. Fraud will be revealed eventually and shorts aren't saving anyone money. In fact their blatant media manipulation and mis-information is ripe for fraud and mis-leading statements. I'd rather they just left entirely."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shorts are in to capitalize on a failing business. If the world was perfect & none of them ever failed, the ultimate shorts couldn’t take place that have maximum capitalization in gains. Also, when a stock isn’t functioning properly, the price point will get manipulated, hello GME.

My point i’m making here, I will never short. You are at infinite risk, that is a position you never want to be in. If you have a decent moral compass, you wouldn’t try to get rich over ruining someone’s job or company. This can lead to real & possible forever repercussions. Yes, someone will tell me to calm down, some people short for a price down, whatever, screw all that risk.

What I absolutely love about GME, it is a battle ground. The boomers & the seasoned traders & investors like me know in the back of our head that retail will eventually lose on GME. That is because the fundamentals aren’t clicking here but you know what? Forget their prescribed notion that things have to be operating normally.  Nothing about GME is normal. The people that want retail to lose are scared of the change, not the results. We don’t care if you all get rich off GME, that is great. What they want is long term stability, not a shakeup of shorting that was suppose to work because the fundamentals said GameStop was going under “and that is a fact.”

I can’t say it enough, I’m with the average retail, but I have had enough of hearing what can & can’t be done because it hurts ‘the system.’ The system let this happen... 

To all you brave people buying & holding, my god stay the course. They have to have what you got in the short term."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Short sellers are important because it can dampen times of high volatility. In rare circumstances (like $GME) it can lead to a short squeeze, but that’s usually the result if market manipulation."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Short sellers ARE important for the market. They keep stock prices from being overbloated so that they still have room to grow. They can also put significant pressure on corrupt problems.

This isn't what's happening right now though and it's absolutely absurd that several media sources keep passing this same misleading newsline. Several hedgefunds and market makers went on full overdrive during the pandemic to blow retail companies to kingdom come through overshorting, pushing out negative stories through the media, and most likely engaging in the practice naked shorting. These major firms basically decided what would and wouldn't survive the pandemic and called out on it by people around the world. 

The world governments and financial ""protection"" agencies like the SEC have proven repeatedly that they are unwilling and/or incapable of protecting the wishes of the people, so why shouldn't we take measures to protect our interests through our own means? Seems to me like it's about time the people finally got a seat at the big table - we have proven that we are more than capable of making absolutely retarded decisions like those made by hedgefunds and market makers."

Now your shares are essentially in limbo, and can't be used against your stock via shorting because they're already being transacted. When the limit sell expires after 60 days (I think), do it again.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"> “I think the main reason people dislike short selling is that something just feels bad about profiting from someone else’s failures,” said Sasha Indarte, an assistant professor of finance at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. “Short sellers gain when someone else loses. It’s like if you took out an insurance policy against your neighbor’s home and your neighbor’s home was destroyed.”

I think the better analogy would be taking out a $10M insurance policy against your neighbours house and then spending another $1M on arsonists to burn the thing to the ground."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"no.  you can't ban short selling and still allow buying of puts.  at it's core, the basic purpose of buying a put is to enter into a short position at the strike price, if it hits.  

I can't believe the amount of mental midgetry going on in this thread..... fuckin retards haha."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,There are people doing good work via short selling. Look up Marc Cohodes.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"just because something is causing more harm than good doesnt mean it is inherently bad, that is a fallacy


short selling simply needs restrictions that prevent the fraud cases, its still very important for the market when you consider cases like wirecard"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Truth. Like with everything else, it's not sufficient to label an entire practice as immoral. In a free market, like a free society, the only way to be objectively immoral is to trample on the freedoms of others.

While many of the short whales have done this with GME, and naked shorts are objectively fuelled by their ability to crush capital availability to certain companies.... there are plenty of shortsellers market-wide who simply are achieving profit by predicting that a more accurate valuation of X stock is below today's market value.

GME is a unique situation in that it brought in a lot of people who don't care for markets but are here for a class struggle, which is a fair label, but only to an extent. As Glenn Greenwald said in late January: ""Traditionally, if you hold beliefs in good faith... if you are on the right, you believe the government's role is to protect its citizens by protecting a free market; if you are on the left, you see the government's role as intervention on the behalf of the most needy.... what we have in 2021 is neither."" So a lot of the influx of new members is here to witness a class struggle firsthand, which is cool. This mixes with a belief held by people across the political spectrum that elites crushing poors is a problem. A number of the HFs that are trying to cripple Gamestop have done this before with other companies, and made tons off COVID lockdowns, etc.

But I'd be lying through my teeth if I were to say that I'll never take a short interest in a company again. That's just cathartic speak from a sect of moral absolutists who will either not be here in a few months, or it's an emotional promise from WSB vets who are mistaking the moral deviations of Citadel, Melvin, etc for the shortcomings of a practice that theoretically  drives close to half of the market over time. I am here to beat the priest who touched my son, not to burn down the church with all its members inside."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Like pretty much everything else in life, there are positive and negative aspects to short selling.

Back in November, a short seller (QCM) publicly called out a medical device maker named Penumbra for shipping faulty catheters used in surgical procedures that were rupturing during surgery, causing numerous injuries and at least 11 deaths. As a result of all the attention, the company recalled the product line and who knows how many lives were saved.

I think people misunderstand debt (which is really all fractional reserve banking creates).

I don't see debt as being ""linear"".  Maybe it's a smile bordering on a smirk, where too little is just as bad as too much and there's a nice, wide ""just right zone"" that's comfortable to slosh around in.  

But the one latent property of debt that I don't think people really get is that debt is used to create predictable behavior (the *real* power of central banking).  In this regard, central banking and the tech industry are in the same business (they just don't know it... well, maybe tech does as evidenced by their attempts to define what money is... we'll see how that works out for them).

If the fundamental first principal of economics is ""people respond to incentives"", then debt is both a carrot and a stick that gets populations and entire countries to act is certain very predictable, extremely long term ways.... until it doesn't (as those non-economists, who are used to operating in the belly of the economic beast, understand)."

Your choice.

Brokers have to make money, and this is one of the ways they do it. And it doesn't really affect you in any way, as you still legally own your shares.

This is the epitome of modern society. Everyone wants everything for free, with no downsides. They want all these Google services for free, then get all upset when they make some cash with anonymous data. Everybody wants cutting-edge brokerages with amazing apps and instant fulfillment, but they don't want to pay a trading fee (and they get all upset when they silently loan your shares to make a profit).

You want premium service? You gotta pay. Or you gotta be okay with brokers running a side hustle. They aren't a charity."

It's one thing to consent to take a risk and loan someone your stock. It's another thing for someone who doesn't own the stock to lend it out from under you to make some money while you lose money.

Edit - I feel the need to clarify here that I do not disagree with the concept of short selling, but take issue with it being done with your property without your consent and with no reward to you. I do also take issue with shorting like GME where the idea was for it to go to zero and the shorts would never have to buy the shares back."

What people don't realize is that markets go BOTH ways. Markets can't go infinitely upwards. Short positions and long positions allows the market to stay liquid regardless of the directions it's moving. 

If we got rid of short positions full stop, then the market would freeze any time there is a dip and never recover because nobody would be spending money. 


You can't have puts without allowing short selling because put sellers ultimately believe a stock will go up and no one in their right mind would sell you a contract that says ""I will give you money if this goes the opposite way I believe it will"" without some sort of insurance or hedge to offset their losses. 

The insurance in this case is a short position. If a seller of a put was wrong and the stock declines and you exercise their put, they can pay you because their short positions is also profiting."

Think about how a put is. Sam and Tim agree to a put strikeprice of $25,  which if Sam exercises then Tim must buy the shares from Sam. Sam must get shares before hand to sell to Tim - these are from the market any time in the past.

On a short, Sam borrows Tim's shares, and Sam sells them on the market. Sam got shares technically without buying yet. But then Sam must buy shares from the market to return to Tim. Tim technically holds ""exercise"" rights because Tim still owns shares on the books and can sell them for what market asks. In which case he could demand Sam buy shares on the market to give Tim the shares he wants to sell back on market. (Look at all that buying! Market prices go up.. short squeeze.)"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure you can, you would just have to limit put selling to those who want to buy a share at a specific price while taking premium if it doesn’t reach a specific point. It is entirely possible to get rid of short selling and allow buying/selling of puts, but it would entirely change the options market. That being said, I do believe options markets should be changed fundamentally because it has shown that hedge funds with billions of dollars can move the price within minutes by using a small portion of that money on options. Either limit option buying to 100 calls or puts per company for the entire floor, or rewrite the system because it is apparent that corporations are using options to profit from fraud."

I mean fucking bayer will pull HIV infected products in the US/UK and then just resell to the rest of the world pay a small fee and move on.

While people might not understand the finer details of things like options, again by fucking design, the sentiment is correct IMO. 

It absolutely contributes to far more fraud than it fucking uncovers. Not to mention the fact that a good portion of the time the ""fraud"" isnt actually fraud is just FUD and helps to tank a companies stock price.

They can make money from ads by releasing the article without having to short it. In order to successfully short, there has to be a degree of fear instilled in the public so they can drop the price quickly and exit the position. Their goal is rarely to drive the stock to bankruptcy and instead to gain a quick buck(look at Andrew left with his Nio presentation or Bill Ackman in 2020, and 2021 on CNBC).

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly I would do the opposite of what MW says
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,you saw that thing mw did last week right
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What company ?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah what company? I'd be curious
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It can work if people have the same idea but dont forget that people short companies because they dont think they are doing good and they can also sometimes be right to do so. Not a fan of the concept as it can give the final blow to a company that couldve otherwise somehow survived but just remember why stocks are shorted in the first place and do some DD. 

MAC is a company thats got a nice price tag and not too big float and big short but if its not to recover by the time the shorts exit their positions , you can end up betting on a beaten horse. If it gets support you can end up winning if it doesnt, your success depends on the company bouncing back. It used to do very good and I tought of doing like you but its seems to be better as long term plays.

Going for long expiration calls on these companies that people think wont recover can be cheap and more profitable than shares, if youre fine with the risk of losing your premium. But then again you either need support from many people doing the same or you need the company to actually bounce. Having time helps! 

If youre broke and looking for a quick buck youd be better going in and out on some hyped stocks on their good days. Or play on recovery patterns, grinding slowly."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Another interesting move could be to identify companies that are intending to buy back stock to increase price when the government lifts the temporary restriction. The Financials are one area where this will likely be happening and most of those stocks are already depressed.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Unless it's current meme stocks, it requires a shit ton of shares to screw a short. Quick summary, things will be business as usual until there are more stocks helds than ""borrowed"" floating around. That creates the point where the shorters are bleeding interest on the borrowed shares, or some other pressure for them to have to buy real shares to return.

If it's not a current meme stock, I'd just keep my mouth shut, read every DD you come across on here and r/investing. Learn what to look for, find proof of the short. Then, bring it up after the meme stonks have died down.

Lastly, make sure there is a real future potential in the company. For GME, every decision I make has baggage of buying down my cost basis over the stocks recovery time VS short term reward. I'm sure I'm not the only one that believes if crap goes sideways on GME I can throw money on dips until I can make profit in the future time. If the business has a higher potential to fail, it's a higher potential to never recover from unrealized losses."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"They do. The harder to borrow the shares are, the higher the borrowing fee, so regular shorting (not naked shorting) is not exactly a scam or shady practice, share holders can make extra income just by diamond handing. Brokers share the borrowing fee with the share owners, you'll have to check how much. E-trade and IBKR splits the fee 50/50 with the owner, Webull offers 15% of the fee.

At one point last year NKLA shares could only be borrowed at a fee of 1,000%. Traders were so convinced that the company would crash and burn that they were willing to pay that to go short."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not in the 'base level' package. They do when you get to a higher tier of options contacts, but I think you can still say no"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"*Edit because I went off on a tangent and did a terrible job of circling back to the point:* the brokerages and market makers ""side hustles"" need to be more heavily investigated, because it seems like ""providing their app for free"" is used as a justification for not actually doing their jobs right. The companies decided to offer free trading and user friendly apps. Wanting them to follow the rules while using what they chose to offer is not ""just wanting shit for free.""

Just one example, customers are required to get ""best execution"" from the ones handling their shares. Obviously, this is to prevent the ones handling your shares from not handling them in YOUR best interest (because you have no choice but to trust them to do the trade).

So, to meet this requirement, while not actually giving you what the plain meaning of ""best execution"" would suggest, they make up a new level of ""enhanced best execution,"" which was briefly brought up during the first GME hearing.

So, if someone else is getting ""enhanced best execution,"" can you really say you're getting the ""best execution""?

No, because you're not. They've made up a new way to grift you while pretending to play by the rules."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Not fully understanding this comment. If your broker loans out any of the shares your purchase (Gme or anything else) to someone to short - the short putting the share on the market helps to drive down the price of your share
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"> If it works out for the short, it means the person who owns the shares loses money

This isn't really true. Say I have 100 shares that I loan out to a short seller for some interest rate. That means that until the short seller buys 100 shares from someone else and hands them over to me, they pay interest to me daily. Even if it goes good for them, at the end of it all when they close their short I still have 100 shares and I now have money from interest payments. Assuming I'm holding shares because I'm long-term bullish (why else would you hold shares) it doesn't matter to me that the share price went down and made the short seller money because I wouldn't have sold the shares at a lower price anyway. It's like selling covered calls except you can't even get exercised so there's even less risk."

If something is less valuable and you're profiting from it via a put option, where does that money come from to pay you and who is excerising? If you guessed ""MMs that are both long and short on the same security to keep markets liquid"" you would be correct. 

The point is that someone has to have money to pay you in both scenarios. Money isn't printed on a declining stock so you can exercise your put option...

I had a bunch of tech stocks in my account, and my QQQ puts kept me at neutral buoyancy over the last few weeks (at least on my tech shits...) so I could feel comfortable holding through the dip and exiting without losing money (on tech.

Andrew Left at Citron and whoever did the recent fraud probe during a Chinese  national holiday are prime examples of fraudulent short sellers who are “famous” but have shown fraudulent activity.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"My $405 in fidelity, feels you on this.  Its mostly safe bet ETF vt and voog to hold long, long term.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"When GME had the big dip last week, a large number of new outlets were right there (within a minute or less across different sources, you may draw your own conclusions) with the same ""GME was doing alright but look it's crashing now"" story.

It should also be considered that media coverage of last week's encouraging GME performance was completely absent up to that point - just a variable to stick into the equation.

So people caught mw when they published their story about the gme dip **before the dip actually happened**. Just by a few minutes, but the mw story was confirmed to have been published while GME was still peaking. mw updated the text of the story, but forgot to update the URL of the page - the url is usually auto generated according to the story title. Users took this information and were able to find that Google had actually indexed the mw story much earlier.

This implies a) foreknowledge by mw; and possibly b) coordination of news releases between a subset of news outlets. If someone put together a list of the sites publishing stories right after the dip I bet there would be a common thread behind them.

*mobile typos

Edit 2: when users saw this story popping up in their WeBull news feed, they asked WeBull wtf was going on. WeBull confirmed the findings here, the time of the publication by mw preceded the dip itself."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"They do have a billion shares outstanding no? 

I’m looking at SYROS right now, and that one is owned 85 percent by the institution leaving only 55 million shares available. Sound familiar? 

I was looking at SENS but I’m unsure of the ceiling."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"SENS is a great company and a great stock to hold, I hold some 800 shares. They have a few products somewhat disruptive to the market, and a few great products in development that will definitely be very disruptive to the market space.


That said, not every company with high short interest is a good candidate for a short squeeze. There's a reason $GME is called a once a decade opportunity despite the prevalence of short selling.



For one, I don't know if the short interest has been hedged. As OP explained, call options allow you to lock down a price point for a stock. This makes it the ideal tool for hedging short selling, when you pick very distant expiration dates. This way, if the stock moons, the hedge funds can just exercise the calls to cover their shorts. With $GME, we can be quite confident the short sellers haven't covered themselves this way (and now they can't, because it's so volatile, the premiums will be so high it wouldn't be worth it). With SENS, I've never looked at it from a short squeeze point of view so I don't know what call option volume is out there and if that means the shorts are covered. With 50% short interest It seems unlikely they'd all be covered, but you never know.



Also, to facilitate a short squeeze, the bulls need to be able to control a significant volume of shares, and for that you usually need institutions who are intending to cause a squeeze, or in $GME's case, a fuckton of apes YOLOing their bananas on it. I don't know if that interest is out there for SENS."

What I am trying to point out is that when a broker lends your shares out - their action results in downward pressure on the share that you just purchased. 

Maybe this analogy would help - Say you own Coke - would you put your excess revenues into a bank that then loans out your money to Pepsi to invest in new bottling facilities and marketing?

Ultimately - if the shares that you own are being used to lower the price of your own shares - you should:
1. Have the choice whether or not your shares are loaned out
2. Profit on the shares that are loaned out"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,">Don't even know how you came up with that. I was only elaborating on your false logic that some WSB user who made money on Puts is the same as a short seller.

No, you turned a morality argument into a semantic one to back whatever narrative there is in your head. 

Hedge Fund 'A' bets $1 million against GME through put options

Hedge Fund 'B' bets $1 million against GME through short selling

You're telling me Hedge Fund 'A' is morally superior for... what reason exactly? 

I understand that shorting a stock is different from buying a put. I'm talking about morals explicitly. Why is Hedge Fund B worse?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,MMs need to stay delta neutral so they hedge short put options by shorting the underlying. Read more books or at least wikipedia.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh shit nice! I didn't know the morality of betting on a stock burning and crashing changes if you use options to do it. So all the hedge funds that used options to bet against GME are off the hook, right?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe I will. Do you know any that are for sale? MW isn't doing so well lost time I checked the reviews. Might be going cheap.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I completely agree with this statement :D
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"just like the post office doesn’t care what you put in a package or where you sent it to, the DTCC doesn’t care where shares are coming from or how you got them. The not the purpose of a clearinghouse"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fund ""B"" is directly putting downward pressure on the price.

Fund ""A"" is taking advantage of a situation. But they are not involved in pushing the price down.

That is all I said. 

As for what is morally superior? I never stated one is better than the other. You are the one that is saying people complaining about Short sellers have no right since they apparently cheered for someone who bought Puts on a company which was about to suffer due to covid.

Those two things are not even remotely the same -- so your entire argument and logic is faulty."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Read what this kid is talking about. It has nothing to do with being delta neutral. Completely different argument here.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Im not sure if Im saying this right...we understand the post office analogy...the point is the post office is actively involved with the sellers who dont deliver the products...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah I get what the problem is: It's the fact that Citadel, Point72, and Melvin did not commit fraud and that this entire thread is predicated on a baseless claim. ""Putting downward pressure on the price"" is not manipulation, and you don't seem to believe the narrative that there was any sort of real manipulation either. So I don't know why you're arguing for it.

>Those two things are not even remotely the same

From a moral standpoint, why not?"

What they did is illegal.

>What Is Naked Shorting

>Naked shorting is the illegal practice of short selling shares that have not been affirmatively determined to exist. Ordinarily, traders must borrow a stock, or determine that it can be borrowed, before they sell it short. So naked shorting refers to short pressure on a stock that may be larger than the tradable shares in the market. Despite being made illegal after the 2008–09 financial crisis, naked shorting continues to happen because of loopholes in rules and discrepancies between paper and electronic trading systems.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"No ""bro"" I am not.

I think you don't  understand what the word illegal means -- or for that matter how naked shorting would appear.


If the short position was over 100% of the float -- at any point -- then what happened was that some of those positions were naked. 

This is not open to debate. It's a simple mathematical fact.

Now if you would you like me to get a written sworn testimony from their accounting department, then I am sorry, that won't be possible. You know with it being illegal and all...

Hope that helps ""bro""."
2021-03-13 15:29:00,wallstreetbets,"""Who's to say $GME is overvalued...??!!"" (Chamath P. - i think; i am pretty sure)  You  know what fellow 'tards.... I've been thinking (it hurts, but i'm  stubborn so keep at it) - there are many out there who subscribe to and  promote the notion that at current MC of \~ 17B $GME is grossly, and i  mean GROSSLY overvalued  ( last SP of \~$266 X 65M Float = 17B) and the  only thing that GME has going for it is this stubborn pack of apes who  like the stock and diamond hand their shares as if those were last  bananas on Earth and therefore presenting and causing all kinds of  nuisances and troubles to otherwise sophisticated investors getting in  their way of  making big bucks as usual by doing all kinds of complex  calculations on smart machines, forecasting, prognosticating, staring  and squiggly lines all day, pontificating to ignorant masses etc. etc.  etc.

\-  well you know what

i  know it's maybe a bit ""apples n oranges"" ; but let's take a quick look at DASH shall we...?

Now  if DASH can take on most of delivery business in US  (including  business w no or in-house delivery services start outsourcing to DASH  and of  course they can start collecting/mining info get into  advertising etc etc ) -  then yes - i say DASH might be worth 46B maybe  even much more (btw - DASH currently is doing less in Sales and looses  as much as GME)

Market  is forward  looking so considering GME and it's potential in - gaming;  e-sports;  betting; e-sports tournaments/events and the fact that the  brand name  is getting a positive FREE SYMPATHETIC PUBLICITY around the  world  especially among GME core users and considering demographic -  who's  then to say that GME is not actually worth the current SP of \~$300  and  why should it be valued 3 times LESS than DASH???!!!

Also I ran a quick ""back of the envelope"" screener (all data are from [Finviz.com](https://finviz.com/) link below // );

I  only specified few fundamental and technical parameters to try to see  what I come up with - take a look-see; snoop around a bit; click away on  some of the familiar names... and some of those business are app's (of  course i'm over-simplifying!!! don't get on my case - I'm VENTING!!!)

There  are currently more than 20 Co's (some of which might be hailed as  disruptions, innovators and all around trailblazers) who's MC is larger  than GME's - in some cases considerably larger; most if not ALL (i have  not checked one by one) are loosing some big bucks - in the billions;  some have triple digits F/PE; ROI/ROA/ROE in deep double digit red - but  hey you don't see a band of apes getting assigned the responsibility of  unreasonably and blatantly ""manipulating"" and  inflating the SP and  keeping the MC where it's at..... (btw reason DASH didn't make the list  is coz they currently don't have ROI/ROA listed)

So in conclusion: **TLDR**

GME SP is currently in ""no-man's"" land and ""Who's to say GME is over-valued....??!!"" - (fundamentally, of course, we all understand it is currently, but again, markets are forward looking, GME has A LOT going for it now and is taking active and tangible steps to adopts and fine tune it's business model and is no more ""over-valued"" than some of the market ""darlings"" currently trading at considerable premium)

To  the moons!!! (yeah you got that right - MOONS - plural - i am maybe a  retard ape but i know MARS has two moons, M  A  R  S - Mars biches...  and don't get me started w Jupiter and Saturn - take that suits...!!!!)

It got shorted that much because it is a dying business, period, and the current stock price has absolutely nothing to do with the future business propositions of the company.  They could have Cohen, Rockefeller, Buffet, Munger, and Ackman as activist investors, it isn't going to change the way that a vast vast majority of consumers purchase a product in the space.  

Doesn't mean it isn't a good investment, I actually do see a squeeze taking place and people making a good trade on this, but the stock will settle at a drastically lower price once that happens, so please do not kid yourself into thinking there are fundamentals outside of a short squeeze possibility for this price, cause there is not."

For GME, it was always the new console cycle. Dumbass me actually held GME this summer but sold it for a TSLA FOMO. However, now the shorters know a fuck ton of people look at that and it’s difficult to solely base a value play on that with all of the FUD.

I’m not even remotely close to the investor DFV is and his method of picking investments really opened my eyes on flaws in my initial thought process, ultimately his DD this summer/fall, followed by jeffamazon’s DD convinced me to buy a fuck ton more shares."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How did you learn the basics and specifics before you started investing back in september? Any books or sites you could reccomend?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Welcome to momentum trading.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah a bit more about my story:

I joined WSB nearing the end of 2020, just as the GME hype was beginning to bubble up but was still background noise for the most part. I really just joined for the loss porn, but it didn’t take long for me to wanna start investing because of everything I was reading. 

I’m in Canada, where simple trading apps are far and few between. Only one I could find was Wealthsimple, had a bunch of shitty reviews, so I just decided I’d try my hand at paper trading. **On my paper trading account, I bought GME for $14/share.**

Well, GME really began to rocket and I was getting FOMO, getting pissed off that all I might have to show for the trading opportunity of the millenium was a bunch of fake money in a paper trading app. So, I went ahead and downloaded Wealthsimple. Took a few days for my money to get in, and I ended up snagging 1 @ 316.. on February 1st. 

Dropped like a fuckin rock starting the day after I dropped $400CAD on a single share, a week later I was down about 80-90%. Decided to DCA on the way down and ended up with 4 shares at 132. 

Then I woke up a couple minutes before the deadly drop the other day, got scared and emotional, decided to try my hand at swing trading and sold 2 of my shares at 200, then saw the price leaping back up and got 1 of them back as quickly as I could for 270. 

So now instead of 4 @ 132, I have 3 @ 178. So certainly could have been worse, but I really did play myself. I just keep telling myself that I at least reduced my exposure."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Perfect
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah yeah that makes sense, I clearly can’t read lol. Literally says market gain right there.

Yeah man you have big balls for swing trading. You should definitely consider selling some covered calls if you’re willing to. I’ve had 3 of them assigned because I was too cocky with the price but it’s been netting me anywhere from $3k-$8k a week selling ~10x OTM calls. Have the cash to rebuy the shares once it settles too, or you can just roll them week to week.

Edit: I’m not selling any calls less than 800c next week and I’m only selling 5 due to the potential to run up before earnings."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s $500 premarket now??
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"No I think it says September in the title.

Couldn't have been September."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean I started buying in October but I’ve continued to buy more and more since then, slowly upping my price from ~$16 a share to about $35 a share now. It isn’t necessarily untrue that he started in September. I only had ~600 when Cohen filed for his 12.9% but sold off most of my other positions to ~double my position in GME around January, so I wouldn’t say OP is lying."

You're clearly not spreading any FUD since you've made it clear that you're holding GME and yet people act like anything other than ""this is going to 100k"" means yours a gay bear.  I agree with you, laddering out your shares in traunches as the price continues higher is the best strategy.  We've seen this thing drop $400 in over 90 minutes (January 28) so trying to hold until ""valhalla"" is just going to cause people to not secure profits."

There is genuine value to GME that is being priced in right now and all you see is a gamble. Squeezes be damned. Buying GME at that point was genuinely smart. It was ridiculous that nobody else saw how absurdly undervalue it was. Oh wait, THEY DID

I currently wonder what other seriously undervalue stocks are in the market"

I think GME is legitimately valuable to retail and could be a huge turning point if people have faith in the company and the stock.

It isn't a ponzi. It isn't a scam. There is a legitimate battle between shorts and longs, regardless of the tripe saying 100k is not a meme bullshit... the stock is the focus of a SHIT load of trading activity.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Almost always cheaper to sell the options.  Then just buy the stock rather then excersize them.  This would have given you an up front chunk of money as well to purchase them.

2021-03-13 14:56:23,wallstreetbets,"Green-Centric Technology Set to Benefit from Infrastructure Spending Real talk: Congress is getting started on the infrastructure bill and the majority leader in the Senate plans on a bill passage by October. It should be climate focused considering that the Biden administration ran on that message. One of Biden’s initiatives was building a network of charging station across America. Another one is making modern changes to the power grid system and alternative ways to harness energy. Of courses the materials to build these priorities takes steel and fuel.

Based on these assumptions mixed in with a few facts about the materials that will be used to modernize our infrastructure, as other analysts have reiterated, this is a great year for energy and materials. They like to think about the reopening which I think is short-sighted. The real growth will come from the rumor out of Congress. That’s going to be the accelerant for a lot of these alternative energy stocks.

Here are some on my watch list:
MP Materials
Star Peak Energy (soon to be STEM this month)
ChargePoint

MP Materials 

• Not a fan all too much for this one, and it has a competitive advantage that’s also its greatest weakness. They are the only rare earth material miner in the US. It only takes a competitor with lower prices to soak up their market share. A little apprehensive about this one but I like their team. Maybe you guys have more information on what makes this one stellar.

Star Peak Energy 

• This one is a good one in my opinion for its uniqueness. Other green tech stocks in its sector are trading at much much higher multiples like Blink whereas this company is only 8x. So, it’s trading at a discount from its peers. They offer energy solutions driven by their patented AI system Athena to harness power from energy storage units. They also plan to be cash flow positive by 2022-2023. That’s beside the point though, they’re pioneering great sustainable technology and already have a 75% market share in California in energy storage. I like this one a lot. They’re planning a merger with Stem this month and it will be listed in the NYSE as STEM. 

ChargePoint 

• The company has the widest distribution of charging units across the country. Though they aren’t as good as other chargers in their sector, they have them at scale. This play is largely contingent on the infrastructure bill. GM plans to have like 30 EV cars by 2025, so just imagine the growth story for this stock. Even at its current multiple, I can honestly say that Biden’s proposal is not factored in. They’re going to be met with more demand than they projected in a few years as more and more people embrace EV’s."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"All this ""green"" ""clean"" play have been priced in already into the markets ..

You can see clean energy stocks had huge runs already for the last few months .. Maybe it was an opportunity to buy during the February dip .. Maybe rates will go up and we have another dip in march .. Will have to wait and see .."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I like TMRC. They also mine rare earth metals.  They own the mine in Texas and last year purchased equipment from Japan to make rare-earth magnets.  Lots of government contracts.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Disclosure, 453 shares of AMRS, but I actually think this is why they've been running up. They're one of the first stocks I bought back when they were $1.65, and I was holding bags for a long time. With my work background though, I had confidence in their science, and held, now they're doing well. I think their ability to use yeast to produce farnesene which can then be turned into other compounds and additives  will benefit from green legislation.

But not advice, I legitimately just like the company bc the science is neato"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m big on ChargePoint and might grab 100 shares next week if I can get it around where it is now. Easily going to add $10 to the stock price this year or early next

Then I bought in the 120's, in the 90's, the 40's, the 70's the 90's and the 150's, and then the 260's. Aiming to buy again Monday in the 230's.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is literally what this sub was made for, son"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"At the time of this post, Robinhood is selling a $300 March 26 call for $67.50. Each option corresponds to 100 shares so you would pay $6750 out of pocket. At the end of the trading day on March 26, you would lose $6750 (at most) if the price is lower and you just let the contract expire. Each day, the price you can sell your options for will change depending on if there’s a higher likelihood the stock price will be $300. A March 19 call for $300 is cheaper - at only $3550 right now, because there’s a shorter amount of time where that $300 stock price could happen. 

Regarding options in general, they’re attractive because they magnify your gains and losses. I.e You don’t actually need the capital to purchase each of the shares.

The amount of money you can make from an in the money contract wildly varies, so you could make 2x or 10x - really depends on how much the current price is compared to your contract"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So options leverage your bet to a 100 shares. Example 1call contract with representate a 100 shares of the stock. In this example, if you end up buying the $300 call expiring Mar 26th and the stock price hits $300 (which is the STRIKE PRICE you chose before buying that OPTION), and It keeps going above your STRIKE PRICE then you'll have an option to buy those 100 shares at the underlying price which is $300 here, regarless of what the market price is. Let's say the the $GME stock price hits $1000 which is obviously possible, then you'll be entitled to buy those 100 Shares at $300, meaning you'll spend $30000 to buy those shares. Now that you OWN those shares, you'll be able to sell those at the MARKET PRICE ($1000 here). Meaning you'd be selling those shares at the price $100000. 

So you expenses were $30000
And your sales were $100000

So your NET PROFIT is going to be $70000.
Keep in mind you don't have to go through the process of buying those shares and then selling them. You could just sell that CALL OPTION to someone else for a minimum of $70000, since that is how much that CALL OPTION is going to be worth at that point in time.

Now since there is no upper limit on how high a price of the stock would go. Hypothetically you could have infinite money."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Roughly $7k for a contract to buy 100 shares at $300 on March 26th, regardless of the current stock price. If the stock is higher than strike, basic total profit = (strike spread x 100) - premium (the initial $7k). Do the math for $800, it’s fun. 

The Greeks can also impact value (volatility, time till expiration, contract sensitivity to price all have Greek symbols). 

Calls are high risk/reward. Expect to lose it all if you buy one."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Running at $3,550 - if GME closes below $300 on 3/19 you lose all of that, $300-355.50 you are making back your premium, and from 355.50 and up you're making profit. 

If you are comfortable with risking that money and think it could close at $500/share then the contracts would be worth $200/share or $20,000/contract and your expected return would be $20,000-$3,550= $16,450/contract 

4.6x ratio if it goes there, but remember that if it is less than $355.50 you make no money, or lose all of your initial investment. Check multiple levels and compare it to shares too, they don't expire so if you're concerned about the date it's worth a look"

I'm literally all in and living on overdraft, I expect to be back to my normal levels of degeneracy taking advantage of media coverage and stimmy fuelled fomo price rallies. If I can cover my initial cost on the way up to a new support line then I can deal with the risk for quite a long time. I give money away even when I'm broke so I'm primed for this."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"What do you base your predictions on? I agree but it's most gut instinct, some confirmation bias would be nice.

It's why I bought more at close Friday, might have been an all time high on the day (bought close to close) but I see a big pump and dump to shake loose anyone with stop losses and people over exposed on the stock generally. (Like me lel) 

Dunno if it'll be Monday though, I feel like Monday through Wednesday might see organic retail investment increase, driving the price up to test 300 repeatedly, maybe even temporarily build a new support.

Surely after that is when the pump and dump would be most optimised because you've got a bunch of FOMO tards buying at ATH expecting a straight rocket trajectory and they'll be watching the ticker constantly and bail as soon as things look squirrelly.

That's why I plan to scalp the FOMOers, either hold or cover costs during the pump then buy back in immediately to make sure as many of those shares stay in our (my) hands as possible at a lower dollar cost average than I have post Friday moves.

I'm not setting stop losses just limit orders. I'm (planning on) gambling on next week not being the GOATMOASS. But I'll revise my thesis daily I guess and try not to get too greedy. Suck to be bag holding more shares than I sold if it does pop off.

Edit: rn I'm also too small to day trade regularly so I have to be strategic to stay below of my PDT limit. If we don't launch the rocket next week but I play my cards right that may change for me.

In fact honestly that should be the absolute minimum I plan to exit with if I'm smart. Double my money and get a portfolio large enough to gamble smarter. (And protect that $25k very carefully until the Give Me Everything event dies down.)"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Melvin Capital, to file bankruptcy as soon as next week according to sources.

The bailout they received yesterday from Citadel and Point72 went “poof” today as the GameStop ( $GME ) momentum continued.

2021-03-13 12:46:52,wallstreetbets,"Out of VIAC. Now in GNOG, SRPT, and GD. So I haven't really logged into Reddit for some time. It's completely blown up wow. Thanks so much for the awards. I've received several messages asking me what's in my book now, so I'm gonna write a quick update.

Alright, so **I've already gotten out of ViacomCBS** \- did so **at $70** actually. Happy to outline my rationale in full next time but I'm relatively busy today so I'm just gonna update y'all on my positions (and a TLDR on why I'm invested in some of them). Let me know what your thoughts are - would love to have a discussion around this. So, I've **recently rotated into the following stocks. Interesting positions in bold.** 

**Swing Trades (6 Month Plays)**

* **Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT; -13%)**: Sarepta is **massively undervalued**. **Only player right now in the DMD space**. Additional **FDA approvals** suggest that the FDA is still keen on SRPT's treatments (there was a little controversy in the past). Trade carefully though, this stock can get volatile. I believe that I got in a little too early, but my personal **PT for SRPT is 120**.
* **Golden Nugget Online Gaming (GNOG; +22%)**: 3 main reasons why GNOG is a strong buy. Firstly, it is a **severely undervalued** stock. Warrants have also mostly expired / been exercised. Secondly, **online gambling is getting legalized** across the US. Thirdly, the **brand recognition** in the US is pretty high. If Draft Kings is the global player for millennials, **GNOG is the US player for boomers**. Would love to write an in-depth analysis on GNOG when I have time. 
* **General Dynamics (GD; +12%)**: **Space baby, space**. Increased government contracts + retail interest = Boom.
* Helca Mining (HL; +6%): Super volatile trade. Indirect hedge against inflation. 
* Lockheed Martin (LMT; +1%): Severely undervalued IMO. Also, Space. 

**Buy and Hold (Long Term Plays)**

* Ozon Holdings (OZON; +19%): Amazon of Russia. Highly volatile though, so I'd recommend caution on when and at what price you enter this trade. 
* Royal Dutch Shell (RDSB; +14%): Great management team + execution = Likely successful in transition into clean energy. 
* British Petroleum (BP; +4%): Fastest transition by a major oil player into clean energy. 2nd time's the charm, I believe. 
* Dollar General (DGBP; -3%): The underlying economy is actually quite week IMO. There's likely to have been quite a bit of capital scrapping over the past year. Unemployment has fallen and people are getting vaccinated. But there is a non-zero risk of another potential wave (SA Variant) which may result in an increase in U3. U6 unemployment is also likely to be above typical averages after COVID as employers realize many of their employees can plausibly be streamlined. 

Happy to do another in depth analysis on any of the above positions as my previous post got quite a bit of traction (thanks for the interest!). Let me know if you're keen on any of them and I'll pen my thoughts accordingly."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"5 other comments here and all hidden lol.

Good DD, I've been looking into an oil company going green and BP stood out to me too."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I like GNOG it’s so cheap too
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your viac dd was so good. It closed at 95 today. Do you think the run is over? P/e is ""only"" at 22 right now."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the write up. Worked for LMT for 10 yrs. Amazing company but why swing on LMT and GD on the basis of Space growth? That’s not happening in 6 mo.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is some fresh water; good agua!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like BP clean transition, but I have so much money parked in vanguard funds, I'm assuming they have a shit ton of BP right ? 

Eitherway;  I'm afraid so much money has gone into energy and clean energy in particular in the last few months .."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I’d appreciate a GNOG write up. Looks like it could definitely have a crazy run up.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Its refreshing to see actual DD. Thank you for your efforts.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the insights. GNOG fan here as well. I am curious as to your thoughts on the industry. It seems like Draftkings and other bigger names are pretty damn inflated considering the revenue totals for the sports betting market as a whole and wonder if that can hurt this.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,GNOG is Fertitta run. That guys an idiot.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,yeah what’s up with that?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thoughts on Criteo (CRTO) and Mohawk Group Holdings (MWK)? Both heavily undervalued IMO.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice write-up, it's great seeing things that aren't just emoji spam and yet another post about the single most talked-about stock on the board. I think Ill be moving some money around on Monday haha. 

It looks like SRPT got absolutely slaughtered at year-end earnings, but it made some big moves in mid 2018 and mid 2019. Do you have any insight into what went on at some of these major swing-points?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great DD, I have not seen any news about SRPT getting any traction. Have I missed something? Is there an ETA on when they should have more clear FDA approvals?"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ford is currently over extended, another buying opportunity is closing in sometime next week, when it corrects itself, it might pull back to 10-12 before lifting up to 15 by the week after next.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are you aware that almost every car manufacturer uses takata air bags?My thoughts are that unless all car manufacturer stocks go down, singular ones won't be affected when announcing air bag recalls. But recalling x amount of cars to fix an issue is a good thing. Personally I expect value to go sideways or up, and it's been going sideways.

If anyones stock should tank it should be Takata's, but I'm pretty sure thats a private comapny.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Due to the article only mentioning Ford I was wondering if they might suffer the worst from it, not saying they should. The reason I asked about Ford here is simply because this was a Ford post and I was curious to hear someone currently bullish explain what they thought about it.

You and I know a lot of manufacturers use Takata but the article only mentions Ford so for anyone unaware they might think Ford is the only one using their product. Hence why I am wondering if there will be a pullback. If the article was titled ""Several Car Companies Recalling Millions of Vehicles"" it wouldn't be so tied to Ford."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thats a good point about Ford only being mentioned, that didn't cross my mind initially haha!  


Here's my retarded bull thesis:  
I love Ford. The stonk is affordable and I think they have good prospects for growth.  Looking at their entire chart history, I'd say they're trading a little over fair value, or what might be considered fair value. And smooth steady growth since April 2020.  


Maybe the price will pull back a little next week, actually with the news being released I wouldn't be super surprised. I still don't think it SHOULD, but a lot of investors don't know about the takata situation properly lol. And if WSB has taught me anything, BTFD :D"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,😂🤣😂🤣😂 I like the part where they say it “discriminates against the most experienced industry professionals. “ is the paper admitting that the most experienced are the most corrupt?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Surely the brokers without ethics will just cheat?

Therefore the brokers with ethics are the ones at risk from this test??? 

😂"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The headline is misleading. The article is about testing stock brokers on fields unrelated to stock broking (eg Insurance). Might be their own fault though because insurance was packaged with pensions for a long time and they (the industry funds) didn’t seem to mind collecting big life insurance premiums from healthy young adults.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Go figure
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,On a side note could you have taken a worst photo?:) Geeez
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I forget sometimes that WSB is epitome of ethics
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Accountants have a mandatory ethics exam, and it’s a fucking joke. First, I can’t tell you the number of people that cheat on that exam. But it’s actually a fairly easy exam to take and necessary for licensure. So easy that we made it part of the curriculum and a requirement to pass first year financial accounting. They take the test as a group. So... yeah.

Immoral and unethical people are not ignorant of what moral/ethical behavior looks like, they just choose not to do it. So requiring them to take a test only costs taxpayers time and money. They’ll pass, and they’ll still be doing the wrong thing(s)."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Had to take an ethics test for an insurance company I was trying to intern for. (Granted they made it sound like I would get a lot of market trade experience, but realized later it was just selling insurance which I don’t recommend any fresh out of college student do.) ANYWAYS - I thought no problem I’m an ethical guy, take the test get an email with my results along with a notice I didn’t get the internship. I check out my results and in the legend it says traits highlighted red were traits they didn’t want. Guess what trait was one of the only ones highlighted in red? “COMPASSION” guess what I scored in compassion?! 10/10.

That really killed my motivation to get any kind of sales job after that."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,People are slowly starting to learn that hedge funds are only out to make everyone else poor. Traders are often given a debit card with their day’s earnings on it because funds know it is a hard world and the traders know they are actively stealing money from others by manipulating stocks a specific way.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Investment specialist here: these ethics tests are not synonymous with altruistic client focus. In this case you likely have a lot of very specialized investment professionals who are unique in their job function and don’t want to study a bunch of basic and random hypothetical client situations to be re-certified after decades of solid work. 

Plus these tests are notorious for the “right answers” not being the answer in the real world but just the way the tests authors believe you should respond. 

Hard to describe but I’ve passed about 10 different variants of these exams in my role at work and they are not about learning or being ethical, it’s about understanding how the test wants you to answer and memorizing content to answer the questions that way.

Also, people in the industry are under a constant microscope. We are doing about 40 hours of compliance certification each year, have all our emails read by 5+ different supervisors, get audited annually in client case work, certify and document our behavior  monthly in a formal report, have our VM translated from voice to text for supervision and review, they examine our personal checking accounts at least annually for fraud, and report constantly to our supervisory boards...and that’s if you’re on the “good”
list. If you’re suspected of anything or make a mistake, it gets worse from there."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Before y’all get insane, I got an A for my Ethics course in college, but the CFA ethics portion is retarded. It does not allow you to err on the side of safety (where if you’re not sure who can be hurt you take the course that definitely hurts nobody) it actually penalizes you for erring on the side of ethics. It’s an idiotic test designed by scumbags who make money off people taking and retaking it. There is no scientific proof that it makes you more ethical.

Edit: CFA is a scam."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not gonna lie, when studying for my CFA exams, I hated the “ethics” sections. So damn boring boring and useless. It’s mostly common sense stuff except now it’s as if you have to memorize and name every common sense interaction. 

Questions like “John decided to touch a red hot stove, what standard did he break/ignore? 

A-the thermodynamic standard that glowing red metal means hot 
B- the stove touching standard that details the proper practices to use around operational stoves
C- the don’t be stupid standard
D - none of the above

Also, the reporting guidelines that were bundled in with them (I don’t see why I need to be tested on whether my records should be kept for 5 years or 7 years or whatever )"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait is this not a thing in Australia?? 

I had to pass the series 63, which covers ethics and fiduciary responsibility, two weeks after I passed the series 7. Every broker in the US has too, how does any self respecting regulatory body not have a test on ethics?? That's fucking nuts lol

Edit to say how the hell are they failing it so much as well, when I worked for Fidelity they had like a 95% pass rate on the series 63/65/66. Are these ""experienced"" fucking stupid?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ethics tests are fucking retarded and pointless. Assuming they are not audited they can just be falsified. I mean I guess you could support them as a proxy for an intelligence test?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck ethics test. It’s just more government bureaucracy that they use to justify more spending and higher taxes.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The real problem here is a government deciding what is or is not ethical and enforcing that by law.

*Hard fact: Ethics are irrelevant. Either something is legal or illegal.*

If something is unethical, then make it illegal.

Prissy overgrown children expect the world to follow some invisible code of ethics. It doesn’t, and you can’t expect it to, and it wouldn’t be fair or legal to have that expectation.

The law is the public established code of ethics. Anyone and everyone must adopt those ethics. Nothing shady or underhanded, everyone knows the rules so no excuses.

This second invisible layer of unwritten law we call “ethics” is a tool for fascism. Learn some history."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"had to read this twice at first i thought it said ethnic instead of ethics.

also why on earth would you require an ethics test its completely pointless mostly because its completely subjective and very easy to circumvent because pretending to be altruistic and ""moral"" are very easy things to do (also most trading is done by algorithms and they don't give a dam about your ""ethics"" and ""morals"" ether). a far more effective solution to stock brokers screwing everyone else over would be to get rid of them just completely get rid of the stock market completely it makes no sense because it legally requires company's to be completely profit driven to the detriment of society as a whole."

Well, all the dishonest employees realized that if they actually had evidence they wouldn't need the scare tactics and the police would have already been called and so they kept their mouths shut, but all the honest employees fessed up to tiny little stuff and got fired. The post talked about how one of the most honest, best employers confessed to stealing a few grapes over the years valued at about $1.50 and got fired. All their little stunt did was eliminate the honest employees from their staff."

They are attempting to test ability to provide responsible fiduciary duties to clients - are they providing advice that makes sense within the context of Australian law for brokerage investments, insurance, estate planning, etc. 

The problem is that they are testing people in wildly different industries (investment brokers, insurance providers, accountants etc) oall on the same test with problems that those industries don't individually deal with. A question about insurance options and estate planning isn't going to be something that a stock broker is familiar with because it's not part of their industry, and the stock broker's most morally ethical advice would be to talk to an insurance broker or estate planning service. But since the test isn't concerned with morally ethical behavior, they are being asked to cite or quote the appropriate legalese that would compel them to act in a particular way if they were responsible for giving that advice."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah Australia's financial systems are a joke.  One of our big 4 banks got done for knowingly laundering money for child sex traffickers.  What was the result of the investigation you ask.  The ceo stood down and the bank paid a big fine. Where did the bank get the money to pay the penalty you ask.  No branch staff or managers got any bonuses that year no Christmas parties and the bank paid out less money to shareholders.  The people actually responsible weren't really penalised in any meaningful way.

Lastly, lots of people have to learn things not 100% relevent to their job.  Outside perspectives can be valuable without benefitting you immediately or overtly.

Ethics does form a small part of this test, but the Ethics hurdle is actually a uni-level subject that everyone has to pass as part of a new minimum education standard (I've already done the Ethics unit & it's a waste of time).


The people I know who have sat the test say it's not very relevant, but worse, nobody has any idea how they've done by the end of it because the questions are so poorly constructed. Apparently there's lots of “Choose the most correct response out of these 4 correct responses” type of questions.


I do feel sorry for stockbrokers & insurance specialists. They don't overlap much at all, but are all being assessed identically to holistic financial advisers. I don't want a stockbroker giving estate planning advice, & definitely not taking portfolio construction advice from a risk-only adviser."

Not only does a huge portion of their own earned money go to some ducking fund, but that fund is going to invest in shit that makes the low wage persons life harder- eg toll roads, real estate, private energy monopolies and so on."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ummm I don’t think you understand how momentum driving works and how hedge funds take advantage of their extreme liquidity.       

Example:     
A hedge fund runs as a trading desk with 30+ different traders(high number). With $1b in liquidity that gives the traders roughly 33m each. When they go into the morning briefing, there is a list of stocks that they talk about as a team. The entire team writes down notes on the different keys that a hedge fund might look at whether it’s 5,10,15 ema and minute spacing or planned news announcements. Now with $33m each, they are all targeting the same stock, but since each trader has a different trading technique it is not considered manipulation or insider trading. For instance: you might have an options trader buying otm options at open while it drops for 5-15 minutes, then when the momentum starts to reverse you might see other traders start buying itm call options to drive the price/delta up. While all of this going on, other parties might be replicating similar moves or adding positions with buy at ask orders. After a set time frame that all the traders will be looking for as indicators of reversal, the otm options will likely sell first and cover with an extreme amount of otm puts, then everyone would attempt to drop their positions simultaneously while picking up hedges to drive the price down. Keep in mind, a hedge fund having $1b of liquidity is probably on the lower end. With $1b of liquidity and over $300m of that being used to trade options(itm and otm, while staying spread out) they can have 2-50x exposure which at $300m is a lot of leverage to have on a stock.           

To my point above: citadel released a news announcement about how they had a ton of calls, a ton of puts, and ridiculous amounts of shares in RKT. They were able to single handedly cause a gamma squeeze and mini short squeeze just buy filling position and forcing people to cover due to high risk which sent the prices sky high in aftermarket/premarket where they were subsequently able to exercise and sell their shares for profit while having the puts as a hedge, and selling the puts once they ran out of shares and hitting profit on both the upswing and down swing.           

That’s only 1 example of how hedge funds and trading desks use their positions and liquidity to take over the markets and get people to buy high and sell low. It is also how hedge funds are able to drive costs, so people get margin called when it falls. When that happens the brokerage makes tons of money because not only did they buy the stock when it was low via margin call, they can now use the position to drive the stock in whatever direction they want. The reason why you will never hear any complaints about manipulation and price driving by hedge funds is because the broker like schwab or robinhood make immense amounts of money when their clients get margin called and the broker can diamond hand their way to gains because they have an inside track on direction. Look up how much brokerages earn from margin trading and margin calls, not related to margin loans.        

Keep in mind, the same things have had a history of repeating itself throughout history. Everything has a tendency of repeating itself even if it shows up in a different name."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can’t believe I’m still having to explain this. Black rock doesn’t have to loan the shares twice.

Think of it like a money loan. You deposit $100 in the bank and you’re the only customer. The bank reports $100 in deposits. Joe walks in and gets a $50 loan which they deposit into his checking account. Your account balance lists $100, Joes lists $50, somehow the bank has $150 out of $100 of real money.

The share ownership figure is the same except with an extra step. Black rock owns 100 shares. Melvin borrows 50 and sells them to you. Your portfolio lists 50 shares and black rock lists 100 shares. 150% ownership. 


This is a fundamentally different number than the % of float shorted. We weren’t talking about that until you brought it up just now but that can go over 100% too without any issues.

So in the above example we currently have 50% shares shorted right? Melvins big brother Marvin comes along and borrows your 50 shares and sells them to me. 100% shorted. Marvin’s friend Frank comes along and borrows my 50 shares and sells them back to you because you’re doubling down. At this point on the books black rock owns 100 shares, you own 100 shares, I own 50 shares. Melvin is short 50, Marvin is short 50, and Frank is short 50. We have 250% ownership and 150% short. Nothing shady happened to get there."

What if you went and took 25% of the classes and paid a bribe for the rest so you never learned the skills needed to preform the job? My point is you can't buy a degree and expect it to work just the same because you're rich, you have to put in work and get educated to be qualified for these jobs. 

Also if my employer says I need a degree (or license) to work and I fired back 'but I like Jeff bezos and Steve jobs and they don't have degrees' they would laugh In my face and say ""oh you like Jeff bezos? Go start a multi billion dollar company then we can talk about your qualifications"""

You can't fake an accounting degree then do someone's taxes. You can hire people to do it for you, you can hire people to run the business for you, but you can't run it yourself.

They use their power and influence to not only get jobs but to actively sabotage competition.

In a legislative hearing for a bill requiring merit be considered for judicial nominations, the former attorney general of Hawaii stated that this bill was to address questions of nepotism as two appellate court judges were interested and not included on the list to the governor for candidates.

You know graphics cards cost twice as much and are impossible to buy. Extrapolate that into the summer when everyone but Texas wants to cash in on this green new deal jam. Retail/Scalpers may benefit from that, but it's less than worthless when you are filling last year's wholesale orders. 

The cost of metallurgical silicon is up 30%. Every DD done since 2010 basically ignores the possibility that we could have another shortage. Thanks pandemic. Now they are saying 5 years to sort it out entirely? That's Biden's entire administration.

Oh, and did you know that nearly every solar company with meaningful output is not 'really' based in the US. There are three diamond domestic dogs: FSLR, TSLA, and SPWR. SPWR uses silicon, I can't find explicit text about TSLA/Panasonic material but it does look like a clusterfuck of a deal that's falling apart. 

FSLR is the largest. Since 2015. AND THEY DO NOT USE SILICON.

Solar panels are about to be even more in demand than GPUs are now. Only one domestic company can fill trucks with them this year. 

MSM were churning out articles convincing people to sell this stock while they were actively shorting it. Not one fucking article mentions THEY DO NOT USE SILICON. 

Please, look"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hi I just wanted to put in a small warning. I honestly think that we are in a green bubble most companies with the sustainable label is up 100% in last year alone. I know there is huge demand for the sustainable market and a ton of retirement stuff is starting to shift holdings. I'm super into sustainability and can only wish that it keeps on going up becasue we need like a 50t invested in renewable by 2050 to reach the 2 degree warming target. Way more to keep it at 1.5 but we never know who will become the apple of this, technology is still evolving. These are my two cents. Be careful to jump on the train tho, growth is definitely needed and there is a demand"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"No. That is one choice and it is called exercising your option. The contract they hold gives them the right, but not the obligation, to buy 100 shares of gme at $300. You never have to exercise your option if you don't want to. Your second choice is to sell the option itself. Much quicker than exercising the option then selling shares at market value. Cheaper too. The premium is generally the profit you would make by exercising the option and selling the shares at market value (if the contract is in the money).

Third choice, if the option is out of the money, is let it go to the expiration date and expire worthless"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"He didn't exercise the option contract, he sold it. Otherwise, yes, he would have to exercise the option, spend 30,000 and of the price of a share was 350, sell 100 shares to make his 5000."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,3/19 300 gme call is only worth about 35$ right now. This guy is probably down a pretty good amount
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Makes sense
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is literally the point of options trading
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I see option price basically as intrinsic value ($stock - $strike or $0) + time value (~$0 at 7 days to expiry) + volatility value ($fuckloads). Obviously this is a volatile stock, to say the least"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude even the $800 calls for 3/12 had $100->$700 swings on Wednesday
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think he did sell these options and we are seeing the profits at the time he sold them. The gme call for example would have expired out of the money. The value of an option (which is the premium you pay to hold the option) changes as the price of the underlying stock changes. Selling a gme call with a strike price of 300 on the day that gme spiked past 300 will be more profitable than selling the same contract on Friday when gme traded sideways under $290 all day. 

Selling an option very similar to selling a stock. You can calculate the potential profits of any option at optionsprofitcalculator.com 

Basically, when you buy an option you are betting on the stock going up (if you buy a call) or going down (if you buy a put) in a defined amount of time (the expiry date of your options contract). Options have two kinds of value. Intrinsic value: Basically how much you would make if you exercised the option and sold the stock at market value. Say you have an option to buy 100 shares of stock x at $3 share that expires in 30 days. Currently stock x is trading at 3.50. If you exercised the option, buying 100 shares at $3 ($300) and then immediately sold those shares at market value of 3.50 ($350) you'd net a profit if $50 or $.5 per share. The intrinsic value of stock x today would be .5/share. If you wanted to sell the option instead of exercising it, it would cost the buyer .5/share or $50 to buy that option from you (it is a bit more complicated than this. The ask would be ~.5/share but the buy may be lower. The difference between the buy and the ask is referred to as the spread. This is how much it will cost you to enter and exit an options position. You generally want the buy and ask to be close.)

So, say when you bought the options contract last week when stock x was worth 3.10/share. It would have cost you around .10/share to buy the contract with a strike price of $3. .10x100=$10. If you sell company x today when it is worth $3.50, you will net the .5/share ($50), minus the premium you paid to hold the contract, .1/share ($10), you net $40 profit. The person buying the call option from you is hoping the price goes up even more, making the premium on the contract worth more than when they bought it, so they can net a larger profit.

This is where the second kind of options value comes in to play: extrinsic value. Basically, is this a stock that moves a lot every day in either direction. If yes, then it is more likely that the contract will at some point be in the money, or in the case of our company x more in the money than it is already, making options on this company more valuable. This is referred to as implied volatility. Options buyers want price action, at the end of the day they need the stock to move. Even a stock dropping $100 in a day can be good for a call buyer depending on their expiry date, because a stock that drops 100 bucks in a day is more likely to go up higher than a stock that trades sideways between say 2 and 3 dollars every day. In general, you want to buy when implied volatility is low and sell when it is high. Keep in mind that when you hold an option, every day the price does not move or trades sideways you are losing money. This is referred to as time-decay. Time decay goes up exponentially as you approach the expiry date until eventually your options contract is worth nothing if the option stays out of the money (worth less than your strike price if we are talking calls, more than your strike price if we are talking puts). The most you can lose when buying simple calls and puts is the premium you paid to hold the contract. Going back to our company x, this is the $.1/share or $10 that you spent to hold the option. 

This comment kind of got away from me. I hope I answered your question."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Screenshot price is ~$59 so he could have sold for $5,900 each, a better deal than exercising at $350"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actually, don't think you can confirm from the pic that they're sold.  I think column 4 reps total gains after costs."

2021-03-13 09:21:10,wallstreetbets,"Options 101 for the Learned Ape - Knuckles off the ground Edition # So you're on RobinBull WeHood and you wanna play options.

&#x200B;

**Options are the easiest way to lose money. If  you are going to walk into this pit of snakes; do not start off by doing it dick first. I am not a professional. This is not financial advice. If I am wrong call me out. If I don't know the answer to a question I will find someone that does.**

Now you have a choice, some would say the option, to read this wall of text which means you  think, ask questions, get Gud or you not and you can Yolo Gamble at the moon and be angry/happy that the stonk god that lives in your phone givith or taketh away...

**So lets touch the monolith shall we**[**.**](https://u.teknik.io/kJXMd.jfif)

These services let you trade what's called covered options. You can buy puts and calls.  Let's talk about the long call to start once you figure that out you can just reverse everything and call it a put.

**Long calls are types of options** which are a contract that is made between you and the seller of the contract that states you have the right to purchase shares of the underlying stock for the price agreed upon from that seller.  This is called the strike price, but it's really just the price that you can purchase the stock at. So You now own the right not the obligation to purchase the stock at anytime between now and when the option closes. Some would say you have the OPTION to purchase the stock at the agreed upon price not the obligation. Option contracts are actually a bundle of contracts covering 100 shares.

So the seller is betting that by the date the the share price will be ""out of the money"" or beneath the contract strike price and you are betting it will be above it. Because if you buy the right to purchase GOEV at 15 dollars for 100 shares and it's 30 dollars by the time the contract is up you now own 15$ x 100 in value. Because you can take the 100 shares you got for 15 and sell them for 30. What if you paid just a fraction for the right to do this?  What if you paid say. 10 cents per share for the right to do this... You might make some money..  This is why options are called derivative products because they derive the value from what they contain not from the actual share of the company. Options contain the time left until expiry.  In this time they may go up or down.  The ability for an option to gain more value (and lose it) directly affects the price of the option.  Options that are farther out are less risky for you and more risky for the seller so will always be more expensive than ones closer in.

The price per contract represents money times 100 shares because it is the price per share so a 5 cent 3/19 15c (A long call for 15 dollars representing the ability to purchase 100 shares of the underlying stock for 15 dollars a share at any time until 3/19 costing 5 cents per share) is 5 bucks a contract... 0.05 cents per share x 100 shares = 1 call option contract.


If the Share Price at the time of expiry is 14.99 the option is worthless because you could just go to market and buy it there cheaper it just wouldn't make sense to ""execute"" the option on 99 percent of the situations. A short squeeze is actually one of the situations where executing makes sense for shorts underwater.

So if I was going to sell you the right to buy $GOEV at 100 bucks, that's a lot of risk for you and not a lot of risk for me so the price would be low... 0.05 cents per contract x100 contracts per bundle would be 5 bucks.  So you with 50 bucks could have 10 contracts... I take your 50 bucks and think I made a good trade...

Tomorrow UBER says they partnered. (A very real possibility) and it revalues the company at 75 billion dollars or so which is 20x it's current share price of like 200 and now you have the right to buy 10 bundles of 100 shares at 100 dollars per share  and you could immediately sell that on the market for profit. So you spent 50 bucks but in the end will make (1,000 x 100 dollars) so 100,000 dollars from 50.  **But people will buy that right from you for that much so you don't have to actually purchase the shares.**  so the price of that contract would be 100 (with a little sugar on top for how much time is left on it) x100 per contract. Now what if the expiry of this contract was tomorrow. Is it very likely that the valuation of $GOEV will be 100 tomorrow? No so that would be dumb to even buy for any money. but what about in 2 years. Well that's way more likely and so the price will change based upon the likelihood of the sp achieving these prices..

Lets say you spend 1000 dollars on a fuck ton of options for a strike price of 3 dollars on a stock that's worth 2. You pay .40  for them.  If that stock goes to 1.50. It is very likely that the price will go to .20  meaning you just lost 500 fucking dollars. Just like that.  Whereas you would only have lost 250 if you bought shares. Options also expire and Shares last foreverish. Options are timed play most of the time as in you think there is going to be a catalyst which moves the Share price.

Also, Open Interest means the amount of contracts out for a given strike price.  Sometimes there isn't enough volume to support that mega bag of super OTM option contracts you got on some weird stock no one knows about.  Make sure there is plenty of volume if its something you are going to move.

So you wanna buy options when the stock is down and sell them when it's up because you get your max benefits like shares. In fact you want to time options so that you time market sentiment or news.  Feel like a buyout is coming and it might affect the SP positively.. well yolo some calls brosky.  **Remember TA is virgin astrology. DD is the Lifestyle Chads live.**

Also, you will always put a limit price on your purchase or sales for these options.  A limit is just declaring you will sell these options for said price.  You can not just ""market buy"" options for as far as I know.

You will never owe money on Robinhood because you can only buy or sell calls or puts that are covered. Covered means you set the shares aside 100 of them until expiry.. naked means you have enough big baller money to say hey.. I'm good for it... Naked options are where the theoretically infinite loss comes from due to the fact that the share price could change infinitely... As in what if you needed 100 shares and there's only 101 and I knew you needed them so I could charge you whatever money I wanted... This is where naked shorting gets I to a problem...  Those calls you bought? Someone else is covering them or more likely a market maker worth billions is good for them. Robinhood wouldn't let you be that dumb...

The last piece here is that market makers have to maintain a certain amount of shares on hand per every option they sell.. this is related to the Delta which is the change in price over time... So a Delta of .5 means that for every 100 shares a market maker has to own 50 if the price goes over the strike price or itm at expiry a market maker has to have 100 shares per 1 contract sold. So it goes and just buys it at market.  There are a metric fuckton of calls that are sold on GOEV that are approaching being in the money and when they do mm have to buy which drives up the price... I  actually suspect a bunch of gambling addicted apes are jacking those numbers to Mars.  Making MM purchase millions of shares per every dollar of valuation.

For example there are currently 26523 contracts for 3/29 17.5c 26523 x100 means those contracts represent 2.6 million shares.  When the SP hits 16 and it becomes more likely that it will be in the money market makers will go to market and purchase 265k shares and that's just for that one strike price for 1 dollar.. AKA the beating heart of the Gamma Squeeze.

**This is the real game you are playing and how you fit into it my friends...**

Edit 1 - if you think you're actually going to make profit check out this calculator in /u/dumbveganbitch's [response](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m41ghq/options_101_for_the_learned_ape_knuckles_off_the/gqsjog1?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3). Option value is just a description of a point in the trajectory of a rocket ship, should it actually take off this helps you figure out the optimal height to bail.

Edit 2 - [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m41ghq/options_101_for_the_learned_ape_knuckles_off_the/gqt2a2s?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) is a good question by /u/UncoolDad31. The price of an option contract is called the premium you can see how ~~share price had to go above the Strike~~ if the market **believes** the share price will go above the strike price and the premium you paid you will profit.  As the share price approaches the strike price and the velocity increases, raising the premium means the next buyer will take on the option at a higher price.  You get laid because you took the risk initially and are essentially creating a safer bet for the next person.  Or so they think. 

Essentially you bought tickets to the moon while the rocketship was on the launch pad and then it took off without exploding. Mid flight those tickets would be more expensive because there's more of a likelihood of getting there. But still some risk. By the time you reach the moon those tickets would reflect the least risk because you're already there. But maybe you haven't totally landed.  The best time to sell options  is on a spike right before the rocket explodes. There's always the last fool sitting in that 🚀 just make sure it's not you."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you Maurice 🦍🦍💪
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm trying to understand this. I also feel like I'm failing miserably. 

Let's say there's a stock that the current share price is 75 bucks. I really believe that this particular stock is going to do well. 

I can buy an call option contract with a strike price of $50. Bid: 35 and Ask: 41. 270 day expiration. 

I'm purchasing this contract for the option to buy 100 shares for 50 dollars apiece on the expiration date? And I'm paying 41 dollars for that option? So I have 41 dollars per contract (100 shares) that I pay to the seller and then 5000 that I have to come up with in order to exercise my option on the expiration date? Or am I paying 41 dollars per share to have the option to buy them at 50 dollars a share on expiration? But then I'm into them for 91 dollars a share total and none of this makes any sense. 

Please help. I'm exceptionally retarded."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a good summary.  I’m not expert by any means.  But what fascinates me about option and still don’t under stand is how contracts can be worth money even if you still haven’t hit your break even.  I’ve been up 100-200% on contracts like this.  I’m assuming It has to do with IV but still don’t get it.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I do a lot of things dick first, thank you for the warning!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didn't really understand the explanation of what ""5 cent 3/19 15c"" meant. 
Does 5 refer to the amount you pay per share to buy the contract, i.e. $0.05*100 
And does 15c mean if you choose to exercise the call you pay $15 per share at 3/19?
Can someone's wife's bf explain please?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So if I’m getting this right. If I have 100 shares and make a sell option for $200 in 2 weeks and the market is at $150 and someone pays the premium for it but it only hits 199, then I wouldn’t sell my shares and I’d make money off the premium? But if it hits 300 then I still make money off the premium but I could have made more just selling them on the market?

Also when it comes to buying I just need it to go over the premium in order to make money by just selling the contract? And if it doesn’t reach the strike price then I’m only out the premium I paid? 

I’ve been slowly trying to figure out options all week so I’m trying to see if I’m getting it down"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"> So a Delta of .5 means that for every 100 shares a market maker has to own 50 if the price goes over the strike price or itm at expiry a market maker has to have 100 shares per 1 contract sold.

Not exactly. Just some grade AAA autism here but market makers also hedge gamma and vega by buying other options, which cover some of the delta in the process. So they might own something more like 20-ish shares on a .50 delta."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You've got it right until the end there. If you exercise your contracts, the premium you've already paid is deducted from what you owe to own the shares outright.

If your contracts expire with no action on your end because you were too hungover and stuck on the porcelain throne with Tostinos Party Pizza shits, your broker will either a) exercise it for you or b) sell it because you didn't have enough cash in your account to buy.

Don't ever let your options expire, pay attention to your bet"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I do not buy options, but you must buy a call for a higher share price.

If AMD is at $74, and i think they will be at $85-$90 next year, i might buy calls for $80 and $85.


It doesn't make sense to buy at that price right now, but someone would love to buy that $80 contract off you if the share price becomes $85. You can sell the contract for a nice profit, and THAT person can exercise.

The person that exercises gets 100 shares at $80. You might never plan on exercising a contract, waiting for a buyer, or for it to expire worthless."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good catch

You're right it was late I had a different example I simplified and didn't update the numbers 

it's still 100k  (10 contracts for 100 shares a piece 1000 shares at a profit of 100 per share 100,000$) 

Have an all seeing eye for your diligence..."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro my Gamma is the square root of negative 1... I have commitment issues...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you do not cover the calls actually and just promise the shares at expiry. This is called selling naked calls.

If you sell options covered you sequester the shares. If the options are in the money cat expiry then you lose the 100 shares but still keep the premium.

 You wouldn't have access to that type of trade without a margin in the 6 almost 7 digits and a real broker. Because you can see how if the share price leaps you could be on the hook for a lot of money"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,No
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It's because you essentially took on risk that is no longer there... Sort of like you paid for tickets on a rocket ship before it took off and now that it's in flight and more certain it will get to space and not blow up on the launch pad those tickets would be worth more...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"When contracts are priced they are priced per share they contain. Normal contracts you buy contain 100 shares think about them as a box with 100 shares. The current share price is 10.

 I say I'll pay you 15 dollarsr a share on or before 3/19 

You say it's not really worth my time to do just one share so this box of one hundred will cost you 5 cents a share or 5 bux.

I would never come get that box unless the SP was over 15 because I could just go to market and get it cheaper."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So this is called selling a covered long call.  Yes you would make money off your premium. In fact you will make money off of the premium until the share price I'd above the premium that you sold it for.  

The buyer of your option just gives you the money and walks away you can spend that money however you want...

When you buy an option you want the market to think the Share price will be over the premium you paid for it... This is how premiums add valuation

Yes you are just out the money you paid, just like the person that would have paid you for the long calls you sold.  People make a living off of selling covered Tesla calls.

Yes, buying options you will only be out the money you paid for them, selling naked calls or puts means you have theoretically infinite losses... See GME for further details on that"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I'll chip in 10 cents if I can maybe eat your fries later
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok. That makes a lot more sense. And if I were to sell the contracts ahead of time then I would get whatever the going rate for call option contracts is at the time of selling. So if the ask is say 52 bucks for a long call a month out, and I decided to sell, I'd make 11 dollars a share?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can buy calls that are already ITM like OP suggested.  However they have a double edged sword.  The delta is higher.  This means the value of the underlying contact will change quicker. Great thing if you make the right bet, a not so great thing if you don't.

If I buy a call already ITM by 10$ and the price goes up on my stock by 5 dollars, the value of my contract is going to roughly increase by 5$ due because the delta is probably something like 0.993 meaning for every dollar the stock increases, the options contract increases by 99.3 cents.  

However if I buy an OTM call with a strike 5$ higher than the currently trading price, the current delta is probably 0.1 (roughly).  However as the stock rises and approaches our strike price the delta will increase.

 Typically a call ITM by $5 will have a delta of 0.95, one at the money will have a delta of 0.5 and one $5 OTM will have a delta of 0.1.  These are obviously rough estimates, every derivative will have different factors that change the value of the greeks."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I still don’t understand how much I could lose. So I think a stock that is trading at 88 is going to 90. I buy calls for .50 at 100 so ten block for 500. The stock goes to 87 do I lose the 500 plus 1 dollar per share so -1000 minus contract of 500  my downside is the initial contact and then the downside. I’m sorry for my horrible phrasing.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, because you don't actually have the shares, the reason these are called options not **obligations**  is that you can just walk away and do nothing. You just lose the premium that you paid on the option.  But your example is a good risk hedge because since the option is still ""in the money at 87 cents"" you lost money on your premium but you haven't lost your entire paycheck...

 This style of option will not valuate as much and will essentially just track the share price at a certain point.

In the end you would have to execute the option to purchase the underlying shares."

Because now each share is worth half as much as before and if it doesn't get up to the strike price I purchased at before expiry I'm OTM."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is a good question my brother /u/thenightowlf had some virx? options which went through a merger that involves a reverse stock split, they actually get rewritten by the market makers as special contracts that accommodate for the new share structure.  You should sell these soon because they will have low volume usually.b

Essentially they reflect what the person or mm now holds in that ""box"" of shares you bought the right to.  So if the stock splits 1 - 2 you now own the right to effectively 200 shares... imagine if someone sold those contracts naked, 

RobinBull will freak out and not update for a while, you'll freak  out and if it's a reverse split you probably just lost your shirt... But whoever opened Tesla calls when it split is a made man though"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,No worries that's a great question.  This is some meta level stuff and why DD is important... I had to read the merger announcement to get how it was going to play.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,">why DD is important...

I've been bouncing around the idea of purchasing some calls for a stock I've been watching given some recent developments with the company. Trying to do my due diligence before betting big. But I knew nothing about options other than a vague knowledge of their existence. 

A little knowledge is a dangerous thing, so I'm trying to gain as much knowledge as possible about everything involved before I pull the trigger on it. I *do* think the company will do really well, but I've been worried I'll get fucked over on a technicality. 

So, thus far I've only bought shares outright. That money I count as being already gone. Calls seemed like more of a gamble to me where the losses could potentially be devastating. And I didn't know enough about them to say otherwise. Now I'm kinda looking at them in a different light. I mean, sure. I stand to lose a shit-ton if I'm wrong, but I was thinking that a 5000 dollar bet could turn into a 50,000 dollar loss. (Which I suppose it still could if I wasn't paying attention...) but it seems like if you do your research, pay attention to the stock and don't get caught with your pants down you can minimize the losses on covered calls. 

Or maybe I'm reading all this wrong and I'll lose my ass speculating..."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm pissing *your* pants too.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,If you keep using EdGe imma have to bitchslap the fuck outta you
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Save yourself.  It's gonna be a bloodbath next week.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pros wear diapers 

Points to head"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"“Naw, not that jar. It’s the one labeled, ‘Perfectly Good Drinkin’ Piss.’”"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you running on DOS ?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Y'all going to be wearing golden diapers
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Is that like the queen of the urine?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,is she cute?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"At the same time part of this balances on the fact that people hold. If everyone does this then it would hurt the potential of the squeeze. It depends a bit on your position of course, having to sell a small portion to cover the cost wouldn't matter too much, but there's a lot of people out there that average at 200+, they'd need to sell 80%+ to forcefully break even"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s not where you wear them.....
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,of course! what else do apes use?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That may be, but those people will not be sharing the consequences if this person goes broke. They will not feed, house, or care for them. Therefore other people’s positions, choices, investment decisions, and appetite for risk are not this persons concern. 

Investing is not a communist activity, it’s very capitalistic in nature and is always a zero sum game. At some point you have to decide which side you will be on, because everyone cannot be on the winning side of a trade."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,...Unless you are talking shit.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,If someone's investing an amount where being able to feed or taking care of themselves would be at risk then they're in too deep. At that point they probably shouldn't have been here to begin with
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree, but it’s naive to think that is not occurring here. I’ve seen plenty to suggest otherwise."
2021-03-13 08:31:59,wallstreetbets,BB suffering might end soon. Let 💎✋ Jesus turn my red into green!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am pretty sure I am the proud owner of the most expensive BB shares in history.

10@26...

This is what happens when sleep deprivation meets someone with an absurd limit.

If I just hold for 50 more years. Inflation will probably make it green right?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've read in the media articles saying BB will take forever to see significant gains. When I read these ""opinions"" I'm fully convinced that they are trying to manipulate full retard retail investors. Just like when they were advertising to buy AMZN at over 3200$ ""to see significant returns"". So I'm expecting a good ride up for BB. Not GME like of course, but a good ride nevertheless."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"1.9k shares at $8.19 with a handful of leaps! 
i. love. this. stock."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,BB 🚀🚀🚀
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,BB to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌙🌙🌙🌙🌙 I love this stock. It will not only come back in the next month it will grow consistently with the Cybersecurity market. Deeply undervalued. Adding more each chance I get. 2100@17.33
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Plan on buying a few hundred more come Monday
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,German here: 115 x 15.52€
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Once this stock hits $ 50 a share before EOY or more ya'll are going to be wishing for the day you could have bought at $13. I really think that there is also a possibility that BB will be purchased by Amazon, Apple or Google."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Need a 10k loss on shares or a 2k loss on options for a loss post. Since you have 10k equity in one position this can count as a yolo, I reflaired it."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought the day would never come. Rejoice!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like the stock.

Earning at the end of the month may include the FB settlement amounts. Probably a good time to buy more now."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Let my bb flowww
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,. 005?? Close your short contracts man!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,God dam true legend we will be fetching u soon
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for making me feel better about my average buy in at 18.25
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude I have one contract at 30C expiring next week. Also have another 4@24C expiring in Sept. 

Total cost was around 5k now worth about $220... 

My stupidest play this year. Got caught up in the madness when it was going up and rode them into the drop. I’ve pretty much accepted I’ve lost that cash."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought 272 @ 17 and honestly I just want it to get above 20 so I can walk away.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would i wan to miss the chance of averaging down
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That 24c will break even at worst.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Did same through RKT that lesson cost bout 3k. I was up 8k for just a second but greedy greed got best of me
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You’ve learned a valuable lesson don’t buy contracts if you don’t know how to use them should have just bought stock instead. You’re only hope is it keeps climbing next week
2021-03-13 08:18:12,wallstreetbets,THEY TRIED AND FAILED! 🚀🦍🙌💎🙌🦍🚀

Those were the best of days."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know it’s small, but I hate that it starts on 24 and ends on 87"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,God dammit. If GME is Beast Mode I better stock the fuck up.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait, GME went down but morphed into another guy? Retard is strong with you sir."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Love seeing all the fellow 12s apes here
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Seahawks have prepared me for the ultimate pressure battle - GAMESTOP SuperStonk Bowl
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Why does the Gamestop move from Lynch’s head to 87’s head at the end lmao
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,GO FUCKING HAWKS
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,DFV should be one of the blockers
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I LOVE THIS. You can check my fucking reddit history, I've talked shit and had tears or joy and hate in all the Hawks game threads, I'm a salty mf, love the Hawks memes. GO HAWKS"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The fact that GME is almost on the same heights as the first squeeze, but without a squeeze yet... must be terrifying for the shorters.
I admit it scares me too. This is massive."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,As a Saints fan I am very conflicted

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I remember being at a restaurant waiting for a table when this happened and cheering as he stiff armed that poor bastard from the saints into the ground and I don’t even like the Seahawks
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What I want to know is how do people convince tv personalities to run the length of a football field just for a meme? Why would Jim Cramer agree to this? Is there something I am missing in my analysis here?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This stock is in beast mode
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You should've placed ape heads on the ones helping GME
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Now do the 99 yard run from Derrek Henry.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great job I loved the faces! Sick touchdown, BEAST MODE!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,you forgot to label all of the seahawks blocking as retards and autism spectrum degenerates
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,the seahawks were 7-9 going into this playoff game only making it because their division was somehow even more trash.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So what yard line are we on?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That number 22 guy really messed up.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I know this is a GME meme but this just makes me sad at the fact that players like him only get to play 6-8 years in the league yet I have to see players like Tom Brady play 25 years and get paid hundreds of millions more...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Except we haven’t actually scored yet.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Great photo of Kenny G looking like he pooped himself
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer swimming in pool without water.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I think we are 1st and goal....dno about that TD...fu*k the eagles **cough**
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't watch rugby for 🌈🐻 but that was an amazing touchdown
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Epic run but in hindsight, also pretty shitty tackling."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha fken love it!!!

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,and that’s the running back they didn’t use on the goal line in the superbowl
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Perfect. Cramer as the defensive back that tossed like a bitch is spot on!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,LMFAO IM WEAK 🤣😂🤣
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I love these memes looool
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Still an underrated post...just like GME
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"""GET OFF ME!""  He says to Suckboy Cramer!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Let's not forget how the game ended. Always run!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m so conflicted by this post...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What software/website do you use to do this?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the content I’ve been waiting for
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"They tried every single day...  if you notice how the market changes suddenly, and then it recovers... I have never seen in my whole life such thing. Hold hold and hold."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Is there something wrong with the color balance? The uniforms look like Eagles green. Was trying to figure out who the eagles had at rb that ran like Marshawn
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I always wondered how Polumbuses got made
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Keep Pounding Boyz!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hold muh diiiiiick
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"More like GameGO, amirite?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This touchdown probably gets disallowed by video footage we are not allowed to see !
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Every tackle he broke should  have had the diamonds hands gif pop up.

Then it would  have been glorious!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Hold my diiiiick!!"""
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure there was an illegal block in the back at the end there but I won't tell nobody I promise
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Hold my diiiiick"" -Marshawn Lynch
""Hold my stoooonk"" - GameStop Lynch"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like a Greased up Deaf Guy skit from Family Guy
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Free Skittles and stiff arm with every squeeze
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,And then in the superbowl they didn't give that man the ball on the 1 yard-line to win the game and lost instead. We apes won't make the same mistake. HOLD!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I put the portfolio on my back doe
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Darren Sharper HOLD MY DICK!!!

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,where is DFV blocking ?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,As a Cardinals fan F the sea chickens but GME...go baby go!!!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hold ma dick !!! 🍆
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a Giants fan, I know this is fake. Because Jim Cramer doesn't run."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,U should have made the ball gme and the player wsb but still amazing and I recognize that as simple as it seems I could not do this in a million years.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So they call this run Beastquake because the stadium rightfully lost their minds and cheered and stamped so hard it registered on the Richter scale as a minor earthquake.

Imagine what they will call this in the market full force. GME just getting to the line of scrimmage."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"BEASTMOOOODEEEEE. He started an earthquake on this play, literally"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How is this done? Do you cut and paste the heads on frame by frame?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I can’t wait until they make a documentary about this later on down the road 😁
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,They tried and DIED!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,lmao that Jimmy Chill stiff arm.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Beast mode!!!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"And just like Seattle I’m sure GME will pass the ball instead of throwing it, too 😎 Oh wait...."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m just ‘bout that action boss
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So I’m not looking to sell but I did try to put a sale limit order of $1000 per share I use or think or swim for my platform. The funny thing is think or swim will not let you sell with a sale limit in the excess of 100% from what the current sell or bid price is. Which reinforces my view on what everybody says about the stock where it could go to the moon because if I try to sell anything else in my portfolio with a sale limit deep out of the money excess of over 100 234- 500% that’s not an issue it only becomes an issue with GameStop for some strange reason we all know market manipulation by the market makers
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So.. it’s over?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just can’t believe that they allowed him to do that in a playoff game. Just a massive defensive collapse. 

You should meme in some old Barry Sanders clips."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I was at this game! Man did that stadium rumble after that touchdown run!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Beast mode!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I remember watching this game live. I was a saints fan before but after watching many games similar to this one, I just stopped watching the nfl."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I was expecting to see photoshopped ape heads on all the other players lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,BEAST MODE ENGAGE BITCHES!!! WHERES MY MOTHERFUCKING SKITTLES!!!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Jesus christ their entire team touched him
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What a strong arm block! Always fun to watch
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer is such a little bitch
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,They need to try harder!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,HOLD MAH DIIIIICK!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cool, when do we dump?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,FUCK OUT MY FACE J-crapper!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can't stop the Gamestop
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Almost perfect except the GameStop logo switches in the endzone from the RB to a lineman. But this is hilarious!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,“Hold ma diccc”
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,See ya Cramer!!!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Where is ole paperhanded Portnoy in this? He singlehandedly kept us sideways yesterday when he hopped back on the hype train.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Finally a meme format i can get down with.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,But I like the saints and the stock
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What did you use to make this?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Easy. Touchdown. Darren sharper. Holdmadiiiiiiickkkkk
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam: “They tried and died.”
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The beast quake. I so much love this
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Some of the linemen blocking for Beastmode should have Cohen/Cuban/DFV

That one GME guy was good!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Back when Cramer was talking about WSB you guys where blushing your buttcheeks off. Took you a while to understand he is NOT our friend.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Take care of y’alls chicken.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck off little Cramer bitch
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Darren sharper hold my diiiiiick
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Should have put DFV's head on the FB who leveled that block that allowed Marshawn HMD Lynch to break free.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,When I saw the post title and the Seahawks what immediately came to mind was the time they *didn’t* give the ball to Marshawn on the 1 yard line to clinch the super bowl.  I guess I really am scarred for life.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,GMEQuake
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Is that Louis CK?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the only live pro football game I've ever been to and it was magical.  BEAST QUAKE

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,As a Saints fan I hate this 😭
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,#78 should be DFV
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The only thing missing now is beast mode buying GME stocks/calls
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I cant watch this clip without hearing, ""darren sharper, hold my diiiiiick"" in my head"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,u/savevideo
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't know if I would say GME did *that* good this week. More like fumbled and recovered for 0 total yards.

Still holding strong though. Even sold off some others to buy one of the inevitable upcoming dips."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,HODL MY DIIICK!!!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, of course no one goes to the e-club. There's zero chance of getting laid, and the place is full of lifers and A-schoolers."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ahhh- the famous beast quake that rocked Seattle
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,GOOOOOO HAWKS
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Upvoted 50% for WSB, 50% for Seahawks."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That was insane!!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a Saints fan, upvoting this was the hardest decision i made in my 2 months of investing."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seahawks fan here. I remember watching this game live in a bar Seattle. It's even more applicable in this situation, because it was the 7-9 Seahawks in the playoffs with a losing record against the defending Super Bowl Champs Saints. This run by Marshawn Lynch sealed the victory for the Hawks. The crowd blew up so loud that it set off seismographs near the stadium, giving the run the nickname ""Beast Quake"". Sorry for rambling, but this brought back a lot of memories. GME to the moon. Not financial advise."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a Saints fan, this absolutely hurts lol"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer takes off his underwear and immediately sniffs it.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I can remember playing madden the day after this happened and trying to recreate that play online against people lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ayyyyy my boiysss
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Just wanted to comment the [source](https://youtu.be/pYlvPDZlt1Y) in case anyone doesn’t already know this historic video
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"the HMD at the end is the cherry on top of this run, meme or not"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Where's my boy King Henry? He makes Marshawn look like his son.

Edit: I still love Marshawn though. He doesn't give a fuck."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao #87 totally stole that running backs head and took all the credit.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"How can they not just do what they did last time and bring it all the way back to $45 for a month?They have several contracts expiring in the next month including thousands ITM? I’m legit smooth brained new trader been in n out of GME holding 10 now but looking for reentry. 

I think next week they’ll crash it hold it low to make the options all worthless and then we will see another pattern like we are in now. My guess it’ll be cyclical. 

Someone help me understand how they can’t ladder it like before..."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow! everyone thank you! Woke up to this blown up Love you apes!!! 🦍🚀🚀🚀💎🙌💎🍌

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Is nobody gonna talk about how the guy making the touchdown passed his GameStop head onto his teammate that almost tripped over him? (0:16)
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It was beastquake all along!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I remember watching this live and saying to myself did he just grab his balls when he dove into the end zone?  The announcers never mentioned it.  On replay you can see he totally grabbed his junk. Still no mention until I went on the internet and we all shared in the good times.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I like this but don't like it because its against the Saints lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hol mah diiiiiiiicccckkkk!!!!!!

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a GME investor, Saints hating, football enthusiast I approve this message."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol..everybody’s going to stop hating on Cramer. He’s about to join the 🦍. Hate the day it but he knows what will get viewers and that’s simply going with the public. Imagine how much his show would 🚀 if he’d just get on the bandwagon.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,DFV as Hasselbeck
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,HOLD MA DICK
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,DFV should be the QB handing it off

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,hedgies can HOLD MY DIIIIIIIICK
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,And they still chose to pass on the 2-yard line... with one time-out remaining.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m a Seahawk fan, too!"

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSBJxtEed1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSBJxtEed1s)

""Crowd silent now, as opposed to when the Saint's had the ball. Oh look at this run! What a run! Marshawn Lynch! Still on his feet! (Oh!) He's got blockers now! He's dancing his way... to the touchdown!"" (Ah!)"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"As you can see by my username, I also find this format appropriate. I was in that stadium that day. Kept thinking he was tacked but beast just kept on running. To say that stadium went nuts is a severe understatement."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Now that I've seen one it makes me question why we've never seen a Beastquake meme before. Its a great format
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,2011 My senior year of high school Reminded me of Sean Alexander
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a 9ers fan I dislike you.  As an NC State alum I think Tom O’Brien is fucking retarded for running Russel Wilson off to Wisconsin over him wanting to play baseball too.  If your franchise lets him go, they are fucking retarded and Pete Carroll has reached peak arrogance."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,As a fellow Hawks fan I approve this post.  Hey just totally of topic - my friend made me a Seahawks banner/wall hanging in a traditional native style to his native art style... Fucking awesome man you gotta see it ! 👍🇨🇦
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a Titans fan, this should be DH22 stiff arming an entire defense on his 99 yard TD run"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This brings back memories as a Hawks fan too. Remember the “hold my dick” memes that followed when Marshawn grabbed himself going into the end zone? The good ol days with Marshawn
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,As a falcons fan I also find this format appropriate. Fuck these guys and fuck the saints
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea you guys are pretty good at running the ball huh?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Beast mode!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,When’s someone gonna make russell Wilson be Melvin and Malcolm butler be gme and the ball be a rocket
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let’s not throw the ball at the one next time, eh?

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It's becoming a different city these days. Gettin' weird(er)
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Uh...what? They were definitely fun times, but Hasselbeck Seahawks wasn't nearly as entertaining as the early Wilson years paired with The Legion of Boom. Still even had Lynch then, and Wilson Seahawks won a Super Bowl and lost another while Hasselbeck Seahawks only lost one. Was a great time as we were a very solid franchise, but I disagree on it being the ""best of days""."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,After watching this with those guys heads on the players they should do the same thing with the actual players heads during the games.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Me too and cosigned.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah that tracking switch at the end bothered me too.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Very different positions and expectations
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can we please stop saying shit like this? I get that everyone is excited and Yes there are some pretty good catalysts for next week but what if nothing happens? Like what if we just trade sideways all week? Then everyone is gonna be saying “it’s over” and the “sell shills” will be out in full force. This is FAR FROM OVER. DFV has 4/11 calls don’t forget that.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"We are up huge! Deflected the media, short attacks etc etc. I’d say we made multipem touchdowns. Game still going! 🚀💎🙌💎🚀"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a Hawks fan people tend to forget that this run happened with like 3:30 left in the game, and it took basically a goal line stop by the Hawks to secure the victory as the Saints needed the TD. Was a fantastic game, but the fact that we almost choked it away gets lost on us being 7-9 that year while having this run known as ""The Beastquake"" as the the home crowds cheering registered on regional Richter Scales."

Thankfully I don't think it will since it seems pointless since a lot of the salary is allegedly locked, so there isn't a real benefit to doing so, and I think they know if would hurt the franchise more than help at this point. Just give Russ an O-line for once in his career so he doesn't get sacked 50 times a game and he will stay put."

And yes, can confirm on the pats and baltimore fans analysis. Although I did work with one cool ravens fan. That's about it."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,DAMN ICARUS.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I respect you for posting but fuck dude. Hate to see people lose massive amounts of money like this.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait... If my sleep-deprived eyes are seeing the correct thing and my smooth brain is interpreting it correctly... 

WERE YOU SELLING NAKED CALLS ON GME?!?

Because if so, holy fuck are you dumb."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's what you get for doing options. If y'all keep buying calls on GME, y'all are only gonna lose. You have to buy shares."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m thinking about the 420 3/19 but I’ve never done options before and I’d probably just lose the 1.7k
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks. I'm pretty retarded
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,No. The List is longer. Just buying call FDs

Oh, okay, thank the tits. That's way less bad."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah every now and then I still do some dumb shit. I decided to go against my strategy of not losing money
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I will never sell naked calls in my life. I like losing money but not that much

But somehow I feel like we're telegraphing our expectations and timing all too well, and getting our hopes up too often.

The shares traded sideways for weeks at 40-50, they traded sideways at 150, they’re trading sideways at 250 now and that’s great.

The last thing you want is it to shoot up to $1000 in 5 minutes and everyone sells, you want a slow rise to a thousand so everyone holds, you want a slow rise to 2k and 3k even so you know those numbers aren’t memes."

There's no expiration on short selling.  It's a battle of attrition until they can't afford to hold their position anymore.  They don't have to give up 3/19.  Stop setting imaginary dates and just hold.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s simple. Buy and hold. GME is easily worth over $1k per share for its e-commerce alone. Believe in Ryan Cohen. 🙌🏼💎🚀
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Listen I can get my hopes up every day and it won't make a bit of difference since I'm not selling. I sit down with my bottle of larceny and question my life choices for a few hours...then I go right back to buying weekly calls on monday.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I think the worst advice ever is to ‘sleep’ on the price action.  You will miss the big squeeze this way and become a bag holder.  This is not a fundamental hold play..  it’s a pure gamble and the people who forget to take profits this time will be truly sorry
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME is a self fulfilling  prophesy, we all believe its going to 🚀 🌕 so we buy shares 💎 🙌,  hence it goes to the moon. If we believe it going to 100k and enough shareholders hold until 100k it becomes true with or without the squeeze. The stock market is speculative, based on belief no matter how much DD you do. So believe and hold fellow apes or don't its your choice."

1) This week we have a ton of new calls that’s expired ITM so wednesdays T+2 should be a strong day. 

2) open interest on 3/19 is HUGE. Open interest on 3/26 falls off. This means game squeeze timing is much more likely next week as opposed to the following.

3) I think people here are overestimating ER. Outlook may be good based on Cohen’s work, but earnings most likely still are not going to be trending up yet"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't even understand what Yoda was trying to accomplish. 

The jedi council:

* Was madly involved with politics, although always passive aggressively until the clone wars.

* More or less abducted young children who shows force sensitivity, but only if they were young enough. Leaving the older children to fend for themselves or find a nice Sith daddy.

* Couldn't figure out how to end a war where the enemy was 99% cheap remotely controlled robots.

* Yoda spent 500+ years training and couldn't even figure out immortality until Qui-Gon came back as a ghost and taught him.

* Practiced cult-like rules and forbade basic humanoid emotions such as Love. 

* Knew about the existence of ancient Jedi temples and Grey Jedi texts that offered actual balance to the force, and just ignored them. Yoda eventually comes back as a ghost just to burn them via controlled atmospheric lightning.

* Not a single member of the council could use future-vision to figure out padme and anakin were banging, despite it being blatantly obvious and him being unable to control himself.

* The force sensitive babies in paddy's womb, they couldn't even detect those.

* 3 Jedi masters basically instantly fell in a fight against 1 sith while Mace Windu couldn't even finish the job.

* Yoda got bested in a Lightsaber fight basically every time he fought another Lightsaber holder. He also showed almost no prowess with the force outside of lifting xwings out of swamps. Finally uses future-vision when Luke tries to go to cloud city but basically says ""not sure, try again later"" like some kinda shitty magic 8ball.

* The Jedi obviously had a shit ton of money and real estate on coruscant. Yet failed in every conceivable way to understand the financials involved with cloning a huge army and following the money to the source.

* Pretty much murdered Jango Fett for no reason and left his head for his son to find.

* Didn't buy GME."

2021-03-13 06:58:34,wallstreetbets,"Billionaire slap fight - RKT VS UWMC For you GME- Keep holding, not wanting you to move money, just laugh at the fight.

**TDLR**:  CEO of UWMC, who won Bball national championship with Michigan State,  went to war with RKT. RKT responded by buying naming rights for Michigan  State BB team. New name ""Michigan State Spartans presented by Rocket  mortgage....

Alright so I have  been a long time holder of RKT and have played with UWMC. With Billions  being delayed I have more free time to watch real life.

**Step 1:** Mat Plays for Michigan State.

So  Mat was a walk on that made the team. Not that  there is anything wrong with that. He put in his dues, practiced against future NBA stars, and got himself a National Championship ring! So that is  sweet who does not want one of those. Mat is a loyal alumi and donates  lots of money. Link to his Forbes article on running his company like  Michigan st BBall [https://www.forbes.com/sites/robdube/2019/05/27/what-playing-for-a-national-championship-winning-basketball-team-taught-this-ceo-about-leadership/?sh=2b26e2107c91](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robdube/2019/05/27/what-playing-for-a-national-championship-winning-basketball-team-taught-this-ceo-about-leadership/?sh=2b26e2107c91)

Link to his 37M donation to Michigan State.[https://twitter.com/DanWetzel/status/1357424044677738503](https://twitter.com/DanWetzel/status/1357424044677738503)

**Step 2:** Dan Gilbert also goes to Michigan State....

So Dan Gilbert founder of Rocket companies also went to Michigan State. He is also a loyal alumnis.

**Step 3. Gauntlet is tossed down.**

Mat  hops on facebook live (looking high as hell... good for him) and tells  all his clients ""it us or them... ARE YOU ALL IN"" and has his clients  sign a contract that they will not deal with RKT. (None of my links will  post)

**Step 4.**  Buy the thing your enemy loves. (Art of War chapter 97)

Dan  Gilbert decides to throw his money bags around. After all what good is  having ""Fuck You Money"" if you dont use it. So what does he do. He goes  and buys the naming rights for Michigan St basketball team. So now every  time Mat looks at the thing he loves, the team he won a championship  with. It says "" Spartans presented by **Rocket Mortgage""**

Edit!!!! - Apparently they will not be fully named. https://www.freep.com/story/sports/college/michigan-state/spartans/2021/03/12/michigan-state-basketball-rocket-mortgage-sponsorship/4665634001/

“The sponsorship adds to a donation war between two of the nation’s leading lenders. Mat Ishbia, a former MSU basketball player who is the CEO of United Wholesale Mortgage, donated $32 million in February to the athletic department. Gilbert and his wife, Jennifer, gave $15 million to have a pavilion at Breslin named after them and contributed to the university’s Detroit Scholars Program and the Resource Center for Persons with Disabilities in 2016”"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"🦍no fight 🦍 We will all make money. 

UWMC under 8 & RKT under 25 (30 is ok too) are great prices for me. UWMC is cheaper per share. I really like that.

Usually when a company starts issuing a regular dividend it means they have stopped or slowed growth, have cash since there is no expansion or acquisitions planned and need something to do with it. Rewarding loyal shareholders (the owners) scratches that itch. Dan has a plan for growth and RKT has room to grow (he said so) Amazons deal was get big fast so no one else will ever be as powerful as you. It’s why they didn’t make money for so long -they were buying stuff. 

Also, no squeeze. At least unlikely. Everyone knows of the potential and I’m sure the corrupt have taken steps to ensure it doesn’t happen or block when it does. IMO what RH did was illegal but I’m shocked it didn’t happen sooner. To believe they won’t step in is to believe they aren’t corrupt."

Matt’s experience was much like my own, proud to be part of the team, recognized as being just as important to the success of the team as the stars. Influenced and respected by great leaders like Tom Izzo.

>In both cases, I was LITERALLY told by my brokerage ON A RECORDED LINE that the decision was made to protect the Market Makers from having to hedge and in turn causing a gamma squeeze????

They are trying to limit new 0DTE options writing to prevent gamma squeeze on OPEX, but most brokers should still allow you to buy weeklies on $GME.

Looking at this graph, the Calls OI falls dramatically after 3/19

https://preview.redd.it/68ultrl34qm61.jpg?width=755&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2fdcd61bd77cda27ed76e7f7b7e2a54aaf6e0c25

and with it the gamma amplification affect. With the 3/12 gone, that's almost 30% of the calls OI, but you still have 3/19 that accounts for another 30% of calls OI. The stimmy should be hitting your bank account in the next few days, there's still a chance for gamma.

I have no opinion on the short interest, maybe hedgies covered, maybe they printed shares out of thin air, I don't know. But they have been increasingly shorting via puts this past few weeks, this helps the gamma squeeze a bit though not as much as calls.

https://preview.redd.it/3rut9av74qm61.jpg?width=685&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=64f835a0daa0f4f1236f9b5302458a4b2ae21afc

The graph shows that hedgies think 🦍🦍🦍 attention  span is limited to a few months a best, and they are betting heavily $GME will fall within a few weeks from now.

Here's some graphs courtesy of /u/HAVE__A_NICE__DAY, she's an ex hedgies quant who needs karma to post, if u like her graphs upvote her comments.\\

^($GME IV Put/Call Inversion on long dated options) [^(https://imgur.com/a/HjvbyJx)](https://imgur.com/a/HjvbyJx)

According to her : ""blue is the implied vol from puts, red is the implied vol from calls; higher IV means it's trading at higher premium, so puts are more expensive as you go further out in time. **so in the near term, puts are cheap because hedgies are too chicken to buy puts even thought they think the stock is <50 then in the medium-long term (july and onward) calls vs puts premiums flip because hedgies are buying more long-dated puts""**

I can't comment on the business transformation, I'm not an e-commerce expert, I don't know what it would take for $GME to compete with steam and etc. What I do know for sure is that, if $GME is bought by X% of float net buy EOD, share price will close up Y% EOD. You can amplify your share buying effect by buying calls at SPECIFIC STRIKES AND EXPIRIES. If you bought shares, it would take around 355 MM USD of net buy inflow to raise the price by 20% EOD, with ITM(safer)/ATM calls and the gamma amplification it would only take \~18 MM USD on the ITM/ATM calls 3/12 before 3/12 expiry.

With the 3/12 now  expired, the amp factor and general cascading gamma effect will be lower, around \~ 40 MM USD net ITM(safer)/ATM calls needed.(that's about 40,000 🦍🦍🦍 each with 1k 🍌🍌🍌)

# TL;DR 3/19 would be the last significant gamma squeeze opportunity based on current OI,🦍🦍🦍 together strong, YOLO-ers 🦍🦍🦍 buying 800C not helping.

**EDIT 3 : I see many 🦍🦍🦍 haven't grasped just how much power the gamma squeeze can contain.**

Buying 1 Contract of 270C 3/12 on Friday afternoon 3/5  or Monday morning 3/8, at the price of 3-5USD per contract(100 shares) / $ 300 with **6x initial delta amplification** would have resulted in **42x amplification**  value of shares delta hedged by MMs in Thursday or Friday open of about $13,000. Since the delta of the contract increased 0.12 to 0.49 and the share prices rose from 137 to 260-290 within that time.

**Edit 4** : I'm not saying the short squeeze or a fundamental business transformations/earnings beat won't happen. What I'm saying is the best chance for another gamma squeeze is 3/19."

Weds was a total dump play which like 500k shorts paid going down, 2M shares changed hands from 340 to 177, plus 14k put contracts on the way down, then calls bought at limits on the way down, and likely more written when hit bottom.

""It means that people have gotten very greedy with the recent spike in price and are buying bets that this thing will gain like 500 dollars in a day. 

Since it's not happening, the OP recommends either just buying regular shares or just bet that the price will go up...50 dollars instead of 500. If you bet that the price goes up 50 dollars, the Market Makers will have to buy some shares in case your bet pays off, increasing the price. If you bet it goes 500 dollars up, the Market Makers will say ""haha, not gonna happen"" and they won't buy shares, therefore not increasing the price."""

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"OP made a mistake. Buying puts does potentially cause a gamma squeeze, but the other direction. Puts encourage a negative gamma squeeze by putting an overleveraged stock like GME back in neutral. If enough puts are opened with market makers, they'd start selling stock on the potential that they may have to buy it from puts being in-the-money to be delta-gamma neutral.

The same strategy the people in GME are using to boost the price can be easily played in reverse to collapse it or even depress it. I suspect part of the volume of 2M shares sold on Wednesday was one part retail panic caused by the sell of 259k shares sold at 240 limit, but also shares being released after a significant number of 330p were opened about 10 minutes before the 259k share exit.

The only reason this strategy hasn't been employed yet is the hedge funds are still playing in the options playground and are enjoying the volatility to create more plays. They're deeply involved in GME's price movements both up and down, and are happy to leave retail high and dry north of 300."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"While what you are analyzing seems correct, I don't think it's broke apes buying the 800c's. I think it's the backend of a spread for people selling calls on the stock. Also due to the borrow limits and accessibility of shares, plenty were shorting via synthetics  which would explain more of the high put buying and the need for limiting risk (especially with the new regulations coming). 

Taking a look, if one were buying spreads, it's not a bad back end on a 50/100 wide spread for inducing delta hedging. Induces buying at about a 4:1 ratio. That being said, if you can afford them straight up, anywhere in the 370-470 range this week is very sweet. Same ratio impact on hedging, as anything higher but with improved gamma (>.002). Also the option chain goes weird at 420 and breaks down into smaller sections ($5 wide strikes vs $10 for 300 range and 500 range) up through 490 (I assume this is only done at the request of a giant player).  I don't know how this forecasts price movement, but I wouldn't be surprised if there is a last gamma event Wednesday/Thursday and it spikes around 450. Small confirmation bias as i opened up a spread from 400-450 to try this theory out."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol we can’t. They’re prohibitively expensive for apes like us... and that also explains why people’d rather gamble on 800c
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s simple. Ape together strong. HODL
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro, your own graph says there would be a chance next month"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The thing is, I'd have to use all my stimulus money and sell some GME to be able to buy a call close to ITM. And these 💎 🙌 make that hard

BUT...I did some quick maths even you apes can follow. If 25% of the members on WSB (about 2,375,000 apes) each individually decided they liked the stock, they might YOLO their stimmy into shares of GME. I chose 25% b/c WSB has many international members that don't get stimulus, and some apes need the money to live, and I'm just guessing. Let's say this is for an average of $300 per share.

2,375,000 x 1400 = $3,325,000,000 ÷ $300 (per share) = 11,083,333 shares. Holy fuck!

For reference, average price of 🍌 in USA is $0.58/lb (1lb = 3 🍌). So all that possibly YOLO'd stimulus money could buy over 17 billion 🍌🍌🍌. Apes would never go hungry with all of those bananas. But apes may never go hungry with all that GME. What will apes do 🤔🤔

This certainly isn't financial advice or a recommendation. But the apes around here seem to like 🚀 fuel more than food."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The 270C 3/12 was then quoted by the Forbes article on gamma swarm, Wednesday Night 3/10

>Imagine that a swarm of, say, 10,000 members, each invested $1,000 in GME $270 call options for Friday March 12. The March 9 cost of the option is $24. If all option sellers hedged, it could drive perhaps $100 million of share volume, at the then current prices.  
...  
A naked March 12 call option with a strike price of $270 would have exposed the seller to a loss of $56 a share. It is highly likely that the sellers of such options would have allowed themselves to be exposed to this risk. They would have covered, hedged, by purchasing shares – adding to the surge.

We *know* one thing: shorts need to cover. It's what all of this is based on. There is no known time limit, because we don't know how much is invested and hidden in those shorts. We *just* found out that Bank of America might get blasted out of existence from this.


We're *confident* in one other thing: the stock as it currently stands is massively undervalued. The good will from this saga alone is worth more than the current share price. 


These two things lead to the same place. Buy shares, and hold them. If I do this I know I will make money, but not how much or when. So this is what I'm doing. 


If you're bored (you spoiled fuckin apes but I love you though) and want to yolo on options, cool that's fun too and your money, so whatever. But those aren't safe bets. In fact when you lose you help hedgies, who do you think the puts belong to?  


A gamma squeeze would be nice and might kickstart a real squeeze, but it's not necessary so if you think you're missing something big by not buying calls, you're real loss is the guaranteed share money you would've made, in my humble opinion anyway."

It’s been said a million times but I’ll say it here again, we can remain retarded longer than they can remain solvent. If anything this article proves to me the squeeze is another month or two away because they believe our attention span isn’t longer than that so that’s pry where their hands get really weak. Even then I have no clue. Don’t be disappointed if it doesn’t happen on the 19th of this month. Don’t be disappointed if it doesn’t happen this month. As long as we remain grouped and everyone stays calm IT WILL HAPPEN."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"What if the initial purchase of those 800 strike calls back in January were the HFs trying to spread mis info and get people like us to try and win big by buying FDs like the 800 strike calls instead of buying itm or atm calls or even just shares?? Because no matter how many 800 calls are purchased, if we dont have a call chain then the price will never reach 800 so those calls will be useless.

To me, it seems that the HFs are very afraid of the gamma squeeze because it exposes their short interest. I believe that the HFs think they can squirm out of a short squeeze. But a gamma squeeze is objective, if there are hella itm call contracts then MM need to hedge and this will raise the price and expose the short interest."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I had this exact thought when I saw everyone talking about 800C, but didn't feel experienced enough with options to call it out. 800c are great, but if there aren't a f ton of calls to set up the domino chain, then the buying pressure wont show up. I plan on buying options this week. In your opinion, is it better just ITM or just OTM? I think everyone buying the bigger calls is depending on some sort of crazy news dropping to effect buying pressure. That may happen, but really is a YOLO in my opinion."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If only there was a way for shareholders to coordinate a simultaneous move or multiple simultaneous moves to help increase the overall collective gain without being monitored or spied on to maybe combat the hedgies and the many ways they can cheat and manipulate.

Holding 45.5 @ $117"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you're too smooth brain to understand. The reason the 800c did nothing was because the odds of them being ITM was virtually none by 3/12. Meaning MM had no reason to buy those shares to hedge.

TLDR; Buy calls ITM with delta of .5 and above. The better the odds, the more shares that need to be bought to hedge which creates that cascading effect which is the fuel to our favorite 🚀

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How close to an ITM call would be considered smart. Obviously 800c is megaretarded (not the good kind). Would an OTM call by say 2.5% consistently be the right kind of retarded?

Like ramping up to blast off (hitting multiple arrows on the track) because the MM have to hedge at this position and buy at those prices? If that’s the case then why blow our wads on options that expire instead of buying shares and holding? Options expire, and when they do your leverage is gone along with your money. Sure you could exercise those options but you need $27,000 to exercise a $270 call on top of the up front premium (which is = purchase price x 100). Meaning an overall investment on a $40 call price totaling $4000 + $27,000 (exercised) making a total investment on 100 shares $31,000. Idk about you but my stimmy ain’t gonna be that high. And even if you didn’t exercise, or couldn’t, your only chance of getting out ahead is selling the contract. Thereby defeating the purpose of gathering shares and holding. I think I may understand the logic behind it but that’s some serious cash for seriously broke people. Why not just buy shares and hold."

All of the major squeezes have been at the end of the month. Not just GME - which was the end of the month in both February and January. Volkswagon? End of the month. Even Shkreli's squeeze was at the end of the month.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, you play minecraft?

1 block = $1 move in share price.

At block 800 ($800) we think there's a giant pile of TNT so huge nobody knows whether it will crash the game if it goes off.

We are trying to make that explode.

What do?

We're at block 250$. We want to use dynamite to trigger the explosion and move the share price along the way. 

Dynamite has a blast radius of 4, meaning you should place 1 dynamite every 5th block (1 dynamite, 4 air, 1 dynamite, 4 air).

There's 150 players on the server. Each one has 1 dynamite. That's more than enough dynamite to make the chain reaction happen all the way to the mega-explosion.

""Hey everyone, place a dynamite every 5 blocks!""

1/3 of the players ran off and put their dynamite in a big pile at block 800, right next to the giant pile then ran away thinking they were being cool. 1/3 put their dynamite at random intervals. 

The other players who put their dynamite where they were supposed to - 4 blocks away from the previous one, just wasted all their dynamite, because there wasn't enough dynamite to ignite at block 250$ and go all the way to block 800$.

We got to block 340$, and now we have to start all over.

**tl;dr:** if you want a gamma squeeze, people need to buy near-to-current-price calls and spread them out in a sequence. Price is at $240? Set a call at $250, $260, $270 etc.

""But the near calls have expensive premiums and I just want a cheap yolo!""

Yeah bitch, it's expensive because it's more likely to happen - *That's the point of fuckin premiums ya damned dirty ape!*"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I realize you might be kidding or serious, but that a million people have no idea what's going on (towelie).

The further away from the share price the strike price is, the less risk market makers statistically need to hedge. In other words, when the share price is 250, there is a higher statistical probability for a 270 call to cause them a loss than an 800 call, so the 270 call will trigger more hedging (share buying) than the 800 call. 

The same concept applies for expiration date - a very long dated expiration is a lower risk than a 0DTE call. 

I'm curious how well the gamma play works without a ton of share buying going on alongside. This shit is crazy."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,OP said buy shares you fucking idiots. Stop doing shorts calls falls willy wackers and nonosmackers! Just buy real shares and hodl you God damn retards!

It means that people have gotten very greedy with the recent spike in price and are buying bets that this thing will gain like 500 dollars in a day. 

Since it's not happening, the OP recommends either just buying regular shares or just bet that the price will go up...50 dollars instead of 500. If you bet that the price goes up 50 dollars, the Market Makers will have to buy some shares in case your bet pays off, increasing the price. If you bet it goes 500 dollars up, the Market Makers will say ""haha, not gonna happen"" and they won't buy shares, therefore not increasing the price."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Depends what the opening price is. The contract would need to be ATM or ITM.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Practically not worth it at this point. A $260 call for 3/19 is at $49.43 strike right now (will be higher Monday), meaning the stock needs to get to $309.43 just to break even."

RH autosold on Friday at 3pm for $3.5k so I still lost, but by buying InTheMoney calls like that, you have higher chances of making solid gains.

Of course, ITM calls are A LOT more expensive so you might be spending $10k to net +$9k but the odds are in your favor, especially if the stock is growing like GME."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol let's be honest here, if you take the squeeze out of the picture the stock would be at 40 max (which is already very generous considering that thats 2x DFVs original PT.. with cohen, the newly found brand recognition, etc all taken into account)

Fundamentals matter.. in the long run. Sure the stock can be any price in the short term - yes, the stock is currently fueled by 100% retard strength but *if* the momentum dies the whales holding gme will see less & less chance of a squeeze so at some point they will just sell at these prices no sane person would ever value the stock and retail will be again left holding their bags.

The comparison to tesla is also retarded.. if you believe tesla will achieve all the shit they say then the price would be fair (sure they probably wont..) but there's no scenario even in your wildest dreams where gme would be worth 20-30-50x what currently (maybe there is and I'm the retarded, gme to become the next amazon..)

If you think there wont be a squeeze but keep holding the stock for long term then you are a complete moron.

I'm not saying you can't make money in the short term  without the squeeze but how long can it keep running on hype?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tesla is 43% institutionally held. It's true that that's a lot lower than it was 6 months ago (roughly 60% and higher than most stocks), but it's nowhere near the level of meme stocks."

OP was saying buy calls In The Money or close to being ITM, that way the person selling the call has to hedge by buying up to 90 shares per call they sell. Your $ has a lot more impact on the price that way. Not saying I recommend doing this necessarily but that's how it works."

I don't know that I agree but that is the takeaway from OP

Personally I think just buying shares is safer, if the Gamma Squeeze fails and your ITM calls become OTM calls then you probably lose everything you spent on the options.   

If you just bought shares you would still have the shares."

3/19 is NOT THE LAST CHANCE. 

There is no last chance, stocks don’t work like that.
Numbers don’t know whose holding or who’s buying. The line doesn’t give a fuck what date it is. 

People need to stop wasting money on calls but they need to hold what they have and buy more if they like the stock and believe in the company.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The distinction is fundamental vs speculative value. The more speculative a stock's value is, the more volatile and unpredictable it is. Fundamental investors are more focused on identifiable sources of value, not predictions as to what might happen in the future. That's not to say fundamentals aren't forward thinking, but they're more rooted in tangibles.  And to be clear, I'm not defending the merit of fundamental investing vs speculative. But just noting they are distinct schools of mind, and being a speculative investor inherently skews towards gambling because there's so many unknown factors.  It's also worth noting that DFV, for example, invested in GME based on fundamentals, not speculation."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fundamentals help people see what the value of the underlying business is backed by. Kinda like how money used to be backed by gold so everyone knew the money had value because it was covered by a valuable material, is the same way a companies fundamentals helps investors see what the market price of the shares are backed by. However, your “the price is just what people agree on” interpretation is precisely what causes market bubbles to burst. Primarily because when it becomes clear that a company’s value isnt backed by any indicators of performance, the value of the company and hence their shares become worthless as well."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is definitely true, but people's perception of value, with respect to stocks, has historically been at least partially based on that company's fundamentals."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm with you.  I've grown less enamored with ""fundamentals"".

What is fundamental value when you boil it down?  It is essentially some group of people thinking that a stock is worth some forward projection of earnings, a price to earnings multiple.

And who decides what multiple is ""fundamental""?  The market does through supply/demand, which is all perception.  Why is Tesla valued at going on infinity P/E, when GME was valued at less than 1 before all the attention?  Why are some sectors' ""acceptable"" P/E ratios different than others?  Because fundamentals are just analysis, numbers, and ratios applied to historic data.  What generated that historic data?  Perception and supply/demand moving stock prices around.

At the end of the day a stock/company's value are dictated by what a person or group of people are willing to pay for it.  That person/group could have all manner of reasons why they paid that price, to rationalize value.  ""Fundamentals"" is but one system of rationalization.  It is not any more or less important than other systems, like momentum, sentiment, technical, speculative, etc."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"No this isn't how a gamma squeeze works. The squeezing effect doesn't come from people exercising ITM options. What happens is MM's sell naked call options that are slightly out of the money with we'll say idk ~.5ish delta, then to remain delta neutral they gotta buy roughly 50 shares. When a whole bunch of bullish apes go and buy those calls the MM's gotta buy more shares. Buying pressure increases the price of the stock; thereby raising gamma and delta on the whole options chain. this can have a compunding effect depending on volume. That's how you get the really quick violent gamma squeezes, it's all share buying done by MM algos. Once the call is fairly ITM it's already covered so exercising your option doesn't add much to the buying pressure."

$360 is pretty far off though. It would rely on ""whales"" to buy the very expensive near calls.

I guess the answer would be *get nearest call you can afford, knowing that if it doesn't work that you will NEVER see that premium again*.

If you can't buy a useful option (I suspect ridiculous calls were all people could afford), then just buy shares!

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The post was about buying near In The Money calls or calls already ITM. Not sure what kind of concussion this shitty-users guy just had that would ignore the content of the entire post. The point of buying options is that the person writing those options has to hedge by buying sometimes up to 90 shares per call sold, depending how close the call is to being ITM.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I understood everything, but that’s what I am saying. I’m saying to buy shares. Buying calls is bail money. Most of them are going to expire worthless (e.g., all those 800c that were bought last week).

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree. Plus the Premiums on GME are a bit too costly thanks to vega(for me anyhow). Also do they need to hedge if your option is OTM? Or do they purchase the hedge when your option becomes ITM? It would allow more capitol to be liquid until the option they sold you became ITM.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It means that people have gotten very greedy with the recent spike in price and are buying bets that this thing will gain like 500 dollars in a day. 

Since it's not happening, the OP recommends either just buying regular shares or just bet that the price will go up...50 dollars instead of 500. If you bet that the price goes up 50 dollars, the Market Makers will have to buy some shares in case your bet pays off, increasing the price. If you bet it goes 500 dollars up, the Market Makers will say ""haha, not gonna happen"" and they won't buy shares, therefore not increasing the price.

Edit: thank you very much for the awards, guys."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp

Honestly worth reading if you want to understand what lit the match that caused the short squeeze in January to happen to fast.

Call option basically = you pay a premium to enter a contract to be allowed to buy a set number of shares of a stock (usually 100) if the price of the stock goes up. You want the stock price to go up, obviously. If it reaches past the strike price, you can exercise the contract- and the contract allows you to buy the stock at a lower price than its currently traded price, so it's a good deal! Or, you can sell your call option contract at any time if the price of the stock has gone up and made your contract worth more (the contract also loses value based on stuff like time til expiration date.)

Ok, why is this important? Well, because the person writing you this contract is sweating balls, looking at how close the contract they just sold is to hitting the strike price. They have to be able to sell you 100 shares for whatever price you agreed upon. What if Ryan Cohen tweets another poop meme and the stock rockets past the strike price? The call writer's loses could be potentially unlimited in that case... *unless* they buy shares before the stock hits the strike price. They'll still lose money that way but not a ton, not enough to choke them out. So they have an equation that tells them how to properly hedge (cover their asses) when they sell a call. It factors in how close they are to the stock price, the time left til the call option expires, stock volatility, and some other things. Each one of these factors is assigned a greek letter (hence, why this type of feedback loop is called a gamma squeeze.)

If the option sold is very close to being ITM, the writer (if not a complete degenerate moron) will probably buy 90 shares just to be safe. I repeat, by buying calls already ITM or close to ITM, you are obliging another person to buy a lot of shares, way more than the money used for your premium could get you. *This* is why it's so powerful."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I think currently means at the moment
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Indeed.

I suspect that one of the big unmentioned objections to the ""unusual options activity"" connected to GME in particular and this sub in general is that it might have the potential to screw with indicators of impending crashes, like the put/call ratio. I'm trying to learn how the NOPE chart works and this possibility just occured to me- though I am still crawling, not walking when it comes to understanding all types of technical analysis."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, if I could afford those calls I'd have a shitton more shares.
The $800 ones are damn near pocket change at the end of the week though"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok so from what I’m getting each of those calls is 100 shares each. Do I have to buy all 100 if the price hits? Cause I’m fucking broke and my entire portfolio is 23 shares.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The point is for people who want to buy calls to stop buying shitty 800c and start buying 270c.

I highly doubt those 800c were from people in this sub anyways. I think they were probably from institutional longs who wanted to cheaply generate fomo. Well, it worked.

SI is lower than it was in January. I know people here have some conspiracy theory that somehow the really low shorts weren't covered, but I think that's a mistake. It's possible to cover using synthetic stock. The shorts aren't even the ones who report SI anyways."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Biggest thing would be if you did buy a option it being exercised is the end goal which can be expensive, that’s why I only own stock 69 shares bb!

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"What’s frustrating though is *tinfoil hat engaged* when Robinhood conspired to alleviate personal burden to minimize their own economic exposure, their was no repercussions. They also weren’t the only one. The monopoly man from IBKR said he was sweating bullets about a chain reaction implosion  of brokers from the squeeze as he was saying the quiet part out loud during an interview .


If there’s no repercussions from that what’s going to stop it from happening again in another form, no one is going to take billions in losses without cheating"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I completely understand, unfortunately I was a bag holder for 3 years (bought into weed stocks hype) and I even gave up on investing because of my own stupidity, so when gme went to 480, I didn’t sell thinking it would squeeze... then when it came down to 90 I did sell because I didn’t wanna be a bag holder for another 3 years .. btw I sold my weed stocks at a complete loss just to jump into gme (my 25k become 4.5k and that’s what I put into gme plus more money that I had saved.) At one point I was at 77k when it was in the 400’s and didn’t sell. That’s life changing money for me. So u can imagine how scared I was when it dropped so hard, also I’ve never seen any stock go up again like gme did, so by all logic the event was over.. funny enough I got back in when gme hit 150 and I’m gonna diamond hand it up or down this time. Ride or die"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't know the exact formula but my understanding is that the further out the strike is the less the MM have to hedge.   

So the 800 calls are probably insignificant, 500 maybe a little but if you bought 270-280 OTM  call (close to the current price) that would cause them to hedge as much as an ITM call would.

Edit:  And I agree the premiums on GME are insane.    I would like to take a flyer on some but it seems like to much risk for the slim chance that they pay off in the timeframe.     Given the recent history of the stock I understand why they are priced the way they are - no one knows what is going to happen.   

I wouldn't want to sell (naked) 800 or 1000 strike calls even one month out, you never know."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"They hedge against the delta of the option. So if they sell you a call with a delta of 0.3109 then you could expect them to buy 0.3109x100 = 31 shares to stay delta neutral. As your call moves further ITM or OTM, gamma causes delta to increase or decrease."

Personally, I like to think of RC as a potential James Halliday(ready player one) with his vision of the stock.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"no my point was if the goal was for a HF to use calls at 800 to cover, why buy 800 calls when they could pick the stock up cheaper.  even buying calls at or below strike would be a better value.  they’re not going to take a higher cost option to unwind like that."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"that’s the potential mistake.  it expires on friday.  so if the price went to 1000 on friday they could make more but have to sell
the call by end of day or exercise it.  if you have the money to buy 800x100 to execute it you could have bought more stock that didn’t have an expiration date.   but if you don’t have the money and it’s at 1000 it’s not a guaranteed 200x100 return.  look at what the cost of deep ITM calls are a week out and then 0 DTE.  the premium has a time decay.  there’s more to the options market than a lot of people realize when they start.  but everyone should make their own decisions and this is not financial advice."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It depends. Somebody else did a more detailed write up that broke down which calls had the highest leverage on share buying. It really depends on the price of the call, it's delta, and the price of shares. But basically if buying one call would cause an MM to buy more shares than you would be able to buy for the same price then it's more likely to cause squozing. But essentially calls near the money usually have the greatest effect."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You don't have to buy 100 shares. You could either buy 100 shares or you could sell the contract at a profit. Or you could do none of the above because if you're broke doing this kind of shit is a significant risk, and I don't like telling other people they should take significant risks.

For the record, I have bought a grand total of 0 calls, ever. I'm not trying to give advice, just explain when I see people missing OP's point."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"A 270 call for the 19th costs $4,550 right now. 
An 800 is $510.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or you can do a step up: stop buying all calls and just buy shares 🤷🏽‍♂️

All that RH and Webull loss porn from this weekend were DEFINITELY “institutional longs” and not retards. /s

You’re telling me that they purposefully bought calls that are gonna expire worthless for FOMO? lol there’s so much hype about this week, especially next week the 19th and there’s plenty of picture evidence showing dummies on this sub and others losing tons of money buying shitty options. 

Options don’t matter. The price doesn’t matter because all shorts must cover. Short interest is NOT lower BTW it’s still much higher than the 140% in January.

Just buy shares."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I actually feel for Vlad, all he had to do to avoid torpedoing his company's reputation was to own up to the fact Robinhood is *not* a big daddy infinite money government institution player.  

He runs a company worth several billion, probably has enough corrupt or even legitimate money squirreled away to not have to work a day in his life and *still* could have spun this into being an underdog."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly. After that first big drop I didn't trust that they would let it go above $100 again without doing shady shit. So instead of buying 200 @ 40 I ended up with 35 at around $150 average after it jumped up again.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"“so when gme went to 480, I didn’t sell thinking it would squeeze...”

This was actually the right move, because it would have squeezed. Nobody could have predicted that Vlad and others would take action to stop the squeeze. If only we knew, but none of us have crystal balls.

The inevitable squeeze was predictable. What actually happened was not."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you sir, very much appreciated :)"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Buying a call option gives you the right BUT NOT the obligation to buy a stock at a certain price.

If GME is 260 and I buy a 265 call ( which means a call option with the strike price of 265 ) it means I expect the stock to go up in price (as much as possible) because that one call option allows me to buy 100 shares of the stock at 265 dollars. So if the stock goes to 300 for example, I can exercise my call and buy 100 shares at 265 dollars. That is 35 dollars less for every share I buy. Since I am allowed to buy 100, that is 35x100=3500 dollars profit.

But if the stock doesn't reach the strike price, I am not obligated to buy the shares. All I lose is the premium (the money that I paid to enter into that bet).

So basically, instead of using their money to buy shares, people use the money to buy bets. This is because they can make more money that way and risk losing less. 

There are a lot more details about the option game that makes you or loses you money, but it would take me a ton of time to do so. This is the most basic idea in regards to buying a call option."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok but once the options expire the MM would unwind their hedges and sell the GME shares they bought for hedging so won't that cause a huge amount of selling pressure?

Seems like a gamma squeeze is like a sugar high, the price will surge and then it will collapse.   Is that really helpful long-term versus just buying up shares in the float?"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think most of the money thrown at the 800c was from institutions, and then some exceptional minds here decided to follow the activity. Didn't go well. Big firms actually have the shares already in hand to cover the calls they sell without buying more. They happily threw some money at a distant target, knowing that would create excitement, especially on a week before a quadruple witching. They lost the premiums but drove up the price of their shares, and took some money from anyone else buying an 800c. I know call writers usually are hoping for the stock price to go down but nothing about this stock is normal.

And yes, shares are solid, but if you're buying right now you're taking a much bigger risk than you were 3 weeks ago... and most people here can't afford to buy that much right now period. Momentum will stall/is stalling without a cheap catalyst."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Vlad isn’t rich and he will be once Robinhood IPOs, but as of this point that hasn’t happened. 

It was in his best interest to drop gme price because he had to dilute and discount his ownership shares to get an almost overnight cash infusion to cover their exposure.

To me taking an action like that for personal benefit is fraud and the decision makers should be investigated, it’s more than lying about lack of capital.


The correct way to do it would be take the gut punch of being under capitalized instead of pushing the burden of that misjudgment onto Robinhood users"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I completely agree with your comment. Vlad should have and would have been much better off if he told the truth from the beginning.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the first time I actually read something on calls where it’s actually starting to click. My only question now is if & when the stock hits the strike price, does one have to buy all 100 shares or just anything UP TO 100 shares?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok so question. If a company is currently worth $1 but I believe it'll be worth $50 in the future, what is the smarter play; buying a $50call option or a $2 call option? Since the price would be $50 in the future, it makes more sense to open a $2call options and buy the shares for $2 rather than opening a call option for $50 and buying the shares for $50. Unless the call option itself will increase on value due to predicting the price would increase close or above $50?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,If you need an explanation on the most basic options please do not buy options.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay, so I'm going to try to apply this to see if I understand it:  
So, lining up with OP: the only calls we should be buying rn are the ITM/ATM ones, as buying OTM calls are handing hedgies the ammo back that the sizeable mass of individual retail stock holders of GMYeet cant exactly afford to lose.

So if Monday morning, I go and I buy a $270 call (GMYeet is currently at $267 at the time of me typing this, and I'm assuming $270 is pretty safe... maybe too safe) and I exercise this the minute it hits $270, I get 100 (whole?) shares for the price of what would otherwise be 1 share @ $270 on a normal ass transaction.

If I'm connecting dots correctly, this might help drive up the price, would significantly increase my portfolio's overall gains (assuming the price moons), and keep some precious shares out of the hands of hedge funds as well. If any of the DD's I read were correct, I think GMYeet's at 6 figures of available shares left to short. If a good number of individual stock holders of GMYeet are willing to lose another $240-$300 did this, this should really, really help the gamma.

I'm not the type to YOLO anything (lockdowns pretty much solidified this hesitation), but given GMYeet's volatility there's a pretty high chance that the stock will creep up at least $3, at least once, and I can still get my grubby hands on what imo is a shitload of shares for someone who's never looked at options before.

Please, please correct me if I'm wrong.

Edit: I used ""GMYeet"" so bots snooping through this reddit arent gonna tick the 6 times I referenced the stock in my one comment."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You know the one thing about buying options that I still don’t get? If you’re fairly confident that the share price will go up...then why not just skip the fee that comes with buying options and just buy shares to begin with?

I suppose the argument is that since an option is 100 shares...that an be a lot of money to be putting down at once."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the actual reason that exercising ITM calls is important. It lowers the reserve of shares that MM's have in their hedge. Then the squeeze can be primed again for the next week when they have to buy more to get back to delta neutral. I know it hurts to admit but I think whoever attacked last Wednesday was extremely successful in disrupting the squeeze. MM's were trying to hedge all the new ITM calls all the way up to 350 and when that price got thrown down MM buying totally halted. That's why volume was such shit Thurs and Fri. This week is a bit of a reset and now we need momentum back if this thing is going to happen
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Unless the mm’s kept those shares, this is the dangerous part, assuming that the shares are bought each time. What happens if I sell the call, the. Buy the shares, the call expires worthless. I can now lend the shares out or just keep them for the next call I’m going to sell. It’s obvious by now that it’s being driven by options activity, so mm’s are going to adapt."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree with your comment, but Vlad actually had no choice, and all his customer’s assets would have been liquidated had he chose not to do what he did.

He could have said that and placed the blame on those who should have done the liquidating. He eventually did, but he should have done that from the beginning, instead of claiming that he did it to protect his dumb customers who aren’t smart enough to make good financial decisions."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s too bad.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The short answer is you have to buy 100. The contract is always made on 100. This means that you exercise the option. You buy 100 shares at the share price with your money and sell them or keep them. 

Here is where it gets interesting. You do not have to exercise the option. In the example above, if the stock price goes over the strike price, you can just sell the option and get at least the same profit you would get if you exercised it. 

Basically, you spend less money and make the same profit. This is called leverage."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You have to buy 100
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"To clarify, you don’t *have* to do anything. It’s an option. It gives you the option to buy 100 (no more, no less) at the strike price. If you choose to exercise the option, you are buying 100 shares at the strike price per share. $265 strike -> $26,500 cost for 100 shares."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,100 shares if you decide to execute. Most people sell calls though. I’m too stupid for all of this so I buy shares whenever I can and HODL
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"A 2 call option, absolutely. The call gives you the option to buy a share for that price. So when the stock is 50, you'd ideally want to buy the stock for 2 dollars, not 50."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'M RECLAIMING MY TIME!!!


*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,">So if Monday morning, I go and I buy a $270 call (GMYeet is currently at $267 at the time of me typing this, and I'm assuming $270 is pretty safe... maybe too safe) and I exercise this the minute it hits $270, I get 100 (whole?) shares for the price of what would otherwise be 1 share @ $270 on a normal ass transaction.

Not really, if you exercise the share, you will buy 100 shares at 270 a piece, so 27.000. If you could pay an option and then buy 100 shares at the price of one, you'd be a billionaire in about 3 hours, haha. 

Theorethically, just buy regular shares. This helps without any complication. Also, these options are extremely expensive rn because the stock has been so volatile. Personally, I don't recommend it, but you can do whatever you want.

And yes, if a lot of options at a certain price get exercised at the same time, Market Makers need to find and buy all these shares to deliver them to the people. This type of driving up in price because of large numbers of options are creating what is called the ""gamma squeeze"". You experienced it two weeks ago when the stock jumped out of nowhere from 50 to 200. There were lots of options at 50 and at the end of the day they were exercised.

The difference between a short squeeze and a gamma squeeze is that where the gamma squeeze is the result of many options being exercised at the same time, the short squeeze is caused by lack of shares available to buy and people who are caught shorting(borrowing) them need to return them, thus forcing them to buy a lot (the bigger the short percent, the more shares need to be bought). 

Now, because there are very few shares available to buy, (that is why you hold) the volume is low and everything is buying. What this means is that the computer sees lots of buying orders but no sells. So the computer says ""fuck, I have 1 mil shares to buy at 50 but no one is selling. Let me increase it to 51. Still no one? 52 No? 53...100...etc. 

That is why you hear people saying ""we name the price"". In reality, this will not reach 100k. I know I get hate for this. But if the computer keeps going up and up at some point someone will say ""Ok, I have a lot of profit, I sell so I don't bag hold"". And the more people sell, the more the shorts can buy and leave. Thus stopping the price from going higher. This is how a short squeeze works."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, it's the leverage I was talking about.

If you have 1500$ investment money (all your money you can play with) and you want to play an expensive stock, let's say Tesla at 800 dollars per share, you don't have money even for 2 shares, let alone 100. If you buy one share (because that is all you can afford ) and the stock goes to 1000, you made 200 dollars profit. So now you have 1700 dollars in your account. 1500 + 200 profit.

Now, if you buy an option for 1400 (it's an example, it can trade for more or less) at the strike price 800 and the stock goes to 1000, you can sell the option (remember, you do not have to execute it because selling an option will give you at least the same profits as if you actually went and executed it). Now you have 100 shares that you got a profit of 200 dollars each. So 200 profit x 100 shares is 20.000 dollars. You made 20.000 dollars profit while investing 1400 dollars.  So you have 20.000 + 100 (1500-1400) - 20.100 dollars. 

In the same example, to get the 20.000 dollars profit by buying shares, you had to invest 800 dollars x 100 shares, which is 80.000 dollars. In one example you made 20.000 from 1400, in the other you made 20.000 profit from 80.000. 

What's the catch? It sounds too good to be true.

Well, if the stock goes down, let's say 200 dollars, your option is worthless. You lost 1400 with the option. Bye bye.

If you bought the 100 shares, you'd lose money, but not everything. Also, if you have 100 shares, you can keep them indefinitely. Yeah, the stock goes down 200 but in 3 months it goes up 1000. You still win in the end. Or not. Who knows.

Options have expiry dates so you can't keep them indefinitely.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,IIRC Wealthsimple doesn’t offer options. Options is a whole other game that’s different from buying/selling shares and should be done by people with training and or experience
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good on you, if you understand very well plus you have a bit of luck, Definitely game changing money to be made there. After gme I’ll be looking to learn and try to get more into the game. Slowly at the start of course. No financial advice."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, one could say that!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"They've proven time and time again that they have tools at their disposal to reset their shorts, thus avoiding margin calls altogether. They've kicked the can down the road for weeks, months, and there's no telling how long they can drag it out.

I ran calculations at many interest rates and price points - interest sucks, but it is TINY compared to what *actually covering* would cost... to the tune of ""if we ride this out for a year, it might cost us $1bil in interest, but saves us $5bil over the alternative of actually covering our short positions.""

I think the ""they're bleeding"" via interest on shorts is way overstated around here.

Sure, $10+ million per week is rough, but when the alternative is $5+ billion... all of a sudden a year of interest doesn't sound too bad."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok but if you buy ITM calls with the goal of exercising them (rather then selling for a profit on expiration day) you are basically throwing money away on the time premium you paid initially.   

I understand for the ""collective good"" the gamma squeeze is helpful but for an individual wanting to add shares, buying ITM options and exercising them would result in less shares owned than just buying shares straight up with the same amount of money."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think your last point is exactly right.

A lot of ""professionals"" were caught off-guard during the first wave/squeeze but I think its unrealistic to expect it to happen so easily again - we have lost the element of surprise.   

They understand what we are doing (I'm sure they have someone on staff to read these threads) and are in a better place to counter it.

That announcement from TD Ameritrade about customer restrictions on buying naked options on GME/RKT (https://www.tdameritrade.com/td-ameritrade-trading-restrictions-stocks.page)  was very interesting.    That tells me they are worried about that method of attack but it also tells me that if they feel like they are getting trapped they can simply put pressure on brokerages or regulators to stop it akin to what happened with RH during the first squeeze."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or he could’ve taken a big enough cash infusion to not block trading and accepted that he was under capitalized on razor thin margins


He obviously only took enough to cover himself with restrictions in place


What blows my kind is he was off the mark of required capital by fucking 10 fold"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude thank you for all the explanations you have posted on this thread. Somehow you managed to explain the point of this post and what calls are in a way that it finally clicked. You have some serious talent for this.

My first award ever goes to you sir\^\^"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So you pay $265 (as example) for 100 shares?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So why are people opening $800 call options on gme? What's the big brain play
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Good bot
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay, I knew something sounded off, so thanks for explaining all this. Will be saving your comment!
So, if a bunch of stockholders exercised their calls at one time, does the stock price rise in spite of shorts? Or are shorts still able to suppress the effect of calls being exercised?

I'm keeping myself from getting too hyped up about anything over a few thousand, but out of curiosity, why do you think it wont get that high?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It does. Thank you!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok then. I’m glad I don’t have access to that yet.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree with what you've said, but I don't quite understand how it relates to them being margin called. Are you saying there is no upper price that will result in a margin call? Or that they could ignore the call if they got it? Thanks"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great post and not to be pedantic but I see a lot of people talking about interest rates in terms of short sellers carrying costs.

The money that short sellers pay isn't interest, its a borrow fee.   

Its expressed as a percentage which is why many people think its like an interest rate but it isn't.   The borrow fee varies depending on the availability of short shares - when they are hard to get the borrow fee goes up, when there are plenty of shares available to short the borrow fee goes down."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh definitely. But for people who bought pretty deep OTM calls before the price got forward momentum, if they held until exercise date anyway they might as well exercise."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, now that half his customers left, he’s no longer undercapitalized.

Problem solved!!!

lol"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks man.

These are not hard to learn, it's just that these finance guys try to make it sound very complicated to keep you out. 

I know I was happy to learn this so if I can, I'll teach others too. 

Keep in mind though that this is not everything about calls. What I said here is mostly about buying a call. You can also sell a call, buy a put or sell a put. Each of them has it's own advantages and disadvantages so before you learn about all of them, stay safe."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You pay $265 per share so $26500 in total, although if you don't have available money on account, you can sell the option."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You pay 265 for each share but you do not have to. Check my reply below for the explanation.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's tricky. 

For one, they believe the stock will soar way above 800 and make profits. Not likely.

In reality they buy 800 calls because they are cheap (the further away they are from the current price, the cheaper the premium) and hope for IV.

IV - implied volatility - gives the premium its worth. If a stock is 200 dollars but the IV is low (the stock trades with little fluctuations up or down) the premium is going to be cheap - you can buy it cheap.

If the IV is high, the premium increases in price because the system says ""Oh, it's trading with high swings, it has more chances of reaching the price"". 

In our example, you can buy a call with a 250 strike and make money on the call even if the price doesn't reach 250 IF the stock starts being very volatile.

Their goal was for friday to be a very volatile day and sell those calls for more than they bought them for. They never intended to sell them at or above 800. 

Jokes on them though because friday the stock traded sideways, not enough volatility for them to sell those for profit. And if they did, the profit was minimal. If the stock jumped to 400 for example, yes, they'd seel those options and make shitloads of money."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Say you short at $20, price goes to $300, but compare that with someone who covered their $20 shorts by re-shorting at $250 and took advantage to cover some of those when it tanked back to $40-50. They won't get margin called at $300.

Basically, they can't get margin called if they continually reposition themselves.


[Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/shortmarginrequirements.asp#:~:text=150%25%20of%20the%20value%20of,funds%20into%20the%20margin%20account.)

> - While the initial margin is the amount of margin required at the time the trade is initiated, the maintenance margin is the margin requirement during the life of the short sale.

> - 150% of the value of the short sale is required as the initial margin.

> - If the value of the position falls below maintenance margin requirements, the short seller will face a margin call and be asked to close the position or increase funds into the margin account."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is true, all of it, borrow fee vs ""interest."" I'll have to admit, my calculations were based on the earlier numbers when they could short with ~3% rate that ended up half a penny per share, per day. Given that we're now in the 400k-1mil shares available range, very unlikely anyone's been getting that sweet 3% for the last who knows how long."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh this is slowly making more sense. I will continue to educate myself on this because I feel like I missed out on a ton of money last year by not opening an option for Six flags believing the stock will double by this time. And what do you know, it has. Thanks!"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah fuk u dumb dumbs
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"One of the components of an option's value is implied volatility: the expectation of future price movement. When the price moves suddenly, IV rockets up. That's why it's not always super easy to play the law of averages and get puts on a stock that suddenly rockets or calls on a stock that suddenly tanks: options are worth more when there is more expected price movement. Generally, however, such volatility is temporary. As the actual price volatility subsides, the IV decreases, and the option loses value. When something that was really volatile (and therefore has a high IV) becomes much less volatile (and loses a lot of IV), the resulting loss of value in its options is known as an ""IV crush."""
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ahh when it closed up 7%?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"oh, you mean...when it dropped down for 2 minutes and all the whales loaded up and most retailers like this dude saw temporary gains of 5000% but could not exit positions as trading was halted?

Right I saw that too.

But I diamond-handed and saw no change in my overall account except at the end of the day when it ended up close to 10%.

Gamma squeezes are rare by themselves, if you are betting on a negative gamma squeeze is like baiting for sharks by dipping your dick in chum and trying to land a shark. There are better ways of making money in this market without taking this level of risk.

But let OP have at it."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm talking about past performance here. For the last two or three years, it has been trading between 5 to 11 dollars. It would pop to 13 then go back below 10. That is why I asked: why can't it catch a break. I hope the time is now."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,There is no comparison between BB and GME. BB has a future.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I think the Facebook lawsuits and such dragged the stock down previously. I think BB is now FINALLY moving on from all that and all the EV stuff is now very much a reality and now you're seeing entire countries committing to green energy and EV's.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,PLTR is just too good of a stock. This is to be expected.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn I though PLTR finally moved but with how much you bought it was just a skooch. Congrats anyway though

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"My exact same thought as I read the title and saw the screenshot.

Then I saw the right swipe button and clicked it thinking it was a gallery post, only to find the right button is actually *part* of the screenshot and not the Reddit right swipe button for galleries. 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️

In any case, yes, still a mystery since from the *only* screenshot attached to this post, does look like OP is only up +$18K and was a multi-hundred-thousandaire already before investing in PLTR."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This. You could pull 18k from round trips in a single day with that kind of BP.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I started buying in around $26 before the 7 layer dip started and just kept buying more to average down as it dropped in price.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Already trading at a high PE ratio, but other companies not exactly like it but similar companies like snowflake have a bigger market cap so technically PLTR still has room to grow. However the market still doesn’t understand what PLTR does and how profitable the future of the company could be. The stock is very volatile so most retail investors buy and sell pretty quickly because they cannot handle the volatility, even though a lot of money can be made by simple buying PLTR under 23-24 and selling once it’s above 28ish"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"They make software to track relationships between everything. People, phone calls, email addresses, incidents. FBI, cops, and others use them to track suspects.

I used to work for them as a software engineer. They pay super well."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ask Cathie. That’s above this 🦍 pay grade.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,They’re basically big brother’s secret weapon. They’re basically Skynet from Terminator 2 before the cyborgs. Which is why it’s a great investment.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,They do the coolest shit. They can model unstructured data. It's amazing. Revolutionary.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"They sell an AI based software to assist companies in making business operations choices. They allow a company to run simulations using data sets based on potential ideas, business plans and what not. The results of these simulations allow a company to know the effect of their business choices before they commit to it. I saw an article a few weeks back that they helped BP save millions in a matter of weeks with this software."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mostly pl, but also tr."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Well before he was a hundred thousand aire. Now he’s a *multi* hundred thousandaire. Like the difference between a millionaire and multimillionaire. (Splitting hairs but this is what OP was going for)
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It seems like the biggest question mark of PLTR is scalability. This sets it apart from other b2b software companies who are assumed to have high profit margin
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So pltr is a computerized sherlock holmes?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You ever meet Alex Karp ? The outdoor sports legend
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,">(Splitting hairs but this is what OP was going for)

Yes, I performed a technical analysis and, technically speaking, OP did not in fact have more than one 100k! He did have more than 100k, but not more than one 100k. Hope this clears things up!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Their business model is to acquire, expand and scale.  Now, they’re expanding even more in different commercial sectors."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I am saying yes based on the question and my inference

I kept my position in CRON tho, so I like weed stocks, actually"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I always looked at ACB as short term trades since it was so volatile. I have no position in it anymore. Long MSOs and Aphray for me

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I had to make this post because u/treydayallday called me out in a comment I made on the GME megathread. I bought Jan 15th and held through the first squeeze. I still have friends holding. Now I can finally buy the motorcycle I’ve always wanted.

I was able to hit the spike at $330 as well (I have never had a stronger “get out now” instinct than I did in the moment), I sold enough to cover every cent I’ve ever put in, so I’m playing with house money now. Still holding on to some GME so I shouldn’t get bit by FOMO and put it all back in."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You paper-handed sir,  abandoned our 400$ apes....."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,MarketWatch over here...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Who brought paper hands to the party?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck you. You useless piece of shit. You absolute waste of space and air. You uneducated, ignorant, idiotic dumb swine, you’re an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole. The magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as moniker of evil for heretics. Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did. When Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality. After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society. No wonder your father questioned whether or not your were truly his son, for you'd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member. Your birth made it so that mankind is worse of in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover into a state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune. I would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell. You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted sac religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair. You are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. Rhodes Island would have been better off if you'd never joined us. You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being. Even this worlds finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are. Anyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe. In the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now. You are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet you manage to make it so that that is only a small part of the evil that is your being. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an eldrich abomination, but here you are. It’s hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you. Even if time travel some day will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to before this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors if they failed would have to many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it. I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did. The countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant. Right from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring. You are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the infected plague apparently only happened with the goal of teaching humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankind’s greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created. If you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched. You are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again. The sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe. I could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating working as hard and efficiently as possible, yet there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world. You are an irresponsible, idiotic, disgusting, unloved, horrible excuse for a living being who’s soul contains less humanity than every ginger in history combined. The absolute disgust I feel when thinking about anything that has even a slight resemblance to anything that might have to do with you and your unholy actions is so incredibly great that when I am honest about it I think that even I do not posses a consciousness great enough to comprehend my own feelings about it. When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children, they did not give their lives to have you fuck the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject become more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to understand what your failure actually means for the universe. My hate for you and everything you stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take the entire Lungmen population down there and back up around twenty million times before you would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I think that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world combined would not be able to stack up to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that when being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless. There is no one in this world that has ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, no one will ever love you in the future either. There is no hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will ever change for the better, and in fact quite the opposite might be true. By making the mistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will only devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are. The only possible way in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is would exclusively be because there is absolutely no conceivable way that you would even be able to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are wrong, helped myself. Also I bought in at $36 a share not $55. https://imgur.com/gallery/dMVqtL6"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao, you waited and are mad about it. Next time don’t think at all, just go all in. You hesitated 🤷‍♂️"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m wrong about what? I’ve been in GME since mid Jan, bought at $39 after waiting for Citron’s live stream that never came. Waited all day that day for it to drop back to $36 lol 

The people who bought in late at the end of Jan have mostly averaged down in Feb when the price was sub $50. Not many people bought during this last spike, unless they were averaging up.

You helping yourself is the same as helping hedgies. I don’t care either way, just pointing out why you’re getting downvoted.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok I’ll not be an asshole and say what should be said and that’s “go look up selling a put and read up” 

So you want to sell a Put?

Hi I’m Troy McClure you might know me from such cluster fucks as “Buying TSLA calls when it’s falling harder than mom when she broke her hip” or “YOLOing away my entire account” But today I’m here to tell you about selling puts. 

When you sell a put you’re really saying “I want fresh tendies only a 🌈🐻 can give me” but how? 

When you sell a put you’re agreeing to buy the underlying at the strike price no matter what the trading price is as long as it is below it. 

*But Troy why wouldn’t you buy a call??* 

Simmer down Billy! Selling a put means you get to take tendies up front with all of the downside risk of having to buy 100 shares of that stock no matter how low it is below the strike. 

Now isn’t that just fun? But be careful cause you’ll need to have sufficient cash in your account to cover that put.

Now run along Billy and yolo your account away on risky cash covered puts."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Google
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok. Think about the opposite, buying a put. If you buy a put, you are hoping that the stock price goes down. Assuming you don't exercise early, at expiry you get the maximum of the strike price X - the stock price S, and zero, or max(X-S,0) per share. You have to subtract the premium you paid to get your profit. 

Now you bought that put from someone. That someone sold a put. They get your premium, and are hoping that the stock doesn't go down in value. They aren't necessarily betting that the price goes up, but betting that at least it doesn't go below the buyers breakeven price, which is the strike - premium."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You sell puts betting the price goes up (or sideways or even down a litt) so the contract expires worthless and you keep your premium
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same as call, opposite direction"

2021-03-13 04:53:40,wallstreetbets,"Deutsche Telekom Recently I read the DD of [u/GermanRocketMan\_13](https://www.reddit.com/u/GermanRocketMan_13/) on WSB ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m25ors/why\_deutsche\_telekom\_has\_a\_132\_to\_194\_stock\_price/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m25ors/why_deutsche_telekom_has_a_132_to_194_stock_price/) ) where he promotes Deutsche Telekom and I am gonna promote that again.

The last couple years Deutsche Telekom has been the most boring stonk you can ever imagine. No volatility at all. BORING. But that is about to change this year. The stonk has potential. When I asked [u/GermanRocketMan\_13](https://www.reddit.com/u/GermanRocketMan_13/) why the stock would change after having a growth of barely 1 euro a year. he answered with the following:

A) Their US subsidiary shows really promising growth figures and a rather high market capitalization (which should reflect in their share price as 43% shareholder as well - at least sooner or later)

B) Finally, the delayed fibre glass rollout in Germany shows some growth and returns

C) Since they are in Germany a de-facto infrastructure monopolist (the competitors need to rent asset usage and maintenance from DTE, 5G is a solid growth driver

TBH these reasons are entirely understandeable and in my opinion corrrect, the results have shown this in their yearly report. A 20% growth in 2020.

Currently the shares are trading at precovid levels without the revenue growth, meaning they are potentially undervalued at this moment from a logical point of view.

Now one of the negative sides of things the user informs us about is debt. Currently Deutsche Telekom has a 100b debt. I disagree about this being a negative thing. As he talks about AT&T I will give AT&T's debt aswell. AT&T's debt is 190B. Other telekom companies have arround the same % of debt. For example the Dutch telekom company KPN has a market cap of 11B and a debt of 10B. The debt of Deutsche Telekom is not unusual in its sector. If anything, its completely normal.

After consindering all of this I see this stock as a value stock. A stock that has potential growth. And I can see you wondering why does it matter that the stock has changed from dividend stock to value stock? I can tell you thats only because of one reason. Options. Options are fucking cheap. Considering this stock has had no volatility for 20 years means that options are cheap as hell. I bought 100 June 17 2022 options with a strike price of 18 for 50 cents each. Currently they sell for 63 cents and thats still fucking cheap.

Now I do see the stock falling with 60 cents considering the ex dividend date at 29-03-2021. But after that I expect a stable growth to 20+ due to all of the reason mr [u/GermanRocketMan\_13](https://www.reddit.com/u/GermanRocketMan_13/) gives.

Keep in mind the stock currently trades at precovid levels while its revenue went up with 20%, and that 20% revenue growth wasnt expected last year, so it will most likely definetly shoot up.

If you disagree with this DD please tell me why so I can potentially get out of this position :P

Edit:

POS:  100 C18.00 17JUN 2022 for 50 cents ea (5k).

What’s your guess as to the price a year from now? Is there a return ticket from 🌕 🌕 🌕?

How do you think this all plays out? 

My own guess, based on nothing but the fact that I used to hold my breath a lot when I was little: it’ll be manipulated for years. There’s so much money sloshing around GME that there’s not going to be any one real level. It’s going to bounce around like your one sketchy cousin who somehow drives a Porsche."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If GME does a 1/10 split every time it hits 400, we could have an infinite money glitch on our hands."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think it pulses up and down for 2-3 months and finally squeezes.  It will never do the mega squeeze we all are holding for but it will peak and then slowly taper off until the positions are fully flipped.  Settling around 80-100 per share, perhaps more.  Management is strong, it has tons of hype and fee advertising, it’s gaming and could be lucrative, and it’s a chance to redistribute wealth. 

I believe.  Look what’s happened so far!  You have to be blind (or maybe I’m fucking crazy) but it’s clear to me this is a big play that the hedge funds fucked up.  If I’m wrong, I’m good.  I’d rather be wrong than miss out.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"A year it will be worth $2400.  It will continuously rise, while dipping to new highs. 

Buy ins will get pricy, which will slow growth.  It will never be worth dumping if you plan to buy back in.  You'll be taking bigger risks for smaller profits. 

So holding is the key to a steady increased value.  Shorts become speed bumps, but end up encouraging people to sell off their position which is more beneficial to them when buying back reduced shares."

it has a chance to turn around and reinvent itself.

On the other hand even if things go full awesome sauce and it's doing well in transition a year from now.. Im guessing $40 stock or less.

a lot of people are gonna get hosed at the end I think, sure the HF's have taken it up the ass early on but by now I suspect they're playing the situation and making money on the swings.

it looks like short interest is slowly declining.

I mean I hate to sound all sour and bearish and shit but eventually a lot of people are gonna get wallet raped.. I mean every dollar you make is someone elses dollar lost.. it's fun when it's the big firms but a lot of apes are gonna be left bloody no doubt."

Sentiment is overall very positive and a stable baseline price won't be set for a long time.

Its got huge attention in the market and is getting tons of free advertizing as well which only helps. It will not be staying this low for long. With Cohen's vision and the company moving realize that vision GME will start getting price valuations as a tech company instead of its historical brick and mortar retail valuation. Some people see the nearly 100x increase in price over the last year and assume its a bubble, but thats just the beauty of having such a low float. I have had this stock for years and I admit that the lockdowns really had me worried, but with the arrival of Cohen and their new moves forward I am 100% percent confident in this company moving forward."

I'm sitting on cost of $100 and I honestly don't believe we will ever see that number again.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Online digital game sells seems like a really bad way for the company to go though due to the massive competition they will face. Digital sales for games on consoles are now made directly on the console with the stores packaged with them like the Nintendo Store and Playstation Network. Gamestop also faces heavy competition from the players already big in digital PC sales like Steam and GoG. Alot of publishers are now making their own digital stores to keep sales more in-house as well. 


I don't see gamestop taking away much market share. They are also at a disadvantaged position since they are extremely late to the game of digital game sales."

A big squeeze always fucks up price for a while. VW needed two months before price stabilised but I think GME will take longer due to the strong community of diamond hands."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gamestop is extremely late to the stage though. There are a ton of digital game stores with a loyal base of customers due to years of doing it like Steam. Console gamers will continue buying digital games from their console makers like the Nintendo Store and Playstation Network. Even if Cohen sets up a digital store, how will they even compete against the current players?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro.

That's literally the same shit people said before the last price peak end of January.

Then the fucking stock tanked to 40.


Gme has no foothold in digital games, compete against steam, epic, Xbox gamepass or even GOG.

I have literally no reason to switch from one of these except if gamestop would do exclusives or beats key sellers in price. Which they won't.
So let's be honest : the price of the shares is incredibly inflated right now. If you to take your gains in the near future, you might be fucked, because price will flop like a dead fish again. This might be the Rollercoaster now, trading into the near 500s and then dropping again, all while hedgies earn tendies from retail and some retailers do clever moves buying the dips.


Long term, the stock is fucked because the company sucks balls. Cohen isn't a magician. And as long as he doesn't offer free blowjobs with the games you buy at gamestop, there is no reason this stock is worth more than 50 bucks in the next year."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stock prices aren’t determined by only valuations. So, it wouldn’t have reached $2-3 from unchecked and abusive shorting practices which extends to many other stocks. This isn’t a rational market."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol. This exact mindset is why you will never be named CEO. Stop thinking so narrowly. Cohen has taken the reigns because he has vision. He doesn't look at the competition and think ""oh, they are too established why should we even bother"". Obviously he saw value when he looked at this company, and he isn't looking to turn a quick profit then exit.

I don't know what his plans are, and I don't really see how he could turn it around. But what I do know, is that if there is anyone that *could* turn it around, we have found the right guy. 

Also, everyone saying they can't compete with steam is fucking retarded. Epic came out of nowhere and is trying to do exactly that. Just because it is hard doesn't mean it is impossible. The value proposition just has to be better."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I would pick Valve for sure. They already have a large customer base in digital download games through their Steam store as well as an extremely successful in house game development of some of the most popular games in the world: Dota 2 and CS:GO. They even have their own OS for Linux console games with in house streaming: Steam OS. They are the market leader for a reason.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Licensing would be an issue and would the publishers running their own stores even allow it since it's basically just taking away their existing customers? What advantage do they have in hiring a middleman to do what they are already doing. It makes sense for physical goods due to logistic complications so it would be more profitable to sell wholesale to retailers but online digital game sales do not have this same problem since all it's all digital. Perhaps if the game company didn't have their own store they could join into gamestops new platform but then why not one of the existing platforms currently available such as Steam?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,INCEPTION!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is this a joke? Steam is the Coca-cola of computer gaming platforms. Many people have over a decades worth of game purchased on Steam. If I ask someone to play a nonplatform exclusive multiplayer pc game, they're almost certainly going to ask for my steam name. No amount of marketing can match that.

 The only way Gamestop could even sit at the table is with exclusives, but that's also insanely expensive. If Gamestop is going to succeed then they actually have to reinvent the wheel."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not say prices are only determkn8by valuations.

I'm not saying price should be 3$. But thinking the price should be 300 dollar a share is nonironically retarded."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol.

You just made a other point for my argument.

The market is already full with 2 big digital games competitors as well as at least another full sub model competitor with Xbox gamepass and for playstation playstation plus.

Now digital sales make up most of all game sales and ingame sales make most of the overall revenue in gaming.

I don't need to be an CEO. I'm just saying you people expect Cohen to magically transform this huge old school game retail company with thousands of shops  into an incredibly big e commerce giant. What happens to the thousands of stores in a world where noone cares about real life shopping anymore?

Even with these ideas of making it esport centers or whatever, people drastically underestimate the effort needed for that, and that gamestop stores are usually tiny, there would be literally no room for any kind of esport event that generates income."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"My understanding is more like a Netflix of video game buying, selling, trading through an ecommerce Amazon like website, backed by local deliveries from the b&m store and delivered same day via Postmates/Doordash drivers.

I recently bought my nephew a few Switch games for his bday and that's how they were delivered, very efficient and friction free.

This all comes back to and hinges on the idea that people are not fully onboard for digital only gaming, due in very large part to bandwidth and data cap restrictions from the entire nations regional monopoly of ISPs.

I'll edit in a link in a min for more context

E: read the first two comments to my comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3fldc/cramer_on_gme_again/gqou0s3) for a few anecdotal data points, I believe this is more of a factor than people realize to position Gamestop to capitalize on the friction with digital games."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol. Go buy their shares then and fuck off with your 1.5% dividend. A pivot is a rocky road and if you're not ready for volatility then don't let the door hit you on the way out. If you want to invest with certainty, I hear the treasury yield has increased. Maybe that level of risk is more your tolerance."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"All I'll say is that Epic has given away millions of dollars in free games over the last few years trying to get people to use their platform more. Still I haven't given them a cent and would typically be willing to pay slightly more for something on Steam, just to have it all on the one account.

I suspect I'm not alone in feeling like this."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"All I'm saying there are too many fuckin digital stores out there and the customer is getting overwhelmed by having to register each time, bullshit fucking exclusive deals and a whole cesspool of other not consumer-friendly dogshit practices.

Instead of competing who can provide the best service, they are competing who can fuck the customer the least. It's not exactly the same thing."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Steam is like kids buying a phosphate at the apothecary, the brand doesn't have serious recognition until mom starts to randomly throw cans of Coke into her basket. If you think all of these people who are holding GME wouldn't buy games from GameStop just to support the company, you don't understand what is happening here. My Boomer dad is asking me whether or not GME is a good investment, do you think he knows what Steam is?It doesn't even need to be the main focus of the pivot, and people would still use it because everything else is a generic.

But go ahead, find the last mention of Steam on CNBC for me."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, the problem was started by abusive shorting. There’s your price fluctuations on more true valuations. This is NOT the only stock in this predicament of under- or over-valued for great lengths of time. The entire market has grown more irrational because of irresponsible trading through price fixing and direction by way of manipulation. Options are a big reason. Hence, if you want to make money, then you play in this crazy game with the regard that it doesn’t matter what you think the valuation should be. The tech, EV and alternative energy sectors, SPACs, and futures have been highly manipulated by market makers who use their leverage with short sellers to profit. Look at the media and analyst recommendations over Palantir. Like this SPY, QQQ, SPX last drop, then I saw it as an opportunity to buy and ride some stocks up for 30%+ gains. But, I offloaded Friday and the rest PM Monday because they are about to make a correction for shorts to cover positions. Many of those stocks which have higher valuations already will dip, like it’s being sold by retail. When in fact, we are negligible in that volume. We’ve had the most effect on GME because of over shorting and increased retail. But, whales are bouncing this beach ball in the 200’s."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are still way too stuck on the problem. You have in your mind what Gamestop *can't* do. And then you ramble on about some half-baked nonsense about e-sports centers. 

All I'm saying is that Ryan Cohen is the right person to lead change. I don't have the vision of what the change could or should be. Personally I hate the e-sport hub idea and think it is half-baked nonsense. But my argument has been completely unaddressed by you, and it's that Ryan Cohen and his dream team are either worth putting your faith in, or they aren't. 

Now, what financials would they need in order to justify the new share price? I think we would need to see strong improvement in earnings (needs to be not negative obviously) and a big improvement in online sales. I'm pretty sure we will see both of those things on the 25th, and Cohen's vision hasn't even begun. If all you see are the barriers to growth, then maybe Amazon and Apple are more your style of investment."

Playstation Now, (In my experience Playstation Now is actually kind of nice when you can download the games onto your console to play but the actual streaming sucks) and Stadia comes to mind. Stores like Best Buy, Walmart, Target have their own Amazon like websites where people can purchase games, groceries, w/e and have it delivered to their home or come in for onsite pickup where they deliver it to your car not to mention Amazon also sells games. Gamestop won't be doing anything new as far as I can tell. Revenue from game trading won't amount to much due to low volume."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol you assume I'm not making money off GME.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, that is one advantage of being the market leader. It does help too that Valve and Steam has very satisfied customers. 

I have a really hard time believing that a pet food salesman is going to beat Valve at their own game."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would say the multiple amount of digital stores is an extension of industry practices with consoles. Lock customers out unless you use their platform/console. They would not agree to join into a meta service unless Gamestop has really good sales people that can convince the publishers to stop maintaining their own online stores and use Gamestops instead, which is unlikely since they've already done most of the work with their existing stores so have no need to switch to an outsource supplier for it."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're either super young, don't play computer games, or you're knowingly bullshitting. Steam is THE computer gaming platform. I don't care how often they get mentioned by the media. Go into any pc gaming space and ask if they think that Steam is getting replaced as #1 in the  sector any time soon, they're going to laugh their asses off."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you are going to rely on non tech savvy people to buy games at your store, most likely they will be buying it off somewhere they are already familiar with like Amazon or Walmart."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bullshit.

As said, I'm not doubting gamestop can be the shit in 10 years.

But right now, it's ridiculous trying to justify a fucking 300 dollar share on hopes in Cohen alone. Even if he turns the company completely, that will take some years.

Then maybe, 300 dollars is a good price.

Right now, until he really begins to deliver, 50 dollar is generous."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You have done an excellent job at wasting my time.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would I do that ? I only did that the second time to emphasize.... why would I emphasize a hidden message in its original context if I wanted it to be hidden ....
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s a whole new dynamic and game here on out, only way I see it"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough. That's a bad assumption. There's two sides to every trade. Obviously, I hope you're wrong. But if you're right, feel free to rub it in 😂"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"My dear retard, I am 40 years old and still buy new releases on disk - I don't think you understand how quickly a consumer space can change just on general sentiment, but you keep blogging on your Myspace durring the Facebook roll out."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"While that is entirely possible, I think there is a lingering generation from the tale end of the millenials who don't think the same way that you do and they are the ones who gate keep their kids' online purchases. I also think the stock is going to a create a cultural awakening that will be forever associated with the brand regardless of what they do, it's really difficult to estimate the value of that.

Just look at AMC, everyone was talking about the death of theatres and how great streaming services are, but now people are boycotting Netflix and Disney plus over Cuties and Gina Carano as a part of cancel culture while people are begging to get back into theatre seats and realizing the value of ""the movies"" as a venue in and of itself.

One narrative is never the whole truth."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Eh...you’re killing me bot. Hang in there.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol. Go look into the values of DoorDash and snowflake. Smart money doesn't wait. Enjoy your 3% annualized return investing in safe stuff. If GME could be ""the shit"" in 10 years, you would expect value today to flux accordingly. Whether it's worth $300... Idk... But all the existing pricing models don't really work in a turnaround/growth company because everyone has widely varying expectations of future cash flows. If you think GME is currently overvalued, I would love to know your opinion on Tesla then?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,“How do you know I didn’t piss my pants on purpose?”
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I take it the space before the last four periods means you're on shrooms
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha gambling baby!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You have no idea what you're talking about. I said it in a different comment, but go look up the list of free games Epic has given away over the last few years trying to get people to switch to their platform. Tons of AAA titles and even that hasn't worked. That's not even considering how expensive it would be for Gamestop to get that all up and running. Servers are not cheap and no amount of ""sentiment"" is going to get a significant amount of people playing on an unstable platform.

You might as well be arguing that Gamestop should launch their own console and try to compete with Xbox, Sony, and Nintendo. At this price Gamestop is a pure momentum trade and if you don't recognize that, you're going to get absolutely fucked when it eventually crashes."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You really really have no idea how big Steam is. Love GME, but you’re way off here"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Of course the future is always uncertain but the odds of that happening seem pretty low so I speculate that most of the people playing the GME stock are relying on attracting as many bag holders as possible before they dumpster the stock on them like they did the last spike.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know what the stock is, I am talking about the value of the brand - they are not necessarily the same thing."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh, I do, but I have seen so many implacable things fall in my life time that I find it fairly amusing how much younger people take as a given. I remember 20 years ago when people told me that Apple was over and investing in them was stupid, best return on 100$ in my life."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"For the last decade the majority of people were absolutely shitting on Gamestop and their business practices, you can still see the spillover jokes from that now. Suddenly it's a meme stock and people start saying how much they care about a faceless corporation. 

Watch how fast the brand sentiment reverts back once the stock crashes and a ton of people get burnt."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Throw 3rd stimulus check into GME, message receieved"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL go for it, I still agree that there's profit to be made here. The greater point I'm making is that if you don't understand the actual game here, you're going to lose. 

If you do understand the game you're playing and you're knowingly lying to others about GME not inevitably eventually crashing, then you're just a shitty person."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's not what I am saying, I am saying that even though the value of the stock at its current price doesn't reflect its fundamental value that the stock will not fall as people think it will after gaining new brand recognition and pivoting into a ""tech stock."" The floor isn't as far down as the media would have us believe."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The stock has been below $20 since 2017. The price has a long way it could fall and a lot of normal people that bought at these prices that could lose it all if they drink the kool aid and ignore the facts.

If you're trusting that the media and the internet in general are going to keep focusing on Gamestop for even the next few months, you must be new here. When interest dies, so will the price."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Profits has to come from someone. Everyone trying to hype the stock are definitely just trying to attract more bag holders before they dumpster the stock back to 50 dollars.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Technically 18% of human body is carbon, coal is 60% - 80% carbon, and diamonds are 99%; average human hand is 0.5 kg, so assuming 0.5kg * 0.18 = 0.09kg .. and so if 1 carat is 0.2 grams and human hand has around 0.09 kg which is like 90 grams or 450 carats of diamonds? 

So well, tl;dr you probably could harvest diamonds from people who claim they have diamonds hands."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Diamonds are primarily composed of carbon which we consider a dangerous atmospheric waste product past a certain ratio. Think about that.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"To make diamonds put of coal you'll need immense pressure. An easy solution is to clench your butt cheeks on your fists. Clench them hard until you can't clench no more. The result would be the hardest diamond hands you've ever seen.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This will make the price drop. This has been a frustrating position to say the least. I think that this is a good long term position to hold on to.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I still think this stock is dead
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You missed all those tasty under $4 shares. I’m an idiot, get in the van."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You think my 4/16 $8 calls have a chance?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Why won't this stock move. My calls are waiting.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's never Nokia time. Never.

I've been holding 8k shares at 5.06 since Jan.

The bags are heavy and my arms are getting tired."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I sure as fuck hope so...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The float on Nokia is huge. Gonna take a lot to move that piece of shit.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I got so tired of it and took a $900 lost .
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How long you thinking? The bag is starting to get heavy.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am with you brother, 950 shares long"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hope the price drives up on this one. Unfortunately you have a long ride up to break even. Fortunately I need like a $0.60 increase to get my money back on this one.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stop crying, this is not a video game for subtle girls, if you lost, accept your loss or keep holding on, this is the game, maybe I have more reasons than you to be crying, but I understand this and how it works, the market It does NOT depend on a meme, stop crying and move on."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't exercise. Sell it and buy the 100 shares if you want the 100 shares. There's still a bit of extrinsic premium left in those calls. We're talking pennies but pennies are pennies.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Im in for long ✔️
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah it never moves which sucks. If it had some movement I’d actually go in and sell covered calls while I waited on it as I like the company. But .07 for a 4.5 call? Screw that.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I keep hearing that. What’s the difference between huge float @ $4, and a hundred times smaller float @$400? Isn’t it just the market cap that matters?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s not a meme stock, so if you’re trying to get in for a quick rise and then cash out, that’s probably not gonna happen. Nokia has a lot in the works internationally. I think it’s a pretty safe bet if you’re looking a year or 2 into the future. I definitely would not sell anytime soon unless you need the money."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you kindly
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Me too, I really like how they are setting up for the future. I think it’s really a period of reset and rebuilding for the company right now."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have an OTM call I bought in January, I doubt I will make anything on it."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You do realize that’s 1.55% returns in a single week? 

Almost 81% annualized?

That’s insignificant to you? You do realize the market as a whole generally only returns like 8% a year right? 

Most investors can’t even beat the market. Let that sink in."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"People in this use option and options are 100 shares per contract. Thereby, the float matters. There is no gamma squeezing this with options."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Copy. Before GME craze I’ve always been a long term
Holder, so this works for me."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm sorry, I thought this was WSB?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I want to be rich now not in 40 years
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,">  You do realize 

Let me stop you right there doc, they don't."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Still, what’s the difference between buying/writing 1 contract or 100 contracts? 

Basically, you’re saying (if I understood correctly) that if Nokia was to make a reverse stock split, then the stock would become more volatile as a result. Which doesn’t make any sense to me."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Didn't it get gamma squeezed hard in January or whenever it was it got over 9 a share? The amount of 1/22 calls on it is crazy, I myself own a few. Options don't cost much when the stock is trading at 4/share."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Fair enough.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cost I believe?
Buying one option is less costly than buying 100 options, at least for my broker?

Buying one option with a stock that has 100x smaller float is essentially the same as buying 100 option for Nokia. But I think buying 100 option results in 100x transactional cost."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"My point is that volatility is induced through options buying. If the broker/people who sell the contract wants to hedge their downside, they have to buy the shares. This will cause the stock price to go up —> gamma squeeze. But if the float is big, option doesn’t have that much of a movement to the stock anw."
2021-03-13 04:10:26,wallstreetbets,RKT - Still holding 3/12/21 - I will sell it only when it’s positives - Can’t touch me !

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are going to get a lot of people making fun of your investment, but if you know why you bought it then why would you listen to them? Remember all the shills when everyone’s favorite stock was at $40?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell covered calls bro
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You might get your money back in a year to be honest. At this point I’d just keep them. Anything can happen you know?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,$22 3/19
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought in at the same price 🤣
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"... at least we've got that sweet, sweet dividend.  i'm actually up $2 on the stock, and I'll make an extra $30 on the divvie.  not too shabby."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"2,010 @ 28.5 avg, 
4 Jan 2020 20.85 (10.82 avg) 

Looking to get more options if I can get em for around 8. 

I’m not worried about the stock. A little concerned about the options but avg down will help with that. 

This is financial advice and you should pay me for it😁: CHILL, be patient. It’s warm outside. The world is a casino."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn, they got you with the decoy rocket 🚀🚀 
Think this has upward motion? I actually haven’t done any DD on RKT"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can sell some covered calls in the meantime and get some premiums.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,1000 shares right here with you
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,#buy more...wait🤣
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, you're never selling?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yikes that average cost. But I believe in the stock, holding a hair over 500 shares right now. Planning on selling some CCs all along the way but believe in the company enough to hold it for a couple of years."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Oof
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I like Rocket but I have read about the housing market making a correction soon which may not be good for the stock. Still long hold
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hope you’re right man, but I don’t see RKT going anywhere but the trash. Awful company to work with on the daily..."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I know right and this play will for sure make money . This company is growing. If I didn't need my money now I would invest a substantial amount too. Op will be up a lot .it's a great company
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"#rip

remindme! 6 days"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol that's where I sold my covered calls because I didn't think it'd get to the break even.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not every stock is going to behave like GME. In fact, most won't but I don't have to tell you that. This UWMC/RKT pissing contest may have some bearing on the valuation, but with the proposed $1B buyback and RKT coming out on top this could rise to anywhere beteen $75 and $100 a year from now. Mind you I said could. it could also continue to stagnate and bounce in the $25-$30 range."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Jay has no fear and will make money regardless of rates. He said so himself.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I understand that, but you aren’t supposed to buy high and sell low unless you have to or the fundamentals change. I’m not claiming that it is the next GME, I am saying not to listen to the haters because the dissuaders will keep you from making profit. Personally, I don’t care about the stock as I have no positions in it, but I do think that even if it drops it is still worth holding. I saw a 25k bid wall while tracking the stock earlier today. You don’t see that kind of movement without someone setting a solid bottom."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I honestly see it hitting $100 a share no problem quicken and rocket mortgage are great companies
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agree. Uber pisses cab drivers.

Legacy Realtor is sour about RKT because they lose their commision from their favorite small time broker."

Cab medallions before Uber appreciated in value. They use to go for ~$1 million and that was your retirement. Post Uber $250,000 on down, not sure about current value but Uber disrupted the entire industry. 

Moral of these stories folks is that disrupters make bank as do those just a long for the ride (us)."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I'll give you tree fiddy.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"In 20 years?  Probably less, but who knows what will become of GME.  This short/gamma squeeze dosent mean that is is a strong fundamental company.  The company has a lot of hurdles to become profitable again.  This is not a stock I want to own long term.  Even if it is worth more in 20 years, it won't be worth much more, when you could use that equity to chase the next GME, and just buy it in 20 years."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,At least 7
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably $1 dorrrah.  But by 2042 it will be $500 dorrrah

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is there a mall in your skating rink?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What is it? A closed shopping mall in SoCal?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Playing hockey in a mall looks fucking awesome!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I picture WSBtards naruto running from on to the other while screaming

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Also Lloyd center in Portland has one.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love malls with arenas! Perfect combo. There's one in Cambridge, Ontario as well."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Portland,OR has one in a mall"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got excited over the rink between amc & GameStop too.  

I think we need an ape drop in game."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,There's also a Japanese arcade as well
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Recorded on nokia uploaded on BB

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,**WHO OWNS THIS MALL?**
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I stared at it like 10 times, thinking that exact same thing."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,We should all meet up and buy something from GameStop and then go see a movie
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,BRUUHHH I posted that last night before going and seeing a movie and woke up to it BLOWN UP this is crazy so many of us know where this shit is 😂😂😂

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude you have no idea how blown away I am how much traction this got and soooooo many people know this is the parks bro.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,One of my fav comments so far
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sell when you are comfortable with the outcome but remember, the longer everyone holds, the higher the possibility the stock value will rise. The HFs will eventually have to close their short positions at some point and buy back the stock. Not financial advice, I just like the stock and movies."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yessiirrr
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This was filmed 3/12/21 lol

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah this is an open mall in north Texas
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nope, Parks mall in Arlington"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s badass. Almost makes me wish I would’ve taken a job offer I had in Dallas.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm seriously Jel.  Might immigrate from canada
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I went to that mall to watch the yu-gi-oh The Movie movie with my family years ago.  Great memory
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ohh hey, I'm like an hour out from there! I go to Arlington every once in a blue moon."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Go there all the time. Best mall I’ve ever been to
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I came here to say this!! Hello fellow DFW resident!!!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"“Welcome to WSB arena, where today’s game features the Retards vs. the Autists.”"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Data analyzed by PLTR?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lost half of mine. Sold $4 weekly calls on half, $4.50 on the other half."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Came to say this!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,thought i recognized that place only been there once long ago but that ice rink definitely seemed familiar.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,God I live like 10 minutes away from from this place! I’ve done all sorts of debauchery here in my highschool days
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Never thought I would see my own mall on WSB
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,100%
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Sure is
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah the parks! I’ll be going there for a movie real soon!

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Omg how did you know
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay cool, thanks"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol all because of the mall ice rink
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Refereed many a hockey game there.  The ice was shit.  People would throw pennies from up above. Mall ice is very over rated
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m sure you’ll be able to visit it sometime soon, haha"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,We had one of these in Tampa also
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,your whole country is an ice rink
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You might want to practice standing in an oven,  I knew a Canadian family that lived down here once... Biggest God damn ac I've ever seen on a house."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Just go to the west Ed in Edmonton it's got the exact same thing
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably keeps a copy stored in DBX
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Well howdy fellow north Texans
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Same
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah that sounds like Arlington 😂
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's hilarious. Sure, for $20!

After the transaction.. ""oh, hope last night's hookers n' blow session won't be a problem..""

That is stupid to ask some stranger. You've got no idea what people do."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So how much did he pay you
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Let’s go the gf didn’t wanna see it so I’m down to see it with redditors
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're goddamn right it is, son."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Where the arcade at
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It's me the theatre seat
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, just that they have cool stuff there. Instead I’m living amongst a bunch of farmland. The closest movie theater is 30 minutes away."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Bet that folder was colored PRPL
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I fuckin knew it!!! The ice rink in between amc and GameStop, the food court. This place and hurricane harbor was an integral part of my childhood"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Home 😢
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Houston here.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,1000% gotta be the parks
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Am I late to the North Texas party? Dallas gang
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,In Round One besides the AMC on the first floor.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nothing wrong with farm land! Go snag a dirt bike or start a block party or something, gotta manifest you're own entertainment in a way in the country, and once you do it's fantastic."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,We about to build AMC theater in everyone’s back yard don’t worry ape
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Why hate on Texas? I’m honestly curious why the general response to Texas is always negative?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Just to be clear man dallas is awful and isn't really texas. Come to Fort worth to see all the people riding horses and shit and wearing boots and cowboy hats. No one will pull a gun on you for no reason in fort worth
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Bet his boxers have LMND stains
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I worked at the hot topic, the new york & co and the victoria's secret in hs, and ate at that chick-fil-a every damn day"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I worked at Hurricane Harbor and later at Spencer Gifts at the parks mall.  Last time I visited I remember seeing that skating rink and watched a movie at the AMC theater.  Miss that place!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Back in my day we called it Wet N Wild. Hello hello Arlingtonian!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How does Texas have an ice rink in a mall and I’m in Canada and no ones ever thought to put a damn ice rink in a mall? Crazy.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,College station here
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck houston
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you tried hog hunting on quads by any chance?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets, Block party? I believe you mean field party.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh shut the hell up.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Fort Worth is “real Texas” for people that are scared of minorities and enjoy smelling like cow shit.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The chikfila or the sbarro, and then we’d go to the candy store. Go to the arcade and get scammed by the stack game for like 30 min and get tilted."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I went back in 2018 to get some shoes and to get a sweet sweet shot of nostalgia. Walked around for like 30 minutes just window shopping like the old days. Haven’t been back to hurricane harbor though, maybe should when the Rona goes away."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I still call it Wet N Wild.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"There’s another bigger nice one in Dallas at the galleria mall. I’d assume as Canadians seeing an ice rink wouldn’t really inspire much excitement, in Texas were like oooooh you can skate on it?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Welcome to the TX thread my guy.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I most definitely meant LAND party of course of course you got me on that one.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Apologize fella apes won’t be political anymore. 💎
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets, As a minority I wanna say that's like 50% true
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It looks as though you may have spelled ""Chick-fil-A"" incorrectly. No worries, it happens to the best of us!"

2021-03-13 03:44:10,wallstreetbets,One year of YOLO plays in the Roth IRA and now the 1 day gains are ~3x the annual contribution limit... throwing an absolute rager in honor of you degenerates when I turn 59.5 😂 
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol fucking congrats bro. Lol that's the plan
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow you went from 12k in 2016 to 300k
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Tax freeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is my plan for GME gains. Currently up 100% in 2021 - fives years worth of max contributions!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Roth gains. This is the way.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fun fact: you can use the funds in your Roth IRA to purchase real estate, and any cash flow/proceeds from that real estate is also tax free."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just discovered this back in November!  I feel like an idiot for not thinking about it sooner!  Anyway, made 30k in GameStop, tax free, feeling good."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Roth gains are tax-free. Murica!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice. Thanks to gme I already 2x my roth/traditional ira accounts. Sucks there wasn’t a lot in it to begin with but I’ll take whatever I can get
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck you...

Are you still single, if not what about your wife?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Spectacular run!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"RemindMe! 30 years

Fuck am I really that close to 59?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is what it’s all about, fucking love it. 

Congrats."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You dirty savage
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn! Congrats on the tendies! What are some of the main YOLO plays you made in the past year?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Laughs from UK with our 20K yearly limits. Congrats tho
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Teach.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,IUL.... no 59 1/2
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How?!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Congrats bro. Just figured out how to roll my Roth into an SDIRA. Starting with about as much as you did, can't wait to get started."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Tax free compounded return.  The way to do it.  You can also will an IRA.  There are no tax consequences until distributions are made to the person inheriting it.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How are you sending invites out? In a post🤣🤣
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Prior to retirement, you can pull out contributions without (re-)paying any taxes or penalties. Also, after 5 years, you can pull out earnings and only pay income tax (no penalties). So, this money is fairly accessible prior to 59.5 albeit not tax advantageous until then. 

https://www.schwab.com/ira/roth-ira/withdrawal-rules#:~:text=You%20can%20withdraw%20contributions%20you,had%20less%20than%20five%20years."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Touching your IRA? Yikes.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Congrats! I actually just opened a Roth IRA and have the funds settled. If you don't mind, could I get your opinion on what is typically best to focus on with this type of account? (Options, dividend stocks, growth stock, etc.) I guess I'm just trying to figure out the best way to take advantage of a Roth IRA vs a different retirement account. Thanks!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone take away his 'tarded merit badge.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,No positions?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,YOLO'd my Roth IRA at $150 a share. So far so good!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude what a move. Don’t give me any ideas to start touching my Roth!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Foly huck!!!! I wish I could throw my whole 401k into gme for the time being
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s fucking awesome dude. A dream of mine. Congrats!!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It can be 55 if youre not working then.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahahaha yeah boi lines of viagra till you’re a senile fucking pile of prunes
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea it’s important to take some ownership in your personal finance. The suits have long just wanted us to drop our money off with them and get our pathetic 5-10%. Had you left it alone you would have missed out on one amazing bull run, congrats."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,you can play with your Roth money?   I did not know this.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You can always withdrawal your contributions for free
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s a Roth IRA
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Invite me if you have any money left by then lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hit me up in a few decades bro you’ll get the first invite
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hes a wizard harry.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,GameStop’s a helluva drug
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Not exactly.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way ^^^ easier to diamond hands when you can’t spend the money till your 60! 😂👴🏻
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought the majority of my GME in my non-roth account 😭
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you have to pay an early withdrawal penalty for using these funds for real estate purchase?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure you can only use your contributions, not the earnings so not very helpful here"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You can withdrawal your contributions for literally anything
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Only $10k though...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can’t live in it tho 😔
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So are TFSAs 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Laughs from the US where we can also stash 19.5k in our 401ks & 3.6k in our HSAs over the IRA limits.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone here who can afford to put away 20k post-tax dollars every year can afford to pay taxes on their gains 😂 it’s hard to max out $6-12k per year!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Laughs in mega backdoor which allows up to $38.5k per year (but depends on your employer's 401k plan)
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So... less than our total?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cries in Denmark, where the limit i 1K yearly and still has 15% tax of gains yearly"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the detail. Can you put the withdrawal contributions them back in later?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,A healthy mix of options and growth for me. I’d recommend only buying ATM LEAPS unless you’re feeling lucky. OP was probably messing with FDs to get those kind of gains. Wouldn’t be too bad if you’re going. Maybe throw $5K into FDs
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Short term plays so you are not taxed as ordinary income. I have GME, calls, other yolos there.

If you also have a cash account (post tax monies) that's the Boomer stocks you hold for over a year to keep tax at 15%. I have commodities, large caps, PSLV and ETFs there."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,i put mine in momentum / meme stocks and bee c oin.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I do 80% market index 20% international index for my contributions.

I took 1300 i had in boomer bonds and started yoloing back in Nov. Turned it into 10k since then. So my yolo money is 50% of my ROTH's total account value."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a casino"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm there! With all these tendies out there I wished I would've opened my Roth sooner lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"RemindME! 7200 days ""Where's my invite?"""
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats and fuck you!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can I come ? I’ll bring my wife
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ahm no a fucken wizzard ya fat prick ah’ll burst ye
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It doesn’t even look like GME. Gains were mostly from 2020, so I assume he made a killing off the March crash. I’m sure there’s some meme stocks in there tho"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, taxed on the way in but from there it's all good.  It's one of the reasons my Roth IRA is my hyper aggressive account, because of in gonna pull it off and get an insane return then it might as well be the account where my pocket change is taxed as pocket change and not my life savings taxed as regularly income."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you allow to do optioning trading in Roth IRA ? Thought they forbid it due the volatility
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Us apes need to know we're all about to own ocean front property on the moon!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have a self-directed Roth IRA. You can take out $10,000 for the purchase of your first home only. And I have loaned out my money for a real estate loan however I cannot before yourself it can only be for a loan to somebody else for an investment.   Basically u are the first mortgage for someone else n u set the interest rate n repayment terms.  Which honestly I regret doing this because I would’ve made way more money just investing in the stock market. But at the time I wasn’t ready to do so. And now that I am I would never loan out my money again for real estate to somebody else"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not sure, check with an accountant but I think there's a workaround."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You need to have the funds in your IRA to purchase. From there normal Roth rules apply. So if you dip into profits, yes penalty."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"And only $10k worth, and only first time buyers, its as lame as can be really."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,No you can withdraw all of your initial contributions after they have been in there for five years with no penalty
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t think they can take out from Roth tho without being taxed.. I could be wrong cuz I’ve never looked into this but as far as I know nothing in USA can be really compared to tfsa equally

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Absolutely critical to fund it every year! Every dollar counts. And the ability to compound those tendies on a tax free basis is PRICELESS. 💎

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I am allowed to buy calls and puts and sell covered calls and cash secured puts in my Roth IRA.  You just need to apply for option approval."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure you can withdraw contributions penalty free any time. 5 year rule applies to earnings.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah we get fucked on early withdrawal. It's a 10% penalty and then you get taxed your rate based on your income/household income. 

If I'm to cash out my gme gians, I gotta lose 45%... That's before 59.5"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,However You can take out your contributions after it has been in there at least five years without penalty. So if you make some mega gains from Gme And want to use the funds to pay down debt or whatever you can take out whatever money you put in without penalty if it’s been in there at least five years
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, short term plays in any IRA, including ROTH. This is where I play/gamble."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought some GME in my Roth. Hoping I can make up for my late teens/early 20’s when I didn’t have an IRA and all those contributions I missed out on
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes!  1/5 of my shares are in my self directed Roth.  Very happy
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You are correct
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can actually withdraw an amount equal to the amount you have contributed without any early penalties. 

I know because I had to do this when I got laid off several years back."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can withdraw your principal without penalty, just not your gains"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can take out contributions with no penalty at any time, 5 year rule is for gains"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Welcome to 2009!

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What is your time horizon for this?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Retards.  Do some search for this shit on wsb
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep. Its a legit play. How far out are we from a ruling?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Since the financial crisis and bail out of Fannie and Freddie, they have been under a form of conservatorship where they keep huge reserves and sweep profits to the treasury. They have been negotiating and suing the government to release them from some of these commitments. It’s complicated but if they were to be released fully or in part from their commitments both would instantly be worth 2 to 10 times current  valuation.  It was thought that they were about to negotiate a deal with the Trump administration, but that got stalled. Next up relying on arguments before the Supreme Court from a few months ago that should be ruled upon soon. If not successful, they’re going to have to go to the Biden administration which may or may not be fully receptive to much of this."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,End of June.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It is but Biden and the dems sure as shit will try to make sure they keep control of that cow. I got out of it months ago. @ $1.93 looking a little more attractive
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,😂😂😂😂
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Interesting
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, great, thank you for clarifying. Could be a really interesting play if it goes through. Is this on SCOTUS’ docket anytime soon?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,they already had oral arguments at the end of 2020.  A ruling should be forthcoming.
2021-03-13 03:42:03,wallstreetbets,"There are more retail investors than ever, but we don’t have the power to tank markets. I saw a post of a person nervous that the economy is going to tank because of GameStop. This individual’s mind was so manipulated by the media that she truly thinks retail investors are the reason for GameStop and the possibility of a recession. The post was insulting against the common people, and it was extremely naïve. We can help the cause, but as you saw today and yesterday we certainly cannot move it or else we would have. All we do is help bullish institutions by HodLing a stock that we like. 

I also see a lot of articles saying that retail investors are essentially the cause of hedge funds losing money and 401(k) stocks just doing their average thing. Meanwhile we’re making 100%-300% returns because we see past the bullshit and don’t trust the system. This is infuriating to me and I don’t think it gets a enough of attention. Gme dropped from 348 to 178 before I could take a snapshot of my gains...yeah we don’t have that type of power. We have a different power...buy and hold a stock we like. 

There are some really smart apes on WSB here and some really dumb apes. We don’t have the ability to pum* GME, we just make it A LOT harder for you to dum* it. The reason for that is because we are fearless and re*arded and we like the stock. We have learned not to panic sell (more of us at least).

My point is figure it the fuck out and stop patronizing over 9 million people by telling the public that we are some godly entity with extreme power. If you’re out there hedgies please listen: figure out your own problems that your own greed got you into and stop crying on live television. The only difference between retails then and now, is that we see right past your lies and are more aware of how to make money. We just do it legally. 

Three years ago no one thought a retail investor could be, not a force in the market, but a CHANGE in the market. What really grinds my bananas, is the fact that it is the billionaire hedge funds job to adjust and pivot to the macro level of market changes. All we do is buy and hold. You’re telling me that these dumb hedgies can’t figure out a way to legally work with that? Then they were never qualified to be in that position. 

GME made us woke. Now you have to figure out how to make money rather than manipulating the public with articles released 10 minutes before the price action actually happens. We will hold through your fomenting and your petty ass $1 price target downgrades to justify movement in the stock. 

Think about it...their argument is don’t let retail investors trade because it makes our job harder. It’s harder because they were less informed back then than they are now. We have to stop giving them freedom. It wont work....since we have social media to spread real truth. No way to hide information like they used to. If somehow they do find a work around that it would have to be done illegally and unconstitutionally. They cant take that route because it would be planet of the apes part seven or some thing."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The stock market is not the economy

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Retail technically does have the power to tank markets. They just cant corroborate and use their collective power or its conspiracy, manipulation, etc. etc. Only hedge funds are allowed to use a bunch of different peoples money collectively to manipulate the markets as they see fit.

Retail has a lot of capital. The ""power"" is there. But retail doesnt operate as a singular unit."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah its sad how dumb your average person is. (Referring to dumb lady who said though we were gonna kill merica with gme)
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,But we do have the power to tank our portfolios!!!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So when buying was restricted across multiple brokerages the first time around, the price tanking was a coincidence? 🤔 Poor, insignificant retail is just along for the ride... hrm okay

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Even with the stimulus out, we expect a huge price increase or a short squeeze and even if it doesn’t happen this week or month just hold! Maybe the hedge funds and politicians are even in on it to create a quick spike and trick ppl into selling out after a couple gains. 40% or 1000% increase??? Stay woke ppl"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So in January there was actually real concern that the Gamestop rise would crash the markets, and it wasn't unjustified. If there are no shares to cover with, the price can go up forever. This you all know, and everyone here talks about what to do when the price goes to mars, etc. 

But, if a hedge fund has infinite losses, they must sell all their stock. Other funds aren't going to buy it at high prices since htey know the short fund is under duress. They will pull their bids on the entire market to get the short fund to sell at the worst possible price. Some of them might even sell significant portions of their own holdings to get ahead of that situation. 

The amount of leverage in the system, though, could cause margin calls at that point, which would have tanked the markets even further. 

That';s not even getting to the point that once the hedge funds can't cover and go bankrupt, their brokers are on teh hook. The brokers would then need to sell off their stock to try to meet the cover obligation, and, when the couldnt, they would have gone bankrupt too. But then the clearinghouses would have been on the hook. I doubt the clearing houses have much collateral of their own, but, by that point the entire system has been disrupted and key critical segments of the market have been interrupted. Companies that provide liquidity may have gone bankrupt and hte market would have been in complete turmoil. 

It wasn't unreasonable to believe this in January before they conspired to block buying on GME. If they didn't conspire to block buying, it might have actually happened."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Your ideals are correct ill end with...the stock market is not the economy as a poster above me said
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,We are def tanking the market but it is def a good thing.  Fulfilling the prophecy of revelations.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Too long and a skimmed. Saw some good points. Retail is involved but if the market tanks over GameStop it is not because retail is buying. There’s much bigger money at play. Even big money buying wouldn’t cause this ripple if hedges weren’t over shorted and got caught. Fault is on the shorts.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can understand why the media would say this since they’re the propaganda wing of the highest bidder, fake news isn’t a meme, it just takes people awhile to realize it when it effects them.

What I don’t understand is the public being upset at the little guys because of mistakes the big guys made, had they not done what they did they wouldn’t have to ruin the economy to pay for it."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Woke is past tense sir. We be “aware”.

I lost my job in the early COVID days and panicked because it took roughly 8 months to get a new one. Unemployment and stimulus checks didn't come close to being enough to pay my bills. I had to use the Cares Act to pull money from my 401k.

The 2008 crisis and the Great Depression are other examples. In both of these cases, the unemployment rates were high."

That was/is a possibility because GME was shorted beyond what should be allowed and has nothing to do with people on WSB.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry to read about your ordeal. I hope things will turn/have turned around for you.

And yes, the economy does (should) impact the stock market but not necessarily directly or 1:1 (in your example, and I know not everyone can afford this, but the goal is to have 6-12 months of living expenses readily available for these types of situations that you don't have to sell stock and even less so tap into your retirement). The other way around is even less correlated beyond potentially a ""feeling"" of losing money.

If I keep my job and I'm not going to retire for another 10, 15, 20 years or more, even a 50% drop in the market has no direct impact on my day to day life. (besides if I have money tied in stocks that I need now for a car, house, etc...bit in that case I should have taken already a good chunk out of the market months before)."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets," People who doesn't know English very well is under threat of many scammer. There are people thinking WSB is one collective mind and wants to join the game. Yeah, most of us like GME and I like GME too. However, we don't have power to manipulate the stock market like media seem to portrait. Most of us just wants to take the gain and go. I've seen some outrageous Korean guys who claim that they are on the same team with WSB guys on the reddit and has connection with some kind of ""team"" asking for money to join discord or some other SNS app group chat. They are promising gains and they say they got all the information. Those guys are fucking scumbags who wants to take advantage of your smooth brain. Be careful fellow autist/retards/apes. Don't be special type of autist and cry later, then blame everything on WSB. This is place for meme and loss and gain porn. I come here for weird emotional comfort seeing high quality memes, gain porn, and loss porn. This place isn't for the financial advice. This is place for diamond hands (retards) who take high risk for high rewards with no guaranteed money."

Sell high, buy low.

I reckon the hedges have more fuel in the tank to drop the price below $200 again.

I hope they do.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh I had some real fun with one one day. Had him on phone for almost 4 hours. So he calls gives the usual speech about how. I owe money and if not paid he will call local authorities to arrest me. Well I fake panick “oh my gosh please don’t do that how much do I owe?”. After hearing the amount I explain I need to run to the bank and deposit the money, he says I must stay on the line the whole time if the call is disconnected he will alert the authorities. So I say ok and put him on how while I “drive to the bank”. I get there and have to inform him I left my wallet at home in my rush to make the payment which is followed with a half hour fake drive both ways. This fucker is still on the line! So I tell him ok I’m at bank and making the deposit, another 20 or so minutes go buy and I say I have deposited X amount of money which was less than what he told me the fee was. This guy starts freaking out, “No no no! I told you blah blah blah amount!” Me- “ oh my gosh I’m so sorry! Let me run home and get the rest of it!” About another hour or so later, I get back on and tell him it is deposited and ask where I should send it. I get all the information he will give me to send the payment, then I ask him ok and what is your name, and information for when I give this all to the cops for fraud? This dick had the balls to start yelling at me and calling me an asshole for waisting his time! Man was I glad I was off work that day."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"[This guy](https://youtu.be/f-j12NvUwhw) has a whole playlist of scammers he's trolling, including from the ""I.R.S"", so the scammers waste their time on him instead of scamming old people.

Bring me my hearing aids’ (after 20 minutes) then letting my female coworker in on the fun by letting her pretend she was a young child on the phone and the ‘I can play you my favourite song with the phone buttons’ beep beep boop beep...until they hung up."

Thank God that guy called me.  He explained things and the tax preparer was wrong.  I had received letters as well prior to the call so it wasn’t completely out if the blue.  Be careful, be suspicious, always."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Set Limit orders my dude
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,*this is the way*
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"No. It’s a 1.5% fee on currency exchange. So it’s free to trade stocks on a Canadian exchange, but buying US stocks is 1.5%. And obviously you pay it in both directions, so it’s ~3% to buy and sell a stock. 

That’s a bad deal compared to a $5 transaction fee if you’re moving thousands, but when you just have a few hundred to play with it works out cheaper."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thier limit order buy has big delay. I missed my buy on AC at 25.6 when checking live price...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"My problem about it is that I can't hold US dollars... so if I want to sell the stock at high and buy it again when dip I need to pay that 3% again.

My wealthsimple now trading Canada stocks only, and interactivebrokers for US stocks and options."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I’m real new to this but I realized the same thing. You’d need a USD account to really get into day trading. 

That said, most brokers charge $5+ per transaction. So buying and selling $500 of stock on Wealthsimple is $15 versus $10+. Whereas buying and selling $200 worth of stock would be $6 versus $10+. So if you’re making transactions that are under $300 I think Wealthsimple is cheaper. And that flips once you start doing trades of $400 up.

But IB or Questrade give you a USD trading account?"
2021-03-13 03:30:34,wallstreetbets,"Exponential growth - $8k+ minimum Remember the squeeze in January that would've ran up to $1k+? (confirmed by Interactive Brokers CEO). And that $500 ceiling is where we need to break through to trigger exponents such as Gamma -> Shorts covered.

There was an AI program predicting 100k+ full squeeze at 140% SI. This is the power of exponential growth - However this program is heavily extrapolated and doesn't take into account external factors such as Prisoners dilemma, there are also many probable flaws in the script.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c48lf6xt7pm61.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=a78f9b7ae232a35306788a436fd446eb673ddb23

 Let's do some simple maths (correct me if i'm wrong i'm trash at maths), We have a ""realistic SI of 600%, a difference of 460% or 4.6x) now lets interpolate the squeeze from January; $148 -> $347 -> $483 -> $1k+ (likely would've been higher), now lets extrapolate our current situation $265 -> $ 621.3 (\[347/148\]x265) -> $864.8 (\[483/347x621.3) -> $1790+ (\[1,000/483\]x864x8). Now lets take into account the 4.6x short interest - 1790x4.6 = $8234+. Take this with a grain of salt. This calculation (like the AI model) is heavily extrapolated and does not take into account the situations present during the squeeze in January such as the 9 figure volume that drove GME up + Gamma squeeze we may or may not have the same factors in the same squeeze today. However what I can say for certain is that this squeeze will be LARGER than the one in January due to real SI being 600+% (remember exponential growth - the higher the SI the even greater the price)."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What if the SI is only 200%
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This AI model was commented on when it first popped up a month or so ago. 

Some machine learning folk explained that you can’t extrapolate any information from it. The only thing the AI validated is that there was so much volatility with the stock that the AI was predicting that there was as much likelihood of it going 100k+ as there was it going 0. 

Someone smarter than me can likely explain it better - but that hard red line at the bottom essentially was showing that the model was throwing its hand up and saying “Fuck if I know”."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shut up, pussy. One good options trade >>>>> long GME.

Speaking of philosophy and psychology. There is a familiarity bias and fear of the unknown driving the retail support of tech despite dot com bubble multiples. So many people go out and buy tech stocks because “finance and energy are boomer stocks” but the reality is, since tucking October many of these names are up 2-4x. Shit CBS Viacom is a 10-bagger YTD I think. The issue is, most retail traders only know NVDA and SNAP and they don’t know how to pick a good cap markets and IB stock or E&P oil extractor.


The same thing happens with GME. So many retarded “apes are familiar with it and they just keep buying” the problem is, realistically, it’s worth like 20 bucks. You’re only cushion is that other aPeS are long. Many of you bought in protest and you make stupid ass posts like this acting like those who sold at 50 missed out and will never get another chance at something like this again.

I accidentally held some calls into UPWK ER in Q4 and I made like 700% overnight. I’m holding JEF stock and calls for less than 3 weeks and I’m up over 100% with a valuation margin of safety too. I bought PINS last year at $15.

I hope you get your squeeze. But you’re a clown thinking it’s the only racket in the market or that it’s “more upside than downside”."

The stock is worth at most $50. Could the e-commerce business get a 10x sales multiple? Sure, but it’s not just e-commerce, it needs of SOTP multiple, like Disney v Netflix. You haven’t different margins for the retail business in the best of times and that’s dying.

You have to buy out of all the mall leases and you need to be well capitalized enough to invest in the architecture required to support a transition to e-commerce and a supply chain to meet deliveries. Not to mention sales and market.

2021-03-13 03:23:28,wallstreetbets,"$HRB H&R Block - Buy some leaps (Part 2) Last month I wrote a post on why I'm buying $HRB leaps ([Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llok83/hrb_hr_block_buy_some_leaps_and_forget_about_em/)). My main reasons were: 

1. Pivot from brick & mortar to digital which could lead to higher sales multiples
2. Their $3.5b stock buyback program which still has $600m to go and will run through June 2022 (for reference: their current market cap is $3.84b)

Today, H&R Block announced 4 new Vice Presidents that will help drive the next phase of growth for the company. Among them are:

Karisa Booker, who previously led a complete consumer data transformation of AMC's marketing

Scott Runkel, who was head of product at Walmart and led the team responsible for ""defining quality standards for digital products."" 

These appointments reaffirm H&R Block's commitment to a digital transformation.

In addition to pivoting to digital, I believe that HRB's new focus on small businesses will greatly improve its bottom line. Some of you might wonder, there over 200 million tax paying individuals in the USA but merely 30 million small businesses, why should they focus on small businesses?

I think the answer is quite simple: most **individuals only file their taxes once a year,** and there are plenty of free do-it-yourself options for them. On the other hand, **businesses pay taxes year-round.** Payroll, sales tax, income tax, bookkeeping, many of which will require services that could generate more revenue compared to individuals doing their income tax one time a year.

HRB is expected to bring in $3.55b of revenue in 2021. Currently, it has a PS ratio of **1.42**, compared to their competitor Intuit (TurboTax)'s **13.65**. Intuit Inc ($INTU) trades at $395 with a market cap of over $108b. There's no doubt in my mind that the upside will be tremendous if HRB can successfully pull off the transformation. 

HRB released earnings on March 8th and reported a -$1.17 EPS for the quarter, beating the consensus estimate of -$1.29. The call transcript can be found [here](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/03/09/hr-block-hrb-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcript/).

Fun Fact: HRB's CEO Jeff Jones was briefly the President of UBER in 2017 but quit during the #DeleteUber movement which took aim at the company's gender bias and toxic culture in the workplace. Jeff cited ""differences over beliefs and approach to leadership"" as his reason for resigning. Four years later, under Jeff's leadership, HRB scored 100% on the Corporate Equality Index and is recognized as one of ""Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality.""

Used unrealized GME gains to adopt a gorilla. [Also got a video.](https://gorillafund.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/urn.mp4?eType=CommSeriesComponent&eId=3a22d556-b96d-4e1b-9f1a-a7dbf2499970)

EDIT: This Gorilla species is called the Mountain Gorilla, they are an **endangered species** due to:

* Poaching: gorillas can be worth $thousands on black markets.

* Disease: transmitted by human-gorilla or livestock-gorilla.

* War: Countries in Central Africa, Uganda/Rwanda/DRC are in various stages of stability to instability.

* Encroaching by human populations: due to poverty, logging, and preemptive hunting by locals to ward off ""threats"".

Due to conservation and education efforts it is estimated that the Mountain gorillas population has rebounded to a little over 1,000.

#**EDIT 2: Please stop giving this post rewards as much as I appreciate them, there are MANY MANY wonderful charities and organizations that can use even $1 in donations.**

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This looks suspiciously like the other gorilla that was adopted. Could this be a Robinhood Vlad / DFV situation?? Has anyone seen these two gorillas in the same room??

I visited refugee camps with him, we sat down during the rewriting of the Rwandan constitution. A female judge changed my life that day. I think I was around 14 years old. She changed my life. They were discussing the law around making polygamy illegal. And the Supreme Court Judge told us the story of how she met with a man's second wife who was pro-polygamy. The fact that there was a first wife allowed her to continue her studies and move forward in life. And to disallow the marriage was having someone else apply morals to her situation. The Supreme Court Judge explained how much of a great responsibility making these decisions were.

So you're an amazing person for this. May tendies fall from the sky.

May we rise up together throughout this mess. I think the boomers need to step aside and let us handle it now."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I definitely agree with your concern that we shouldn’t collectively waste money on awards that have no meaningful purpose, I see a clear upside here — in this case, all of these awards have driven this post to the top of the list and made it visible to A LOT of eyeballs. 

For me, I started browsing the foundation and reading abt adopting wildlife for the last 20 mins because of your post, something I previously never would have even considered as a charity option of interest. Given how popular this sub is, imagine how many traditional advertising dollars (billboard,online, print, you name it) would have to be spent to raise the same level of awareness! I’d bet the amount of charitable activity that’s going to be driven (or already could have occurred) by this post alone makes the tiny resources spent on the awards literally irrelevant by comparison. 

Plus it feels good right? Ya did a good job fellow ape!! 🦍🤝🦍"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So they’re endangered because of us.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The video made me tear up a bit. Buying more GME on Monday to restore my manhood.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,blessed video OP. Also the OP pic looks like a hyperrealistic doll of a baby gorilla lol

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The great ape population in the wild will be exterminated in the next few decades. Let that sink in. No more of these beautiful animals thanks to barbaric humans. I propose we start an ape conservation park in South America because it can be more easily controlled and kept safe by those of us in the US versus the apes natural habitat in Africa and Southeast Asia. The apes will thrive in a jungle habitat created to mimic their natural home areas. The only other option is to hire like 3000 park rangers to patrol these great ape sanctuaries in Africa. That would be another viable charity and the people would be paid like under $5 a day probably not costing us much.

Lastly, I LIKE THE STOCK"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What places are these that you’ve used where they send actual updates and photos? I would certainly do this but I’m always concerned my donation isn’t actuallyyyy doing anything. Pays for some administrator to sit at the desk. And people suffer. I think this about most large charities to be honest. I tend to give to small ones where I “trust” them versus something like Greenpeace or ASPCA or whatever. Don’t trust them to do anything.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I noticed we all noticed wonderful charitable events on u/wallstreetbets. People paying for their dog's surgery, sister's medicine, student loans, gifts for children's hospitals, paying a kid's school lunch bill.

I kinda wanted to raise attention to endangered wildlife and environment cause.

There are great and wonderful causes around the world and close to home. Whether it's the homeless guy asking for a quarter at the stop light, buying your 5th grade teacher some school supplies for the year, or buying a handmade bracelet from a woman in Laos.

As long as you give back in an effort to make something good even for a second it's worth the cost."

2021-03-13 03:16:38,wallstreetbets,"QFIN - DD - Big Banana Play - Earnings on 3/15 *Join me on this rocket ship named QFIN.*  🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 
____________
**EDIT: Many people have brought up concern that this stock has already tripled and might be played out. I strongly disagree - from a valuation standpoint it is still an amazing buy. It wasn’t the cash flow or loan quality keeping the price down - it was the regulatory risk. As that risk diminishes it will grow to reach it’s fair valuation, which is around 50 using even a conservative growth rate in a conservative FCFE. The real risk is new regulations, or a bigger impact of the current ones, hence why I spent most of this DD talking about them. Right now the market is pricing in regulations wiping out about half of their revenue sources, which I strongly disagree with.

The earnings call is Monday at 9PM EST, which is Tuesday morning for QFIN in China. The numbers will be interesting but the real catalyst will be management’s discussion of the impact of regulations. Make sure to place all bets by then!**
______________

I have ventured out of my usual territory in my hunt for an exotic rocket ship-shaped banana, and I’ve got good news for all ape-kind: I’ve found one. Here’s my DD (whatever that means). 

Ticker: **QFIN**, AKA ""360 Digitech"". They are a Chinese Fintech company. Currently trading around $31.50. Market Cap is around 4.8 Billion. Very few people in America have heard of them. PE is less than 10, growth is insane, plenty of cash on the balance sheet, low leverage, etc. From a fundamentals or cashflow analysis, this is a banana mine. 

**Here's their business model:**

*First*, they use their online presence to advertise loans to the rapidly-growing Chinese middle class.

*Second*, they use their proprietary risk-assessment tools to analyze the credit-worthiness of the applicants. They also have proprietary identification tools to help prevent fraud and simultaneously speed up the loan process (this is a bigger deal than it sounds like due to the strong desire for convenience in lending) 

*Third*, they partner with banks to supply the capital for the loans. 

*Fourth,* they service the loans and deal with recovery in case of defaults.

The business model is important because in order to understand why this is an amazing buy you also need to understand where their revenue comes from. It's not just loan interest as you would expect.

**But first, let’s talk numbers.** 2017 Revenue: *175 million* 2018 Revenue: *3.75 Billion* 2019 Revenue: *6.99 Billion* TTM: *9.19 Billion* (TTM means trailing twelve months)

Obviously that’s insane growth. Most apes can’t even count that high. 

And yet, despite that growth, their P/E ratio is a measly **9.4!** *(P/E is a measure of how high up tree us apes must climb to reach banana, lower number = banana more soon)* **That’s less than half the P/E of the S&P 500** *(P/E: 27.5*), **despite having significantly more growth.** 

To understand why the stock is still so cheap, let’s talk about why dumb apes might *NOT* want to buy it. 

Firstly, I assume most of you haven’t bought it yet because you have never heard of it. Do a search for QFIN on reddit – it’s next to impossible to find mention of it here. Furthermore, the trading volume is extremely low…. And most of the ownership is institutional. A few hedge funds, sure, but mostly ETFs, which is exactly what’s caused this great buying opportunity. As most Chinese Fintech stock prices have struggled lately with regulations (with the exception of this week), QFIN is relatively immune from the changes. QFIN has only gone down because most of the ownership is through the sector ETFs, which have been dragging QFIN down with them. Only recently did it buck the trend and move away from its sector's performance, in large part because people are just now starting to notice it.

This is a misunderstood company with obvious value. The play here isn’t that there’s extra value - the value is obvious to everyone - the play is that the “problems” are being significantly exaggerated and misunderstood… so rather than tell you where the deep value is, I will instead focus on why the doubters are wrong and why QFIN is uniquely placed in its sector. 

**First Reason for Doubt – Winnie the Pooh.** The Chinese Fintech industry has recently been slapped with some extra regulations that I had to get my mandarin-speaking wife to translate for me. 

One regulation is that for microlending transactions involving banks and partners, the partners (in this case, QFIN) must contribute at least 25% of the capital. Here’s a breakdown of the rules: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-20/china-imposes-further-caps-on-online-lending-amid-clampdown](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-20/china-imposes-further-caps-on-online-lending-amid-clampdown). *The stock tanked 30% when this happened.*

**Why it doesn’t matter:** According to QFIN’s CEO, Wu “Cock Slapper” Haisheng, *“Currently, the outstanding balance of the outstanding loans issued through our micro lending subsidiary, accounts for less than 1% of the total loan balance, and joint lending accounts for around 0.01%. Therefore, based on our personal evaluation, the new rules will have little impact on our loan origination business.”* 

Another new regulation is that online lending can only be done with banks that are established in the same province as the applicant. This is no problem – QFIN has a multitude of partners in each region. There are other new regulations coming down the pipeline (capital requirements, etc) but QFIN is well capitalized and capable of overcoming all the known issues. 

**Second Reason for Doubt – Default Risk.** There is concern that the loan default rate will be high, especially if China’s economy crashes, and that this will destroy the value of the company similarly to what happened to US banks with bad mortgages in 2008.

**Why it doesn’t matter:** First of all, *sack up.* 

Now that we’ve covered that primary reason, the fact of the matter is that default risk will always be a thing for banks. But QFIN isn’t a bank. *(Actually, they technically do have a banking charter in case they have to become one for due to new regulations, but they aren't currently using it.)* Remember their business model I mentioned earlier? 

*Now consider this:* 

Remember that 9.9 billion revenue for the trailing twelve months? Of that 9.9 billion, 2.3 billion is interest income. *(600mm interest expense).* Meanwhile, **they’re receiving 8 billion in service revenue**. (source: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QFIN/financials?p=QFIN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QFIN/financials?p=QFIN)) They’re bringing in far more money from loan origination commissions and the SaaS fees for their credit analysis than they’re bringing in from actual interest income. In other words, they aren’t a bank. What’s even more important is that QFIN literally does have the best proprietary software, as evidenced by the default rates of their loans. Compare QFIN’s loans defaults to FINV’s, who shot up *90%* yesterday after their earnings call. Go to slide 17: [https://ir.360shuke.com/static-files/6ffd9815-c5d3-478e-81df-0f4b3eb1ad0f](https://ir.360shuke.com/static-files/6ffd9815-c5d3-478e-81df-0f4b3eb1ad0f) 

If you’re too lazy to click the link, the TL DR is that QFIN’s historical defaults for every tranche is significantly lower. 

Another facet to consider is that even if their interest income does drop significantly, their operating margin is strong and, more importantly, improving. Despite their revenue increasing significantly, “Total operating expenses, excluding provisions were roughly flat Q-on-Q but decreased 33% year-on-year. The year-on-year decline mainly reflects significant improvement in operational efficiency” – CFO Alex “Oh God Please No Not My Face” Xu 

**Third Reason for Doubt – uNaUdiTeD fInAnCiALs**

OK so this is the best criticism the bears have. It’s also the most nebulous. 

A few things to think about: 

This is a Chinese company with Chinese consumer loans on their balance sheet. The QFIN ticker is an ADR. I’m not an accountant, but AFAIK all of the Chinese fintech companies without a US presence use unaudited financials. I don’t think it’s that weird. 

Speaking of accounting, QFIN has a history of overestimating expected losses. *In other words, they used pessimistic estimates that make their financials look worse than they really are.* Back in 2Q2020, Chinese regulators slapped a cap on the interest rate of internet-sourced loans. Some of QFIN’s loans at the time were above that rate, meaning they were impacted. An unscrupulous CFO would not have marked down the loans in anticipation of a decrease in value due to the new, lower interest they would be receiving*. QFIN did the opposite – they devalued the loans by too much* (mostly because they overestimated the default rate). “...the high take rate for capital-light model in the third quarter, maybe partially contributed to a reversal of the charge in the second quarter.” – Ethan “Prolapse King” Wang, paraphrasing something the CFO took two minutes to explain when asked why the loans were doing better than anticipated after being devalued.

**What risks are there still?**

First and foremost, macroeconomic risks. As the Chinese consumer fares, so does QFIN. I view this as a good thing, not a bad one, but it does constitute a risk. Additional regulation from Winnie-The-Pooh represents a risk too, but it looks like, for now, that storm has mostly passed. My take is that the Chinese regulators seemed to have a hard on for fucking up Ant Group – a spinoff of Alibaba. Jack “Actual Vampire” Ma had mouthed off publicly about regulations and so the CCP went after him with even more regulations after disappearing the guy for a month. Ant Group focuses more on microlending, but QFIN’s stock, as another Chinese Fintech company, got dragged down by the bears despite not really being affected. Ant group is finally approved for their IPO, so it looks like Winnie’s red rocket for regulation is rapidly retracting.

**Any big banana showers coming soon?** YES! **Earnings call on 3/15!** QFIN has a history of smashing earnings estimates. If QFIN has even half the success of FINV, who went up 90% on the day of their earnings call, then it’ll be bananas for everyone. Apes taking a rocket ship to banana planet. 

If you still aren’t convinced just look at the fucking fundamentals you god damn baboon. 

TLDR: I like the stock. 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 

*This is obviously not financial advice.*

*Positions: long 15 QFIN 3/19 calls 35 strike, and long 500 shares (cost basis $27.48)*

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Great DD. Could be my next YOLO play. Any near term catalysts?

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I saw this ticker mentioned after the first gme crash, bought a couple and never saw it mentioned again. It recently went green again."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Like this 

Very similar to FINV , never heard of this company before and even after the 100% increase last week the fundamentals look good. 

I immediately searched for similar companies and found another one I liked, the market cap is below 1bn so not allowed on here but it’s cheap and has ER the week after next.
I bought shares and options on this play.

Will look to get into this Monday morning."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You lost me at “Chinese”
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yolo?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,never thought i'd see them come up here. i got in at $16 when i fished it from my screener. still highly undervalued imo
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Started looking into it’s financials, looks insanely good to me. RSI over 70 and negative FCF is kinda spooky, but considering the how low the P/E is I’m in"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"My boss actually just told me about this earlier in the week and I loaded up. 

He told me he was jacked to the tits in October on SBNY. Picked up a bunch of 3/19 160c that saw insane growth so let’s go 2/2.

See you on the moon!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Added an edit: Many people have brought up concern that this stock has already tripled and might be played out. I strongly disagree - from a valuation standpoint it is still an amazing buy. It wasn’t the cash flow or loan quality keeping the price down - it was the regulatory risk. As that risk diminishes it will grow to reach it’s fair valuation, which is around 50 using even a conservative growth rate in a conservative FCFE. The real risk is new regulations, or a bigger impact of the current ones, hence why I spent most of this DD talking about them.  Right now the market is pricing in regulations wiping out about half of their revenue sources, which I strongly disagree with. 

The earnings call is Monday at 9PM EST, which is Tuesday morning for QFIN in China. The numbers will be interesting but the real catalyst will be management’s discussion of the impact of regulations.  Make sure to place all bets by then!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thats a great point, but the fact is that the P/E is still less than 10 and their loan origination rate has grown in line with, if not faster than, their stock price

It was undervalued a year ago. Their revenue shot up, and so did their stock price, and the regulations everyone was afraid of happened.  But theyre still super undervalued because the price raise hasn't fully captured the coinciding rise of revenue / loan origination / decreased future regulatory risk of the company.

**If banana tree price triples, but banana tree now makes 4x as many bananas, banana tree still a good buy!**

P/E is less than 10, after all."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know OP answered this, but think about this stock and others like this. Even if a stock 5xs in a year, if their revenue, manufacturing capabilities, or more importantly earnings did the same, then the price really just kept up with growth even though it looks overweight from the outset if you didnt do dd"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the earnings call on Monday.  The numbers will be important but what’s even more important will be the verbal discussion from management on the impact (or lack thereof) of regulations."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey I just want to say that while I love this stock, I don’t know that it’s a YOLO stock.  I’m very confident in this DD, but it’s a DD based primarily on forecasting regulation.  The stock’s value is obvious and seen by everyone - it’s the negative impact of regulation that has been keeping it down.

Thing is, I’m confident that I’m right.  But with regulation, unlike with hidden value, there’s no way to be *yolo* confident.  Governments are just too fundamentally unpredictable."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s around when I found it - I sold GME before the crash at 245 (bought at 45) and used some of the proceeds to buy into this.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you pm the ticker? Wanna check it out
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If this earnings pops hard and brings PE to 15+ I might realize earnings and then jump ship to another fintech company that might still have a regulation surprise. The trick is finding companies about which there is enough information on the loan type / quality to anticipate the regulatory impact ahead of the call. The actual micro lenders are probably fucked.  What I see happening is the companies that don’t do that will skyrocket and the companies that do will crash. For now they’ve all been moving together, but they’ll continue to split (as FINV did) as we get more color from management on these earnings calls."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm sure their Financials are fully 'audited' and true....... so says my drunken garden gnome...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ve got about 10% of my portfolio in this. It’s my favorite play but I’m not going to YOLO against Chinese financial regulators. Fundamentally unpredictable.  If it was a question of missed value, then maybe.. but this is a play based on the market overestimating the impact of the fintech regulations on this stock. I’m confident, but I know that with this type of bet it’s impossible to be *that* confident."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Negative FCF is spooky! I didn’t want to write that kind of stuff here because it is a bit out of scope for WSB lol.. but you’re right.  That’s why I’m glad that their operational efficiency is improving and I’m glad that they have significant cash on hand.

RSI is an indicator I’ve never paid much attention to. I’ve always been more of a fundamentals guy. Can you elaborate a bit on why that worries you?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That is crazy deep. How insane would it be if it actually hits. I love your balls.

IMO this is a value buy where the value is suppressed by regulation rather than by people not seeing it. 160 seems too unlikely imo unless there’s insane growth.  I could see 90 at the high end *if* all regulatory concerns are completely cleared up, but that’s not something that’s ever *completely* cleared up.

Regardless, Godspeed to both you and your boss! See you on the moon."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It was a great critique and it was the first thing that went through my head when i first found the stock. 

I've come to understand that it's the regulatory risk that's really keeping the stock undervalued - that and the fact that not many people know about it."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What options did you pick?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Keep in mind that china’s central bank isn’t nearly as active as the US fed.  That’s helping to drive some of the disparity we’ve seen - Chinese equities started dropping as soon as their bank turned the faucet off.  Thankfully there’s still good value there.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly. this is a play based on the market overestimating the impact of the fintech regulations on this stock - management discussion of regulatory impact will be more important than the actual numbers.  That’s why it’s so cheap right now even though it’s gone up so much so far this year.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ya the regulatory thing is suppressing a lot of Chinese stocks right now
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have stocks and calls:   4/16 5C  
They were 0.84p

Was looking at their Sec filings, their cash to market cap is about 0.8 which is incredibly high and they are profitable.
If this was an American company they would be trading multiple times higher.

On their last few earnings releases there was no questions asked. They are totally under the radar.

Also noted in June 2020 they introduced a share incentive plan. Everything reads this is a long term play.
The biggest risk is China government and if the whole economy crashes. 

https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-099786/#a20-29780_1ex99d1.htm

What this company needs to do is sell itself more to the market. Maybe it’s not the Chinese way but American companies are all over the investor marketing."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Just look at BABA - it’s should be trading at least 25-50% higher.

2021-03-13 02:49:03,wallstreetbets,"Simplying Law DD series - NSCC rule 18 and GME Alright my first DD hit well, but I've got the impression all those after it are essentially not plain enough. I'm going to try and take a different approach and simplify as much as possible.

Not financial or legal advice, any assumptions drawn are your own, hell I might and probably am wrong on things (have been before) and if I am, do your part - please tell me and I'll update.

This will be the first in a series and we'll start with a simplified DD on Rule 18 of the NSCC rules, as this forms part of the 'disorderly market' rule spotted where people are afraid the NSCC and friends will just sit back and let the 'participants' mess with trying to prevent the MOASS, ironically, for fear of creating a disorderly market their members already made.

I mean we know they've already done that with GME as other excellent DD shows, but let's get into it.

Rule 18. This rule applies **only** when the NSCC declines / ceases to act for a 'participant'. OK great but what does that mean and what causes this?

The rule states the NSCC will cease to act should a participant become a Defaulting Member, or undergo a Defaulting Event. i.e. the NSCC determines that member either can't settle a trade based on their funds or made a really stupid decision or multiple decisions on a trade or actions involved in it. This means guess what? We block your access in the market and control your portfolio until it's resolved using this rule.

The list of who this affects is looong. Pretty much anyone with a relationship to the NSCC. For ease for us apes, this affects entities such as Citadel (member). Anyone can apply as any kind of member though, provided they are FATCA certified and have a Cybersecurity confirmation and get approved (i.e. many more than you might think).

Side note: those we suspect are responsible for GME are still members. They might have gone through a Defaulting Event (January?), but as they aren't insolvent and are active in the market, it's safe to assume these rules aren't in play. Even if they get kicked out, this isn't FUD relating to payment if the market goes crazy, more on this later.

Onto the rule. So the NSCC thinks you fucked up or you did, or both and you're either a dreaded Default Member / went through a Defaulting Event. What now? 

Unless the NSCC board says otherwise, on their notice being delivered, any CNS trade, Balance Order trade, Special Trade or Foreign trade, Long or Short position(s) for an OW Obligation that was entered for a CNS Accounting Operation, any cash relating to an OW adjustment and uncompleted cash ACATS transaction are the fuck up's responsibility.

*Special mention: fuck Special Trades. Literally defined as security trades between members only and it's allowed. Ripe for manipulation if you ask me.*

I know what you're thinking. What does any of that mean?

The thing about legal documents, they'll make up a bunch of definitions on the first page, which then refer you to many different pages to explain a definition. Then they expect you know what they're talking about 100 pages later to bore your ass into not looking it up.

Fortunately, I have nothing better to do. Or maybe I do, but I'm a retard. For ape understanding, this is basically saying anything you're on the hook for the moment our letter of bye bye is delivered, you're responsible for.

Oh no, does this mean they won't pay for the GME squeeze? **Nope.**

Put simply, this is the NSCC's way of clawing back as much money from that member's fuck up as possible before paying the remainder of what they can't liquidate from them first. 

It also states any net loss will be debited to the member, meaning they pay it first in accordance with their rules and get whatever they can when they're liquidated. Not only that, any sums due to the stupid member from other members will also be used to close them out.

*This makes the SLD filing that much more pronounced in my view, as they think even this risk isn't enough to stop members making stupid decisions.*

For instance, all the following rules gives the NSCC the right to take control of that member's entire NSCC and friends holdings to sort things out. 

The rule also states they will focus on settlement, not profit or loss. The **only** reason they will not just fire sell / buy is if they think it's related to fraud; or would cause a disorderly market to genuine market participants. 

What I think they mean by this is imagine Blackrock took out an uncharacteristic fat risky short position which dived, and then suddenly the NSCC liquidated their GME position on the bid and the stock tanked before the squeeze and allowed shorters to cover at low prices due to the low volume. 

You'd be furious as you were affected by some third parties stupid decision. That's why they allow it at their **discretion** instead. They'll probably buy the shorts or sell the longs at some point, but they also don't want to cause a crash / surge in any stock.

Let's face it, at this stage a risky, double, tripled etc down short position in GME would likely cause the NSCC to buy at any price, as they'd see what's coming and was only ever being delayed by their members if they hold this position, as they continue to eat billions in interest. 

Pulling the band aid off quickly may be the better approach if you don't face the risk of becoming insolvent and the loss is theoretically infinite.

The rule therefore has no impact on the NSCC stepping in and causing / preventing the squeeze for GME. If anything, if a member triggers this rule I'd argue it helps it.

TLDT: this rule is like the NSCC's version of an intervention for that loved one you know is a gambling addict. You take away their cards and cash, sell their damn car if you need to and collect owed money from their 'friends', and pay off the rest yourself until you get them paid off. Then, you never let them into the casino again.

Edit: not even removing the TLDT mistake or the misspelling of simplifying as it shows I belong here"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for siphoning through all of it.  I had a question about the SECs rule implementation.

From what I’ve seen, they have up to 10 days to file a federal release and then up to 45 days to implement that rule correct?  I’ve also seen in some of the federal releases that it can be effective immediately as well.

What’s your stance on proposed rules?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,thanks homie!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think this is the feds way of nipping inflation.  

We’ll write stimmy checks all day for the citizens, but we’re deleveraging the banks by cutting up their credit cards.

It can potentially cause massive damage to the economy short term, but hedge against inflation in the long term."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only problem, the nscc and by extension the dtcc, ARE NOT BUYING SHARES. They are facilitating the movement. Each clearing member (the big boys) has a 1bb line for default ( last I remember) last used in 2008 when Lehman went down. This means if they need money to clear everything out they pull those lines first."

Edit: for those reading, the insurance policy is the line of credit the dtcc can pull in case of a members collapse, and then some for independent insurance.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So don’t read them a-hole. Simple fix. Yet you continue to lurk. GTFO of here if you don’t like it.   But wait you cant, because you have an agenda clearly. I hate golf. I don’t go on golf Reddit forums and comment. Yet you do with this. Move on BRO"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah here [https://www.dtcc.com/annuals/2019/financial-performance/](https://www.dtcc.com/annuals/2019/financial-performance/), from 2019. Scroll 2 to the right. They cleared more than 1 quadrillion in assets in 2019. This is the key distinction that everyone mixes up. The DTCC (NSCC, FICC and all the subs) don't actually own quadrillions they just facilitate the movement. Actual assets and money on hand is in the billions.

This is why when people say ""the fed is just going to print more money to save the shorts via the DTC"" it doesn't make any sense.

Also the point on billions for ""insurance"" that's what i was getting at. In order to be a member that participates, you have to post money, and if you're a big member, you're liable for a line of credit to the tune of 1bb in case of failure (this number is way old may have changed in the last few years)"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you're doing such long term investments, why not simply buy shares? At the current price 90k would get you very juicy tendies in 22 with 0 risks. I guess I'm too retarded"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,there's still a chance that they become 0 by the way.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"claims he isn't doing that ""shares"" shit.

buys leaps.

fucking lol."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I learned not to go full retard.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,LOL I’m fucking dead LOL
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Sucker’s bet in slow motion
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed. It’s achievable.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Palantards united!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"OP is betting the price will be 30$ by jan 2022 and 2023.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Because LEAPs will make him more money.  PLTR LEAPs are a gift from the tendie man right now.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Your brain is too wrinkly for this sub
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Don’t blame ya. Lol. I went full boomer and went in heavily on shares. I don’t even belong here anymore. I should be over at r/investing at this point.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You did the right thing, brush off the comments all the way to the bank"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,If one is gonna yolo... u gotta at least do leaps...Smart decision they should def print in coming months 💪🏾💪🏾
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Smart 🦍
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Robert Downey Jr provides.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Like I wanna gambool like an 🦍 but secretly im a 🙀
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So OP is a pussy.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy shares
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel like that's an even bigger gambboool edit: you might die before those leaps expire and ill be damned if an estate attorney is gonna figure out that mess
2021-03-13 02:43:38,wallstreetbets,ouch we hit top 4 
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmfao who shorted Moderna during a pandemic?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m pretty sure GME short sale losses are a lot higher than this. 

Edit: S3 partners is showing $6.79 B in GME short sale losses as of today"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Those numbers aren’t right lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What an incorrect chart lol. They need to fix this garbage. We beat out tesla for sure.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets, Wall street taking such huge losses on GME they're gonna start lobbying Biden to reopen the US so we can go out and stop harassing them
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Tesla is down 5% ytd. What sort of nonsense is this
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This seems low on the GME unless the articles I've been seeing are way off
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well the tesla is us too, pre gme."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I didn’t hear no bell
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wtf is a bilibili
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I've owned puts on half of the companies on this list within the last year. Pour one out for the poor gay bears like me.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can’t lose if you never sell!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought this was similar to Volkswagon. Why isn't it on the list?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Plug Power? That price looks mighty appetizing!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ouch? Fuck 🌈🐻
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn they still shorting Tesla
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is also just what is reported.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The OG TSLA stands proud.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,We'll be first a month after it ends lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been shouting VIACA for days yet no one listens. The company goes parabolic and they earn billions per quarter, not even yearly. It's Warren's new go-to company and it has new tremendous contracts. This stock when to stratosphere, 60% monthly, 340% yearly, volume? Only 110k average, you people are sleeping on this, sleeping hard."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Since there is bilibili

The meme game on that site is strong. Lots of fantastic agk/ kbc videos and hitler/ sailor moon crossovers and stuff.

Definitely a buy in my book."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,most painful losses so far 😎
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,GameStops gonna be number 1! Why cause I like this stock!!💎🙌🚀
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wasn't January's squeeze confirmed by all media to be $16 billion loss for short sellers?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I can understand attacking brick and mortar stores but Carvana & wayfair? that's probably the perfect way to purchase a car during a pandemic. Plus everyone is moving out of the city and needs furniture. lol I don't understand their methods.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,MOOORRRRREEEE!!!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yay $VIAC! I was going to post my gains but I figured it would be down voted to oblivion since it isn't GME, AMC or BB"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,chart is wrong also amc is up there now too
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is not accurate lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So far.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,GME is a lot higher than 1B afaik. I heard the melvin alone had to cover like 3B when it went to 300 the first time.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Who would short viacom? Thats warren buffets golden goose. He could buy every share.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Now do losses to market cap ratio or losses to float ratio.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Where is Rkt?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Dont these fools even use stops?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea, this is outdated."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Those are Rookie Numbers in this racket You gotta get those numbers up
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This data ain’t right and your account is 26 days old
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Short sellers are cynical bastards. They deserve to lose for betting against innovation. Fuck them.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME is way higher than that! Also, where's the VW squeeze? Adjusted for inflation, that would definitely make it on this list, if not outright win (so far)."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hehe, the same guys we’re fighting with on gme. Maybe not as smart as we think."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"They might have been betting on negative side effects tanking it before it became clear it's safe as baby shampoo, or that Moderna would tank when all the competition hit the market I can see trying."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably betting that they might drop after not being first to market
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Professionals take different positions, which may seem nonsensical to us, to balance their beta.

Like how someone bought 10k GME 800c call options expiring yesterday. That wasn't someone thinking it would explode and gambled, it was a short seller hedging their risk."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Just when I thought they couldn’t get worse.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Because it was overvalued. every other vaccine stock but moderna crashed at that time. I remember.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed.  This doesn't make much sense with what the market cap and the respective short interest is, even if we assume the original shorters covered."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn't Melvin alone lose $15B?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Elon better make a tweet, we’re $10,000,000 from showing him up!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,There is no date on this. It could have been months ago. It was more than a billion last week.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This might be realized losses, not mark to market losses."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I dunno about beating Tesla. They’ve been shorting Tesla for so long (one of the reasons Elon doesn’t respect the sec). Looking at Tesla’s price action the losses would be way heavier.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The real reason they're pushing so hard to open everything.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Had to be last years data
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,May 10 2013..bought 4000 shares at 24 cents each.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This year...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can see maybe a bet with puts, but enough shorts to get on this list? God damn lol"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,safe as baby shampoo but several countries have temporarily stopped with this Moderna Zeneca vaccin because of deadly blood cloth side effects...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,But how would that help them
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd love to know the model that led them to the 800 strike. Were they protecting against only the $500k/share mega ape fantasy, and the 800s were the cheapest?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You don't hedge risk with something that has infinite potential for loss. That's not just nonsensical to us unsophisticated, dumb money autists. It's legitimately amateur and the kind of low iq play one would only take if they were at the apex of arrogance or ignorance."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Just wait... two more weeks? Until they actually start covering lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It might because game was shorted a long time ago when it was still a functional company and had higher value.     
They shorted high on a lot of the shares so they were only at a loss when it went back up a lot.     
But it still turned what would have been a massively profitable position for shorters into a huge loss."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Over 50%~ish.  So whatever the fuck that was.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe their total worth was around 15 billion and they lost half of that.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly what I was thinking. What happened to the 70 billion lost in a week in January??
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe YTD Gamestop beat tesla but definitely not all time. I'm pretty sure tesla was in the hundreds of billions last year.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Shorts lost well over 40 billion betting against tsla last year. This is from the early run in January.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Smart ape! It hit $75 back in January and has tanked since then but it looks like it’s on the come back. May have to drop big ape tendie calls for April!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,">Blood cloth

Jesus, you DO belong here."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,AstraZeneca and Moderna are not the same vaccine.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait what side effects
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because this is what calls are for.

They owe someone shares. Calls give them the option to buy shares at a specific price. If gme went above 800, say to $2k, they could exercise the calls and give back the shares they borrowed for only 800/share instead of $2k. Shorting shares has theoretically infinite losses, but holding calls caps the loss at the strike they're for."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It hedges their risk. You can never be 100% certain of a trade going one way or the other, so professionals open positions against their outstanding positions.

In the moderna case though - it could've been people betting against them producing a viable vaccine and further, if they produced a viable vaccine, betting it had negative side effects that countries would ban"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The contract price isn't really dictated by the price but rather how many people are buying into the position. Yes you could buy a 800 call and probably sell it for gains on Monday. The closer you get to the strike price the more money you net.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,See my other comment.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Bout tree fiddy
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh, you think I'm retarded enough to still have those shares today? WRONG, sold them like 1 month later for a miserable double of profit. I remember there was a hype about the company getting contracts for BMW warehouses (Plug Power provides forklift elevators). There was also this other company following the same trend, Ballard Power, BLDP."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holyshit I might even be more retarted then I thought, I truly belong here I guess"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah makes sense, thank you!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It means that guy had a huge amount of risk on it going to 800 lol he was very scared indeed
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not scared, but yes anyone short would be screwed if it went to 800 in the matter of a few hours."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This thing could easily trade sideways till 6/18 it’s not a fast growth etf so this is pretty ballsy for a so called smooth brain play - tech is way hot already..  you should look into commodities because inflation / interest rate ‘feaarssss’ could fuck tech all year

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The final decision is yours.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Monday I will have so many tabs you wont even be able to see the RH tab
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That's what I like. Tab porn.
2021-03-13 02:29:08,wallstreetbets,"GoPro Let’s Go!!! Ok fellow apes! We all love hated stonks of well known companies. Therefore I’d like to bring attention to never-loved GPRO. This is a household name just like GME & AMC, shares have been beaten down to hell basically since IPO. This godforsaken stonk has barely seen double digits through most of its lifetime. That being said, everyone knows this brand. It was ahead of it’s time, but only for a very short time, when it came to camera quality and capabilities. As smartphones got better and better it started to deteriorate their sales as more could simply use their IFIN and Samscumb phone.

That brings us to the present. They are pivoting to a subscription model which has grown from new to 760,000 paid subscribers in approximately one years time since they pivoted their focus. This shit ass company’s market cap is only around 1.6B even after its present rally from $7 to around $11. Its short float is nothing great-approx 11% if this Google didn’t lie to this dumb retard, but that’s plenty to build on. This small cap target is the perfect candidate to diamond hand the hell out of and make a run towards Ape Heaven. GoPro has learned from their mistakes and focused on cutting costs while staying afloat. Now that we are REOPENING, this could end up being the perfect play as people begin to travel, climb mountains, skydive, snowboard nude down Mount Everest, and other shit GoPro people do that this ape wouldn’t touch. Per their last CC, they took a big hit with stores and travel being mostly closed as this product sells best in person. 

What day you apes!? Do you what to make a run at one of WallStreets most hated stonks of all time?! Is it time for this shitshow of a company to bloom? I don’t know shit about shit, but if we all agree on something then let it be so. 

This is not a recommendation for anything, and for many might have wasted some of your night and cut into your liquor and Tendy time. I apologize in advance for time wasted!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s a no from me chief
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,No. GoPro guy is a douche. I couldn’t even stand him on Shark Tank. Hard pass.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You get a free subscription with every purchase I’d like to see how many renewing subscriptions they have
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I got a free gopro stock and sold it today fir $1 profit
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The retardedest retard here. Bought GPRO at an average price of $72... never again
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Positions or ban

Get back to your roots wsb. Fuck."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro do you think people stopped going outside or buying shit like gopros off the internet this year? This doesn't click for me.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"i have over 1tb loaded into that fucking ""unlimited cloud"" - i use it like the truman show for my kids - it's a damn good deal for 50 annually"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"While this really isn't useful DD, I am very bullish on GPRO.  This sub doesn't seem to give it a lot of love, but that doesn't mean its not going to do well.  I've got multiple calls, and they are all in the money."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, that's not how it works."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It was attractive in September when it was $4 a share. Then it doubled in a month and I lost interest.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol. Going outside was literally the only thing people could do during the pandemic. If you couldn't sell action cameras in 2020, then your camera is fucked.

Also, anything GoPro could do, DJI can do better and cheaper.  GoPro went out of business in my mind when they couldn't even keep their drones from dropping out of the sky. If I wanted an action cam, DJI's offerings are a legit competitor and they have gimbal stabilized cams too."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm one of the apes that does things OP mentions he wouldn't do

\>  travel, climb mountains, skydive, snowboard nude down Mount Everest, and other shit GoPro people do 

&#x200B;

and I have thought about GoPro a lot. I've thought about getting a GoPro and about their future as a company because I really love the concept, but... I just don't see them growing super big in the near future. Watching extreme sports is great, you get an adrenaline kick without having to risk your life yourself, however, I don't see that GoPro could ever get the volume of watchers required. They're a retailer of cameras, not much more, and there's cheaper action cams out there on the market. They're not as high quality as GoPros in many respect, but honestly, to how many people does this actually matter? The 0.1% that are top extreme sport athletes and some fanboys, sure, but most people who'll do the above things OP ape wouldn't touch are not professionals.

&#x200B;

Additionally, even though I'm super into most of the things OP ape listed, I don't even watch them on youtube myself. I wouldn't pay for a platform to watch them on, I wouldn't sink more than 20 odd minutes here and there into watching them, you get it. It's a thing I love to DO. DOING is the key with us weirdo sports apes, not sitting in front of a screen and watching other apes do.

&#x200B;

GoPro is too niche. They're only really relevant to extreme sport apes.

On a side note, go watch Killian Bron's Winning Run on the Mountain of Hell on youtube. It is entertaining, but in the last two years, that's literally the only GoPro-made video I've watched of its kind."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Forget that noise, I lost all the money I cared to on GoPro years ago."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I am in
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,i actually bought wack of this for the long cause someone will acquire them eventually
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just sold mine to try to break even on it, ended up making a couple dollars but no."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,A subscription model? Subscription for what? To use their cameras?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nothing in this looks like a buy from me. I can't imagine much interest in renewed subscription services, but mostly because I can't stand subscriptions to use shit I already bought."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hit this with [my own DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/tendie_hunters/comments/lrvdo3/film_tendies_at_high_speed_with_gpro_ta_dd/) two weeks ago.

Ironically, I sold my stake today."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"i was holding some at 6, now it's 9, FACK  


i always joke about using it as a learning platform for selling options and setting stops and stuff"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm thinking puts on the GoPro man. I'm no scientard, but I gotta believe the vaccines are going to lose efficacy at some stage here."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Some people were already hinting at GoPro stock about a month ago and getting completely ignored. I caught on early to another ignored gem and it has already netted me 20% gains and 180% gains in calls in just the last 4 weeks. I'm talking about WWE, a better-looking recovery play than GoPro. I mean, yes, you can wait until it goes up another 20% and someone makes a long DD post like this one."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Drones would be a better investment than gopro camgirl stonks.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ya sadly I don’t believe enough time has past to see where things settle out
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is premature if there hasn’t been any subscription turnover yet
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"There isn't really much to buy either... I mean, once you have a cam and equipment, the fuck else do you need to buy from GoPro?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Good god that is tops retard ever hahaha
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought at somewhere around $10 a month ago and then sat through it until it got to $10.3 or something last night and immediately sold. Never again for me too.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha yes it was more get the stonk out there, always room to add information. The tough thing is the hopeful turnaround story is too fresh to include too many positives about financials or growth because there isn’t much there at this time. I’ve done well on this the last year or so and can’t deny last weeks price action means something"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, it does start with a G...so i dont see why it wont work?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty much lol. I made the mistake of joining the stock market too late (January) and bought it for $10 a share. I FINALLY FINALLY could get rid of it yesterday.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for your input! As a last resort I bet it’s not too far fetched that they might be a buyout candidate. Everyone and their brother is dancing on tik Tok and other crap like that. I bet the GPRO cameras work way better for all these rich asshole kids to catch every move of their dance or challenge video. I’m not saying this would be a GME, just like the stonk"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same, not touching this shit"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Smokes, let’s go!"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,AAPL too slow. When you earn you are old and can’t use the profit.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Need Tim AAPL to get off his ass and announce something lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,AAPL 150c jeezus
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Balls deep in pltr , arkk and apple myself"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Why woul you yolo apple shares??? You’ll get margin called before anything ool
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,AAPL is dead.  The last fumes of Steve Jobs wore off around late 2019.  The stock will operate like getting GE or Ford stock going forward.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"AAPL has been good (but slow) for me, but it ain't going to produce rocket fuel like PLTR!!! 💰🚀"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,My apple call options got killed too :(
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is appl still on sale?!!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuk that's risky. Don't use margin unless you can survive a short attack. Look at gme. Margin calls.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You're actually retarded
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I like apples. Fuji apples are my favorite.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Now THIS is what I call retarded!!!!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm scared to ever use margin so I usually use my own money.  How does the margin loan thing work when it comes to stocks? I know you're burrowing money at an X percentage ( varies by brokerage )but how do you pay them back assuming your positions are doing well from the day you borrowed the cash.  You borrow 100k and buy stocks/ contracts with it, then if you're up you can use it to pay them  back and keep the difference?  Also when and how do they start asking for that money back ( is it like a credit card ) ?  Thanks apes"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Damm that's actually not bad at all if you make a Yolo play like the guy did before Tesla shot up to 1k. He bought them at 200+ and borrowed 50k. Something to think about lol. Thanks for answer

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Shares????
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,AAPL is almost a value trade at this point.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have you seen ford lately? If he yolod into ford, he’d be up 25%"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Most teenagers don't even know who Steve jobs was. You might be right, but Jobs has nothing to do with that. It's their tech that was getting stale, but tbh the M1 looks phenomenal, so they might have just pulled another trick that will significantly increase their value. At this point with apple it's impossible to say when the stock will stop.

Not to mention the fact that they still are very strongly perceived as a luxury brand, and anything they make is bought at unbelievable prices just because it has a big white apple on it.

So overall it's still a very good investment IMO. Not financial advice of course, I'm a retarded"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You pay like 8% of your loan. You pay per day (amount *.08)/365. They get their money at the end of every month. If you are in margin then you owe more unless you deposit more money to your account!

2021-03-13 01:50:07,wallstreetbets,"GME and how my wife's girlfriend is my EX. TLDR:Buy GME low, sell GME high. Get paid many times over the next year.


Many a DD has been posted discussing the numbers behind the price changes in GME. I have read a number of them and it's one of a few reasons that GME will pay me twice. However, I have seen very little discussion on something that should be shouted from the goddamn rooftops. Something that would mean GME might pay me 10 more times.

* Collusion!

No self respecting media outlet will ever publish an article on hedgefund collusion. While I have seen comments here and there about price manipulation and short ladder attacks, almost no one in the media is talking about how several HFs are acting as a group right now. 


My first premise for this belief is based on Melvin capital receiving a cash injection from Citadel.  In what world does a professional financial institution look at another professional financial institution, that is bleeding money, and say, ""you guys just lost a shitload of cash, here have some of mine in exchange for..."" no article I have seen has really covered what was received in exchange for the injection. As far as I can tell, it was just friends helping friends. Which for me is a giant sign saying, ""Collusion found here! Come back on Thursday for the Melvin special"" 


My second premise for collusion is the message consistency in the media. Nearly every media outlet gets their pocket lined by one hedgefund or another. Jim Cramer admitted as much in his video explaining how hedgefunds manipulate media to influence stock prices. I don't believe that each institution practices manipulation on an individual basis. You would see a lot more conflicting messages if they did. The consistency of the message from the media on GME is astounding. They all have slightly different reasons and theories, but all of them have the exact same conclusion, the shorts covered. **BULL FUCKING SHIT**. 


My third and final premise for collusion, is more speculative. I believe that the second wave of GME is another institution winding down their short position. If they can loan each other money to keep their friends liquid, then they can certainly all get together and find a cost effective way to exit their shorts. I believe this is what's happening right now. I think they fucked up so bad, that they have to collude in order to unwind this position or they lose all of their money. 


In conclusion


They are colluding on their exits so they don't pay out 10k a share, so they don't have to sell all of their other positions to cover, so the insider whale douchebags can pull out their money and replace it with dumb money to pay us a pittance with, so they can all survive when they fucked up so badly, so they don't get a slap on the hands from uncle Sam, and finally so they can once again fuck the retail investor.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is why the only way to beat them is to buy SHARES, not options or LEAPS. Both the latter can be manipulated to oblivion.

And the shares must be bought on cash accounts, no margin. With lending prohibited wherever broker has that option enabled.

Edit: look again at Ken Griffin’s testimony to Congress: he says - and emphasises - that options MUST be registered at the ‘public exchange’.   


Why is that important? Why did he bring it up? Because this means the INFORMATION becomes public knowledge and the competing market participants can see it. It’s 100% transparent and accurate.   


Now ask the question: which market participants know exactly how many GME shares are genuine, who ‘owns‘ them and how many are ‘synthetic’? Hahaha!   


The quants can ‘model the options’, but shares? No chance.

Us vs Them was when GME was shorted 140pc. 
It it’s now. It has a healthy short percentage now. You know that this is a bubble but unlike last time this time it’ll be mostly us fucking each other. Basically redistribution of wealth between retail investors.

You and your holier than thou attitude...

Even with Cohen it’s common sense that $150 is a stable price. This is hype and mass hysteria. Even Your aunts uncle knows and acknowledge this.

If you believe in GME then you’d want stability. If it fluctuates longs are just fake longs waiting until the price drops...

Because you're retarded and obviously you didn't do enough risk management or DD or maybe you just got unlucky. Regardless, most of you are new traders, and losing is learning. Get the fuck over it. No one made you buy your shitty 1 DTE call 200% OTM and lose 100k. That's you being a true retard. Good job buddy. You did that all by yourself.

So for next time. Do some DD of your own instead of blaming strangers and memes of people who want to offload on you.

Every trade has a loser. Youre that loser. Atleast you did something right 👍

**Edit:** this sounds like I'm targeting that one guy with dumb options. Nah he's just a good example. I'd say 30% of the sub was actually retarded before it exploded. That number is closer to 85% now if not higher.

**EDIT3:** You can ask people for fucking help, just don't ask stupid questions like ""What's a call"" or ""Whens the next short"" or ""Whats the buy"". It's your own fucking job to do research, whether personal or DD, this is a forum board to bounce ideas off and complex trading strategies [Like *box spreads* ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/agovgl/only_invest_what_you_can_afford_to_lose_they_said/)

**EDIT4:** Don't give me awards, dipshit. Either send that money to me so I can buy shares or calls, or do it yourself, ffs. This Chinese owned website doesn't need more money for their anti-human rights shit abroad. Seriously.

2021-03-13 01:11:39,wallstreetbets,"Canoo was algo attacked today probably to cover shorts https://ibb.co/r7YhN6N

I am posting in WSB as I honestly believe it meets the criteria in terms of market cap and retail interest. This post may get auto-deleted or mod-deleted. If it disappears just know that’s it’s not of my fact. I’ve been covering Canoo for a few months so check my post history if you need. 

**Context:** Canoo released the presentation of its new truck on March 11th (YouTube, Instagram etc.). A great new catalyst which was covered by multiple media. Price action went rapidly up after the stock been hammered below $10 on the recent tech growth correction. 

**Options context:** For the last couple of weeks I have noticed that put/call ratio was **massively** skewed towards calls volume i.e. I’m talking near 10 to 1 every single day. Option interest also much bigger on calls side. Although the price of the IV was relatively “cheap” around 100% (for a new public company with long duration growth). 

**Weekly price increase:** The stock went from $11 on Monday until exactly $16.00 today... until something funny happened... [weekly graph](https://ibb.co/Wfhtwm9)

**What I believe happened:** Some big money was too short on the stock that started running way too fast for a mispriced implied volatility of just 100%. The heat intensified and people were more than ever buying calls (like 90% 95% of options volume were calls again). Also these calls are concentrated onto March expiry as there are no weeklies on this name. 

**What I believe they did:** They had to cover their shorts as money was bleeding fast with no sign of any slow down (Canoo was even up 5% PM when all tech growth was in the red). Massive sell wall at 16.00 with more than 100K on the offer. But even after it dropped the stock wanted to moon again and people were still buying calls relentlessly. **They activated the ultra algo** in order to drop the share price as fast and as low as possible in order to trigger stop losses on calls. Specifically on MAR 15CALLS. 

**Evidence:** Look again at the [screenshot.](https://ibb.co/r7YhN6N)

At time 12:59:50 and 12:59:51 you will see that within **one second** big quantities were bought at the lowest prices of the day (0.35 to 0.45) then 3 seconds later it went back up to regular prices and quantities. This is the evidence that someone has triggered a sell off on Canoo stock to trigger stop losses on MAR 15C for the algo to buy absolutely everything it could within 1 second. It happened so fast that you couldn’t even feel it. Only an algo was capable to perform this. I had to dig into time/sales to decipher what happened.

**ELI5** Why buy calls if they are short? HF was about to lose too much money on shorting Canoo a retail darling that wants to moon hard. They couldn’t control the price action anymore. They had to hedge their short by getting long calls and mitigate their potential loss. They scooped more than 1K MAR 15C at around 0.42 average price and within the next few seconds it went back to 0.80 and then minutes later to 1.00. All this happened at plain sight before you had time to blink. Now don’t expect media talking about this kind of stuff. They too busy witch hunting retail. This post may also get censored anyway.

I’ve tried my best to make this a quick and simple post. I’ve explained it at the best of my understanding. Obviously not a recommendation to buy sell hold any security. I shared public data. My interpretations could be erroneous. 

**Bonus S3 short data** on Canoo: 
short interest is $152M
10.33M shares shorted
10.33% of Float
9.37% S3 SI% Float
47.82% fee.
Shares shorted up +1.6 million shares, worth $23 million, +13.3%, last week.

**TLDR** HF got caught asleep at the wheel shorting Canoo. Retail likes it too much and wanna moon. They had to buy next week calls ASAP and as cheap as possible. Used algo ultra fast. One second later: thank you very much for cheap calls."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Should probably add $GOEV ticker to the title so more people can see this.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Absolutely my observations as well - thank you for confirming with actual data OP. Also glad to see Canoo get some love on WSB - it's been undervalued for months and so many unknowns that aren't priced in.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is enough data to file an SEC complaint for investigation. That is definitely the best direct evidence of price manipulation. All they would have to do is subpoena the MM and trace who made all those call purchases at that time frame!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Was watching this with u/BrotherLuminous today and the speed with which it ran $15 to $16 was unreal. That wall at $16 was tough in the lvl2 for sure but it dropped way too fast not to be a bear tactic. 

Overall though getting this kind of action on an otherwise slow market day for EV is EXTREMELY bullish. 

Needless to say I'm long. I opened spreads in the morning to put a little more pressure on the March calls, but bought the top half back in the afternoon dip. Making lemonade out of lemons!"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think this is going to get pretty volitile for a second as the short interest will seek to shake off retail and cover with scare tactics... Much like the long gap opening we can see the strategy, we will now see them thrashing around... The trick here is because of the gamma ramp if we see 18 we will more likely see 30 because of all the open interest magmatism... This decays every day especially for the march 19th calls... So expect not only bear violence but bull violence as well"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ofc we will as long as we all double down on Monday LETS GOOO
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly. Also I maybe didn’t emphasize in the OP. Most of the STOPS are regular stops which turns into MKT orders sell at any price... You can avoid this unfortunate situation by using Stop Limits if you must.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So hedge funds or some other whale that aggressively shorted the stock realized they messed up, drove the price down with a massive sell off, then scooped up the call options that had become super cheap from their sell off. This all to hedge against their short positions that they realized were screwed. 

At least that is the theory, and the info we have corroborates."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I think the theory (right or wrong) is saying that the price was short attacked THEN calls were scooped after the attack. The calls scoop were from stop losses of others (not MMs) so the net call position didn’t change; just changed hands.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,MM and hedgies need to hedge like a billion shares (not really that many) to cover the March call volume. It's going to be interesting.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It's not a real concern because buy pressure always wins out long term. The longer they short to more of a pop we get when they unwind.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,yes but doubtful they would manipulate it if it was worthless. More just sloppy and they wanted to improve their position going into a very bullish week

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I was thinking about trying to dink away at it and act like I was helping but they washed it down in the $14s too quickly
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,2 weeks my homie. Gamma squeeze-y
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,what a site to see:')
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’d love to see something over $20, I total thought we were going up to $17.5 today before that crap that pull at noon."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Never heard the phrase ""Buy the rumor, sell the news"" before? Well you bought the news."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"No,   they just got overwhelmed when news finally broke.  SI has doubled over the last week.. they trying to re hedge their positions. Unfortunately goev is a heavy short stock after it crossed 20. BUT look at it as wow... I got that shit cheap amd these bears gonna make me some money.   That's how I see it at least. Good luck all."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Want to get in Monday. Buy at 14.9x on-the-open or wait for a dip?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm a new ape...ape make bad deal?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, those are the ones I have. Got to double up at the low today. Avg price 3.25. Not too bad."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It was aggressive. Me and the crew started digging deep last couple weeks on si.  Its a heavy bear. But the fatter the bear the more the tree shakes..  fat bears can't hold on. Let's goev!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Why 2 weeks?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ultimately I see today's price action as a bullish indication that the only way to cover these positions is to expect the price will go up..
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Never heard this wisdom before? Pray tell, what issue of Penthouse was this sage advice bestowed upon us in?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I always wait 15 minutes.  Every time I don't I regret it.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You might want to sell your calls on the next big leg up. I’m bullish too but 40 by april is expecting gme level gains
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,My first option was PLTR. I made like 240%. You'll be fine!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Welcome to the ape club good sir. I grant you one 🍌 and wish sweet tendies to you!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Not too bad at all
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,We expected some more announcements shortly followed by a nice gamma ramp due to insane options activity for 3/19. When they talk earnings we get to see how much they're getting from hyundai for engineering services
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Me too, we had a GME moment, it dropped to $14.12 but quickly bounced to $14.70 range.  I really wanna see a stock that I bought could get up 50% in one day!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shit man I'm setting for 14.95 limit on the open. I just don't wanna miss the mark. Might save a few cent's if it's like todays early dip, but the chances of hitting that seem low if a dip does happen.

Where as it's sounding like this is guaranteed to be 15+ by next Friday atleast."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait, no...my contract ends in August. That's why I held today."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It was up 50% at one point today. I was tempted, but with the long away expiration, I held. I read someone's dd on here and thought I'd give it a couple of weeks."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do you actually have to be expecting to reach the price target to buy the call/put. I'm new to options as well and I see even these stupid far OTM calls fluctuate 50% and to me, as someone who is used to watching stocks, this is a huge gain for a short time. Is this a terrible idea?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"First ones free!
Mine was also PLTR at ~$9/share, Feb 11C
Peaked at 1600% gain, sold at 850%"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That'll do, pig."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you think it is too late to get in on Monday?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Just wait.. if we hit 25... Giddyup
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,EV stocks have huge swings.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"now that WSB has caught onto GOEV I am really tempted to follow your lead on the $40 AUG calls but I’m also really happy about already owning $10 AUG calls (bought them when GOEV was $11) and you should consider something at least closer to the current stock price if you’re new to the game, otherwise be prepared to lose quick if it doesn’t pan out. ITM is the best way to avoid theta decay.

edit: supplementing i mean, not replacing your current calls"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not necessarily. This isn’t really options 101 and i’m not in any way qualified to explain it anyway. You gotta watch some educational videos to start to get the basics and then actually buy some options to learn the practice.

Best way to learn is by experience. Try playing spy calls 1 contract at a time and see how it works out on you. I usually day trade my options unless its a play like goev that I have real faith in."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Huge gains and terrible ideas are neither mutually exclusive nor synonymous. You gotta find a thesis you believe in, then find a way to capitalize on it with available funds."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,No I really don't but it is still a long term buy and hold. At least for me.  The company has 2 analyst price targets currently: $23 and $30. Im conservatively saying $40 EOY.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,🚀🚀🚀
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it better to get 3/19 or april calls?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have both, but I'm not sure which is better. The only recommendation I would give is go with ITM."
2021-03-13 01:07:17,wallstreetbets,"Last Friday, I yolo’d my entire cashapp balance into GME. I like the stock so much I bought more... "
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is amazing. Can you even see the stocks price in Cashapp? Lmao
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I remember seeing your post. Fuck I should have done the same 😩
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just don't get the hype about gamestop...it's not like with all this attention they have done anything to change the way the do things besides one fire, at the end of the day its a game store that wants to be a toy store and there not even good at that, they are still just liquidating assets and closing stores faster then blockbuster ? Go in one its mostly empty boxes on shelves and a pissed off person behind the register telling you to buy online so tf we need em for ?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Right like I had a couple hundred bucks in cash app from splitting dinners and shit. Who the hell keeps tens of thousands of dollars in there.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,My same thoughts
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That's the only alternative if u want pretty lines
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What you see in the picture is all the technical graph data you get. Line move up or down. That's it.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I got screwed out of 1k during the first AMC jump because I bought it on cash app. I tried to sell at a peak and it “scheduled” my order. Order went through at the bottom of the dip over an hour later. I don’t recommend.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Some ape who splits alot of dinners and shit
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah thats actually a valid point. I didn't think about it because I've only ever bought on the account but ""market"" orders did seem to have a BIG time delay. Might cash out the few hundred I have on that account and move on plainly to my fidelity account. I have has 0 issues with fidelity and its not ""that"" bad of a app but there is room for improvement thats for sure, they need to hire a little younger talent to revamp it I think."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I found that if you pay close attention to TD ameritrade (maybe another as well) you can figure out if it’s going to uptick or down tick on the next “update” cashapp waits for the next movement or few to make your trade, so if it goes up on the next tick it will sell when you hit the button. But if it goes down it will delay it until it stops going down or I believe a max tick or 3"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ape be splitting lambos lol

2021-03-12 22:50:14,wallstreetbets,"$LUMN - Lumen Technologies (Formerly CenturyLink) by u/uknj **$LUMN - Lumen Technologies (Formerly CenturyLink) by** u/uknj

Lumen Technologies (formerly CenturyLink) is a telecommunications company which provides products and services related Network, Cloud, Security, Voice, and Managed Services to enterprise, SME, and retail customers. Lumen is aiming to position itself as a key infrastructure partner underpinning public and private cloud, edge computing and fiber connectivity. LUMN is building its services with 4 key areas in mind:

1. Physical assets and infrastructure – These include fiber, hardware and facilities.
2. Software managed networking – This is a network-as-a-service (NaaS) offering that can be leveraged to connect organisations with
3. Hybrid Cloud – These include private cloud and datacentres, colocation services and connections with public cloud service provider partners.
4. Lumen Orchestrator – This is the orchestration solution that allows for the management and control of the various services that are offered.

I am currently bearish about LUMN with no immediate plans to invest (although in the event of the price dropping into the single digits, I would re-evaluate this position). There are a few key reasons for this, but I encourage you to read the full bullish, bearish, and neutral considerations in the rest of the post:

1. LUMN earns a significant portion of its revenues from legacy offerings e.g., traditional telephony. This revenue stream has been decreasing YoY for the last few years and this is likely to continue.
2. Despite the above, there are significant areas of potential for LUMN – specifically in their Edge Computing and software defined networking offerings (see Organisational Summary below). Edge Computing is only a small % of current revenues and while it is likely to grow, it will take time to significantly grow these streams. I view the Edge Computing growth as a slow burner and small market, but this will grow at a rapid rate in the future.
3. LUMN has a high level of debt, and while they have managed to de-lever and reduce interest rates, the amount of debt is still significant. When accounting for intangibles and goodwill, the level of liabilities is roughly 1.6x the value of assets (although specifically looking at long term debt this is a healthier picture at 70% of non-current assets).
4. Revenues have been consecutively down for the last few years and are unlikely to show a significant turnaround next year. This is somewhat mitigated by improvements in margin which are expected to continue and a healthy level of free cash flow at $2,770 although this has been declining YoY.

Please do have a read of the Bull, Bear and Neutral points in the detailed post below for a more balanced and in-depth view.

# Key Data

All data believed to be accurate as of 05/03/2021

* Price = $13.45
* P/E = -12x
* EPS = -2.12 (dil)
* Forward P/E = 8.5x

# Detailed Analysis

**Bull Considerations**

* $LUMN are well positioned to become significant players in high potential markets – specifically fiber and underlying network infrastructure, NaaS and Edge computing.
* $LUMN has several verticals it can offer to customers including Hybrid Cloud, Connected Security and Collaboration. These can be leveraged to grow revenue streams in parallel (i.e., cross selling products and services to customers).
* Successfully managed to de-lever the company from previous debts. While this is a great deleveraging trend and a significant reduction in interest rates by redeeming outstanding 5.375% and 7.00% notes1 and replacing them with 4% bonds, the level of debt is still a concern (see bearish consideration item 1).
* The dividend from $LUMN has been consistent and relatively attractive (although on a yield basis this is less so if the price continues to rise). The board are committed to continuing the dividend payment and at the present time it can be safely assumed that $0.25 will be paid per share per quarter for the remainder of FY21. Dividend yield should not be the primary reason for going into $LUMN as yield is \~ 7% (at a stock price of $13.70). In the event of a dip to single digits, the dividend becomes extremely attractive and is worth considering (at a yield of > 9%).
* Despite the overall reduction in EBITDA (see bearish item 4), EBITDA margin has improved and is likely to continue improving into FY21 due to cost cutting measures being pushed by executive leadership.
* Significant number of insider purchases throughout 2020 with one sale.

**Bear Considerations**

* Overall, there are likely to be better candidates for returns on investments than LUMN, while LUMN is in a number of attractive areas, it is still growing revenues and these are unlikely to materialise in any significant manner over the next year or two. See competitive advantage section for additional details.
* $LUMN holds significant long-term debt of $31,837 (down from $34,694 in 2019). This debt is primarily due to $LUMN’s all in play to fiber (at the expense of 5g) when they purchased Level 3 Communications for $34,000. It is worth noting that $LUMN has not had an issue with either paying down debt and paying dividends with its current cash flow.
* $LUMN earns a substantial portion of revenues from legacy services. These include voice ($391 in 4Q20) which approximates to 29% of overall revenue. As can probably be guessed, this has regularly declined over the course of FY20. While not all the voice revenue is likely to be a “legacy” product, I am considering it as such as there are likely to be other legacy revenue streams. (N.B. According to $LUMN legacy revenues primarily include voice, private line (including special access), switched access and other ancillary services.)
* $LUMN is facing lengthening sales cycles for its products and services as their customers (and more likely organisations in general) continue to evaluate new infrastructure needs and delay purchasing unless necessary. This is likely to continue until at least 2022 as cost pressure at organisations globally push down purchases.
* Revenues are down both QoQ and YoY with EBITDA down YoY and there is no expectation that they will increase next year with best estimates at stable revenue / EBITDA and worst-case a reduction. YoY revenues have decreased for both FY20, FY19 and FY18, although the rate of decrease has reduced over time.
* Free cash flow while still high is reducing over time and will continue to do so as LUMN are likely to continue to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and paying off its long-term debt.
* Executive compensation (specifically focussing on CEO compensation) is above average for the industry at $17M (compared to an average of $10M for similar sizes). It is worth noting that when comparing against larger companies or those listed as competitors, this level of compensation was not unusual. Compensation did stabilise as performance dropped, however, no decrease in compensation occurred despite the decrease in earnings. While not initially a problem, if the results do not turn around, and there is no decrease in compensation, there is a concern that executive pay is no longer in line with the company’s results.

**Neutral Considerations**

* Long term credit rating (Moody’s) – Ba3: Speculative with substantial - high credit risk.
* Speculative Grade Liquidity Ratings – SGL-2: Good liquidity, will be able to meet their obligations over the next 12 months through mostly internal resources but may rely on external sources of committed financing.
* Southeastern Asset Management has increased its position in $LUMN as of Dec 2020. It is worth noting that they have lost (\~25%) on the investment to date2. Despite this, they remain bullish on the overall prospects as the CEO has tightened controls on costs and margin improves. Additionally, they believe $LUMN can monetise several segments they are in (specifically fiber), and that as a multiple of free cash flow (< 5 at the time of investing) is an attractive valuation. As a final point, they have signed an NDA with $LUMN, and this indicates a higher and more “activist” level of engagement3. I have listed this as neutral despite the bullish sentiment of SAM, as their track record for the last year has not been great compared to the overall market.
* $LUMN will be seeing reduced subsidy revenue (from CAF II – A US initiative to improve connectivity) with subsidies declining to $20 by 2022. However, $LUMN believes their investment into providing this connectivity is likely to add to revenue that will make up for the loss in subsidy.

# Organisation Summary

Essentially Lumen Combine underlying infrastructure with platforms (i.e., cloud PaaS) and Applications (SaaS):

1. **Adaptive Networking** – High performance network connectivity i.e., on premise private lines, Content Delivery Network, fiber internet connectivity, direct cloud connections (where they provide corporate WAN infrastructure a direct link to Cloud) and managed networking services / consulting.

* Content delivery network market growth is forecast to grow at 14% till 20254.
* Fiber Internet connectivity in the US grew at 12% from 2019-202022 and will likely continue to grow at a similar rate for the next few years. Across the EU growth rates are largely similar for both coverage growth and subscriber growth5.
* Software defined networking offerings (Networking as a service) is an expanding industry and likely to see significant growth of 34% annually till 20266.
* Growth rates and industry sizes for private lines and direct cloud connections are not easily available. I believe direct cloud connections are a growth area and likely to grow at a reasonable 10-15% annually for the next few years (based on over all cloud growth, increase in colocation and deployment of data centres – see Hybrid Cloud below).

1. **Collaboration** \- VOIP, teleconferencing, collaboration solutions (e.g., file sharing and virtual meeting rooms all hosted by Lumen, but the products can be from vendors like Zoom, Webex Skype etc.), contact centres and calling services (e.g., traditional phone style calling both locally and internationally as well as toll free / business numbers. Also advanced emergency services support).

* VOIP is relatively mature industry with a CAGR of 12% (at best) till 20257. Personally, I think we can discount any mobile VOIP growth as I do not believe LUMN has offerings in this space and in my view, this would lower the effective CAGR with 8-10% looking a more reasonable target.
* Call centre growth is forecast to grow at 6% till 20278. The US houses over 60% of call centres globally, and this number is only going to decrease as increased internet penetration and decreased telecom rates drive the outsourcing of call centres9.
* Numbers and growth rates to traditional telephony are limited but I imagine that growth is probably negative. For toll free, business numbers and emergency services support, growth is likely positive but limited.
* Collaboration solutions are growing at a reasonably high rate of 13% till 202710. However, LUMN is limited to managing, implementing, running, and hosting products from other vendors as they do not sell their own.

1. **Connected Security** – Threat management (managed threat intelligence), managed SOC services, WAF and DDoS mitigation, managed firewalls, and professional services.

* The WAF market is expected to grow at 18% annually till 202211.
* The DDoS mitigation market is set to grow at 15% annually till 202612.
* The managed security services are expected to grow at a CAGR of 8% till 202513. While I think managed firewall growth is likely to be less than other managed security services (e.g., IAM, SOC etc), a growth rate of 4-6% is probable.

1. Edge Computing – Managed services, connections to both public cloud and private data centres, networking, colocation, cloud. Essentially connecting edge locations / end user servers to backbone infrastructure.

* Edge computing as an industry is forecast to grow at \~25% annually till 202514. However, it is currently a small market valued at \~ $ 2,000 in 20201. Edge computing as a market can be further subdivided into hardware, platform, and services. Hardware is expected to grow at the fastest rate of the three potentially reaching 40%15.

1. **Hybrid Cloud** – Cloud storage, disaster recovery (data replication and business continuity), hosting services, data centres, private and public cloud alongside consulting for cloud.

* The private cloud market is expected to grow at 29% annually till 2025. Private cloud growth will primarily be driven by businesses who wish to take advantage of public cloud capability with the addition of potentially more secure and customisable hosting resources. On-premises cloud growth will be significantly lower than provider hosted options (PaaS / IaaS) which are likely to hit 50%16.
* Hosting services are likely to increase in market size by 15% annually17.
* Deployment of data centres are likely to increase slowly over the next few years with a growth rate not likely to exceed 10% (estimated at 6% for 202118). Similarly, colocation services are likely to see a modest 14% CAGR19.
* Global cloud storage is expected to increase at a rate of 20% till 202520.

# Competitive Advantage

1. **Adaptive Networking:**

* Summary: A large revenue earner with solid growth potential. $LUMN is a large player in the infrastructure space and should be able to leverage that to provide organisations with NaaS and global fiber connectivity.
* From a coverage perspective (compared to Verizon and AT&T as of 2019), $LUMN serves 16% of the population, with Verizon and AT&T serving 17% and 41% respectively. It is worth noting that $LUMN covers more states than either21, 22. N.B. this view is for consumers but presumably also can also be applied to corporate coverage.
* $LUMN is relatively well positioned from a fiber perspective as they have a lot of “unique coverage” (i.e., locations served without significant competition) in the US and have coverage in Europe and Asia. They carry a large portion of internet traffic on their network backbone and have 180,000 locations globally which provide their customers direct access to $LUMN infrastructure. Additionally, they have direct connectivity to several cloud service providers and data centres. Compared to competitors, they appear to have the largest total fiber route23.
* The software defined networking offerings are an exciting growth opportunity and combined with the strong infrastructure position of $LUMN will mean that customers (particularly those that are multinationals and large enterprises) can utilise the network as a service offering to connect their enterprise infrastructure efficiently and effectively across the globe including connections from on-premises to cloud service providers.
* While competitors do exist, from both a software defined networking perspective (e.g., Fortinet, Cato etc.) and an infrastructure perspective (e.g. Verizon, AT&T etc.) $LUMN has the advantage of being a strong player in both areas with good partnerships with Cisco and VMWare.

1. **Collaboration:**

* Summary: Largely a legacy business and revenue generator for $LUMN. This will be a shrinking revenue area for $LUMN as the decline in traditional legacy telephony services is unlikely to be made up for by any growth in VoIP or collaboration solutions. Additionally, this area is a large revenue earner for $LUMN, and significant declines here would result in material impact to value.
* While implementing and managing VoIP, teleconferencing and collaboration solutions with partnered vendors (e.g., Zoom) are likely to show some little to moderate growth over the coming years, they will likely provide consistent revenue due to the underlying network requirements needed to effectively utilise such solutions.
* Traditional telephony services including contact / service centres and business telephony service revenues are likely to shrink over the coming few years.

1. **Connected Security:**

* Summary: The cybersecurity market is an exciting growth area which holds significant potential for $LUMN. However, it remains a small % of overall revenues and so revenue growth in-line with industry expectation will not materially impact the overall value of $LUMN.
* If $LUMN can leverage their verticals in the datacentre / cloud space to cross sell their security services this could see some reasonably large growth, but overall due to the small footprint of $LUMN in the cloud space presently, material value growth due to this vertical is likely be several years out.
* Additionally, $LUMN is not a recognised global player in this industry unlike Akamai or NetScout, and so will be at a disadvantage compared to incumbents with higher profile portfolios.

1. **Edge Computing:**

* Summary: This could be a strong growth area for $LUMN. Could be a way to take advantage of the potentially significant growth area of Edge computing. However, it is likely to significantly materialise only 1-2 years out with little revenue growth in this area prior to then as organisations slowly accept this paradigm shift. Additionally, it will be a highly competitive area that will require significant investment to grow and maintain an advantage.
* As of 23 Feb 2021, $LUMN claims they provide 60% of enterprise locations with <5ms latency to edge nodes. Their goal is 90% by the end of the year and their large fiber network leaves them at an advantage compared to competitors. (See Adaptive Networking).
* An example from the 4Q20 earnings call was SAP using their Edge infrastructure to bring SaaS applications closer to customers and bypassing unnecessary internet traversal.
* While $LUMN can leverage its underlying infrastructure and assets to push a solid offering, this is likely to be a highly competitive space with players including typical cloud service providers e.g. Microsoft, Amazon, Google and HPE as well as specialised players e.g. Mutable. Large cloud players will have both the hardware and software required to compete effectively with $LUMN while also being able to leverage their substantial public cloud technologies to gain an advantage.

1. **Hybrid Cloud:**

* Summary: If you are interested in taking advantage of private or public cloud growth then Lumen probably is not the best value even at its current multiple. This is due to low revenues (as a % of total revenues) from Cloud related activities. Additionally, this space is highly competitive and $LUMN does not appear to have the background or experience (it is working on growing its employee expertise) although they can potentially take advantage of their underlying infrastructure from their fiber and physical assets.
* Personally, I believe Private Cloud is not a significantly growing area with potentially some shorter term increase due to pandemic pushing a more remote working / access focus. However, longer term 3-5 years out, I think hybrid cloud will be the dominant focus as organisations transition from private cloud to increased public cloud usage. Only 3% of enterprises use private cloud exclusively24.
* If you are going to opt for growth within public cloud, there are higher growth options with AMZN, GOOG and MSFT although these are substantially higher in price. Alternatively, Cisco, HPE, or other smaller providers may work. A dedicated cloud provider will likely provide better value than $LUMN due to the low revenue share (see above).

Also no  🚀 so I'd rather just sink the rest of my 4 digit porfolio in PLTR FD's."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Awesome looking DD, came here to say century link had to change their name due to all the class action lawsuits (that I have my name in). Rebranding might work. Their customer service is *literally* the worst I’ve ever had to deal with."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"it's still centurylink to me, and it's crap

not an analcyst"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Saving this to read later. Just seen the several points that highlight what each paragraph was on and can already tell this is great D.D. I did see as I was skimming that you are currently bearish yet took your time to type this out and make calls from both prospectives. Sadly 90%ish of this forum is meme stock only rn. Someone a made great dd on unfi and it went under the radar but anyone that took it seriously profited. So I won’t disrespect your work and give it a read later
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is this the company michael burry bought heavily in the last quarter of last year according to February filings ? I remember I saw some Lumen shit in there ..

What happened to the price since ? It's saturday I'm too lazy to look!

Also TLDR ? No fucking way I'm reading this shit ..."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've worked in both cable and cell, and I can say for a fact that acquiring Level 3 is a big dick energy move. Might shuffle some stuff around in the near future for some leaps depending on how bloody next week looks."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I made 70% on a Nov $15 call and rolled that to a Nov $17 and took profits.  It moves slow but it keeps going up so 🤷🏻‍♂️
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Why Lumen over AT&T it Verizon. What about them makes you think they will gain ground over either of those companies? I'm assuming not their earnings statement.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Positions or ban.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I read the ""formerly CenturyLink"" part and rolled my eyes and, as a former customer, thought *no way am I investing in them*. Still ended up reading the majority of this DD and appreciated the effort put into it.

Thanks OP!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Up like 15%
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,They don't hold positions. Read for at least 3 seconds.
2021-03-13 00:55:17,wallstreetbets,"This one thing has done the most to convince me this is real. And we are winning. I was mostly convinced about the media manipulation. All the stuff we've talked about and seen, but there was a part of me thinking that we was just in an echo chamber, parroting ourselves. Until today. All day I've seen a news article on yahoo with the title ""Trader arrested as Gamestop soars"" . I know because I clicked the article about 20 times. I was confused as it was just a story about a Japanese guy getting arrested years ago. I kept clicking the story thinking something was bugged. But now after market closes the title has changed. To how the gamestop situation echoes a situation years ago when someone was arrested. The intent is clear. Scare people away from GME. It reeks of desperation. They're grasping at straws. Apes we are winning."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think the problem the HF ran into was the “working ape”. 

HF’s are use to dealing with people of wealth and able to pull strings by threatening that wealth, or taking it.

The HF’s don’t have that over the working ape. 

Also, since the working ape is working... the ape keeps buying every paycheck. The working is never all in. The working ape will have more money to buy every two weeks."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wonderfully put. I was feeling the same. But I too realized that the media cannot be trusted. 

There is a HUGE cover up going on.

The angles these companies are taking to flip the narrative is so ridiculous. 

HODL 🙌💎"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought the EXACT same thing when I saw that article this morning. The title leads you to believe that some guy got arrested for doing ""reddit shit"".  When you read the article, as you said, it happened a while ago and is NOTHING like the GME situation. Dude tried to keep the stock DOWN in order to get some kind of restriction removed. Nothing at all like a short squeeze.  It was baffling to me how the writer was trying to tie the two together. It also signaled to me that it was purely a scare tactic.  Jump on GME and possibly go to jail, is that what you want? You want to go to jail?

I was disgusted."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Downloaded the Bloomberg app just so I could give it a 1 star review.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought this might be an echo chamber too, regarding media manipulation. What convinced it for me was the article about the crash being published before it happened. At first I thought anyone can photoshop a picture, but then there is Google indexation metadata, webull confirming it, the author blocking people in Twitter instead of calling it a photoshop, and the WayBackMachine for marketwatch having no snapshots from midday until late that day, when you would expect about 1-2 snapshots per hour."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This article won't stop me because I can't read
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I just love how robinhood's analysist ratings have been 0% buying GME for weeks now.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I was convinced when a ladder attack on Wednesday dropped the stock from like 350 to 170 in a matter of 20 minutes and the fucking thing just recovered like a champ.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You should have followed the Bernie 2016 campaign.  They would literally publish a positive article with a positive headline, let the momentum pick up and then change both the body and the headline to be negative.  It was amazing.  It’s all 100% garbage 100% of the time.

Edit:  Not to bring politics up, just was the first thing that came to mind.  When I saw that, it buried the last tiny illusion of legitimacy left for institutions and the media specifically.  Sad."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not fucking leaving.
Simples."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,DON'T FORGET ABOUT YOUR OLD FRIEND SLV
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I saw the article on Yahoo finance at work today I showed everybody the headline and ask them what they thought of it, at first glance it definitely did hint that the Fuckery is related to GameStop and someone was arrested for it. It proved my point and bought a share on the spot."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha remember when the media said that we were trying to short squeeze silver?  Everyone was saying it came from WSB. Yet I never saw a single fucking post. So I bought puts on SLV and made money the next couple days hahaha
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"AMC iS oNlY wOrTh A pEnNy!

Hahaha.

Bahahahahahahahahahahahahhahaahhaaaaaaaahhhhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahhaahhahahahahahahahahahahahah.

Ha. 

Get fucked hedgies."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The world is a better place with GME in it. This whole event has really opened my eyes to just how far the 1% will go to keep people divided and news and information is their weapon of choice.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,One of the fatest most retarded apes here. Holding since 310 on the way up and I gotta say. If we can stay this dumb tiller those stimmies hit we will be riding the Starship Melvin Fucker all the way outta this galaxy. So hold strong. Buy that dip and why are you still listening. I said in the beginning I am one of the fatest most retarded. Now go grow bananas and come fucking get me.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,With simple and obvious traps like this... Are we actually the retarded ones or are they? This is some Twilight Zone shit
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Both are true, we are definitely in an echo chamber :p doesn't mean that our conformation biases is wrong. Am i right?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ape was at work place, where ape spends most of his time just to give baby apes a roof in this jungle. 

Suddenly ape gets alert on his old iAPE, and ape sees he has extra 1400.00. 

At first ape confused as fuk. 

Then ape thinks to ape self. 

What if extra is for ape to buy more banana?

Ape knows banana is one way to tendie. 

So away it goes, instantly ape chucks 1400.00 at the tendie wheel. 

Why not wait for dips asks this ape?

Well it simple really, ape is retarded and gives zero fuk. Tendies are good with dip and without

Ape just really fucking likes tendies. 

Ape believes this is the way, ape likes the stock, and ape has eyes on moon home for his ape family. 


Basically I’m fucking retarded and have been yoloing every dime I get into this because I’m already broke. I’d probably just buy dumb shit anyway."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It has to be sobering to know your balls are firmly in a vicegrip operated by a bunch of self-professed smoothbrains who have been filmed literally eating crayons
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is sort of my feeling. I know very, very little about stocks - but I know people very well. I bought in at 240 end of Jan and even when it was at 40 I haven't waivered because of the utter desperation I've seen in the hit pieces and the talking heads on TV."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,They’re worried we can choose any stock they short.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,When we almost $200 in a few minutes I was reading the daily megathread but sortes by new. Every other post at that time were 1 month old accounts that were blatantly there just to cause FUD. That's when I knew we had the hedgies by the bollocks. They're beyond rattled at this point.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Its funny all these news articles remind me of that one nazi news paper during WW2 that would constantly write articles about how they were winning the war and it wouldn't be long before victory was achieved even as the allied forces were basically at the throat of Berlin. We apes are practically knocking on Melvins door and they continue to make everything seem like they're winning!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is so odd to me that people risk their reputations to shill the interests of the powerful. 

I’m no conspiracist but, damn, the GME & NVAX coverage over the last few months has highlighted to me just how much influence industry has over these sources. Their impact on broad sentiment is palpable and its been this way for years. 

It’s hilarious to now hear complaints about the ‘Reddit army’ as if to say retail influence on SPs is greater than industry’s."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice ninja edit. https://ibb.co/59gcML3
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"One thing about media manipulation though. It's fucking easy to do. It's just a few words and maybe some pictures. It's not like some huge, massive, coordinated police raid."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Fact we stand together ☺️☺️💯💯💯💯🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🦍🦍🦍🦍💪💪💪💪💎💎💎
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I see it as clickbait created that we just had to click, thus more clickety clacks. Just nonsense we created ourselves.   It's meaningless nonsense. Don't fall for shit like that.."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The market manipulation is becoming clearer as well
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"My brain is smoother than ever.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol or it’s just really poor reporting and ad management. But hey an echo chamber won’t tell you that
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup, the blatent corruption was awe inspiring, from a certain point of view."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Man you got some DD to do if this was your convincing thread 🤣 countless evidence
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Too bad we can't read their headline anyways 🤣😆🤪💎👐💎👐🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Man, I fucked up then. I bought a bunch of AMC today. Was I not supposed to do that?"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,My retardation cannot be cured.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Weren't there a bunch of $300 shorts due today?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I read the same article on another news feed! It had no relevance or proper timing.   It was like saying, ""Man got arrested for speeding in the 90's. You shouldn't speed!"" So weird.  I don't know if it a concerted effort."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck it i cant go to the casino's i might as well have this be that thrill for me
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Think about it. If they didn't care about retial, then why would they manipulate the news?

We have power, and they're afraid."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think that article got to me like they thought it would. That article was about a guy who shorted and suppressed the stock price of a company so he could sell at the peak when he stopped shorting it. 

Reminds me of Melvin and citadel. The article motivated me that the hedge funds will be brought to justice."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What if….op is the Japanese guy that got arrested?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Every time I see an article saying “why GameStop fad is done” I buy another share
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"All Mainstream Media is now just propaganda. In the age of misinformation, If I will be teaching my children anything, it will be fact checking and verifying even trusted sources. **Trust, but verify**."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Come gather 'round hedge funds
Wherever you roam
And admit that the stock
You derided has grown
And accept it that soon
You'll be beat and de-throned 
If your money to you is worth savin'
You better cover your shorts 
Or you'll sink like a stone
For the market is a-changin'

Come journalists and shills
Who spread lies with their words
About the most shorted stock
That we've ever heard
And dont sell too soon
Paper hands is absurd
Cause there's no tellin' how
High its Sailin' 
The dumb money now
Will be later to win
For the market is a-changin

Come retards and austists 
Please heed the call
Don't give in to FUD
Instead buy when it falls
For he that gets hurt
Will be he who has sold
The battle on Wall Street that's ragin' 
Will soon bankrupt the hedge funds
And tear down their walls
For the market is a-changin

Billionaires and boomers 
Throughout the land
Please don't criticize
What you can't understand
These retarded apes
Are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly agin'
Please get out of the new one
If you've got no diamond hands
For the market is a-changin'

The line it goes up
Despite short ladder attacks
So get on the rocket
Before, off it blasts 
We're going to the moon
And we're going there real fast
The order is rapidly fadin'
And tendies soon
we will amass 
For the market is a-changin'"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Just remember if you have enough money you actually get paid to get together and talk investment moves but if you’re a retail investor you’re only allowed to eat shit and be manipulated by trillion dollar institutions.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I saw that same article, laughed my ass off when I realized what they were trying to do."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"my generation #@$bleepblop$#@ was better than yours because we drank out the car engine and were beaten by water hoses, we licked cow eyeballs for fun, our dinner was hot screws and cold ashes, fireworks was our bedtime story, we made pajamas out of cactuses, our shoes were hot coals. we lived through too many historic times. we wanted hot chicken sandwiches but got cold validity on mouldy bread. The sun was the moon and the earth wasn't flat yet, thomas jefferson came from mars and freed us from the evil empire of shadow frogs and candy corn puppys drove yellow and orange painted rainbows."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"God, I hate how much this is proving how much of big media corporations are dedicated to market manipulation and preserving the status quo."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. This is the same reason I joined in. I don’t entirely understand all the numbers and lingo yet but I’ve been studying Psychology for the better part of a decade and, the minute I saw the powers-that-be start to freak out, I knew I had to join in. I could damn near taste the fear and it tasted gooooood. It tasted like green crayons for days."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Now extrapolate that media manipulation to every other sphere of influence and power...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think this is what they call ""fake news."""
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Us retards don't give a shit about their news. Institutions don't give a shit about their news. The only people they might scare are the normies over in r/investing and r/stocks. Hodl, my fucktards. Hodl."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"According to TDA, GME is held at a 106.22% by institutions, so I""m sure retail isn't having much affect at all on the situation at hand here.  Its like a battle between the titans and olympians but the media is putting the blame on those who bought tickets to watch the event.

The media has been a joke for at least 20+ years and its crazy how so many people will slurp up all the shit they spew."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is where the group description is spot on: like 4chan got a hold of a Bloomberg terminal. 

I never understood how people fell for conspiracy theories till I joined this group."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Would have been nice to see a screenshot of it too, crazy stuff."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,SPEND STUMULUS ALL ON GME!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The things is, this approach works on traditional, conservative, risk-averse investors. It's why Hindenburg et al run short and distort ops. It works. It's easy and inexpensive. Aphria almost got slammed by a hostile takeover in 2019 because of exactly that. Shares lost 50% and took forever to recover.

But now a new breed of investor is changing that dynamic. One used to social media stupidity, unphased by rumor because all that matters is the DD. And follow the money. To use Hindenburg again, if they have most of their stake in a short, and they are running the same playbook for the 10th time, probably worth not just taking their word for it."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I saw an article that said something like “Should you buy gamestop stock? The short answer is no”. You know shit stinks when an article gives an answer to the question in the title, it doesn’t make sense"

There are more articles about selling GME than ones that don't mention GME at all. Half the articles about other stocks say ""Don't buy GME, double down on this huge growth stock"" while saying retail momentum is ""drying up."" 

I can think of a few people that have probably never heard of this whole crazy GME thing. I bet most people in 2008 didn't know about VW until it was over...what a shame.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"They definitely think we are retarded, but they also know that the common American citizen will only read the headline of a story and then base their thinking off of that. It’s not meant to scare people who are already in GME, or even the people who are on the fence. It’s for the people who know very little about it (which at the moment is a large majority), and they want to keep it that way."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao.. I'm not a fan of Trump at all, but this has just been sad.

$1400 is not going to take someone out of poverty, and it's insulting to imply that. We may be poor (okay I'm not that poor, but I make little enough to get the full amount and live in a very high cost of living area), but we're not all stupid. I'm still happy to get it, but I'm not going to act like it's ""showering money"".. that's the billion dollar bailouts for rich people."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How about NBC having a headline saying something like “Shout it from the rooftops! $1.5 trillion Covid bill delivers stimulus and a political fight” and in the article it was saying how Democrats are betting they already have the key to success in the midterm elections” and the article talked about it was such a gruesome task to get the bill passed BUT they still one hard part left to do... “persuade voters to reward them” .... like what??

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s literally what this movement is about. It’s a fucking protest that is actually getting the attention from the chiefs without the need for violence and riots. A simple loophole that just needs people to hold hands and shares together as one. 

It’s about helping your neighbor and ruining the corrupt. It’s not and has never been about race or sex, Money has never cared about race or sex. It’s about love to your fellow ape.

That is why I will always own gme for the rest of my life. Of course i will take some profits as it goes up. But i will never not have gme in my account. Even when we hit 1trillion / half share. If 1/3 of America bought one share we win. It’s just not worth the risk to sell."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You have to understand, that a monitor like that is not a commonly purchased item. With the speed that new monitors come out, it would be stupid to stock them, and they would end up losing money. Thats not even getting into how much store space they will take up. 

Even microcenter normally doesn’t have stuff like that in stock and if they do, they have 1 or 2 of them.

Expensive PC gaming hardware is a very niche market. They should have normal gaming hardware in stock (mid tier gpu’s, keybords, mice, maybe a few 240hz monitors, some mobos and cpu’s) but imo makes no sense to not stock BFGD’s."

But to use any of US military equipment (from where hollywood gets it's tanks, jets, etc.) you need to agree that your script will be reviewed and if needed edited by them (the author was complaining that the returned script pretty much changed everything about the movie, and his only options was either accepting it, or not making the movie at all), and I'm pretty sure that every marvel movie had at least some of military hardware in them, so most likely all of marvel movies were vetted or even ghost written by US military. 

And i kind of understand that if you want to use theirs equipment, it makes sense that they get to say what you can do with it, but it still doesn't sit well with me how much power it gives to them over our culture."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes and no. Whales are retail and retail has grown in it's influence (above HF's) and may be a driving factor for the increased volatility and spikes we're seeing coupled with retail now getting access to leverage. Institutions are giants, but they for the most part are slow moving and very regimented in their movements, while they can affect the market, they try not to. HF's are generally larger than an individual retail, but as a whole they are smaller than retail however due to them being the active ones they have had an outsized effect on the market and create noise. Now that retail basically has similar access and similar tools, they too can effect the market and create noise."

It was seen as patriotic to do it and many Americans helped the country win the war by doing it. And it wasn’t just Hollywood. Baseball players were a huge help in selling war bonds as well.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,They do have that online. They actually go through DoorDash and it’s a fixed 4.99 delivery fee I believe. I used it for Fenyx Rising
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Amazon doesn't have same day delivery in my area, I live right next to a distribution center, literally 5 minute drive next to my local walmart, most we get is next day, funnily enough, we got a gamestop between the Walmart and Amazon buildings"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"True, but I never resell my games. Even if it's a single player one time walk through and I never touch it again. Even selling them on eBay or locally to strangers you really don't get much return on investment. I just hodl all my old games I have in disk form anyway so I decided a while ago to stop buying disks and only buy digital. 

The ability to switch between games without having to load different disks is nice, plus it's easier on the system not having to spin the disk when your playing it. Although this is just a fucking wild guess and I have no facts to back it up. It just sounds good in my head."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"F For all Fry’s.
Terrible loss to everyone.
Sad to see it go."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fry's died because it failed to keep pace in E-commerce and then a feedback loop from adopting a pay-after-sale model to suppliers sealed their fate as they couldn't sell relevant products anymore. Microcenter is a prime example of what Fry's did wrong, done right. Gamestop could learn from that and carve out a brand that focuses specifically on gaming hardware, largely through e-commerce, but also potentially in stores. As for how they can establish an advantage over other companies, that remains to be seen."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Microcenter definitely is the mainstream pc gaming market. What can you not find that you need for PC gaming at a microcenter? They have everything even advanced water cooling hardware. They also have the lowest prices. 

I have 16 shares of GME, so don’t get me wrong I’m rooting for them, but I’m also a pc gamer and a pc builder (built and sold custom pc’s for a few years) and microcenter is going to be a VERY hard place to compete with, especially when it comes to pricing."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, AMC has been open here for a while, but the closest cinemas to me are Regal. They closed for months, reopened briefly, and have been closed again for about 6 more months so far. Part of me at this point would be surprised if they ever came back. AMC needs to ride out until things get back to normal; places can only stay shut down or operated under limited capacity for so long until they just can't afford to stay operating anymore."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,its coming though
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I get that, I’m just not a fan of the “yeah you own it, but no you cant sell it”. If you cant sell it, then do you really own it??

When i was a kid, trading in games at gamestop was how i got a lot of my new (pre owned lol) games. That experience will always stick with me and maybe its why i feel how i do now. Yeah they ripped me off, and even at 10 years old i knew i was getting ripped off, but something is better than nothing lol.

I would switch to 100% digital if there was a marketplace that allowed reselling of used digital games. But we all know thats never gonna happen."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I loved going to Fry's as a kid. I was so sad when I popped into one a couple of years ago and it was just a ghost town...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That vast majority of movies would absolutely be a waste of time to write.

What makes you think the government controls Hollywood movie writing? Can you explain to me what/how they do it? Which movies have they edited or prevented from being released?"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,If AMC survived Spanish flu they can survive C19.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah my one gripe with digital games is you can't buy pre owned so you have to wait for a sale, but usually the sales are you only the console store, and the sale usually only brings it to the price of the used version or somewhere in between. 

I used to cheese gamestop hard as fuck right after I got my license. I'd buy a brand new game that just came out, beat it, and return it within 7 days for full price. Beat the fuck out of game fly 😂"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't have any proof of these secret CIA programs, but you'd have to be willfully ignorant to think that the government doesn't have a hand in the movie industry to some degree.

You could do the bare minimum of research and find tons of shit, but I doubt educating yourself on the matter is of any concern to you.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Was talking more of an uncertain future for the other chains, which would be good for AMC If a lot of other cinemas closed. Less competition and more potential real estate they could pick up. I do think AMC had a chance of flopping before everyone started buying their stock, but now is situated better off than the other cinema chains."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you name a movie they would have likely written the script for? Or edited? I did my research. I can't find one.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not just buy shares?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great loss porn, thank you. 

I lost 100k+ over the last 3 weeks and I have a WSB port. The reason why it’s not less [than 100k] is bc I bet on short dated options. The reason why it’s not more is bc I don’t bet 40% of my NW on 3 standard deviation otm, short dated options. Read ‘A Man for all Markets’ by Ed Thorp. Don’t mean to lecture but I’m willing to risk looking like a douche. 

There are plenty of infamous WSB tales that describe miraculous resurrections from the depths of bankruptcy. Looks like you still have $ to stay in the game so you *will* come back but #dont# chase your losses."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"aw mann,  buy shares from now on!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s not over till expiration

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro all my 800c are dated fucking NOVEMBER 2021 and I got those for like $500 a piece.

People need to understand that THE PRICE DOESNT MATTER.  What you need to do is GET THE RIGHTS TO AS MANY SHARES AS POSSIBLE FOR THE LOWEST PRICE by both shares and options.  This is a binary trade; it will squeeze or it will not.  If it does, it sure as shit will be above 800.  Get the cheapest long dated options you can to supplement your shares."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I didn’t hear no bell 🛎
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What does your wife think about your brilliant move? We deserve a story
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the post. Learning from the replies. I too made a really stupid decision that I knew was very stupid before I clicked the buttons.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Are those 800 calls lmao
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You guys are pissing away your money back to the hedgies.  This is not coming close to $800 with 30% short interest.  I was amazed it hit $350 again the other day.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I used to think that trends/predictions could be made when it came to stock prices, but lately the price movements make no sense at all.

Now I'm trading stocks like how I used to in a game called Neopets: check once a day if sell or buy targets are reached, buy or sell the stocks, then wait for the next day

Would be funny if this works in the long run LOL"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,">Exactly. Besides most of us are too dumb to play around with options

Bro do you know where you are?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Really confuses the gap ups and gap downs
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is what happens when influx of idiots read half of the posts and think they're superman. I don't feel bad for these tards losing their shit on options. There is a reason there are warnings and you sign shit. Do your research if you want to make money. The shit isn't easy. If it was everyone would be rich.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I know roughly nothing about options but fucking A did I know holding those bad boys til expiry is literally the wrong play
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,At least yours are in July though. While I still think it's crazy yours are a lot less crazy

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Works every time 😉
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think with GME it’s hard to tell - shit is a gamble in general right now. If it’s “the day” that 800c would’ve printed huge and he’d be a hero for the yolo. I’m holding a couple 400c’s into next week and the theta is already fucked but if it gets to 340 it’ll be profitable again. 

Actually I’m probably just justifying my shitty decision not to close it. Fucking hate holding weeklies."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cold, but fair and on point. WSB promotes and idolize retards as a joke, but people actually act retarded and, if to take OP’s word, lose their life savings. To me this is sad and could have been so easily avoided. Why would you trade something you know nothing about and don’t understand? Even in a casino, you play the games you at least know the basic rules of, right? Smh"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh when I said I buy and sell, I was talking about setting buy and sell limit orders 😅 I got too used to making limit orders that I didn't specify, whoops

Edit: Thanks for the advice though!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,My advice. Don't do it. They're called FDs for a reason
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s too late now since these are carry overs but I won’t hold to expiry. I’ll either cut my losses Monday or try to roll them for something next week closer to ITM to make the premium back flipping them off volatility. If I’m doing an FD then I’m at least going to try and put on some lipstick.

800 OTM though, yeah, that’s always going to be a no from me."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,My credit union (SCTelco) got merged with Spero. Damn it!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait til your patient starts having one in real life. That’s a shift ruiner.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, they didn’t put a clawback in. It’s just like the last two."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmfao. I can always count on this sub for a laugh.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It's hard staying away with all you apes in here having your extra chromosome only orgy.  I bought in for the first time yesterday.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah. Honestly I couldn’t figure it out then. The app is still ugly as hell.

I just want one of these other brokerage institutions to create an app as easy to use and navigate as RH. Then I’ll switch over."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Schwab and TD are trash
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well not literally anything, because Fidelity def sucks."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Instant money transfers?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,We’re gonna hold and wait for you
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So if you filed already then it’s based on 2020 but if you haven’t yet then it’s based on 2019
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean I prefer to have my money in a place where the broker won’t manipulate the market and potentially cause me to lose thousands you know like they did just recently.

But yeah I guess it’s ugly."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,He asked what’s better than robinhood.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s credit technically but yeah
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,you need to pay your 2020 taxes to get the stimmy?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I doubt if that made him feel better.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree its probably better than RH but to what extent?  TD (now owned by Schwab) has been playing games - Shwab played them in Jan.  Now passing on the fuckery.  There are lots of complaints about how they're handling GME (and AMC) in the TDAmeritrade sub.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,lol they didn’t manipulate the market. They had to comply with clearinghouse capital requirements and got screwed in terms of liquidity like most other brokers
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just want that’s easy to use. It helps me make money better. 

It’s not fault only one brokerage firm has an app that wasn’t made a decade ago"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,1.9 trillion for this shit.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,From what I've read no.  They will just go off of your 2019 taxes.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Who else then
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,But the DTCC notified Robinhood that the capital requirement increase was cancelled before market open. Robinhood still blocked buying ...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It wasn’t cancelled
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but the DTCC specifies requirements for the clearinghouses so it’s not like that helps them"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"More or less. And why is that so wrong?

It makes earning money easier.

Truth is, RH has been treating me well. If a rival can come up with an equivalent app, I’ll switch over then."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"As volumes and volatility in the meme securities spiked on Wednesday, January 27, NSCC 
calculated and imposed a special charge under its rules that essentially accelerated collection 
of a portion of the following morning’s VaR charge for many clearing members with exposure 
to these securities. The imposition of the special charge, in addition to NSCC’s collection of 
intraday mark-to-market charges, reflected significant growth in risk in many clearing 
members’ unsettled portfolios. Final VaR charge estimates were updated at the end of day in 
the NSCC risk portal to reflect changes in each clearing member’s portfolio through the end of 
the trading day, and then updated overnight to reflect the impact of security price changes 
using Wednesday’s closing prices. Clearing members would have observed these updates in 
the NSCC risk portal.



Shortly after 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, January 28, NSCC’s daily margin statements 
were released to clearing members in NSCC’s risk portal and excess/deficiency notices were 
emailed according to NSCC’s standard operational timeline. Many clearing members whose 
unsettled portfolios were exposed to volatile meme stocks saw significant increases in the VaR 
charges that derived from the risk posed by increased volume and price volatility in these 
securities. Substantial VaR charge increases also generated capital premium charges for 
clearing members whose core requirements exceeded their capital cushions. Several clearing 
members were subject to capital premium charges, which were automatically generated by 
NSCC’s systems based on the formula in NSCC’s rules. 



*NSCC examined the market activity and clearing member margin requirements to consider 
whether it would be appropriate to adjust or waive the capital premium charge, as permitted 
under the applicable rule. NSCC determined that the spike in market volatility, particularly in 
the so-called meme stocks, was a material contributor to elevated VaR charges for several 
clearing members, including most of those subject to capital premium charges. NSCC 
determined that it would be appropriate to waive the capital premium charge for all clearing 
members, using the discretion provided in the rule to reduce or waive this charge. Just after 9 
a.m., prior to the market opening at 9:30 a.m., updated daily margin statements reflecting the 
waiver were released in NSCC’s portal and revised excess/deficiency notices were emailed to 
clearing members. All clearing members timely satisfied their clearing fund requirements.*

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That only says they reduced it some, not the entirety of the requirement. By the end of January 28th DTCC requirement increased to $33.5 billion, up from $26 billion. For a company like Robinhood where over 50% were invested in the stocks that had increased requirements, it was a significant increase that they couldn't handle."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is what it is. But there’s nothing stopping a “real brokerage firm” from creating better looking apps.

Once that happens, I’ll gladly switch over."

2021-03-13 00:36:05,wallstreetbets,"Why UWMC has Value in Both the Long and Short Term Full Disclaimer: Not financial advice, I eat crayons.

United Wholesale Mortgage is an amazing buy that I think has both long term and short term potential. I will admit, I don't know a lot about stocks, but when I look at UWMC I see value town for days. I wouldn't call this DD because I just googled stuff.

**Who Is UWMC and What Do They Do?**

UWMC underwrites loans for brokers, banks, and credit unions. They do it all- FHA, Conventional, VA, the works. Their primary business however seems to be with brokers. Now what is a mortgage broker? No really I had to google this to get a better understanding. Mortgage brokers essentially take your info, screen it, and then look at the variety of home loan options available to you and aim to get you the best deal in return (usually) for a small fee. Mortgage brokers currently make up a little over 20% of the housing market vs. 7% 2011 and 16% in 2019. They essentially help people find the best deal on the market to help finance their home, and seem to be popular among millennial homebuyers. With mortgage brokers shares growing in the mortgage space this gives UWM great growth potential (I think).

**What is UWMC's Edge?**

Now what differentiates them from other companies? Well one is their fast turnaround times. UWMC proprietary tech that allows for the quickest turnaround time in the market due to streamlined efficiency. That tech alone makes them convenient for the broker and home buyer. This makes the loan process insanely fast vs their competitors who can take a longer time to close the deal. They've built strong relations within the broker community and appear to have a symbiotic relationship with the brokers they work with.

**UWMC Ultimatum**

There's been a lot of speculation over that Chad Ishbia's ultimatum to the brokers- sign the addendum by 03/15 saying you will halt working with Fairway and RKT. Well 90% of their brokers signed it, so I think this narrative is overplayed quite a bit. Like I said, UWMC and brokers work together to profit in a symbiotic fashion. Brokers are the face and voice you see UWM directs them traffic, they each get a cut, both walk away happy with fast turnaround times/best deal for their customers. According to UWMC, RKT has gone out of their way to bypass broker's. RKT is better off offering them a rate, bypass the broker, make more money cutting out the middle man (I may be under simplifying this or have it wrong). Rocket Mortgage is not interested in working with individual brokers when they have an in house team to help keep it all in the family.

**The Value Short Term**

Short term I think we have a few key things coming up.

* [u/faisall1](https://www.reddit.com/user/faisall1/) is convinced there's a short squeeze, if you wanna see his DD on that it's here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3o6bu/uwmc\_part\_4\_when\_the\_squozes\_keep\_on\_squoozing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3o6bu/uwmc_part_4_when_the_squozes_keep_on_squoozing/) I hope this is why I've been getting fed red crayons.
* Addendum Deadline is 03/15, looks like a majority of brokers have agreed which at the very minimum shouldn't hurt their bottom line. Looks like a win-win for the UWM-Broker channel
* Russell 1000/3000 Addition on 03/22
* Q1 Earnings Report after destroying their Q4 numbers. Housing volume Remains low, demand remains high. Despite Treasury Yield + Mortgage Rate Increase I think we're gonna see good numbers here. Also I like dividends.

&#x200B;

**The Long Term Value**

The individual broker is not going away, UWM has made quick turnaround times standard for brokers and homebuyers increasing the speed and quality of service you get from an individual broker. The growth of the broker sector is a positive for both homebuyers and UWM, I like my quarterly dividends, and the stock is just way too undervalued here. Every analysis I see online has a target price of $11\~$13, so it's at a discount at $8.30 right now. UWM has rock solid financials. UWMC has a PE of 6.17 and PS of 3.84 vs. RKT with a PE 2.06 and a PS of 8.46. Look, I'm not the smartest guy, but I can clearly see that UWM has a distinct edge in the home loan market. I think UWM has a wide valuation between $11\~$16 in a fair market all things equal.

I took my tendies and yeeted them all into UWMC. 374 share and x3 $9 calls 05/21.

&#x200B;

TL;DR UWM has been feeding me red crayons, but I feel like it's gonna give me green ones soon. I like dividends because I'm big boomer."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great post! After learning more about UWMC I have invested more into the stock. Currently around 50% of the loan process uses manual effort and there is an opportunity to utilize automation tools like UiPath to increase automation which would save 5% to 10% of loan costs. There is other opportunities to automate some underwriting process which would further cut cost by 20% to 25% and UWMC is working on all of this. They are making applying for mortgages a lot easier, faster, and cheaper.

The brokers will love this. They get a fully automated mortgage application system, cuts out lengthy human activities, ensures all federal, local laws are met.

Highly recommend reading the detailed report on street guru. https://www.reddit.com/r/streetguru/comments/lwx13l/uwmc_deutsche_says_proprietary_technology_is_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"My mortgage is with UWMC. 

When we started the process my broker said “we have to get everything in a row pretty fast, if we don’t close within 3 weeks we have to start over”

I was a little shocked, but a little over two weeks later I was a homeowner."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Does anyone know approximately how many shares need to be purchased following Russell 1000 and 3000 inclusion?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I purchased $9 5/21 calls...you apes think I'll be ok?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I give the housing market and all surrounding industries a life span of 2-3 years before another crash. Short term investment is nice but jump off before it bursts.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"New accounts love this ticker. This is sus, 100%"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Rising interest rates, combined with extremely low housing inventory. Is going to make this a bad play."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,And they aren't trying to cut the feet out from underneath Brokers and loan officers
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Both good investments
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Retard here, like stonk, 127@8.97"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That is why it is heavily shorted.  However, rates are still historically low and people avoided moving (if possible) during covid so the inventory is likely to jump this spring."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I would know
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s just going to boost broker revenues with faster turn around!

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey, it ain’t going to get to $10k unless someone buys it at $490. If apes are really going to the moon, then you still got a steal of a deal"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just means you're on the front lines, hodl strong we'll come get you on stim-monday."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Time to learn how to sell covered calls.  We’ll be up there in a week or two

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You, fellow 💪🦍 are a 💎👐 warrior. We're coming for you! 🚀🌕"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,when (not if) that shit turns green you need to record your reaction or some shit
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How cold is it up there at the peak?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Nope... bought amc... then they pulled it 😞
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you averaged down since then
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"yea, that and a wash sale, I have some that are over $500"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh,  sweet baby Jesus. I've never seen one the high."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This fully sucks...but that's premarket trading for you.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"pff robinhood would not execute my call debit spreads in the green. and ended up executing minus 50 dollars instead of +200 dollars..

i mean it aint much but still...fuck. Shit would not trigger unless i was way under bid... some BS i tell u.

So on that note.. i do not reccomend robin hood if you are buying ANY spreads be it credit spreads, debit spreads, etc.. robinhood will some how fuck u over (cant set the limit price on each leg simultaneously etc unless u have like 100k in ur account and sell each leg separately.)

Tho its great for just regular calls or puts. It is what it is.. somehow robinhood will give u a couple of tendies here and there but will fuck you at the worst possible time..."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That loss will one day be a gain. Just hold.

The squeeze has not been squoze"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,bought mine at 316 so not too far from ya
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I think this is literally the highest we’ve ever seen. Didn’t it go up only like $3 more?!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I give you the rank of Ape
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Oof. We got u tho

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"For a sec I thought you bought from me, but I checked, it was 489. No worries, put it all back in around 60."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Getting closer mate.  Hold strong.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let my start by saying I don't know much. I don't think I would buy much, if anything at pre market. Selling sure, but buying at premarket seems like a great way to lose a lot of money."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Think I'll be rolling my PYPL options profits into more GME. We're coming.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,They sold mine below a value that was even listed on the whole day.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,No ape left behind. Keeping doing what you have been. We’re coming for you!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I've been under a rock. What'd robinhood do this time?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,we’re on our way
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, you need to send that screen shot to one of the law firms suing RH.  
Since your loss wasn't caused as the direct result of your own 'tardation, you don't qualify for your ape badge yet."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Legend
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel a whole lot better about myself so thanks for that.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didn’t buy at peak, but I was in the day before at 30 around $315 each. I feel your pain, but this rocket ain’t finished mooning yet."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you fucking boofing your crayons? Oral hurts less.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought I was the biggest paper hands here...I was wrong, thanks for giving me hope !"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Average down?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,World record for most autistic
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine if you can also sell the highest somehow. Some dude in GME had a contest for a milli for whoever can prove they sold the highest once the squeeze pops off
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yoooooooo
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How exactly does this happen when the stock is at $260?

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha I wish man
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"lol. I paid low teens for my AMC. When it dropped a bunch I almost cried. But they i was like ""shit, it will climb up once movies open. Or I'll have a writeoff"".  Pisses me off as I was up a bunch when I got GME at 45/86 and sold in the 140 range."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Trust me I would’ve done that by now, but it was a yolo....beginners mistake"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea if he has the money. That’s an option
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I sold 500 shares at $500 so it most definitely DID get that high.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"U can buy, u just have to set it as a ‘limit buy’ and type in the price you want instead of a ‘market buy’ which could be anything during premarket and AH. It happened to me before too. But we all learn. Welcome to the club you retard"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the webull apps UI retard

Do you think market orders before market open are a concept unique to Robinhood?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bull fucking shit. I bought gme in premarket at 245. Also ah yesterday same price, 245.01. By the time market opened it was already 270. You have no clue what you’re talking about"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I saw $515 with my own eyes

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jeez, the fomo was real"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It hit 500+ in after hours
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Some1 bought at market price. Thats a no no. Set orders to limit so you don't get screwed and you deff don't want to push into margin. But I suppose he made it in. Congrats fellow ape. Perhaps RH should have been uninstalled and maybe download a better app like WeBull.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It peaked at 514 I think the first time
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I was intimidated at $95 in January. I think people were just intimidated all the way down
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought at 455 sold at 489. This is impressive lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"As much as that stung, I feel better knowing it was only a single share for that price and not like 100 ><;"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Man, now that is buying the dip"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,BB @ $25.34 lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Shoulda averaged down when it dipped below 9.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought BB at $9.99. We both got in cheap, remember that when it hits $200"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,$18 bb checking in
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,BB was my desk-pop. Never doing that again.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,BB @ 18. BB will see the sun again!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought 20K of amc on the first rally, after hours, and set it to sell have if the price doubled. To my surprise I woke up with my 20K and half the AMC stock I had bought. I went crazy and yoloed it all in GME, AMC, BB, and NOK. Ended up like 40K down and the combination of the other market that shall not be named in this sub, and my very thinly paper hands, I sold. Thank god I invested what was left in the market that shall not be named and now I'm richer than I've ever been.

I'm so sad I missed the second rally, I'm a longtime crayon eating ape and will be for life, but will forever remember by paper hands blunder.

I really hope GME reaches a 10000 and all my fellow apes make 100 the money I've made in the past month. It will be bittersweet, but definitely more sweet than bitter.

💎✋🦍>🌈🐻"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude same here. Been slowly averaging down as I can afford to
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"My average price is like $14 :(. I did sell off some at $20 last time around, but just holding for now. I still think BB is a good long term investment, but I suspect unless hype takes it up it's going to stay in the red for a while."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got so lucky with amc, in at 2.70 in December and out at 22 in January the morning it popped. No idea how my order actually filled since the price wasn’t that high."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How many shares?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You bastard! 

Nicely done!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Congratulations and fuck you!
Now we need the buyer to post..."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m curious, when you sell after hours do you place a limit order GTC+ ext or do a market sell?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Paper handed bitch....
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly people should always be using limit buys regardless of the volatility of the stock.  It’s best to keep fate in your own hands rather than to leave it up to chance.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,No but Robin Hood’s order flow is notoriously not in favor of their users
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Robinhood doesn’t allow market orders before open tho or in AH. If you force set a market order before 9:30 you’re setting a market order *for open* not extended hours trading. Robinhood only allows you to select the order for extended hours trading if you have it set for a limit order. This dumbass just wasn’t getting the order filled and skyrocketed his limit price to instant buy and then blaming it on the broker.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow. 

You are retarded."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes I am. Yes I am holding my two shares.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the Thursday at the end of January where they halted trading. One of the only days GME was trading in the 400s."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is referring to January?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Only because of pay for flow.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Made almost $1,000 in 10 minutes"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats was the idea until RH fucked the wet momentum hole.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,God damn. The ~~rat~~ retard king.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I saw this and wanted to buy @ $25 too but it was @$11, I'm sad now because as I understand the market the higher the price that you buy the more success you have.  

&#x200B;

Do I really have to say that it isn't financial advice?  Not because I don't want to but because We can't read."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I averaged down on BB but it's still at $26.47, help 😬"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same lol ended up selling at a loss and making it all back and more with gme though, thank god"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wtf I didn't know it ever got that high
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are you implying I have money?

In reality I decided to pump into a few other stocks and just hold BB long term. It'll come back eventually and my other investments are doing fine, including my titanic 2 GME"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I'm not worried. I buy stocks to hold them because my brain is too smooth to day trade
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I initially bout at $10 then sold the day it hit $40. Realized i was a 🧻🤲. Then bought back in 5X at $18 the next day to redeem myself. My brain smoooooove
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, the only thing I regret about it is not getting in at a lower price. I'm still bullish on it, just as a longer term stock"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"500, also I’m Canadian so that’s a yolo in cad"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It is a separate type of order at Schwab. You can only place limit orders in after hours trading at my brokerage.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,A bird in the hand is worth two bushes or something like that.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It's only paper handing if you are selling at a loss
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So is every place that doesn’t do commission trading, they’re lumped together as smaller margin trades by market makers and get lower priority. Nothing special with Robinhood here, if you’re placing a buy and not paying for it, you’re getting lower priority on the trades in general."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea maybe by the order of milliseconds and cents not a hundred bucks
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah yes, I'm being an idiot. I didn't even look at his date stamp from purchase lol. My bad."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The date is on the screenshot bud
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the laugh, man 😅"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy high, sell never! That's the strategy, right?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck! How man? I thought I got in at the peak?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice man. Definitely a learning lesson so I ain't too upset. Definitely turned me off from buying into meme stocks, especially when they are going crazy."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah man, it was stupid, and I actually bought at $25.46. I was bummed I sold my shares of GME the week before for $40/share (got in at $11) and didn't want to miss another crazy ride.


I was fuckin driving home, refreshing RH and watching BB fuckin sky rocket along with AMC, GME and NOK, so I pulled over and bought some BB.


It was only 2 shares though so nothing insane.


And the 3 weeks leading up to the huge rise, I was buying weeklies on BB and all expired worthless. 


In all, I think I lost $400 on BB, and will never buy in again.


Still got my 2 shares though."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not financial advice, but since you have the shares to back it up, you have the option of selling calls, if you're not already."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh ok. I’m on TDA so it might be the same
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Every time I see Schwab I just hear Billy Madison.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,[idk](https://ibb.co/tsRH8j6)
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"They're a huge gamble, for sure. It's always better to invest in something you actually believe in and endorse. Good luck with your next one!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably. I feel like market orders could be pretty bad in after hours. Order book is really thin on some stocks.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I use TDA and they only let you buy/sell pm or ah with limit orders.  Even then you have to set it either EXT or GTC-EXT.  If you don't, it won't execute until market opens."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can't wait to eat breakfast crayons... Weekend treat
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol isn't that $26.35 CAD?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah, definitely been a big lesson. Though I did believe in BB at the time, there was some really solid DD and news but I let my emotions invest. Lol fucking $25"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Bad in what way? Too volatile?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s what i thought. Awesome thanks!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Unless you're the one buying or selling at pre market prices
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That's why I'm reterded
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,BB is for going long not instant gains
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Really bad fills. A market order will buy at the ask until the order is filled, potentially increasing the price. You could climb far up the book depending on the volume of the stock.  That's why I always use and recommend limit orders."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s for suckers. That does not mean the value of the share ever hit that number. It means someone put their shares up for sale at a wildly inflated price and someone else elected to buy shares at whatever price they could get them at pre market and Robin Hood just snatched them up. There are folks with limit sells of $10,000 a share sometimes."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol

Still holding them bags? I still got my 2 at $25. Don't think BB will hit again but who knows"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,">recommend

Looks like financial advice to me. Bake him away, toys."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,If you buy a scalped ps5 for 800 did you not just pay 800 for a ps5? Yes. So yeah. The shares did hit that number if someone paid for it for that cost. Is premarket and after hours pricing reliable? No. So was that purchase of the share over valued? Yes- but so is anyone buying now. And I don’t mean that to be against GME- I’m long GME because it’s gaining moment and I like the stock- doesn’t mean the current price is it’s true value. So using your value argument is invalid. But I can assure you I’ve sold shares in after hours and premarket. I clearly was given the “value” that I sold it for. So yeah. Did it hit that high during market hours? No. Clearly doesn’t mean that it never got that high.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a very good long
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol your gonna be eating those words
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hopefully, man! I do believe in BB and I'm still holding these bags"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly man this stock is going to blow up 2023 - onwards. Its a long hold but it will be well worth it !
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree, lots of potential and a solid company. I'm going to hold my shares for a long time but I'm okay with that and maybe I should average down."
2021-03-13 00:27:20,wallstreetbets,RBLX YOLO LETS GO BOYZZZ 
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ouch.  I was tempted to get in at 45.  When they jacked it to 67 pre-offering, I backed off. 

Glad I did.  I'll wait for a month to see how the price changes."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I'll buy in at $35 in a month
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Too soon IMO, but in 2 years you’ll be happy with that decision."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hope you didn’t buy the peak :)
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That would be fuckin' insane.  That's beautiful.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You just described the futures market.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah. Wsb cares about retarded bets like this
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol let’s see
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought so, not sure if the programming code or the game systems would allow outside constant market updates, and that's a fair amount of streaming data. I might look further into what it would take to make that happen or if it even possible.


The beautiful thing is smart people that have a good grasp of the market would make back enough robux that they wouldn't have to use real currency purchase more robux. Of course losers in the market would be buying robux like crazy to try to beat the market. Talk about hitting the gamblers bug early on children."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Based on the financials in their S-1 I was guessing around $30 PT. It's pretty similar to something like BMBL, highly competitive field with a track record of losing money, they have to manage to squeeze way more money out of existing users before they get eclipsed by a new competitor (which has historically happened constantly with both video games and dating apps). 

Price goes up at first because people don't look at fundamentals, and most retail traders can't easily short without options."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The fact that this isn't one of the top posts on the front page saddens me. Congrats and fuck you.

- have been following ur updates so pls continue to do so and/or if u start ur next yolo"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been off VIAC since it tanked at earnings, and have been betting against it for the past two weeks.  Most of my money has been on puts, but luckily I had some back up call options, and that's kept me at slightly above break even.
But I remember your post two weeks or so ago.  It was so outrageous, because it was in the low to mid 60s and you had all these penny call options starting at 75, 80 and 90.  It seemed like you were too cheap to buy at 70.  And 70 call options were less than 50 cents.  I recall it was only 600 dollars worth of options total."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just looked at that VIAC chart and cant believe I havent seen this ticker mentioned on here before. 

How are you guys making all this damn monayy 🚀"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Sold my March 19 80 Calls 2 weeks ago for 125$
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Obligatory charge your fucking phone

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I went in at $45 because of Paramount+. But only bought shares. Never thought ~$100 was going to happen in months. Shit doesn’t make sense and I was watching the threads around VIAC like a hawk

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Does that mean it’s not too late for us? Lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,No shit... 2 weeks ago you started?! I’ve been in this for months and never really was convinced we were gonna see gains like this. What made you send it?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m iffy on balls deep calls now. Profit margin has changed. I don’t know that I see more than $110 from this before some whale wrecks ship. 🤷🏽‍♂️
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes..
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Not for a year +...😜. I just remember it being flatlined for years. Wish I’d seen your DD...would have climbed aboard. Just curious about what changed a year or so ago.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine if 500k was in those calls instead of shares
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Seriously the people saying to get off RH right now during the squeeze are just idiots who can’t think of anything original or clever to say
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Mind if I ask what else is in your portfolio as it’s only showing 50whatever percent of GME?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck you.  Congrats
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Right. It’s so annoying. Everyone who posts RH has people telling them not to use the broker they want to use.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"By my math this guy has over $10,000,000 in his Robinhood account"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,For real. 5k to 3 mill. As far as we know. Wish you luck in the future too. 💎👐🚀
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,every morning after confirmation bias
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,yes. i only had 4 figures last year
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,He likely bought them several months ago when it was sub-25 so he's WELL in the money now. Basically a money printer at this point
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, the calls' strike price is $25, and the call is currently worth $241.33(x100, for 100 shares) per contract, with a quantity of 10 contracts. = $241,330.00 total value of all contracts

Meaning that he bought the contracts thinking that GME would go above $25. And now he is very far ITM (in the money), with GME at $265

If you subtract the current value of the contracts by the total return so far, you can find how much was originally paid for them. 

$241,330 - $235,730 = $5,600 for 10 contracts = $560 paid per contract

$560/100 shares = $5.60 original contract pricing. $5.60 --> $241.33 = $235.73 gain per contract price. 

$235.73 gain in contract price, x100 shares, x10 contracts = $235,730 total return

Hope this helps and isn't too confusing."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not exactly. From the screenshot here it seems he paid about $5600 total for this call. That means he paid $5.60 for each contract (since each contract is 100 shares and he bought 10). That number comes from subtracting the current value of this call ($241,330) minus his total return ($235,730). That number gives you the total amount he paid for this call (the $5600 from above). A $25 call exp 4/16 means that he’s betting the price will be $25 or higher on 4/16. That $241.33 you see is the current price of the each contract, a MUCH higher price than the $5.60 he paid for them. As the stock price rises, so does the price per contract. He must have made this call quite a while back if he only paid $5.6 per contract. I hope this clears it up a bit."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"donations, chicken tenders, and a cybertruck"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"All jokes aside, easy to hold, but not easy to buy. He bought 1/5th of that at around $250-$350, so he suffered major losses on the way down. Even so, that is still hindsight of entire portfolio, because for all we know, his avg could've been $300+ for a long time.

Low average may be due to luck sometimes, but often times it's from good position-sizing, risk management, patience, and timing. My average buy is way higher, in the $250-$300 range, bad decisions due to fomo. But I'm not going to blame it on my [small] stack size, or luck, or anything else. Often times we're trading based on % of portfolio.

OP did good here to get it that low even with those buys at the top. Sometimes, you just gotta YOLO."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,the rest is $CUM $ASS and $AMC

Oh I mean more money because he got in in December like a genius, congrats"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that makes perfect sense, thank you! I'm pretty good with the numbers, its just understanding the ""lingo.""

He can exercise these options at anytime, right? Can he exercise before hitting the strike price? He doesn't have to wait till the expiry date before exercising does he?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You have explained options better than anyone else on here.

Thanks!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you! So what's the advantage of this call versus just buying shares? Are calls cheaper than buying shares?

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hi five
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,$GME DFV
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Every dollar above the break even point on his 10 $25 calls earns him $1000. That should put him somewhere around $240,000."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"No problem! You can exercise a call at any time before expiry, though you are not able to exercise before the strike price is reached."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you expect the price to go up by a certain date, it's cheaper to buy options.

For example, let's say the current price is $260 and I think the price will reach $360 by next week. 

I could buy 100 shares for $26,000 or I could buy an option that gives me the right to buy 100 shares, and that option would cost me maybe $1000 or so (option prices fluctuate heavily based on many factors, mainly the price of the shares and the time until they expire, more time means more expensive).
 
Now there's several things that can happen: 

Scenario 1: the price went down to $240.
In both cases, you'd be out $1000. In the case of shares you can choose to hold (shares don't expire) or sell for $1000 loss. In the case of options, your option expires worthless so you threw away $1000.

Scenario 2: the price climbed, but only to $300. 
In the case of shares you could sell for a profit of $4000 
In the case of options you'd still be losing $1000 (note that maybe you could have sold the option for a profit before expiration as the price of the share went up).

Scenario 3: the price climbed to $400
This is where the option shines. Your $1000 option now made you $3000 in profit. For a nice 300% return. (400-360-10) = 30 per share.  
Your shares will give a higher total return (400 - 260) = 140 per share for 14000 in profit. But the percentage profit is a lot lower. 

So if you bet correctly, with the same amount of money you can make a lot more profit with options, but options are also more likely to expire worthless if your bet was wrong."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,thank you!! will be reviewing many options

The music for todays post is **Terrible Bear Attack** by **Bongripper.**  Put it on.  The entire album is good. In fact just start from **Reefer Sutherland** and work your way up to it.

**This is not financial advice.  I am not a professional.  Tell me when I am wrong.**

I have a lot of calls in March and April 

You should listen to nothing I say Bruh

But look bruh...

Bruh, I'm Glad your back bruh,

Dude bruh I was so high bruh... I was so fuckin' high...

and everything was cool Mann and then like I smelled smoke brooo

Shit was on fire mannn  and it was the **50 day MVA** and it was over my head bruh,

you don't understand bro

# The 50 day MVA was over my head 

Today started out like many others, GOEV bulling out the gate and just destroying shit. We did this before. Released the hordes over ran silly sell walls, kicked in doors took plunder and moved on.  In the distance was the prize. Gleaming 16$.  It was the only thing between us and the sick GammaRamp Dildo of Naughty Gainz posting.

We ran up on it, Got pushed back, Ran up on it again and again got pushed back off the stage, Voltron jumps up, swerves fakes, and then does the Philadelphia eagle all over Gojira's face.

For the rest of the morning Voltron and Godzilla are fighting on a cliff edge for fucking hours.  Hours on this tightrope edge. Shit is going down. Couches are getting broken in half and thrown into the mc Donald's ball pit. The toddlers are running the daycare. The candy jar is empty at the nurses station. Fuck, I forgot its our anniversary again.

The party is on fire. There is no driver at the wheel.

But the crowd roars when Voltron drops a back cracker on Gojira.  Theres voltron kicking the shit out of a big lizard, people cheering from the balcony, hes looking hot. You're all smug looking at your mad gainz.   Gojira is all beaten up, getting tossed around.   Cup to Handle Voltron climbs on top of the ring and jumps arm out stretched, Gojira rolls out of the way and bam theres Mecha all dazed, Gojira starts winning some more fist fights, the mecha is sparking, slipping... loosing his groove...

the fans we're a little nervous, some people are even switching to some copium..

""We want them to accumulate SI here...""  ""When the big boys get back from lunch, they'll make the move. Junior traders don't know the MechaBot kungfu and aren't authorized to deploy lightning sword...""

Round 12:30 the handle started smoothing out and the bull flag banner started to lean farther and farther over till...

12:50 on the money Godzilla just straight kicks Voltron in the nuts

**World Star**

and that's exactly where everyone who bought tickets to this ride after 10:00 today was sitting.

**You just paid money to have a gigantic lizard kick you in your robotic nuts.**

I feel bad for you. But it will be ok. I mean that.

[This just in 500k$ Put order for 15$ strikes 3/19](https://u.teknik.io/GMsQO.PNG)

**This just in 700k in 2 minutes sell volume.**

**[This just in, Godzilla has some bigger balls than I expected.](https://u.teknik.io/Z2k4B.jpg)** credit Dustin Weaver off of deviant art. 

10 minutes later the bosses get back from lunch and want to know what the fuck just happened.

# Welcome to the Jungle... I was wrong about yesterday.

Today was the day shit got real.  A big boy woke up and put us on notice that they aren't going down without a fight.  Luckily we have the battlefield for now.  EVs are hot.  Capital seems to be leaving other plays and flowing to Canoo.  Macro is good. Nasdaq set for a run.  We got Roth in a few days and even with all that bear violence we performed well.  Our Gamma Ramp is  still quite lopsided see the [comment](https://i.imgur.com/LIsnoKy.png) below by /u/krvrotmg.  OI is positive... intraday selloff is irrelevant below.

I bought the dip a bit. Won't lie.  The thesis is still in place...  We took a beating and continued to raise the price this is highly bullish. However, You might still be holding a gun, but admit it... you got a little nervous there didn't you. I'll write something deep and thinky bullish for Monday.

In the end I will give the big lizard this.

That was a pretty fucking smart move.

Edit-1 if you want to see a deep breakdown into what actually happened check out u/rivaaal post on the matter in wsb"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I chose GOEV this morning for the first trade of my 1k to 1mil challenge.  Worked out real well.  Already sold though.  Might have to jump back in for step 3.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah she fell off a cliff 12:50 today but damn she was resilient through the afternoon in to AH. Wish I bought more right at the dip, the bubble truck is super cool, loved their media on it. The gamma ramp is still savage going into this week. Still might load up on more calls on Monday morning. 

I'm holding the 19th $15 calls right now. With stimulus, media, shorts and the gamma ramp starting to think the $17.5 could be sitting pretty by Friday."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought some 4/16 15c after it fell. Anytime I see a stock tank like that it’s an immediate sign I should get calls because I’m 100% retarded. Bought my ticket for the ride so let’s fucking go.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's pretty great... I'm glad you grabbed some profits, this, imho will become more volitile the closer we get to 16 and 17... As the shorts become more and more violent, I can expect the longs will also be equally as vicious as the gamma ramp loses value daily..

 I would say if you see the price begin to cross the 16.70 price range consider taking a large position.. the thing to study here imho is a point of no return.. where the magnatism of the open interest pushes the share price into intolerable levels... I think the SI is in at a cost average 18 dollars which might be lower now..."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is kinda hilarious... Welcome to the rabbit hole. If you have any questions be sure to ask well try and point you in the right direction

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It's literally about to squeeze itself... The gamma ramp is disgusting and it's nearing a point of no return... Som long is shoving them into a wood chipper
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate the insight, thanks"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,All in on $MOO and $GOEV
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you! I think my biggest weakness is doing DD, so I am thankful for folks like you. I made a few small profits today that I’ll probably put into GOEV shares on Monday, hoping for a small dip to buy in!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The higher the stock goes over $15 the more you make. Basically every dollar the stock price goes over $15 you make $300 ($100 for each of your 3 contracts because each is 100 shares). This is very simplied there are a lot variables that play into premium price. You can play with an options calculator for better numbers. 

Will it make you money? It might, there are no guarantees in the market. You might, you might not. There are a lot of variables that could make this go up. I like the potential based on my own research. This isnt investment advice yaddy yaddy, do your research and make the best decesion you can."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Stupid ape here. Just bought my first option trade. Following what you guys are saying. I have no effin clue what I'm doing. 4/16 15c. Am I doing this right?!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s the PT next week realistically? lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"for non-option people, buy on-the-open?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"No worries I hope you are a made man after your project, i'll drop a new post for Monday with the ortex data to check out..."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a team effort.. I'm glad you got in earlier than today
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This isn't financial advice but I made the same decision thinking that is the most risk adverse play that you can make right now that will net you some money that is OTM The reason why those are so pricy is because they are near the money so for them to break even they are what you bought them for plus the strike price it is highly likely they will achieve that... So at a sp of 17 they will be 2.50 or so... The real game is to buy something at .20 cents that turns into 10 dollars...

It's important to understand that the calls are essentially a method of determining trajectory my price so there is an optimal time to buy them and an optimal time to sell them

Plenty of resources on the internet though they can be hard to understand at times..."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That depends if we are successful in dragging the shorts into the woodchipper. At 16 the 17.5 calls really wake up and dance around, I estimate shorts are mostly in at a cost average of 17maybe less of the Short Interest increased today, At around 22.5 I can imagine the small ones popping and pushing on price at 30 all calls are ITM and then it's psycho...   each day that we don't get there the march 19 calls have less of an impact.. so I can imagine a big push..

Theres probably some catalysts coming up a lot of good press this weekend, stimmy checks and Roth conference.. 

So it's either like 18... Or 60 imho"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,We are entering a period of high volitility you should read up on cost averaging into a position if you have a lot of money... If it's a small position then there's usually an opening dip yes...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh I'm sure you will.  I perused your profile the other day when considering GOEV lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for the answer. So say shit goes south and doesn't work out..the max I will loose is $195? The premium is $1.95. I have been looking into and doing research also. I am just a little sketched out, seeing people loose all this money (thousands of dollars) saying they just found out how to use options trading. Can't tell if most of them are trolling or not. Again thanks for the help."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh it's still possible it's going to dip down past 14.90?

Any recommendations for buy limits here? I want to get in but at a good entry point obviously. With the ""squeeze"" you are making it sound like this thing is going straight up starting Monday (or atleast how my ape brain is interpreting it."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I take it you're using robin hood or webull?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey I gotta run for a bit but I'll be sure to answer your question soon
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes robinthehood. I have a td ameritrade account but not used to the layout yet.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks man, appreciate it!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cool, so Robinhood let's you trade what's called covered options. Options are a contract that is made between you and the seller of the contract that states you have the right to purchase shares of the underlying stock for the price agreed upon.  This is called the strike price, but it's really just the price that you can purchase the stock at. So You now own the right not the responsibility to purchase the stock at anytime between now and when the option closes. Some would say you have the OPTION to purchase the stock at the agreed upon price not the obligation. Option contracts are actually a bundle of contracts covering 100 shares. 

So the seller is betting that by the date the the share price will be ""out of the money"" or beneath the contract strike price and you are betting it will be above it. Because I'd you buy the right to purchase goev at 15 dollars for 100 shares and it's 30 dollars by the time the contract is up you now own 15 x 100 in value.  This is why options are called derivative products because they derive the value from what they contain not from the actual share of the company.

The price per contract represents money times 100 shares because it is the price per share so a 5 cent 3/19 30c is 5 bucks a contract... 0.05 cents per share x 100 shares = 1 call option contract.

If the Share Price at the time of expiry is 14.99 the option is worthless because you could just go to market and buy it there cheaper it just wouldn't make sense to ""execute"" the option on 99 percent of the situations. A short squeeze is actually one of the situations where executing makes sense for shorts underwater. 

So if I was going to sell you the right to buy goev at 100 bucks, that's a lot of risk for you and not a lot of risk for me so the price would be low... 0.05 cents per contract x100 contracts per bundle would be 5 bucks.  So you with 50 bucks could have 10 contracts... I take your 50 bucks and think I made a good trade...

Tomorrow UBER says they partnered. (A very real possibility) and it revalues the company at 75 billion dollars or so which is 20x it's current share price of so like 200 and now you have the right to buy 10 bundles of 100 shares at 100 dollars per share  that you could immediately sell that on the market for profit. So you spent 50 bucks but in the end will make (10,000 x 100 dollars) so 100,000 dollars) from 50...  But people will buy that form you for that much so you don't have to actually purchase the shares...  so the price of that contract would be 100 (with a little sugar on top for how much time is left on it) x100 per contract. Now what if the expiry of this contract was tomorrow... Is it very likely that the valuation of goev will be 100 tomorrow? No so that would be dumb to even buy for any money.. but what about in 2 years... Well that's way more likely and so the price will change based upon the likelihood of the sp achieving these prices..
.

So you wanna buy options when the stock is down because you get your max benefits like shares... 

You will never owe money on Robinhood because you can only buy or sell calls or puts that are covered. Covered means you set the shares aside 100 of them until expiry.. naked means you have enough big baller money to say hey.. I'm good for it... Naked options are where the theoretically infinity loss comes from sue to the fact that the share price could change infinitely... As in what if you needed 100 shares and there's only 101 and I knew you needed them so I could charge you whatever money I wanted... This is where naked shorting gets I to a problem...  Those calls you bought? Someone else is covering them or more likely a market maker worth billions is good for them. Robinhood wouldn't let you be that dumb... 

The last piece here is that market makers have to maintain a certain amount of shares on hand per every option they sell.. this is related to the Delta which is the change in price over time... So a Delta of .5 means that for every 100 shares a market maker has to own 50 if the price goes over the strike price or itm at expiry a market maker has to have 100 shares per 1 contract sold. So it goes and just buys it at market.  There are a metric fuckton of calls that are sold on goev that are approaching being in the money and when they do mm have to buy which drives up the price... I  actually suspect a bunch of gambling addicted apes are jack those numbers to Mars.  Making MM purchase millions of shares per every dollar of valuation. 

For example there are currently 26523 contracts for 3/29 17.5c 26523 x100 means those contracts represent 2.6 million shares.  When the SP hits 16 and it becomes more likely that it will be in the money market makers will go to market and purchase 265k shares and that's just for that one call for 1 dollar..

This is the real game your playing and how you fit into it my friend... 

Hope it helps"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So there are a couple of things here that are play. Shorts are currently not under water to the large extent of their position. 

The squeeze is only occuring if they spent their margins elsewhere and left their short positions open.  

They are in a hugley different position today than they were last Friday. Not only has the company been deeply revalued it is quickly becoming a hedge against Tesla. The market is also now more free with capital to spend on the growth sector

Someone built a really expensive gamma ramp that creates magnetism at certain price points related to the strike prices on open options at 16 plus because the 17.5 options will begin to have an affect on the share prices because market makers will have to buy shares to prepare for those options to be in the money.  This is why the violence today and why we have been gap opening every day...

As far as buy advice if you want to take a large position then you should look up cost averaging to secure your profits and losses against volitility, if you have a small position there is usually an opening dip, a lot of money expects this share price to be something way more expensive and soon"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Alot to take in. Thanks once again for taking the time to explain this to me. Another question if you have time. Say the call  (4/16 $15)becomes itm. Would I excersize it or just sell the option? I've read that majority ofcalls are sold and not excersized. Is this true. Also since the premium is 1.95, is that would I would loose if it expired otm? ($195)"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks so much for the thoughtful response man!

I was looking at the company more and really starting to like what I see. I think it will do very good this week, and even with the increased volatility, I feel that on-the-open might be the lowest *dip* we get all week and thus my best extry point.

Based on this, do you think I should:

1) Buy On-The-Open Monday at whatever price (limit 15.00).

2) Buy Good-Till-Cancelled at 14.40 or something and just hope it dips that low to catch?

(large order btw)

Sorry if this is too much just really want to master entering stocks at good timing."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I covered that in the above post comment :)

Another common question.

Yes the most money you would lose would be the money you out into it."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm actually not the right person to answer this question tbh let me find someone better to speak about it
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm in a similar spot as you in that I like this company long term. You can use options to get the price you like, which is part of my strategy. I have now 30 calls at various strikes and expires and cash on hand to exercise them if things are still looking positive down the road. I have 5 8/20 $10c that I plan to exercise no matter what unless the bull thesis on canoo changes dramatically. Having options and planning to actually take the shares for long term holding kind of removes the FOMO on high volatility days like today because i know I have another 500-1000 shares waiting for me at my price in the future.

 Just my $0.02."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"These highly volatile stock jump up and down ALL the time.

If you are going to put alot of money in, buy over time, using ""laddered"" limit buy borders, with good til cancelled.

Conversely, if you have experience with options and are FULLY convinced about the long term value of the company, sell cash covered puts. Or, more simply, get paid to buy the stock (as long as the price drops) 

Or buy some longer dated ITM calls. 

But DON'T YOLO into a large position. 

This week some dumbass bought ~1 million shares of DIS all at once with a market order. The price spiked like $10 a share in ~1 minute.

So that guy WAY overpaid.

Don't FOMO of gains. The price goes up, and the price goes down. Buy on a red day if you can."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Awesome thanks!

I’m not much of an options guy currently, so the limit GTC buy ladder sounds like my best bet. Though I’m not sure how to execute it well, such that I’m not sure specifically where those limits would be placed and at what intervals.

So let’s talk specifics so I can learn better.

Using the current 14.97 of GOEV as an example and investing $100k. My ladder might look like:

10k @ 14.10

10k @ 14.00

10k @ 13.90

...

10k @ 13.10

Is that how you would execute this ladder buy GTC strategy? Lower/higher limits? Smaller/larger intervals?

Thanks!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, I don't know what the current price is / future of the company, so this isn't financial advice.

First - options are a great way to limit losses as well. Using the following made up numbers:
Share price is $15.

An option expiring January 2022 at a $15 strike price has a $3 premium. 

So, you could buy 1000 shares ($15,000) or 10 call options (3*10*100=$3000)

Now, if the stock drops, you max loss on the options is $3000, whereas your shares it is $15,000.

Read through this, as it has a good explanation for options:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Vitards/comments/m3xdab/options_101_basic_options_overview/

OK, so, one thing to focus on is shares, not dollars.

So, I would setup limit buys as follows (again, made up numbers) :

1000 shares @ $14.51
1000 shares @ $14.01
1000 shares @ $13.51
1000 shares @ $13.01

And so forth downwards, and then walk the fuck away and don't touch them to move them up ""because you are going to miss out"". I fall for that all the time and end up buying higher than I would like, which limits my gains and increases my potential losses.

Assuming all of those get executed, your average buy price is $13.76 (or so), which is WAY Better than $15 if the stock is now trading at $13.01.

Every stock has a red day. It is better to buy the stock after a series of red days (consecutive daily losses) than it is to buy after a series of green days. Shares correct up and down ALL THE TIME."

In hindsight though, it was REALLY hard to see a deviation from the bullish uptrend that afternoon Wednesday before we got hit with a flash crash. Not gonna lie, trying to sleep last night was absolutely terrible, but feeling better and more optimistic for next week's trading, only issue is now my amount of leverage is complete peanuts."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it had a nice run this week, but if it’s expiring Friday and you’re holding Wednesday, even a 3-5% gain on Thursday (which normally is awesome) will probably result in a loss of value on the option. Unless of course you bought at open Thursday then sold a couple hours later after the 5% jump. It’s something you’ll get a feel for after trading options for a while. But yeah it definitely sucks to take a big hit like that in the beginning. When I started trading options I bet only a couple hundred bucks from my $43k portfolio until I got the hang of things, then I started to make bigger bets."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got way too optimistic. Started with 8k in Feb, brought a bunch of shares at $46, and sold last Monday, then brought those stupid one week contracts which hit $138k on Wednesday, saw the trendline being bullish and every $6 increment was a 10k profit I believe. It haunts me in my sleep that if I just brought them for March 19th, or April calls I would be more than golden right now. 

Honestly what gets me the most is that I didn't even try to break even or a little bit under cause I wanted it to go ITM after Wednesday. Even recouping a bit of leverage would set me up for a possible recovery this week. It bounced off $295 Friday around 10AM for a second, and then stayed under the entire day."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah it’s very easy to get greedy or to try to “at least break even” when you’re down a little bit but it’s a very slippery slope.. when I sell for a loss I see it as “ok cool I salvaged $800” instead of “crap I lost 90%” lol. You’ll be surprised how much a simple rephrasing works at making you feel a lot better about the trade. ☺️
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So It expired worthless Then?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think where I fell the most is trading psychology, numerically I was up 4800%, and I should've taken that and used that fat ass leverage into shares for next week. Really felt that ""pigs get slaughtered"" slogan."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn 4800%! I’ve never even been as high as 2000% lol I definitely would have cashed the F out at that point 😂but I have 3 years experience trading options so I can understand why you held on. But now you know and will crush it when you start up again. ;)
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, next time I'm setting a limit sell order for profit and the exit, sticking to those exit plans so I don't lose fucking 98% of my shit again.

The direction of the call was off by a millimeter, but what fucked me was pure greed and lack of execution."

/[Jcw122](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jcw122/) in case the auto mod deleted my reply:  
 Like I state in my DD, EXPI reached platform maturity this year and by that, I mean that they began reaping the fruits of their investments and work. Their net income transitioned from negative to positive as the platform matured over the last few years. Look at their YOY growth in their agents, the company's revenue is driven by the number of transactions closed by their agents. So as the agents grow, the revenue grows. This company IMO should be worth 25B at the moment, minimum. It is not speculation like Zillow nor is it constrained to the US like Zillow is. EXPI is expanding globally and is going to be making all the TENDIES at a global scale. I mean look at these financials, any reasonable APE would know that this is solid. Other companies like Zillow, Redfin, etc are theory, this company is the  IRL PRACTICE.   


If you still don't believe in this, then you sir are a 🌈 🐻 ! Have a good day sir!

I have called so many stocks going up but I've been terrible at discipline. I swore to keep my Amazon stock when I bought it at 500 but I sold it after a tiny dip.

I LOVED everything about M1. What they set out to do they did fantastically well. Money went in. Stonks got bought. Dividends got paid. DRIP did it's thing. 

Then they bitched out.

I'll probably continue to use them for a low maintenance, dividend-centered account, but I'll never recommend them to anyone again. It's a shame. I really thought they were going to be competition for RH or Webull."

That really left a sour taste in my mouth. It was obvious double speak.

&#x200B;

 **TL;DR: Do not fucking hang on to dates and give others false hopes so they don't trigger the big red self destruct button when shit does not pan out they way you fucks fantasized.**

&#x200B;

Q: What is March 19 ? 

A: Quadruple Witching

&#x200B;

Q: Is it a guaranteed liftoff date and should you put your orders in for Lambos on 20 March ? 

A: No

&#x200B;

**Background:**

But why shouldn't we latch on to 19 March...

Well, imagine all the hedgies are in a circle formation and collectively walking this formation down the road. 

Q: What are they hiding in center of this formation and kicking down the road ?

A: A time bomb (shorted/counterfeit shares).

Now these hedgies are told, if they *leave the formation* (cover their positions) they will be *shot* (suffer huge losses) because when they leave the formation, the apes will be able to see the time bomb and become even more retarded.

Now each time one you retards throws a *run-away-from-the-bomb-free* *card* (sell GME) a hedgie can pounce on it and run away from the time bomb.

**Problem:**

Now when you give the young apes false hopes of with these dates, they grab onto their tiny nuts and wait for the ""GMEday"". And when it turns out to be a <100% gain day; they freak out and throw *run-away-from-the-bomb-free* *cards.* 

**Solution:**

HODL, that's right ! Just HODL. Trust the numbers and trust the process. There is no way these capping shitbags have covered their positions... read the DDs by apes with brains that have more wrinkles than mine.

By treating it as the worst day possible people are preparing themselves not for massive gains, but for massive sales! If it does become the MOASA then people are mentally prepared for it and, as a bonus, are mentally prepared for the firesale! This is how I'm treating it. Keeping money prepared in case this does happen.

If it does end up becoming the MOASS then it flipped from a day waiting for an amazing sale into a day of even more amazing gains! Can only really go up from there. And if nothing happens then it just another day of holding.

In any case GME to $1,500,000+! Millionaire status for everyone holding that far after taxes!"

2021-03-12 23:33:22,wallstreetbets,"To anyone who invested significant life savings or taking out debt to go all in on GME I went all in on gme last time and held from $40 to $105. This time, I bought like 2 shares and rode them from $160 to $326. I wouldnt have really cared had these shares gone to shit.

Despite what many people who have a vested interest in this succeeding are telling you, a price increase to 800$ is not **certain.** A lot of shorts have already been and are being covered right now. The volume yesterday and today combined is the same as the total float. This is huge. The volume on Wednesday was 71mil., which is bigger than the actual float. While I am sure that the short interest right now is still very high, because this seems like free money to most hedgefunds a further price increase is not certain at all at these levels. Im confident that 90% of shares shorted at 40-90$ have already been squeezed out, causing the massive price increases to $340. The only way another short squeeze happens is if some insitution decides to make it happen by playing the long side and squeezing out the shares reshorted at 200-300$, but this would be very hard, since the price is already so high. Not impossible but NOT CERTAIN. Despite all the hivemind shit you hear on this sub. YOU NEED TO CONTROL YOUR RISK and if you're betting a large part of your life on this succeeding you should sell gme until movement in the stock doesnt dictate your financial security. Retailers are not driving the price anyway, so dont lose your life savings and go into debt because you saw a ""apes together strong"" meme or some dumb shit.  


The most ironic shit is that if you follow wsb advice you can never win because even if a squeeze happens, the posts here will tell you that ""its not the real squeeze, hold dont sell"", so you can never actually profit from it by selling to the shorts that need to cover. Selling to them is left up to some smart retailers and mainly the institutions that are playing the long game on this. Don't help them, HELP YOURSELF. CONTROL YOUR RISK. HAVE FUN BUT MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS DUMB AS FUCK.

TLDR: Another squeeze might happen but not certain. Make sure you know that, even if you wouldnt get this impression by browsing this sub. Don't bet your financial security on this.

Edit: The retard meme is more than a meme I guess :(

Edit2: Btw I still own one share for the meme but would be totally fine if it lost 80% of its value"

No thanks, I'll enjoy being pajama rich while you count your bird in hand"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"My take on this whole affair is that this community has shown the world how our equities markets have become distorted by the fact that insiders play by a different set of rules.  

The practice of short selling equities is a positive thing net-net.  Longs get paid a premium for holding shares they want to hold.  The Boomer stocks in Grandma's retirement account still trade in the market while she gets her sweet dividends and a little extra vig from the short .  How is this a bad thing?  Well... It's bad if you don't have to actually go find and borrow those shares before you sell them back into the market.  It's abhorrent that a share can be sold short more than once.  In practice, the rules that HF short sellers get to play by aid in price discovery until they don't.  And when they don't they can REALLY mask the value of a company.  They don't have the power to put a solvent going concern out of business, but they can make a stock look unattractive to the point that the longs start to question their commitment to the investment thesis.  And not having to pay taxes on a short play that ends in bankruptcy (if true) is immoral.

Full confession time....  

I day traded the ever loving F out of GME when it was doing its cute little Death Dance during the first squeeze in January.  High volatility on low volume with 7% trailing stop losses netted me almost 10K in ghost pepper flavored tendies.  I even did that while blacked out from railing Zaleplon like the true degenerate that I am.  
At the time I had no real sense of what was actually happening.  GME mooned as the market trembled, so I knew whatever it was, it was BIG.  The next day, sober, I decided to hold for a moment.  After buying in I didn't set a trailing stop.  Maybe there WAS a REAL squeeze here.   
 When the vertical selloff happened I bought another 100 shares that filled for $120.  It bottomed at $112 and came roaring back (just like the action on Wednesday this week).  I sold half my stake to get my average cost down as my wager was bigger than my current financial situation could sustain.  I then averaged down even more by buying as the share price came back to earth.

On the run back up this week I sold enough to bring my net capital at risk to zero.  The shares I own have been purchased with proceeds from trading the stock.

Where we are now...

The price action in GME cannot be driven by retail.  Even if you cut the volume in half (assuming that every transaction has a high frequency algo front running it) we still aren't big enough to move GME.  We've taken liquidity out of the market, but more importantly we've attracted whale money into the long side of the game.  They are driving the price, we are only along for the ride.

All full conspiracy theory DD aside, I think the shorts are mostly out of this play at the moment, but they will be back.  If we apes triggered the MOASS we'd only break the shorts that are in right now, and new shorts would jump in at prices that can only print money.  There is a small chance this is exactly what's taking place.  HF vs HF.  I know I'd be willing to light 10B dollars on fire if I knew I could make 11B shorting it on the way back down.

I want to be part of the movement if what we are doing here can help level the playing field by reforming the short sale, shortening settlement from the ridiculous D+2, and modernizing the SEC.  Even at that I just KNEW that I was going to turn into Edward PaperHands if the share price crossed $300.

Asking for forgiveness...

So I sold the 950C Jan20 2023.  This locks my shares up for almost two years.  I can't paperhand the play at this point because my broker literally won't let me.  Brilliant.  Or maybe not.  If I sold those to a deep pocketed degenerate and WSB sets off the Squozening(tm) they will get exercised and we both win.  My mortgage gets erased and some ape gets to buy his wife's boyfriend a second yacht.  If I sold those to Shitadel then maybe the rocket takes off and the contract doesn't get exercised.  I'm happy to hold because I like the stock long term.

TL;DR

Don't read it.  It looks like I just needed to vent.  Most of us are managing risk and/or only playing with Biden Bucks."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah.  DFV's is a cool story.  Folks who saw the wisdom in DFV's thesis and got in early have a cool story.  Mine is a story of luck and risk control.

One of my little brothers alerted me to the action in GME on January 25th as it was coming back down from its run past $150.  He wanted my opinion.  I took one glance at the chart and knew that a successful short squeeze had taken place and GME would settle back into a ""reasonable"" price range.  I could have bought in at $75 and printed a comfortable 3 bagger in 2 trading days with one round trip.  That would also be a cool story.
Instead of doing that I came to the party late, was lucky enough to trade my way into some ""free"" shares and still ended up emotionally involved in the action.  Buying at $120 on Jan 28th was a shot fired in anger.  It's no way to trade or invest (if your wife's boyfriend will allow it).  

I'm comfortable with where my position sits at the moment and I'm willing to hold for two years because the guy behind Chewy is coming into the picture.  AND I got paid a nice premium on the LEAP that locks me into ownership for the next two years.

When volatility settles back down I'll consider repurchasing the LEAP, but if that happens I'll be plowing the difference right back into GME.  This is a company to watch."

2021-03-12 23:28:36,wallstreetbets,"Stimulus checks will bring the market up next week especially GME As per [this CNBC article ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/21/many-americans-used-part-of-their-coronavirus-stimulus-check-to-trade-stocks.html) a significant part of stimulus checks went into the market.  The article is from May referring to the first stimulus.  

I think this should be bigger news with most Americans receiving $1,400 next week.  Some people mention it is priced in but an inflow of some significant part of  the stimulus checks ($400 billion) flowing into the market can't be priced in.  It isn't news - it is actual money hitting the market.

""Trading stocks was among the most common uses for the government stimulus checks""

And with WSB now at close to 10 million subscribers from two(?) million last year - there are a lot more people watching this subreddit which primarily discusses GME.  

So I'm long GME!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wish I had kids so I could yolo their stimmies in too !!!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but Jlo and Arod broke up
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Welp......I guess mine will go in the GME pot too. See you fellas at the casino on Monday!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,roughly 20% of americans have a brokerage account. from a survey done by Deutsche at the end of Feb they found people aged between 18-55 will put 40-50% of the stimulus into the stock market. Other banks (I do not know who) estimate a $150-$190B injection to US markets as a result of stimulus package.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,is there a way to get my check directly in GME?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Without reading past the first paragraph, the market was near all time low in May. That being said, the fact since then wsb user base is up 10m users, i’d say it benefits bulls"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm always down for some stimulation.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Consider buying some close to the money options for more leverage. An option is basically 100 shares of it goes ITM.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Will the stimulus money actually arrive before next week or are you assuming people will spend money out of pocket until they have it?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Should be fun with quad witching 🍿
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gme is going to be doing some crazy things next week, but we cant expect incredible gains cause the shorts will be waiting. Hold fast you degenerates."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I think we all agree that it's the big whales/hedge funds that are running the GME show now (both long and short).
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I think that one reason people put the last bit in stocks was because it was so low.  But $1400 is actually enough to pay your bills for a lot of people...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s definitely going into correction territory before it comes back. You need to understand retail investors make up less than a third of the money controlling the stock market. This money is a drop in the bucket. Everyone thinks the stimulus is a golden ticket to see last years gains and it’s simply not. Last years gain were hedge funds perpetually reinvesting their own gains with stim money acting as a great story to back it. The moment you think you have control over anything that happens in the market is the moment you get caught with your pants down.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's literally priced in, how can you think you're smarter than the market lol? Once stimulus was passed everyone went on a shopping spree anticipating those 1400$"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So the stimulus check was not needed at all. Otherwise would have been spend on food and rent. This actually bothers me. Because I am paying for it from my taxes.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm going to laugh my ass off if this squeezes, and someone does the numbers and comes out with the calculation that the government made more money off of the gains taxes from the stimulus squeeze than they spent on the payments. Probably won't happen, but would be amazing."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I don't see why the government won't just let GME rocket. WE'll be paying more in tax from our tendies than the hedges have ever paid"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Except for oregon. They taxed it like income
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think it's pretty obvious they can't cover at this point. They already lost, they just don't want to pay us yet."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're assuming wsb is comprised entirely of Americans below the income threshold

Im canadian, no stim for me"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's not just going to increase market cap by 34% because even a million shares can double the price (just an example).

But I'd be surprised if even 5% puts in most of their stimulus money into GME to be honest, as much as I wish that were true. It gets hyped but especially after the first go around people aren't willing to risk it, and then the ""sensible"" part of their brain goes to buy ""normal"" stocks like AAPL and BAC. Lots are just here for the ride without the financial risk given the popularity. 

Wish that were true though, I'd easily be a millionaire if your scenario happened."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"What if you can turn that $1400 into $140000 and not only pay your bills, but pay of your debts?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The stimulus is designed to be used to stimulate the economy by freeing up purchasing power so people can make any type of purchases from businesses. Unemployment benefits are designed for basic needs. That is why it’s called a stimulus package and why federal unemployment exists as a separate part of the bill from the stimulus.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I also hate taxes, but we've been hyperinflating the currency for the last year. The USD is worth about 10% less than it did 3 years ago. If we're devaluing the currency, it's best we do it before the wealthy can shift their placements."

Take what's left of your of 40 cents and buy one share of GME at that price.  You make 50% gains for a total of 60 cents and then owe 25% Capital Gains which leaves you 45 cents.  So, you basically have less than one half dollar you think you had.  But at least you got some gum.  BTW, the government is now broke and that leads to inflation where 45 cents is really only worth 20 cents because the cost of everything suffered rising costs because of the $1.9 Trillion Dollar stimulus package.  Now you have to put that 20 cents into savings to offset the 35 cents you will owe in taxes next year.  Nothing, NOTHING, is ever free."

I imagine something to this effect is what is panicking the powers that be but it's beyond the Hedgies at this point.  I remember Barney Frank and the mess he caused later in 2008, so we'll see.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell puts and take the full hit if it tanks and take none of the gains if it moons. Not the best idea for GME. Rather buy some yolo calls then or just stock

And that’s not financial advice"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well in that case, technically the shorter would've paid for it. Taxing your gains is not the same thing as paying something"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but you can withdrawal the amount of money you deposited in your Roth IRA.   You could also withdrawal it early, if you got enough cheddar to make it worth it.  But yeah your right about it being locked up for the most part."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure, but at that rate you end up with a 43.3% (!) tax rate but still inside with a new membership into the TOP 35% of the nation's wealth and therefore **BECOME** the very same thing folks here are ""hedging"" against but who will soon **bitch** when those with lower shares start betting and yelling against your new wealth.  ***It's a strange phenomenon, isn't it?***   Top pays the vast majority of the bottom, it's always like that.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"THIS. And there's shills all up in here trying to push that rhetoric and sentiment. DON'T GET BORED.   


 The longer this takes, the better. That's more support and higher damage to the HFs. Of course everybody dreams of getting rich over night, but that slow and steady growth without a squeeze is the best thing that could happen. Three weeks ago you would have been happy to make a million in 20 years, now all of a sudden it seems like people (shills) want to be one NOW. Calm your fucking tits.

Stop setting dates. It will happen when it happens. Getting your hopes up that a squeeze will happen on a certain day will only make you feel disappointed when it doesn't happen. Bagholders, remember when you were down 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%? You weren't expecting shit to pop off like it did, you were just chillin. Now you're in the green (hopefully). So just CHILL. Trust the DD, nothing has changed."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think if WSB didn't lose interest in the drop to 40$, it's quite hard to make use lose interest now lol"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This. 

People are neglecting that names like Melvin are just that--names. ""Reallocating"" assets and responsibilities to shell companies ensures that names don't matter and also that the assets can't be found without extreme measures.

That's the point. This is all a delay. It doesn't matter that we know it. What matters is that the system doesn't want to recognize it because to do so disposes of a massive revenue stream, by one name or another matters little.

The pony will trot until the wagon has found a more convenient hitch. 

Don't like it? My recommendation is: PROVE IT."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"but isnt the idea that theyll eventually have to give in and cover? its just a matter of when, lose clients now or later whats the difference"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ahh I see yup. Good call. My wife is waiting for you.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"We still got free healthcare like the VA.  I have a family member who can use the VA but whenever he does it takes forever for an actually appointment, and then they still ended up over charging him.  He said he would never go to the VA if he needed any actual surgery done on him.  I guess all the other stuff he has dealt with has him jaded, which is a problem with free stuff.  If everyone can get it (higher demand) then it will take longer compared if people have to pay for it(less demand)."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you think America doesn't have wait times that are at least as long, if not longer, then you're misinformed. (And that's if you're lucky enough for your insurance to even deem you worthy of a kidney in the first place.)"

If I can steal all your shit without breaking any laws, it's gonna happen. And with GME, once the 'squeeze is squoze', check your back for daggers cause it will be full of them."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yah I don't mind that sentiment. Sorry for being a prick. I'm feeling cynical lately. I'm down to follow the crowd on small bets, but definitely not as a yolo. GME was and is unique. Not sure if this will ever happen again."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ape no fight ape. I didn't take any offense, you're good. GME is definitely a black swan event, but it also marks a turning page in stock market behavior and a lot of the pros have noticed. This level of coordination is massive and will only grow. Pandora can't be stuffed back in the box, and yeah I like the sentiment of how it could be utilized going forward. Just wanted to share my spin with ya."
2021-03-12 23:28:11,wallstreetbets,"Why just purchasing $800 calls isn't enough for 🚀 I've read a few times now that the gamma squeeze is best squoze by the purchase of calls, particularly high multiple calls. I even read one apes theory that we should all purhase call options and that all those apes holding 4 shares of GME don't belong on the 🚀 with us. This is based on the assumption that MM's who are writing/selling these options are always hedging by buying the underlying asset, thus creating a huge leverage effect. I believe in some instances this may not be the case. When you look at the sheer number of $800 calls that were purchased and expiring today it far exceeds other more reasonable call levels. Say a MM decided the probability of GME hitting $800 today was exceedingly low, especially since they understand they could actually drive it there through the gamma effect mentioned previously, this MM may decide to just sell all hedging GME shares and sell those options ""naked"" This would have netted them profits from a sideways day of trading  and expiration of calls not in the money.
This is why we need to purchase calls at all levels and the underlying asset as well. Each in the money call option does force MM's to hedge. And every diamond handed ape out there is driving the price up too even if they only hold 4 shares.One ape weak, many apes strong!! Buy all things that go green! Eat green crayons and 💎👐 to get 🚀🌙"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also gambling on a $800 option is likely going to allow your premium to be pocketed by a hedge fund, which will give them more money to use against the stock price."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How does buying options limit risk. Wouldn’t buying shares be limiting the risk. Buying options are 100x riskier
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Gonna have to look this one up bud.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Well you only lose the premium right? With a stock you can lose the entire value.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol yea if the stock goes to 0. But at least have the shares still. With options when it expires out of the money you lose all of its worth and the option. I don't think you understand what options are. They are way more risky.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,God speed you smoothbrained bastard
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol if you load your entire investment account on options and they all expire worthless then you lose everything.. loading up on shares the stock would have to be $0 to do that..
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How can you loose the entire value of the stock. Premiums are way more volition more expensive and have an expectation date.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It depends entirely on how you use them. Options can be used to hedge risk but the most talked about way of using them on this sub is buying call options that are OTM
2021-03-12 23:23:30,wallstreetbets,"CNBC says stocks should be traded based on fundamentals, so here is the APE ratings based on fundamentals. What would the ratings on stocks be if they actually traded based on fundamentals?  Well lets find out:

The list of stocks are all companies I like.  They are all on my list of stocks to watch for wheel trades.  These are all companies that I would want to own if the price was right.

&#x200B;

Since stock prices are usually based on perception of future performance, for each stock I looked up its estimated price earnings for 2021.  I ignored 2020 completely.  If it is a spec stock expected to loose money in 2021 I estimated its first profitable year in say 2022.  If I thought the CNBC estimate for 2021 was good I used it.  Otherwise I upped it a little or lowered it a little based on my opinion of future earnings.

&#x200B;

I also used CNBC's numbers for past earnings to estimate what I thought the growth rate for the next few years would be.  Again I ignore 2020.

&#x200B;

I then find a price target of earnings \* 2 \* growth rate.  The only exception was Hasbro which is a dividend stock.

&#x200B;

I then calculated a price I would want to own the stock at which is usually about 70% of price target or 1.4 \* earnings \* growth.

&#x200B;

If a stock is trading at PE of more than 2 times growth rate it is rated a SELL

If a stock is trading at a PE between 1.4 and 2 times growth it is rated a HOLD

If a stock is trading under 1.4 growth it is rated a buy.

If it is trading at a PE of under its growth I rated it a STRONG BUY.

Other than Hasbro I did not take dividends, revenue, or assets under consideration.  This was a simple calculation.  Therefore THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE YOU SHOULD DO YOUR OWN DD BEFORE BUYING, SELLING, OR HOLDING ANY STOCK!!!

&#x200B;

Also, I did not take squeezes into consideration they are ONLY based on future fundes.

&#x200B;

I think the results will be SHOCKING!

&#x200B;

Yes I used excel I know I suck.

&#x200B;

[Sorry ABBV should say extremely strong buy](https://preview.redd.it/t711u16jznm61.png?width=2080&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ea2ed4ec900928f6f6f11180a250d2f349e2e31)

Also read about call spreads."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"guys can someone explain why you wouldn't buy calls when they're already ITM or super close to ITM at the time of purchase?

If it pass near-term pressure downward to 200-180 support & bounce back above 250 it will complete the pattern which is very [bullish](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/bullish/) sign to all the way to ~~800$~~ 680 $ price target per chart.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Upvote.. saw my bae PLTR
2021-03-12 23:08:28,wallstreetbets,So has anyone checked in on this person? 
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Live by the sword die by the sword
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Why does everyone that shares their portfolio have low battery?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don’t know, his phone ran out of green and red battery"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,He’s looking at the option chain for next week
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s a lot of crayons....
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I truly worry when I see this type of thing. Folks I learn by doing too. And there is no better teacher than failure. But please please for everything that is holy practice with one contract on a cheap stock. I feel sick when I see these screenshots
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,His cellphone battery definitely ded now.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"He would double his money if he sold quick this morning 

&#x200B;

Its all about timing"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,See: FD
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey, a $20 is a $20, especially in this economy."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Calling u/admirable-surround11
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,He ded
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I dont know if you're in the right sub. I loved seeing it.  I printed out a screen shot and showed my kids what happens if they dont do well in school.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,He commented on someone comment that it isn't his first time with options he actually blew his student loans previous to this.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a casino.

But you're right, at least try a paper account or start small lol"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have to agree, losing a paycheck is a lesson. This is just insanity"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean. What. That’s only happened like once.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I've learned some lessons about risk and being stupid, but those lessons involved a couple hundred bucks. I am always dumbfounded by the people who hangout here to show off losing $80,000 they probably can't afford to lose by buying a ton of super OTM calls."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,">	He bought them yesterday

Yeah, I mean, he’s not *retarded.*"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Unless he wins enough to where 90k is 30% or whatever of his profits.

So yeah he is good on taxes this year lol"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"More like the more expensive contracts are the higher iv is. Iv is an input into black scholes that is backed out by using the current price of the option. As always, what drives price is demand"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,no! he has a call option$510 for next friday.  he going to the moon with us 🚀
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"fuck these dumb kids. They can learn through patience or blow daddies 100k on dumb 0DTE's.

Fuck em."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but if you work at burger king you dont go up to the high rollers table.  Ya stick to the $20 blackjack table.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"His 60 other contracts expired today but yea, lets hope his single (1) contract for $510 3/19 patches the leaks in his hull."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Michael Jordan.. is that you?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,And now he can’t even afford a phone charger
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You betcha. You from there?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,*We are gonna need a bigger boat...retard*
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,From close to Marquette ya.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh shit. I was there in august. My grandparents live in Ishepeming
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Amazing! So youve been to Congress pizza?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"My favorite, is my hometown Ambassador in Houghton."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah. Ralph's, Laurie's, the Vearling?, border grill, vangos, etc"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"They dropped the ""r"" in Ishperming, I'm callin em a fraud here pard."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup! Lauries pasties are good but their cudighi sandwiches are amazing. Border grill is pretty great too.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Those cudighis are the shit. They put that meat on their pizza too. Bangin
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cudighi pizzas are amazing. When I was home I made some deep dish pizzas with cudighi and damn, so good. My aunt gave me a cudighi recipe so I can make my own lol."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck yeah. This conversation made my wife and i decide to make cudighi pizza this weekend
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hell yea!! Congrats on that!
2021-03-12 23:06:42,wallstreetbets,Suncor (SU) update. 93 call options strong baby. Slow and steady. 
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,27c is pretty bold. There is a chance these go itm. Not sure if SU will go above 30 by Sept.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,If the IV gets to high I am not above cashing out early.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"My best guess is 26-27 by next earnings and 28-30 by end of year. Maybe 35+ if we are super lucky.

I personally own 20c 6/18 and 24c 1/21/22"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah my original bet was that we would see $30 by sept. I would be happy with that.
2021-03-12 23:06:18,wallstreetbets,2 Huge AMC buys right at the closing bell! 
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,When you realize every buy is also a sell...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Is he saying AMC will be $33? Who is this hero of the night?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Watch the opening bell and closing bell daily this has been going on for over 2 weeks. I have been trying to tell everyone about this. Some suspicious shit going on. PLEASE UPVOTE THIS so others will see. Thanks
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s a palindrome. Jesus is coming back but his name will be Eel Lee. On 3/31. And we go to the moon
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How much did it increase the price?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"When I was 12 I told my dad to buy stock in this new up and coming company called Microsoft. He didn’t, but he has always viewed me as a stock picking god ever since.

Little does he know I’ve made all my real money in VTSAX."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,lmao xDD
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s the closing auction, it happens literally every single day..."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,0.o
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"33 is the angel number the rest just reads itself 

1=A

13=M

3=C

You're welcome for this DD

Edit: format"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe on 3/31 it will hit $133
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I buy into this stuff so easily, I'm sold."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I can work with that!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,If it's hex it's a dark magenta color
2021-03-12 23:03:36,wallstreetbets,Found out how to buy call options yesterday 
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That 510 call is like watching a football game where the winning team takes a knee in the 4th quarter but you are betting the losing team will win by 120 points anyway.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,YO; WHEN THEY SAID DIAMOND HANDS THEY DONT MEAN OPTIONS
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy fuck. Imagine losing 90k and still going on Reddit. I’d be so fucking drunk. I lost like 40k in options value today and it makes me ill. I deleted my broker apps until Sunday night lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh my god lol. 100k just down the drain

This is ... *unzips* 

The stuff."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just BUY SHARES u retard. Look, we all want to brag about our +1000% gains in a day, but the price won't get there or force MMs to delta/gamma hedge if you smooth brain apes keeps buying these way OTM FD's. MMs look at their order books and goes, ""hm, thanks"" because there is zero likelihood of them needing to cover these calls. Either buy shares, or close to ATM/ITM calls. Yes, IV is expensive, but the more retards buy these FDs, the less fuel for the rocket."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I’d like to believe it traded flat today because the hedge funds saw OPs post and was like “fuck this guy in particular”
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Losses for the tax man, hes playing 4d checkers"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You still got that 3/19 510 though 😤😤
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This guy was either gonna retire for life or lose 90k. Can't help but admire it a little bit. I mean you could have bought at least a little further out, but shit you bought weeklies. Godspeed retard"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Please go see a psychiatrist for self-destructive behaviors
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey man props for grabbing your ape balls and posting your loss porn. I’m also glad to see other amateurs fucking around with options in this short squeeze. If you pay attention to the right puts, they can fluctuate by tens of thousands of points based purely on 5 minutes worth of a volatile stock doing something volatile. It has happened over and over again. Buy them when the stock shoots up and they are cheap, dump them when you feel your butthole pucker on your long position. I have made money both long and on options. You truthfully cannot say how high the stonk is going to go or how low it will dip in a given day before it shoots back up again. What you can count on is that it’s going to happen, and if you play your cards accordingly, you can feel a lot better about a ballsy long position knowing that you are still hitting the opposite directions lottery with your put hedge when the stock dips like right before lunch Tuesday. Or countless times when it was way up last month."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Was thinking about your position today. Felt sad it didn't go up to atleast 300 so you could recoup something. 3/19 would've been a better date even if it meant you'd have 50% less contracts
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Expensive karma
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,at least ur 510 might make ur money back
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,After seeing this I disabled option trading on my account. Thank you
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I just wanted to say that people are probably giving you a lot of shit but if this play worked out you would have been king of the sub and on top of the world. Hoping you have more ammo for next week since you YOLOed that much money on FDs on a Thursday. Buy longer dated calls next time.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ohhh daddy yeah! *unzips* This will last all weekend!

F in chat for you and may you recover!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I was thinking of you all day... fuck hahahahaha I hope you double your account after this
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The comments here prove that this sub is the weirdest  gamblers support group. I’m a proud member.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought about you all day. You dumb fuck.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was so fucking rooting for this dude, and when it hit $290 this morning I literally gasped and got into “this crazy son of a bitch is doing it, it’s happening!”..."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The crazy thing is if he cashed out when it hit $295, he would've ok. Maybe"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"-91,287.00

Congratulations my friend, welcome to the hall of..."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is what a loyal smooth brain looks like.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You truly, and I mean this with every fiber of my existence, encompass what it means to be a true WSB retard. Just when I thought that we've seen it all, you my friend, have taken this very special sub to new levels of retard that are rarely seen.

If anyone is wondering what happened here, I have full confidence that OP has essentially walked out of their residence with around 90k in hand, threw it on the ground, lit up a cigarette, took a couple puffs, threw the cig into the 90k to light it on fire, started pissing on 90k, then decided to walk away while it blazed a beautiful inferno.

Give this person mod."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Checking his comment history is depressing... 
> Wanna know some crazy shit I bought 5800 shares of gme at $45 then sold covered calls for $46 the week it went to $182 beacuse the IV on premium was so high. Missed out on close to 1 million in gains. There must of been a lot of people like me that did the same thing. But it does seem apparent that short selling and option chains control the price of stocks more then anything.

> Edit 1: Also I jumped back in with 1600 share at $121. So far it’s been my best investment to hedge against market down turn. Will probably hold even if gme goes back to $40 then just double down.

I feel like you only went this hard because of unrealized gains. Nobody can predict the movement of a stock man, no one."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How do these people have 100k in the first place?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Way to lose all your money in a day to hedge funds. Keep fighting the good fight.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So i guess i won't bother learning what call options are then.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Your volume-based DD post into this is legendary
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Real WSB is back. Nature is healing <3
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess he never found out how to sell call options...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re literally better off buying shares because it’s nearly a 0 percent chance that they drop to $0.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone bought 44k contracts of 3/12-800 on Wednesday. How do we determine who gets this week’s trophy?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,He's gonna make it all back on that one call
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was wondering how people lose money on options


This is how, thanks for the education"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Day 215 without sex: I fucked my own bank account"" - OP probably"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That you are lighthearted enough to post such retardation and massive losses just makes me think this loss is well within your risk tolerance.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this the way?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Motherfucker tryina be a bajillionaire out here.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You didn't sell the 275 and 285s this morning???
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Who gave you the answers to the test to enable options?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,GME 0 DTE calls go BRRRRRRR
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"can’t wait for tomorrow’s “found out how to buy call options two days ago”

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m31138/found_out_how_to_buy_call_options_today/"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Experience is expensive
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So does this guy have to pay all that money now? Can he just ignore it? What happens now? What if he doesn't have that much money? Do they collect in court? Close his account?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,May favorite part of this update is he didn't just hold these through. He bought one last 510 expiring next week. Ppl like you are why I sell calls. Love to see who they are. Good luck
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You fit in here perfectly. A non-retard would have sold 275/285 during early morning bump and maybe would have minimized some damage
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is classic WSB. Well done. You bet on wall street, and you lost."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the most beautiful display of full retard I’ve ever seen.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude you very easily would have made your
Money if you dumped during the early
Morning rally. What the fuck were you doing?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I lost 10k with Tesla puts this week. I feel your pain / 9
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Read up on ""Time value decay"" and ""Implied volatility crunch"" this will teach you what just happened to your money and why you are retarded."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro why the hell did you not try to sell and cash out yesterday you greedy fuck, salute a true autist"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ya know, if Wednesdays market manipulation didnt happen, they would have printed today, maybe not the 510, but pretty sure about all the rest."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, what is a call?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Retard, what actually happened, in your words?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Beautiful level of retard. I want updates on Monday and the rest of the week.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Time to buy GME to make up for it 🚀
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy cow man. Jokes, memes, and emojis aside for a minute. Are you okay?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn I was depressed that I lost 3k on tesla calls. This is just an other level
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's a reason you have to get clearance from the broker to trade options..  And options that expire in a matter of hours are some of the riskiest trades out there with a very small chance of return due to the exponentially deminishing time value.. 

Don't

put

money

into

something

you

don't

understand"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Basically you spent $90k on lottery tickets but didn't win anything.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Why didn't you dump the profitable one swhen it hit 295?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Should have just bought the stock
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,But why TF you using Robinhood?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,F
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow. This takes the cake. Just discovering options and you throw down 100k on OTM options with extremely high implied volatility expiring fucking tomorrow and you hold until they expire worthless. This is peak autism. Congratulations on being a fucking idiot for all of us to make fun of. You are a fucking retard
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"R I P

Rest in poverty"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I brought you up in conversation like six times today.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,i don't understand you unless you are a millionaire and doing this for shits and giggles
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Next week find out about puts?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude you okay? That's fucking brutal.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,what is the opposite of deep fucking value?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,aannnnnddddd it's gone
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Now invest in learning options. Come to me.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,New to this but wasn't the 275+285 worth something at one point?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks OP, I needed to feel good about my poor decisions lately.  This is what this sub is about."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the quality content I'm here for.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is why i can’t leave this sub. Thanks for bringing back old wsb
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You ever just see 90k just disappear
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Never go full retard
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Great now let’s work on how to sell before expiration.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I like how it’s apes together and diamond hands bullshit and this guy loses 100 k to prop up the rest of the dirtbags here.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just give me the money since you’re throwing it away, lord knows I need it"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is no one noticing he bought another call, 3/19 @ 510"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahahaha he fell for the meme
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for the update you beautiful retard

Edit: why the fuck didn't you at least roll the shit closing today into next week??? You had a chance"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Simple jack level right here
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Real talk though can someone explain what this means and how to do it?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The crazy part is OP could have salvaged $75-80k of the $90k if they sold this morning when GME hit $294 early on.  

But that's not what we retards do here."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,He just went full send
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you winning son? How much $ do you have left I hope that’s not your whole bank
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,F
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Move over DFV
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn, I had such high hopes for you after seeing those losses yesterday."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate the fact that you put your last $1000 into a long GME call for next Friday lmao. You'll even have over $200 left when that one expires worthless, which means you can still afford $ROPE!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This fucken ape
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"F

Well...the least I can do is give you a nice internet point so your loss isnt a total loss.

...right?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I blew my alt account up today too.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the reason why I started doing theta plays...  thanks.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Is that a loss of 100k in two days?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This man needs at least 2000 reddit gold's to break even!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You alive OP?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Next time you feel the need to throw away $91,000...I just want you to know I'm here for you. Venmo, check, money order, whatever, we can make it happen."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm in the same boat. I lost $10k on FDs during the Wednesday crash. Now I'm left with $1k. That was most of my gambling money.

Now it seems I won't be able to make the big bucks like everyone else. Good luck everyone. I'll be watching from the sidelines."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,why is this post giving me serotonin
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How does a smooth brain like you even accumulate 91k in the first place
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Man, you're milking this fuck up eh. You've posted this daily."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gamma pin at 250 today guys. It wasn't moving anywhere. 

Wait til next week though. That's when it's happening."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets, I just want you to know that thetagang loves you
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This man could’ve sold and walked with 30k and he didn’t. Takes diamond hands to a little whole new level
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m with you on 3/19 $500 calls 🚀💎
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Someone yesterday said he still had another $30,000 to lose lol"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You're definitely in the right place a lot of us have big calls on $Rope in the near future
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ooh... n... no...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Curious most people don't burn 91K like that unless they are a multi multi millionaire or come from a wealthy family.

I am assuming 91K for you must be the equivalent of someone spending 5 dollars on a scratch off ticket."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the shit this sub needs. Not all this r/stocks bullshit. Love it. Bummer buddy
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'll say it yesterday and I'll say it again today, I hope this tard was able to exercise at least 100k worth of these options."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hi what’s your return policy on 0DTEs
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Let’s do it again eh?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"lololololololol

“$.01” hahahahahahaha

On *three* calls!

Hahahahahaha

I can’t, sir."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,GUH
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You might be bad with money, bro."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is premium content.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"that stinks man, maybe next time..   hope your doing okay with the whole situation."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Guessing this amount is just like being pricked for him/her.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Now I understand FDs a whole lot better & why I avoid them like the plague currently... lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So I’m confused. If the stock hits that price by that date do you buy it for pennies on the dollar like it’s listed here?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It looks like you are doing right. Congrats.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok where's the sugar daddy giving money out to all you guys to lose on the markets? I got my cosplay dress ready and have pretty loose spending habits.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought they expired if they didn’t hit the strike price?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I still do not understand this shit at all and I really wish I did or didn't or whatever the hell you idots do to make these thingys be super green and awesome
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ahh yes Whats your PO Box I will send a bunch of bananas and a bucket with cut outs of shapes you can try to fit through. (Spoiler they all fit in the circle hole if you can figure out where the circle hole is)
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Theta gang thanks you for your contributions.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I felt a sharp pain in my pee-hole when I saw this, jfc OP"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,VIP at the retard lounge. Lifetime platinum membership. Congrats.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucking balls man. How do you walk dragging those massive nuts around?!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What in the fuck? You ape.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wtf is an option
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is wallstreetbets
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"A true retard. 

One of us. One of us. One of us."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Man, just buy shares next time."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,His wife’s boyfriend told you to do
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I'M HERE FOR THE GUH!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Heyyy I’m with you, I lost 7k on 3/12 280c today purchased yesterday. The saddest part is when it was actually up 50% but diamond hands and all that"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Well... yeet
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you find out how much he put on options?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,No u didn’t lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"fuck, you should have bought puts! the rest of us could have been rich"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I just came
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Diamond hands for sure!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Every time I think about doing this I see one of these posts.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn op. Diamond balls.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Real question. What happens when you owe that much but clearly don't have the money.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ouch
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey, he took a chance on the spike, this stock has been irrational and hard to time, if it paid off, he would have been legend."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Bruh... 😐
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You need to stop
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ha
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the sexiest thing I have seen in a very long time.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a true yolo. I respect you
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You're a retard
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You should probably unfind out how.....
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s a more than 2 volvos
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you find out this the other day as well or that was someone else
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,F
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you sold today at the 10:30 am peak, you could've sold all your contracts for $83,700.

Edit: add a breakdown:

At the very peak today:

$360 calls @ $6.30 x 20 = $12,600

$380 calls @ $5.50 x 10 = $5,500

$275 calls @ $28.35 x 10 =$28,350

$285 calls @ $22.55 x 10 = $22,550

$330 calls @ $10.50 x 10 = $10,500

Also, looking at your P/L for the day, all your previous positions account for all but $1,343 of today's losses.

This means ***you bought your $510 call when it was worth $24.00.*** If I had to guess probably at open. Bravo."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Unfind out
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,At least his battery isn’t about to die this time
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Unfind out
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Read the Pete and John Nagarein (sp) book..
or maybe even the Series 9"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Guh

The one saving grace. That 3/19 call. Here's hoping. Also if you ever want to throw away 90k again,just give me the 90k and I'll give you 45k back a couple days later. You'll make out like a bandit compared to your options game.

Edit:dump RH"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey for real dude, I was up 12k and back down to 4k. I learned a good lesson on what money I had to spend. I hope you had a good lesson and use this to fuel you to the moon. Only positive vibes bro."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Love how the $510 call doesn't even show an updated value. Everyone knows they're worthless.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,please post your overall portfolio graph
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Actually one of the most retarded things I've seen
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Theta gang thanks you for your sacrifice
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is faptastic
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I did the same thing and I was pissed but oh well
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I love you guys for buying these expensive options every week. I can sell you more on Monday.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,lmao and one hasn't even hit expiry date yet. youre a real fuckin retard but also respect+ for the yolo.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Best investment advice I heard was from George St Pierre (GOAT in UFC) say; ""sometimes stock market goes up, sometimes stock market go down"".

Never steered me wrong."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Take the $18 call on $EYES. Youll be happy.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,WTF are you thinking?!?!?!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,At least you didn’t buy GMED options
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I actually just spent an hour learning how options work just so i could understand how fucked your shit is. Shits fucked yo. Couldnt he have exercised at 285 and gotten a good chunk of money back????
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone know any Call options video tutorial ELI5 for an ape like me?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ask for a refund.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You doin okay?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I just can’t even look at this and not feel sick
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Always the way: smooth brain discovers options, smooth brain throws away money. Happens to us all, bruh."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess it’s probably better to know what your doing before messing with options. I hope this guy is ok and not curled up in an alley behind Wendy’s in the fetal position.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Our saint is back and he actually held them even the ones that were in the money.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry man but there's being a ""retard"" and then there's just being an idiot."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm brand new to this and besides buying GME have no experience.. started reading books and taking an audio course on banking.. I listen to Bruce and a few others on Youtube. Kind of scary seeing how you can fall into quicksand to easily
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,LOL! Fuck dude I am so sorry!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Flair this retard!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"what exactly is a call option? im still in the realm of knowing how to buy and sell stocks and how to buy limits, nothing else really makes sense to me yet lol"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe that last contract expiring next week will save you
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Not to worry. If it makes you feel “better” I bought those options in puts and still lost money today. Guess we are both equally retarded!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,when is the last day you can sell a call before expiration day? you can't sell on day of right? plz help a n00b
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds like he forgot to find out when and how to sell them
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"you \*NEVER\* go full retard. Unless you're a WSB retard, then you always go full retard."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This man deserves to be a mod. Fucking legend you
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Real question. If you bought a hypothetical x/x date call option of 100 shares of XYZ stock for $1 per share at a strike price of $100, and you exercise the option in the black, do you need to have the liquid funds ($10,000) to make the purchase? Or does the profit cancel out the debt?

Edit:  now that I put my question into words it sounds stupid. Of course you need to actually make the purchase. I’m leaving the comment to bring smiles to ape faces."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ape no like bananas? Banana peel not taste as good as actual banana..... eat banana. Not peel.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Easy peasy. My 18 month old son could do this. What’s the big deal?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You glorious retard you
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you tried calling for a refund?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,For the people buying options. Of the money doesn’t look good almost immediately... sell and stop the bleeding.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Oof :( that makes me sad to see
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How much of your net worth was that 100k tho?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cmon you bastards, I know there’s hundreds of other retards just like this one here since January. Show us your loss porn!!!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,it was either a multi-millionaire or this. nothing in between.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re a fucking legend dude. RIP
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can someone explain it to me like I’m 5 please? I have no idea what I’m looking.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Saw his post yesterday.  Boy was I wrong when I predicted he might actually make a profit.  I was expecting 300-350 today.  I missed that by a lot.  

Hope you learn a good lesson from this and do better next time..."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow these options things sound fucking terrible. I'm just gonna stay over here and shove crayons up my nose.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice, ~30 years of discounted taxes"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"When you say ‘figured out’, what exactly do you mean?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Unlearn this

But why"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,3/19 is coming!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How did you wind up with $90k in the first place. This is retarded
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,GUH

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Noob question here... but who “wins” when someone loses on options like these?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait so you bought a bunch of very out of the money options the day before they expired? Am I seeing this right?

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy inspired me to buy one 400c that I sold at 10:30 for $120 profit. Thank you sir 🚀
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m clapping alone in my room. Wow. Is he the one true retard we’ve all been waiting for?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,275 didn't click over?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Does he not know what a strike price is? The value isn't there even if it went 800 for that 510. Lmao and he bought weeklies with one day left way OTM. Jesus.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Nailed it

What am I looking at here? 

Do I understand this ape has the right to buy those stocks at the listed prices? But the stock is below those prices, so OP ape is losing the premium?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Guh
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You should probably unfind out and just stick to buying stocks.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ouch
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe 3/19 will be good luck
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You lost me at the $510 call.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You have to double down for this week now to make it back. This is way!

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Double down for next week, you have to win eventually right?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Let us know when the $1-2k for the 3/19 510c you added goes to zero too. There’s new guys here that haven’t blown their loads in years.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"can you comment OP about what was going on in your head? how are you feeling. i cant imagine loosing 90000 like that in a few days? you must be rich as fuck to not give a damn? with 90,000 i would ha e done so much more than option trading..."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"My initial reaction was “holy shit, GME calls for $1?!” And then I realize they’re expiring out of the money today 😂😂 my dumbass"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hopefully it’ll rocket next week and your 3/19 510c and my 3/19 300c can put us both positive on our options buys!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ouch bro
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I suddenly feel better about all the poor trades I've made.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hi. I'm a novice, smooth brain, retardeder ape than ussual so allow me this question please:

Did you buy the option to purchase the stocks at said prices (360$ and so on) for 1¢, or did you sell the option to buy said stocks off you for 1¢ at that given prices (360$ and so on) ?

Also, where does this big loss coming from?

Sorry for the lack of knowledge. I'm an idiot."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oof. First off I wanna say respect for actually posting an update and not deleting your account. Second I wanna say I also found out about options the same way
(On a significantly smaller scale) I lost about $5k

This is what this sub is all about. Loss porn. We just been on these gains lately. 

If u had made long calls you could have made so much profit but that is all hindsight. Look at this like a $90,000 lesson on the market. I'm sorry for your loss



Good luck on the 61st option you threw in"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Autist

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"after find out how to buy call option: 


where lambo?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Don’t do too many really bad options they can cause issues for the stocks rise over all and can cause slower momentum
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That is a very expensive flair you just bought
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Guh
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,'About Community' description checks out.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Jesus Christ you're a retard. Should've just given me the money.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Looking solid
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn dude, almost had the 275's but shit that's rough."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Eli5 what am I looking at
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Carnage.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You were actually in the money at one point. Probably could’ve doubled your Money if you had sold at the top today
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy fuck
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re doing great! Keep it up!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh man, I'm never on this sub. Please tell me those losses aren't in real dollars!?!?! 😨"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Coo one
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Unfind out
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh shit there goes the rest of it. I thought about you today fellow retard. Briefly, but I was inspired by you for a moment."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can someone explain this to me?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is why shares are king.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Man I'm almost jealous of how retarded this man is
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"lol, good work brother. what % was it if your total account(s)?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This ape is the anti-DFV. Truly a martyr for this sub. You will be remembered one day OP.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, this is pretty intense.  But I’m not sure what I’m seeing here.  So this thing called a “call option” is something you can buy on the stock market... and OP spent $1200 on them, and now he owes *$91,000?!*  How, is that possible?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,what's wrong with you man
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,what's wrong with you man
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,what's wrong with you man
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Never go full retard
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So he's  beyond fucked and there is no do over button?

If the squeeze happens will he be ok?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You hella retarded
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Found the spitting Karen. :) I’ve joined
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"what happened?  
maybe im reading it wrong but don't all these just expire worthless?

  
like... he has the option to buy at $360, $380, $275 etc?  
but since the current price is lower, they just expire worthless? and he chooses not to execute them? so he just loses the premium?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy mother of god
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Props OP you didn’t delete your account
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You've earned my respect retard.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Guh moment
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,ayyy i too lost 90k on options after they restricted trading that terrible weekend
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That 3/19 call may yet make up for the other losses!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"With your $1,288 you can buy 286 ten piece mcnuggets. I see this is an absolute win"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow. I went into a pretty intense depression over losing 2k back when this sub was going nuts over Tesla. Props for not killing yourself.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,To lose 92k in days needs skill too man.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Spray and pray. NOICE.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I am very glad I’m not you.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Congrats
Edit: just saw the negative sign, sorry op"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn should’ve at least sold the 275 and 285
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wasn’t this the same post as yesterday?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t understand exactly what’s happening here
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This does not look good.
I am closing my options acct."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Man that was an awful idea. Big yikes. I hope you’re able to handle the loss.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,He must be a millionaire or something to be able to just burn that money without a second thought. I think OP will be fine either way.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You should have sold those calls not bought them
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this guy okay
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn son you are fucked
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,ouch. just buy shares nxt time😊👍
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah yes some good old WSB classic content
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is awesome but I also hope he has a bunch more so he's still in.... id be personally really upset for this fellow autist if this was his all in and he isn't in on gme next week. I want tendies for us all
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,thanks lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao at the 3/19 call. I didn’t realize how insane the IV was on GME until this
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,with GME is better to just buy shares.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,F
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for your contribution.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,All you have to do to fix this is call up robinhood and ask them to remove that minus symbol. Worked for me.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I also figured that out too yesterday but I don't have fucking downs syndrome
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"i feel you bro, i lost 450 today too."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can someone ELI5? What are call options and what does his screenshot mean??
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh senpai, you’re so funny"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This shit is going to print!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds about right? Hey next thurs if that last one isn't working you can still invest in $ROPE
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"One way or the other, not knowing another breaker would pop essentially; “an I feel bad bet”"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Guh
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What did it cost? Everything.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,one of us!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You are now an fd blackbelt
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Better un -find out because wtf
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I lost $13 on my first call....
I haven't done one since."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,$510 call? After 90k loss within a day? Wow. Darwin Award for money management 😂😂😂😂😂😂
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"He was right every single time, if by mistake he just only bought  puts..."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This play was screwed from the get go. The time to play options was when it started running. Anything after $200 is just begging for the market to take your money. The premiums are just a rip off now.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What are buy call options
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What the fuck happened in your head lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Gotta buy leaps brody
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So close
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah well shit happens. I’m out almost 25k on calls now too. I have 3 400’s expiring Friday that dropped 50% today. I’m either going to roll them into an ATM and try to flip it back and forth for incremental gains next week or go for the touchdown. I can already feel the tears of next Friday.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I salute you.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't worry it's all just a dream and some numbers on the screen. Try to wake up or pinch yourself
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,F
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wowza
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Unfind out, please"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Which tradimg platform is that?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,that 275 was close tho...NOT! hahahahahahah
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Should have bought shares 😭😭
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,F
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,My wife asked me to find out about options this week... based off this I’m probably not going to find out...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This far from over even BBC has our back I bet we see GME going to 10000 [https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56357526](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56357526)
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can I buy your course?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you tho?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ut-ohh...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I bursted out laughing at this for some reason. You really went full retard.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can someone explain this to me?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,i upvote but i am too retarded to underrstand
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or did you figure out how to give money away to option writters?

Lol GL!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fucking hell. You ok, monkey bro?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m sorry sir, this isn’t a Wendy’s."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Truly belong here
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"My daughter who is on the spectrum would call this “ decision paralysis “. It is the best description of an ongoing issue she has. It is something she suffers frequently. He couldn’t decide which was the better choice, so he bought them all. This is a true autist thing to do. And true to form actually logical. Better statistical odds lol"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,One of us.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yo that 510 call might be the move though

F to the rest lol"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,GUH
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Jesus
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,We need a life alert bot to avoid this type of thing. All these people saw it and nothing was done. No tard left behind.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can I interest you in some ornamental gourds?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"holy fuck just beccame less retarded 

f"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Are ya winning son?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm really, really sad for you. But I also feel better."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol!  I hope this ain’t your approach to everything in life.   Wincing at the thought of you driving 100+ mph the first time someone handed you the keys to a car...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ll repeat last time, unfind out"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy high and sell low fellas!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,how much money do you have left
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This was me last Friday. Rough day
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why didn’t you sell when it hit $294? 

You could have sold the $275 and $285 right ?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The first step in a solution process is admitting there is a problem
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This isn’t investing you just straight gambling
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Will you reload again on calls?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I might not fully understand.. but I dont think this is good. Hopefully you only invested what you could afford lose? Idk.. I just like the stock.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,F
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,F
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,are options just legalized gambling?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,R E T A R D
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the way!!! 

Full throttle retard mode! 

Is a work of art!!! 

Have a banana!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Then there's people like me who cash out on a stock after i made a $10 profit.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,And I was pissed being down $61....
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Y’all. Just buy shares!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I love this so much. Nice job fellow retard
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,can anyone explain in simple terms how this dude fucked up or what was supposed to happen?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Am I the only one that profits on options?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Shoot... my stonks went down $124 and I nearly jumped off a building...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What does your wife’s boyfriend think?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,LMFAO!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It doesn’t surprise me you couldn’t find the sell button yesterday
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Jesus christ
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok but doesn't RH automatically excersice those options?  Wouldn't that add the shares to his portfolio?  If Im wrong please explain why so i can understand.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Easy come easy go. Something good will come of this :)
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I really really missed these posts !
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can someone explain how call options work? 
I can imagine myself doing something like this with how much I hear about them"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,the rocket will pick your stranded ass up with that GME $510 call on 3/19
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can someone ELI5 here please I’m so confused about everything going on with this post
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What an idiot.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I lost 90K when I learnt how to buy options too
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You know you can only claim 3k in losses... yeesh
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry man. Mine looked similar with AMC options last week.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Mod this fuck
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,RIP buddy 😂
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,success
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Just exercise them.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,uhhhh
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Couldn't he have just rolled out his calls to April exp?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,i don't understand how to read these numbers
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I also recently found out how to lose money, I’m just smart enough to know I’m too dumb for that. Ive got that smooooooooooth 🧠"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I accidentally bought GM and am up now.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Told you
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Paper trading can be fun
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish I knew more about what call options are to understand this. Because this doesn’t look good.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m so sorry
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're my hero, everytime I lose money again I'll remember you and your massive balls to post this."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can someone clarify what happens for these gigantic losses larger that the total funds in the account? Do you get a bill you have to pay or does the account just get closed out?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Moron
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"click ""reset account"" and you will get your money back. keep all in next week."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hate options...

It just keeps giving my body new holes."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude you are truly retarded
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"OP, we all make dumbass plays that lose money, but you have the balls to post yours. Chip and a chair, bud. GL"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,My sides 😂
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"hey man good for you, now get back on the horse and make it all back next week"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Still too scared/ignorant to try options. Sticking with market buys like a good ape.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This did not age well
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice gainz
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy crap.... I’m sitting here legit wondering how I can make enough money to make that sort of investment, but still be retarded enough to make THAT specific investment. I must know your profession."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good job retard,"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Woof.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can someone briefly ELI5 what happened here? I'm just an observer with no involvement. Did he lose a bunch of money just on premiums?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you record your face as you saw it today? I wanted to watch the GUH
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Oof
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Upshot, you’ve got some solid capital gains write offs for a bit! That’s a win! 

Keep at it! Maybe not the margin part. Thanks for posting, and it should be noted that your diamond hands are of the purest quality. 

I’m down about 700k (lowest was a bit over 800k) from the high. Different companies, but haven’t sold... added more... I believe this is the way. 

Wish you the best!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,fuck this person in pertocular - life
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This man has ice in his veins 🙌 Props!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Just slam your dick in a door. That'll fix it
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh gourd, he bought another call for next Friday. I’m starting to think he likes internet awards more than actual money. Respect ✊"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is there an ‘Ape Loss Hall of Fame’?
Can the mods make that a thing?
Maybe just a crown that gets handed out for the week?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ctrl+Alt+Del, repeat."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You need to learn how to sell options too
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"all the DD I read said since Thursday 3/11 went sideways, Friday and Monday will be sideways as well."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,We gotta send OP ramen packets or what?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Do...you...hate...money?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,.m
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow 🍆💦. That's some hard core loss porn. Don't worry you'll get the stimulus next week for another chance.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Rip to this retard
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Just do exactly what you’re doing with PUT options and you’ll be back in no time!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow. You’re fucked.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,We've all been praying for you ❤️
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,what the fuck
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought I was a genius because I set a limit by for 270 thinking it was going to only dip that far... Lo and behold it goes down to 265 but I still feel like a fucking genius.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Do it again for next week on Monday when there is a decent dip. You’ll make it all back.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,i was just thinking about you!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I remember my first options YOLO on RKT..."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"What are you, autistic or something?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The irony of ""Found out how to buy call options YESTERDAY"" followed by LOSS."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don’t answer if they knock on your door 
✊ 🚪 GUH"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you discover margins as well?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know I’m late to the game and this may be a silerbacked question, but! Why not buy x# of calls at 275 rather than ramping up?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yikes
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is sad but beautiful.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,If you are new to options you should buy contracts 3 months out. This gives you time to recover from your retarded self
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you even a cat?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've realized this sub has so many new people you fucking retards don't even know what real, free range, vegan, kosher, seasoned loss porn, hand-selected from my wife's ~~slave~~ strap-on warmer's collection."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"goddamn man........
GUH~~~~"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh sweetie
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,My man

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Charge your phone
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao I'm so sorry but you are a fucking legend. Keep your head up man money comes and goes but internet points last forever <3.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't fuck with options
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This makes me feel both happy and sad.  Happy cuz i'm not alone.  Sad cuz thats baseline.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So wait, like, what was supposed to happen here? What was the thought process? Not hating I actually don't know how options work lol. Like I get the concept of a ""call"" and ""put"", vaguely, but where did OP go wrong?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for making me feel less retarded
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Double down next week
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you read my son?

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You know what, this made me feel better about my att otm calls that expired today (only 11 contracts) so thanks for that, mate


Hope this was within your risk tolerance though"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait somebody explain to me how this happened
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You, sir, are a comedian."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Newbie here, can anyone please help me understand how did he lose 30k?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Guh, FDs?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This makes my 500$ loss today seem not so bad

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a 3/19 gme $400c (my first!) that I   bought on Monday.  Haven’t lost money on it yet. And feeling a little confident..  Was feeling really confident before Wednesday’s cliff dive...

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What does GameStop need to hit in order for this dude to break even on that 510c? I really hope it does.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can someone explain options to me and help me understand how you lose this much money that quickly
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You were off by a day.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,that was un*call*ed for
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,A
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish I understood options well enough to go off the deep end. Even when I watch the awesome Adam dude explain in video after video it all seems confusing when it’s time to actually pull the trigger.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Not a single call expired ITM. RIP retard. Congrats! God speed to ya in the future
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"too bad it didn't work out for you

If all assumptions and reasoning done here come to life there must be money to be made for you

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Oof. This is the real WSB autist shit right here.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I dont know if i should be amazed
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,rip bro
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Had a good laugh after a long time
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,They gonna put this on the news
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Im not really experienced with this, can someone explain what happened to him? (Serious)"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucking good try tho
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Theta decay my friend
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,maybe its house money
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Okay i am not ready for this yet haha
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wtf
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Unfind out...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Great job!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Serious question. So who walks away with the loss money? 

Robinhood?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Don’t you only lose the cost of the contract? If he was buying then at 0.01 how did he lose that much?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,To my understanding he bought the right but not the obligation to purchase the shares at these strike prices. So if the stock rallies to say 500 a share he is ITM and can buy the shares for 360$ 380$ etc... or am I completely autistic??
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I remember my first beer too.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeh, I can jerk to this."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only a 90 thousand dollar lesson, you’ll get past it bro!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Teach me! I have read up on it but still cant get it into my thick skull.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Love you man. Total legend. Do it again but stretch out at least 2 weeks.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,good times
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,His pull out game is weak
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,oh nooooo
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro, I feel bad for you"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Good job buddy! Keep it up!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"People always tell me, ""First one is free."" I, like you, have never found that first free one."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought I was bad losing 200 of my 800 profit. Hats off to you my guy
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thought we weren't using robingay anymore 🤦🏻‍♂️
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,At least ur not a 3/12 800 tard
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don’t worry, dude. Just flip your phone upside down when you look at the graph."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I salute you sir. You belong here. Welcome home.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,A real ape
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Check it out. Dustin Hoffman, 'Rain Man,' look retarded, act retarded, not retarded. Counted toothpicks, cheated cards. Autistic, sho'. Not retarded. You know Tom Hanks, 'Forrest Gump.' Slow, yes. Retarded, maybe. Braces on his legs. But he charmed the pants off Nixon and he won a ping-pong competition. That ain't retarded. He was a goddamn war hero. You know any retarded war heroes? You went full retard, man. Never go full retard. You don't buy that? Ask Sean Penn, 2001, ""I Am Sam."" Remember? Went full retard, went home empty-handed.

UNFIND OUT ;)"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Juuuuuuuust a bit outside.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy something other than GME retard
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"LeVErAgE, mArGiN!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,this guy is back again! omg
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this for real?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,this is the way
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Remember the episode of breaking bad where Walt buys a brand new challenger, but instead of bringing it back to the dealer, he joy rides it and sets it on fire?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,If he does it again next week he will have better odds at least lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, i was almost thinking of trying them."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao I nearly did the same then thought ""You know what ? Maybe just maybe this time I should learn how to do things because jumping in and loose 5 years of my life because of the stress""   


I already lost ten of them playing with big margin in the past"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I dont even know what call options are 🤷‍♂️
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The shit 90k could hve done to improve someone else’s life tho lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"fcking retard hold and double down like Melvin. 

Hahahaaha.............GUH"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"my fucking lord, i get all depressed when i loose -150 on any stock, and this guy is loosing more money then i have ever had. jesus may this ape win in the end please!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So can someone explain to a retard ape how calls work? If GME went passed $380, does he get to keep every single call option below that price point? I’m assuming call options are those things that give you 100 shares or some shit for a low price?

I only stick to buying shares because I’m a knuckle dragger but I don’t see, for instance, why putting a $280 buy call is unreasonable if GME will probably go up with the influx of retard stimmy money."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,damn this man has balls of steel
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,*oogaboonga stops*
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You sir have my Respect
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Bruuuuh
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Good you know how to buy. Now you need to know what to buy 🤣
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone know how I can buy call options here in the UK?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Jesus christ make it stop
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t understand options at all. How much did this cost OP to place? And does he now owe 91k?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,🤕 ouch
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,F
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That dude just lost 3   🦍 salaries for the year. Damn!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh... oh no
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"""But they aren't totally worthless"""
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This will make you feel better OP: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIFVwF35Jb0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIFVwF35Jb0)
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You're a fucking legend
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This makes me wanna cry again... you don't do 1 day options bruh.... those options for 3/19 would of been x2+ profit
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude. Buy them far out.. and dont buy them when it’s going up!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s okay. GME is hitting 1000 next week. You’ll make minimum 50K from intrinsic value of your 500C, but imagine how big the IV will be. Probably over 9000%."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,All the bag holders saying yo buy gme lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,He can still make it all back if GME hits $1500 by next friday.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You could have been DFV if luck was on your side.  Well played.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,There's still hope for your $510 call. You'll get it all back when GME hits $1200 next week.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Watch him make it all back next week as we fly to the heavens
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Should've just gave it to me, could've paid off my parents house lol well, my mom's now since my dad passed 3 years ago"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly why I won’t touch options. I understand how they work but I don’t understand how to make them work in my favor.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,WE HAVE FOUND THE CHOSEN ONE!!! THE GREATEST RETARD OF THEM ALL!!!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"How many people are actually buying GME? If my math is correct there are about 50 million shares in the float... If there are just 500,000 thousand people in the world who buy GME... each person just needs to average 100 shares since 500,000 x 100 = 50,000,000... Now if we have 5 million people in the world buying GME... each person just needs to buy 10 shares... Since 5 million x 10 shares = 50 million... Now if we have 9 million retards on wall street bets each person just needs roughly 6 shares each..."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice, hope the rest of the gme pigs can posted these kind of loss porn."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy shares instead.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I am starting to question my $500 3/19 call now that this guy has similar plans
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait so does he owe $91k now or do his calls just expire and he'll only lose the $1,288?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can someone please explain to me? I thought with options they just become worthless. Isnt the low price on the right how much he paid for the contracts? Why would he have to pay 90k?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow only $9 away from owning $275,000 in stock yesterday on those $275 calls.... Perhaps learn spreads... You'll know your maximum risk. If you end up owning a loser just make money each week selling covered calls at your basis while waiting for the share price to rebound."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"My man. You made the right trade that would have made you millions, just at the wrong time"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Blindly purchasing options contracts not only hurts you but also doesn't help the squeeze.  Just buy shares and HODL if you like the stock
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can someone explain this to me please? What are options?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have total faith in this play. I really feel like it’ll turn around and you’re going to be looking like the goodest retard to ever shit between two toilets. I know they are all saying they think this money is gone, but I know you’re going to be rich off these options when the stock goes up on Monday!!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hell yeah, so what price did you pay for next weeks hope and prayer 510c? I can tell you must be east Coast because market isn’t closed yet on this screenshot. 

Just don’t know how much you added for the 3/19 to completely solve this riddle lol."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,can you teach me please
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You are dumb
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You have shown your diamond hands 💎🙌🏻 Now buy shares and HOLD!! Fellow retard 🚀🚀
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,...???? Why are calls preferred over plain shares right now?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I wanna call him retarded but I can't even understand what all the numbers and words even mean. But I'm still going to keep dumping money into GME. Buy high /sell low apes
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm really confused the little I know I thought the great thing about buying calls is the known risk profile, op didn't pay 90k of premium for those calls right? Any help for how this happened for a newb to options?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"$0.01, 20 buys?

Can somebody explain this to me? I think I’ve figured out stocks, but haven’t learned about options. All I know is it’s more like direct betting?

And does $0.01 20 buys mean you only paid $0.20? If the price of the stock DOES go above your call/bet, how much do you make?

Please don’t make fun of me, I’m just a retard who never consented to my own birth. I’m just trying to make the best of it!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Valhalla has a place for all of us. Don't worry.  Soon.
I know your holding.  HOLD & HODL.

Soon brother ape. Very soon. Promise."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"$GOEV 
$CLNY"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I want to be like you when I grow up
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m very confused, how do I read this. I don’t k is anything about stocks and how to read them"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,does he pay $91287? or $10.80 ?¿
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought we were done with robinhood
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Greed comes before the downfall.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If this thing explodes and we rocket to the moon, we're gonna start a retard fund to help you out. For your bravery in retardation."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Atta boy. 
No one can ever say your hands aren’t DIAMOND 💎"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice! Well done!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not just buy and hold shares? Seems way more effective. -not financial advice.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Eli5 calls
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"bro you have at least to buy one GME, its enough to compensate"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can someone explain 'like I'm 5' how call options work?

Thanks"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re going to be rich, good job."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can’t even handle this. How do I sign up for options trading. If this went the other direction we’d be all lining up to fuck this mans wife’s boyfriend! Unreal, bad lose but worth it just in case."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,we actually need to start a Gofundme for this guy cuz I have no clue how he has survived for this long hahahaha
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"From  what I hear, options tradngs are ruining it for the buy and holders"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Man, I have to learn how to do options. I need this level of drama in my life!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm a little confused as to how Robinhood call options work because I've never used them. Why does he owe this much money? Is this how much he has to pay in premiums?? Because can't he just not exercise the option and take the smaller loss? If that's the amount he has to pay from the premiums then fuck me this guy's nuts.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucking loser
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is why I stick to market orders. I don’t have the balls to play the roulette table.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What exactly am I looking at? Why is this loss so massive if you didn't have to exercise? I thought buying options was to hedge risk.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope this works out for you. If it does you will be rich(er) but many of us will also be swimming in money as well. Rooting for you(us). 🚀🌙
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What's a call?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,DFV should bail you out
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"As someone who doesn't trade stocks, can someone tell me how you lose 31k on 61 GME stocks, when their total value is only like 16k?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,He only lose if he sell right?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hes an engineer. Its all planned. He wanted 30 years of losses to put on his taxes because hes getting paidddd daily.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,If only they were for 3/29
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Here here.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is great.  Sorry for your loss but dayum this is funny.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,More like props for posting this and not killing yourself....assuming op hasn’t already.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahahahahaha
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Look at all his karma - $91k well spent.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,DFV probably wrote and sold those calls on his burner account lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,can y'all help page /u/zjz or /u/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR? we need to get this boi (OP) some flair pls
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Its easy when its some shill shit
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The stock was halted and it showed all his calls as valueless for the duration of the halt, he didn’t loose the money."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You lost money either way, might as well farm karma and awards too 🤷‍♂️


If he was able to drop 90k in something he knows nothing about, chances are it would hardly affect how much hes worth."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Give him a flair with a degree because he basically paid tuition money to learn options in one night
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Next time he should just cut a check to the bank
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't diamond hands a grenade lmao
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mods;

Flair petition. OP deserves it"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thetagang needs tendies, too"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,im glad my broker doesnt have option trading
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Diamond...hands...?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If this guy doesn't get like ""Option Pro"" as flair I'm unfollowing this sub."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,“Admirable” GME retard
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,a flair? he ought to be modded.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Or he has a separate account and took the opposite position/ sold these calls. This seems to retarded to believe
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,A real retard flair please.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the weirdest option trade I’ve seen.  But hey why not?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,💎🙌🏼
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s what I was surprised about. Wow.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Spade hands, for he has dug himself into his own financial grave."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"We already knew that he held them..? His screenshot from yesterday of still having his position **after market close** is holding them. 

People like this guy don't realize that option pricing doesn't happen at market close, it's at the open next day. As soon at 9:30am ET hit Friday, the rest of the $30k in value evaporated once these changed from 1DTE to 0DTE. 

The only thing giving these value is Theta, which decayed its final day, today, lol."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah like a 510 call for next week
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Plus we need more entertainment in the future.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Naughty 😏
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I love u
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't do anything stupid? I think you're too late with that advice.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I doubt someone so casually throwing away this much money needs your consolation.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What other options? Genuinely curious

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m an employee for Robinhood, and thank you for the question. Actually we prefer our clients to utilize alt+f4."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Just unplug it and plug it back in
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Reload last save
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes or No?

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I woke up, 9:37 am (est) and saw 300, thought immediately of this guy; started hoping he’d win."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t do options to ELI5 to me. The first one is an option to buy (what does 20 buys mean here) at 360 that is expires on 3/12 (today). So if the price doesn’t meet that target he forfeits any premium he paid. Correct?

He paid $0.01? Is that the premium. 
So his max loss on that should be less than a dollar. Or maybe I am reading it completely wrong."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro this sounds like some gamblers addiction type stuff.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How did he lose 90K on calls? You can only lose your initial investment right? We’re those premiums high enough when he bought them that he spent 90K? Still relatively new and a little confused by this post
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't really understand how options work. Did he actually lose almost 100k?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That was so cold I need to put on a jacket now
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,RIP bro. I laughed and immediately felt bad.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't get OP diamonding handing these to worthlessness.

Those 275 and 285 were briefly ITM today.

The $275 were worth $17 each at least at one point today. Do at least 17k there and those 285c too.

Ah well. MMs thanks him for his service."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,100% that was all of their money.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s why I followed op. We will watch his career with great interest
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So sorry, me Ape stupid! How OP ape lose $90k? That ape does not have to buy the stocks correct? That ape bought 20 calls at $.01 so that’s 20x100x$.01 so that ape only lost $20 on that one, correct? Sorry, new ape dumb and trying to learn how to lose money like other apes!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,He spent like $1200. Where did you get 90k from?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look at that last call....

He is going to lose millions."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"At least a flair, right?"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahahahhah😂
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Profit? What profit?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,He liked to watch his money melting in front of his eyes
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly selling covered calls on GME right now is like having a license to print money, those premiums are crazy"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"His 10 $275c and 10 $285c would have printed this morning when GME hit $294.  The others would have gone up a decent amount too.  I calculated it, and at $294, he would have made back $51k if he sold at the absolute peak."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hi, Would you mind explaining quickly the post?  The first entry for example. Is that not saying that he paid $0.01 for each option? So is that not just $20 for 2000 options? Don't all 5 of those contacts only cost like $230? I don't see where the 90k in losses comes from."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"> GME needed to hit 325 for him to break even 

At expiry. During the peak today, as I learned as well after checking prices, IV rise was enough that his entire position would've been worth $83,700."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are the first person that kinda explains what happen, everyone else is just shitting on the dude."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This has to just be fuck you money.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"For real though, as someone who's been there it can be quite the burden to haul around while trying to get through your normal life. At least for me I had a decent bit of baggage lugging around while still trying to wake up in the morning and put my usual 110% effort into work."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m rooting for him!! Godspeed OP 🥴
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,imagine how much fun could be had with 90k over a week in amsterdam......thats like 1800 blowjobs.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Or lose $180k in 2 weeks  ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|scream)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Parents
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,He's already lost the money. When he purchased the options the money went from his cash balance to option price. From there all he did was lose 91k because the options lost value. He could have sold 2 today when gme hit 295 (I think it was) and could've salvaged something but he didn't and now all are worthless. He also doubled down on the 500 call expiring next week.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not giving a fuck about 90 thousand dollars, clearly"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,yea in the morning when the price was 290 but he didn’t sell
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,We definitely noticed
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea. He coulda got out this morning on the run up for a small loss relatively speaking.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,you want to lose $90k too?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly. Might have been the equivalent of me tossing 20 bucks on it.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What not to do
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lost $1,200 today of the $4,000 I made on Wednesday. Feelsbad"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,one dumb mf bought 800 calls
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,whoever sold the call to him
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep... the retardation is strong is this one
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Please lower your voice. This is a public forum.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You have the right to buy stock at a specified price ""the strike"" up until a specified date in the future ""the expiry"" thats why they are called options. The premium is multipliedby 100 because each contract controls 100 shares. The premium is just what you pay for the right to buy it. If it goes into the money the price of that contract becomes more related to the actual ammount of money you could make buying all those shares at the strike price and immediately selling them for the difference in price. The profit. Puts are similar to calls but you have the right to sell stock at a certain price until a certain time. Thus if the share price collapses but you can still sell it at that higher strike price there is money to be made."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, and that price was 91K"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,OP hates money
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This guy spent $90,000 on options that expired in one day. Predictably, he lost it all."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I love you both
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Guy bet GME was gonna close higher than those prices.

It didn't.

Lost 91K."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"OP spent 91K where are you seeing $1200?

Edit: $1288 is the current value."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,All of those but one expired today. It's not looking good.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"yesterday this person was 50,000 in the hole. Today, they are 90,000 in the hole."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"He bought a bunch of call options and held them through til they expired and they didn't meet the strike price, so he lost a ton of money."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,More like by high and don’t sell
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"He was hoping GME would go up 100% in a day. Honestly, unlikely but it’s done that a couple of times within the past couple of months me"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes 90k in premiums alone. Now worthless.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,A “Lord of Loss” flair. Or just LOL for short.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Even better still, paper trade options for those 3 months and throw the money you’d lose on those bad options plays into a share or two of a stock."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,look at the expiration date
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,dude he lost 91k
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Guy bought options Thursday, most of them at 0dte (0 days to expire). If these options had hit those strike prices early in the day, he’d have made some good money. Since they didn’t, and expired today, he lost 90k."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"92344.30/100+510=$1433.45 if he waits for it to expire in the money.  However, if the stock rises that much next week the option will be worth more the longer it has until expiration."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Strike + his premium
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Depends how much he paid for it. He'll make $100 for every dollar past $510 minus the cost of the option.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,inthemoney on youtube
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Only $90k. :)
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,practice on a cheap one. or do paper trading. it’ll click once you do one.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,$3k max write off per year with losses. Carry forward the rest.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,He fucked up.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"People like you and me.  If you had 100 shares of GME, you could sell a covered call.  When you sell it, you get paid the amount of the contract.  If it expires worthless, you keep your shares.  If it expires in the money, you get paid the contract price for your shares.

Say you had 100 shares you bought at 100 each.   You can sell a $400 call for next Friday and get paid $1750 today.  On Friday if the stock is worth 399.99, you keep it.   If it's worth $1000, you lose your 100 shares and receive $400 per share for them or $40k.  Whoever bought your contract gets $100k worth of stock for $40k.

Edit to add:. My broker charges 65 cents per contract of 100 shares.  That's how they get paid."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's a great question. It's an important question. Thanks for asking it. As I said in my opening statement, I appreciate you inviting me here to talk about this today. It's something that hasn't been discussed enough in my opinion. In conclusion, we're out of time.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Him.

Why would Robinhood lose money from this. In the meantime, the market makers/institutions/individuals who wrote these calls makes the money (cause the other side 'won' the trade)."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I also was wondering about that... imo he looses the premium. Or am I missing something..
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That screenshot is recent and not when he purchased them.  The contracts are only worth 1 cent because they are expiring worthless.  Look at the total return to see what he paid for them.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yap. But to get 'ITM' it has to actually pass those prices. Hahahhaa.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s going to. Options are a zero sum game, somebodies making 90k"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The call options expired on 3/12, so he lost the premium he paid for the “right” to purchase the shares at his desired strike price."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,if you’re looking to throw away £100k my account number is [redacted]
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It cost him 100k to place these options overall. He doesn't owe 90k, but the ""Total Return"" of -90k indicates that he has lost 90k so far."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That would be so sweet for OP
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, maybe not all of it... Just now seeing there is only 1 contract at $510.  But you could always buy more. Buy some that expire in like 2023 this time."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice flair.  Is there a story?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,These are all debit transactions. The money was up front and now lost.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s how much they were worth when he took the screenshot. He paid $100k for them in advance hoping to sell them for more later.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Perhaps learn the difference between long and short options
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You speculate if the price will reach a certain number. If it does, then have the right to buy 100 shares per contract. As the price reaches the target price, the initial premium is increased and most time people sell these contracts for a higher premium. If the price moves the opposite from your target price then eventually, it will expire worthlessly. So you can choose to sell the contract to someone else for a higher price as it moves closer to the targeted price or exercise it and buy 100 shares when it reaches its targeted price.

If you look at DFV's called option. he turned 20$ call into roughly 26k because it was a 14$ call option and the price is now 260."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucking read
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,If apes can understand options so can you
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,But they expired today
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol. 60 of them expired today
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Some of them were ITM today and he didn't sell. What makes you think he'll sell if it goes up Monday?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,To the individuals who he paid 91k to that were selling them.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"they arent. they can move the market more but they are riskier and a lot of people get into than and don't understand them and lose dummy money, so if you don't understand them dont do them."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao he did!! 60 contracts...all in premiums. 6,000xpremium for those strike prices ."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,90k was the premium.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I understand right, (which it's possible that I don't because I'm retarded), when you purchase the contract, if you hold it until it expires, you're agreeing to purchase 100 shares/ contract at a specified price."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,that’s what they’re worth now not what he paid
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Those are just what they're worth now. They show $.01 but they're really worthless because they've all expired.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"No that’s the individual contract price, and you buy 100 of them. So if the contract was .50, total premium is .50 times 100=$50. If he had bought 20 of those, it’s $50 times 20=$1000 total paid in premium. The price of the contract hinges on IV, and the Greeks, compared to the movement of the underlying stock price. Those fluctuations in contract pricing is how your profit and loss is determined. .01 is basically worthless."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"He lost everything (over $90k). That's all you got to know.

He bought calls. To make money, by the date the calls are due (today), he needed the stock price to be higher than the call price plus the premium he paid for the contract.

Basically, to make money on all his calls, he needed the price of GME to be like $420 or higher today."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,he is poor now
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,He actually loses the $91k cause it’s paid up front and he loses the $10.80 because that  expires out of the money (OTM)
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"An option contract allows you to control 100 shares of a stock with a known risk.

Look at today's numbers.  Buy 57.5 shares at 265 for  15240. Or buy 3 260 calls at 5080 for  15240. 

Next Friday the stock hits $800.  Your stocks are worth 46k.  Your options are worth 240k.  You walk away with either 31k or 224k. 

Or buy 300 shares at 265 for 79500.  Next Friday, the price is 210 and you've lost 16500.  The option buyer lost 15240."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Not like this
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,At least use limit orders fuk
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"His options are worthless if on the day the options are due, the values of the stock price is lower than the call price.

Buying options ""can"" be used to hedge risk. But not everyone buys option to hedge risk in first place. Sometimes, options are used to amplify risk: that's how you see some people in 3 weeks change $1k to $1\~2 million. Each contract is 100 shares. You can use huge leverage with options."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're looking at them expiring worthless.  The risk was hedged when he bought them for 90k.  He can't lose more than that.

I hope the stock passes 900 by next Friday so OP can recoup most of his losses."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Retard
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Either you’re really confused or I’m on acid
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,These aren’t stocks. They’re contracts which give him the option to buy the stocks if the price hits a specified price on or before the contracts expire.  All but one of them expired today. Because the price of the stock did not reach the specified price before they expired they are now worthless. And homeboy is out 91k. A couple of them he could have probably exercised in a tiny timeframe but he chose not to.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, there’s no better way to accumulate wealth than to intentionally lose money in the stock market."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I lost $500.00 on options today. This guy has balls to show off this level of full retard.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This isn’t your normal everyday autism. This is... advanced autism
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You know you never go full retard.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Never go full retard
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Never go full retard.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,And full retard he went indeed
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,in the immortal words of Shotgun Willy never go full retard
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m not sure if it’s possible but I think he went past full retard.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Never go full retard
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The question I have is does he even know he went full retard? Held thru expiration gotta be some kind of special.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,He said he found out how to buy Calls. He never said anything about knowing how to sell them!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"They were up (vs. yesterday’s close) way more than that. His 275s and 285s were up more than 3x. My guess is if we’d pushed a bit higher, say to 300 in that early morning run he could have sold everything for about breakeven just given all the IV, even though he’d need a higher price at end of day to breakeven."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You're being very generous believing he knew he could sell them before expiration.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is how every options transaction works. You look at your 25% gains and believe you can make 100%... greed is the biggest enemy...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Who would have bought the ones that were still far OTM with 0DTE though? Maybe the $275 and the $285, sure, but $300+ Strikes?

I have a feeling a majority of these 500+ upvotes don't even know how Options work."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So im genuinely lost on options,  what's the issue here?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow i can’t believe he didn’t get out....
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Me too. At least I didn’t have as much money as he did, and I did have my calls Monday."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Nope. Even if he sold at 292 today he’d be pretty far in the hole. I did the math.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,yeah its kind of sad to see people cheering other people on for making awful move. take profits where you can as the volatility of the market is high and randoms on the internet aren't going to help pay the bills
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,There was a time the IV went up and he can bag some gain. Too bad
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I saw this and thought of him too.

But then I thought, if he was retarded enough to do this in the first place, there’s no way he’s pulling out!

Just be thinking “I hope he got out” we are disqualified from ever getting to this level."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That was me. 3/12 $800c was up to like $2.99 and I could've sold then. But I wanted to be rich
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s dumb is OP could definitely afford it too. But chose to do this insane yolo
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah idk how much money this means to OP, but I’ve been in similar downward spirals before too (not to this extent tho). He’s definitely feeling like complete shit I can guarantee that. 

Just how bad FOMO can get, least he’s hopefully learned his lesson now"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,“GMEtard Hall of Famer”
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m not sure what you mean. But all his calls expired essentially worthless and OTM today. So yeah he did lose money
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It's unreal to me that a $510 call contract costs over $1000 when that's literally the stock doubling in a week. Like why not just buy shares at that point...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only one though, so it would appear he's learning"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Watch gme hit 1520 next week and cover all of his losses.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That call will print and pay for the rest
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,RESCUE THIS ~~MAN~~ **APE**
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I didn’t even see that! Ahh I love op
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s what we call rolling them.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Never know the 510 Mike print next week if it squeezes and you might recoup everything he lost today
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,When it hits $669/share by 03/18 we'll be praising this autist as the new DFV
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If he weren't so retarded, I'd have a hard-on for his enthusiasm."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I'll fuckin do it again.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If someone says fuck it let's bet another grand on the day they lose 90k, I am assuming none of this really has a meaningful impact on OPs financial health."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah that one's gonna print
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, that $510 call could take over his whole crayon box. Stupid risky, but then this *is* a casino.

Not financial advice."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I worked for a quant algorithm company years ago. A guy went against the advice about leaving the algorithms on overnight. He never did. One morning I got a call that he wanted to make sure the algorithms were turned back on correctly and to remote in and fix anything he forgot. When doing so, I was casually chatting with him and he had lost $60k overnight because the algorithms got out at some point that he shut them off. He didn't get out of the trade like the algorithms did, so he lost. I was apologizing profusely because that was almost my entire year's salary.. it was a lot for me.

""It's no big deal, lesson learned and I'll get it back in a couple of weeks.""  Needless to say, some people just have money to spend. The owner of the company was told by his attorney that even though his contracts were iron clad, the disclaimers were perfect, and everything was set up for his butt to be covered, it didn't mean someone wouldn't try to sue him. He would win every case, but some people really just have fun spending money taking up time in court, too. Those guys are the assholes."

These are worth $20 for the 20 calls as of right now, yes. Since they are out of the money, they will (or already have) expire worthless (unless he exercises the calls). **These calls were not bought at $0.01 per call, they were worth $1000's a couple days ago, which is when they were purchased.** You can look at the call options expiring next week to test the math for yourself. 

I'm actually not sure if Robinhood would allow to exercise a contract that's about to expire that's out of the money, but if they did, this would be basically be paying $20 (for the contract) to buy 2000 GME stock with a strike price of $360, when the actual price of the stock is $264, overpaying by almost $100 per stock."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"No that’s not how calls work. He only bought the 1 contract (“1 Buy”) and it’s worth (10.58 x 100 =) $1,058.00.

Unless GME hits the strike price ($510 per share) next week which is not impossible but highly unlikely"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So if GME hit $380 on 3/12, he’d get to keep all of those buy call options under that price? Which gave him a shit ton of shares for a lower price? Sell Calls would be you get to sell a bunch of shares at a lower price or some shit?"

If he hits the strike price, it'll execute, and he has to pay for those shares unless he asks Robinhood not to execute, deeming the contract worthless, I'm guessing.)    It's just that you mentioned that $1,058 is the most he can lose because that's what he paid for (which I totally understand since he would be out of the money), but are you suggesting he would make money because it would hit strike and (assuming he could afford it) getting the shares and making money from the difference?"

He bought 60 freaking contracts."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"He bought $91k worth of contracts (so the 61 contracts).

Since they never hit those prices, he lost it all.

&#x200B;

In calls, the most you lose is everything you put in. So if prices don't hit, you get capped out at 100% loss. If prices go up, you get infinite potential money.

Basically, it's a ""I lose all"" or ""I get rich"" at the two extremes."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"No one would do that.  Take the 360 call.  He would buy 100 shares at 360 if he exercised it.  He could buy from the market at 265.

His hope was that the stock would be say 400.  Then it would cost 36,000 to buy the shares and then he could sell them for 40,000.  But really he'd just close the contract for a 4,000 profit."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct. Now he doesn’t have to exercise the contracts. He can also choose to turn around and sell them to somebody else before they expire which then gives that person the option to buy. Had the price of the stock itself gone up considerably before the contracts expired, the value of these contracts would have also gone up considerably too. But they can also lose their intrinsic value if the stock price goes down and/or the closer you get to expiration date."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buddy trust me there are way better ways of getting tax cuts due to capital losses than this, off marking something as a capital loss even though you haven't lost anything.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I check this guy’s history comments he actually did some more complicated options. Like cover calls and all. He said he has a gain of almost a million so i think he is just intentionally yoloing 90k to expire worthless for KARMAs. Karma hoe!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You're advanced ape. You know how to use internet and app.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m with you , I bought spent $900 on a $90 call on DMTK and spent $800 on 10 shares - literally minutes after learning about this stock and seeing a  promotional video - within 3 days the stock was at $65 , bought 10 more shares , 24 hours later it’s at $40 - I’m a dumb monkey with aggressive thumbs"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Next week should be gangbusters for you though.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Youll be making profit in no time
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The cents are what his contracts were worth just before expiration. Each contract is for 100 shares, so $0.01 = $1.00 of value. He paid significantly more for the contracts originally and they expired Out of the Money (OTM) and worthless."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Say what you want about WSB — most here talk mad shit but don’t actually wanna see anyone lose. 

I’ve been thinking about this dude every time I saw the ticker. I wanted it to hit so bad for him. Fuck my few shares— I wanted to see someone win on a dumb ass 90k bet."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you’re not gonna pull out, at least wrap it up"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wish I pulled out, I'm too retarded to be allowed to reproduce."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,His dad was wishing he had pulled out.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough, I think I Love you retards like I love the gmed guy—truly a RETARD who needs ❤️"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,">how many people in this sub were watching the tiker and thinking of this dude and all probably hoping he pulled out

I think we can all agree his dad should've pulled out"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I always hope dudes pull out.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,">watching the tiker and thinking of this dude and all probably hoping he pulled out.

But enough about the day they were conceived..."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,His wife’s boyfriend hoped he pulled out too
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I always think of retards before pulling out
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Real men never pull out 😉
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,98% of WSB’s current users are _more than happy_ to encourage this dude and dudes exactly like him. Much cooler to be able to call yourself a retard to other retards than to be able to provide for your family or whatever.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I also called him out for being a [dumbass](https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m31138/_/gqmt2gu/?context=1) lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ouch that sucks. His wife's bf probably called some of his buddies over too.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Only two were up. Only one was up by any significant margin. These options were taken out Thursday or Friday when the price was never above 300.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,or his kneecaps are getting smashed in tomorrow.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This. My man clearly has money to burn...

Edit: my dumb ass just noticed that I just resaid what op said oof. Dont mind me just a fellow retard"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you sure about that? Who knows if he does...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Limit-breaker SSJ3 retardation
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this like a personal attack or something?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What do you mean by that? You sell?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"By buying 90k worth of lottery tickets, basically. Sometimes it works out ([400 into 1mil](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k7anqp/200000_return_4_presplit_tsla_options_purchased/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)) but usually it doesnt."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Explain how you roll a naked 0DTE OTM call lmao. 

You literally just have to sell it back at a loss. That's step #1 in ""rolling.""

These are all priced at 1c premium, or more accurately, zero bids and worthless. There's no 'rolling' these rofl."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I didn’t really look at the contracts when I was responding to the person saying it was ITM. Just looked at the share price and assumed. Thanks for the correction
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fine. Replace ""Exercise"" with ""selling while they're ITM."" Same difference. 

I'm not fucking retarded, of course you need capital to exercise options."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did, but I also can’t read. I feel as if I belong with the autists since I get excited about using $20k in carryover losses to prop up my returns each year"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,join us
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol damn it. God fucking damn it.  I just might also

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It's honestly retarded that Ford doesn't get more attention right now.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol you might be able to flip it on the used market (don't)
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How are leaps different from a call option?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly no idea. Waiting to see what happens. F seems to be moving upwards fast so I think I'll give it another few weeks. 6/18 is still a ways away, and while the time decay is important to consider I think it's got some room to grow upwards still."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How does it make money so far out? Wouldn’t volatility and time decay fuck you over?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm game for it. 

I already drive a Mustang, might as well go on some calls and see how it rolls. 

I do like what they've done with their car lineup, minus the atrocity that is the Mustang SUV lmao. 😬"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks! 🚀
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you tried holding it upside down? 😎
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I was only able to afford one share of gme back when it dipped and I still feel bad for him.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or he did ""know"" what he was doing, and he just fucking sucks at trading, in which case I still don't feel the least bit bad."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,**Tubthumping intensifies**
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This dude super knows what he’s doing don’t be fooled he’s just fucking around and this is probably the equivalent of $1000 to most of us
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly guys same here. I was routing for him so bad all day. Fucking dips are double edged swords. Great to buy but sad when fellow apes take a hit because of them. 

On that note I’m equally autistic and just learning about options these last couple months. Quick question to the other apes as I’m not at your level of retard yet. 

Are there any basic indicators one looks for when placing a call option? Or is it acceptable to just YOLO like the OP to be a true autist and just place a call I can afford to lose? Also I assume I only lose the premium Y x 100 based on number of options purchased?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,agreed just fuckin pissed about it. donate it to charity next time.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t know what should he have done differently? Longer? They were spread nicely...if not for the ladder attack probably would have worked.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah that's what happened.  I was confused too.  Thought that was his buy in.  

Ouch big hit then."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t know robinhoods layout so not sure if that number on the right is purchase price. But in principal yes.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I lost almost this same percentage of my first options trades. So glad I started with $2k instead of $90k.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Today.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I have more than that. I inherited it from my father who was a very frugal career Air Force man. I'm also medically retired through the VA so I have that income as well.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Next to the words total return.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"There’s too much incorrectness in your comment to address fully. Options don’t execute like that, that’s not what he paid for the option, you don’t have to exercise if you don’t want to, that’s not how you profit on options, etc...

I’ll leave you with a resource instead.

Study [this playlist ](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOweupE79XXiBaeH_xBpkUcYUsrAaKQen)as if it were a course you paid for and you will be well on your way."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nobody is playing dumb, your statement was ambiguous."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The percentage would be high, but not as high as 99%."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didn't say it wasn't far off, im saying 99 percent is preposterous"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s the worst part of this one.  That TSLA Put guy was fucked the whole way with crazy positions.  This one had a chance today to come out ahead and he held it straight into the dumpster.  Fuck, one hour went from a life saver to drowning.  Brutal"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Because that's exactly how an engeneer mind works
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, RH is kinda a shitty broker for these kind of posts  cuz you can't tell the purchase premium at a glance"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I wasn't calculating extrinsic
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks. So are those call options automatically exercised on the expiration date? Meaning that he purchased Gme shares on 12 March for $ 275 to $360? Do those $0.01 amounts mean anything?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Huh. Where you get $9.10 from? I don't see it in the picture.

And if you don't understand, the premium was MUCH higher when he bought (cause there was still a 'possibility').

Premiums change depending on IV and all."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"And? Second? Third? Dare I say, “lastly?”"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s just the exact opposite of what you said. The person has no obligation to purchase the stock. They paid a premium for the right but not the obligation to buy the shares.

People often set up automatic purchase if they are in ITM. That’s the opposite of the scenario you described though."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks! I do understand options (somewhat), but I can't believe how many contracts he's bought! Good Lord!

I'm not familiar with his interface either."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That makes sense. Wait- you can do that? Just close an option to lock in instant profit?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I already found a church, invented 3 children at my charge and founded a charity fund, ill be fine.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Actually what he said was he missed out on like a million dollars. You’re slamming a guy all because you misread his comment
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I still appreciate it. I hadn’t seen any worthwhile loss porn in a few weeks until I saw this and my balls were hurting bad
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,this is the way.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You have a point!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It's like scratching lotto tickets .....🤣🤣
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,He had 90k to lose which I bet is more than the average person here can say.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It sounds like we all got the WSB spirit and became a cheer squad. Seriously, I would root for anyone on here over pretty much the rest of the world. I want you all to succeed. That being said, the loss porn is delightful."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Meee fuckin too
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep...he was in my thoughts today...I was watching it pop 295...think at least he’s gone one in the money.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I always root for them to win but it's always entertaining seeing the loss porn
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,No we love loss porn here. This community has changed.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Same dude. I remember checking the price at like 3:30 and thinking “uh oh someone’s going to lose 100k”
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you looking at end day stats because I very much remember a good majority were up 30% when it hit 290 and thought of this dude. Of course moment it dipped it was over.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,is he gonna be fishing with the sleepies like Big Pussy from S'pranos?

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Nope. If you owe that much to the mob you’re going to be made an example out of.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Imma go out on a limb and say he just burned an awful lot of it at once.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Not anymore
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,No. I am definitely not sure of it. Honestly I think any retail trading app/site should include gambling hotline info. If that’s what is going on here i feel truly sorry for the guy. I can imagine losing 50k that you couldn’t afford to lose.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe he's rolling them out in time by selling the ones about to expire and then buying new ones at a later expiration.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, just read through his old post... Didn't realise it was purchased yesterday for today... That was definitely a huge gamble especially for a Friday when generally the market slows down. 

I still feel bad for him though. Hope he is ok and taking it well as one can take it."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Couldn’t he have cashed in on the 2 when the price was $295 and make some of it back?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I said I didn't read it probably, I didn't know he brought it the day before the expiry date. If he had more days before the expiry day."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"These contracts were never ITM...??! What are you smoking lmao. He spent $90k yesterday and lost $60k of it within that day, and lost the remaining $30k today lol

Edit: 

Also exercise and selling are massively different. You forego all remaining time premium on the first one.."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm up 1000% on my June $14.  I think I'm going to buy some 17s with profit

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's a deep ITM call option with a long way to go until EXP. Premium is big, but delta is damn near 1 so it's pretty close to just owning the stock, but requires less collateral."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Imagine buying 100 shares of F today at $13 apiece. $1,300 total cost. Or you spend that same $1,300 on F $12 leaps Expiring Jan 2022. They cost $310 apiece, so you buy 4. Now you control 400 shares. If F doesn't move this year, bad play. But if F climbs to $20: with the stock your $1,300 became $2,000.  $700 gain, 54% return. With the options, now you've got $8,000 worth of stock at a cost of $4,800 + $1,240. = $6,040.  $1,960 gain, 158% return. Your breakeven on F is $15.10. If the stock breaks $15.10, you'll make more on the options than you would have on shares. If F stays below $15.10, you're losing money compared to shares."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,lets goo
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're right that you can only lose the premium. Of course, if you buy out of the money options that expire the next day you're very likely to lose that whole premium."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"His problem is buying out of the money contracts that expire in a FEW DAYS. You’re paying for dog shit wrapped in cat shit. It’s a complete gamble, your contracts have no value other than “hype”, and each day closer to the Friday expiry, that hype gets fucking destroyed. 

Also stop assuming every dip in GME is a “ladder attack”, you realize some people just want to sell and take profits? When a stock goes from $60 to $250, most retail investors will think “well shit that’s amazing, let’s realize these gains” lol..."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Spread nicely?!?!?! They were literally all out of the money and except for the last one, expired in a day or two from him buying. That's like the least spread out possible.

What should he have done differently? Oh I don't know, maybe bought ones that were weeks or months out, or bought them in the money. Obviously hindsight is 20-20, but don't act like this was some brilliant, conservative play that should have netted him big."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"that makes sense. smart as fuck in what they do, stupid as fuck in everything else"

I appreciate the link."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha your comment was almost good until you told me to fuck off you little bitch. You're obviously a small dick energy loser who can't even handle a single question about your feeble mindstate. A lot of people do in fact live on under 2000 a year, but you're clearly far too fucking stupid to allow outside thoughts into your smooth lead weight of a brain. Lick nuts little girl and maybe you'll learn to grow a pair"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Up 100% today is still down 33% overall retard
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I couldn't believe he was only $7k down at one point. Definitely opened my eyes to the insane IV.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"People are greedy. Why you think he purchased $510 calls for next week at the peak of today.

He legit believed this stock was going $400+ by end of today. It's his first time playing calls. Be nice.

I seen people lose a lot more than this (in real life). It's normal... for wsb members :) to bet one's entire retirement and get a yacht or go broke trying."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"No. You have the 'option' to exercise the calls at that price. Most people who buy options just sell the option for a profit/loss.

&#x200B;

Calls are a contract between the person who wrote the contract and the person who bought the contract. And each contract == 100 shares.

It's a promise that by a certain date, the person who bought the contract can purchase the shares at X price. If the price is lower than X on the due date, that promise is worthless (why would anyone buy 100 shares at $360 when GME is $264.50).

Those 1 cent means that those contracts are essentially worthless and he lost everything. At least it's not zero cents :)"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, they expire worthless:

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"/r/options or YouTube.

An option gives you the right but not the obligation to buy at the strike price.  His have no value value because the strike price is above the stock price."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The 9.10$ was in his previous post, but I guess it had allready changed dramatically since purchase. Thanks for your replies. But holy fuck 91k"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"And second, I changed my downvote to an upvote, retard. Have a nice weekend with your wife and her boyfriend 🙏"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Well shit. 😂😂😂 I've been reading so much trying to actually learn things beyond just YOLOing into GME and I was finally starting to feel like I kind of understood options. 🤦🏼‍♀️ Fuck me man. I'm so retarded.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"American style options you can sell/buy to close at anytime. If any options I've sold are out of the money,  I close them Friday afternoon so I can use my money without waiting until Monday.  It costs me $1 and no broker fee.  

I can't speak to how European style options are closed on expiration."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s absolutely wonderfully. Puts my 100-1000 loss in perspective for sure.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I even loaded each of his trades in with his cost and watched the P/L break even.   Obviously the OP has the money to burn or he would have exited when he could.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Same here.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Same here
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You set fire to $500 in solidarity? Hit me up for my Venmo next time you want to give money away.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I was watching it all day. It was never more than about 11.5 percent from the Thursday close of 260.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Since it was never more than 11.5 percent above 260, there is no way it’s more than 30 percent higher than any of these options since all of them are above 260."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hard to collect money from a fish tho
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, hence bein a goon for holding"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Check the GME price action. His 275 and 285 calls were ITM in the morning. IV also spiked at the time, it's likely OP was close to break even at the time.

>Also exercise and selling are massively different. You forego all remaining time premium on the first one..



Yes, I know.

Incidentally, if he had the capital, exercising the 275c and 285c and selling 0-DTE options would've been a great idea for OP."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is this including all the other factors though? I thought holding calls long term cut into your profits big time unless it moves nearly 2x the strike?

Why would I hold the entire time also if I could sell it off at just above the strike?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry what do you mean buy out the money options? Like execute the options?

Edit: I’m an idiot. You mean OTM options. Meaning I buy the shares at the strike price even if their OTM. I’d lose the premium plus I’d be out the difference from market value to my crappy strike price that was OTM"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Should he have bought in the money just to get equally wrecked by theta? I’d say shares first with some FDs to send the rocket 🚀 to Mars. It’s the options combined with the hedged shares pushing these stocks ever higher...buy more options.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh, so everyone sold over a 25 min period to have it rocket back? Seems like a coordinated attack to me or a whale exiting."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That's sucks man.

Is all I felt I had to leave but I figured your smothering brain wouldn't understand, seeing 100k in your lifetime does not mean you have 100k in the bank, did I say in the bank? Cumulatively during anyone live time they are statisticly unlikely to make less than 100k within a lifetime.

Again does this mean they saved 100k no did it mean that if you added all of their income up over their lifetime it would be worth more than 100k of you cant realize you honestly belong in the jungle with the rest of the apes its simple math bro, your point has no logic if you actually read the comment for what it says not what you want it to say."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well that would lose you money too, but you should never ever do that. You could spend the same money and buy more shares on the market. 

What I meant was buying calls with a strike price higher than the current price of the stock. If you buy calls that expire in 1 day with a strike price of 400 while it's at 270, you might win big if it hits but it's extremely likely that they expire worthless and you're just out of your premium."

It's literally a ponzi scheme, you're just hoping you're not the one left holding the bag when it eventually craters again.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah, now how would I win big? If let’s say based on your example, the strike price is 400 expiring in 1 day and it’s currently 270. But suddenly at end of day or first thing in the morning on the expiration day it hits 400 wouldn’t I only benefit by selling the options? If I were to buy at the strike price, which also happens to be market value as it just hit 400, wouldn’t I break even on the execution of that contract? Wouldn’t I only benefit by executing the contract(s) assuming the strike price is actually below the new market value so there’s a difference for me to benefit from on the sale of those shares once I buy them?

Please feel free to correct my understanding as I’m insanely interested in investing in GME with calls."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,My point is the options are super expensive due to IV so you have to look at the point in time at which they’re bought...they all end up at zero on expiry if OTM. 🙄 The stock lost momentum so that’s what nailed him...same can happen next week or the week after or in a month. It’s a bet...big win or big loss. I don’t know...the 800 calls seem like a more risky bet but a guy on here was flipping those for a handsome profit as the stock was running. Thanks for the dialogue.

Not the first time our country has had something like that happen. Hell, we survived a literal Civil War.

>Billionaires have increased their wealth 100x fold in the year that 10s of millions have gone bankrupt and lost their jobs in the same period of time.

Yeah, because the products their companies create are extremely valuable in the day of social distancing. Their companies increased in value, not their personal wealth. Not sure why that would cause society to break down though...

>Unless this world, and especially America, dramatically changes things soon, there will no longer be life as we know it in 40 years, that's a guarantee.

Full Disclosure I have 10 6/18 $28 Calls and 227 Shares of 1-800-Flowers

This is a shorter term play.

We just saw great earning in previous QTR, I expect another great round of earnings with valentines day, and not to be a piece of shit but the huge covid spikes causing death and sickness where flowers sales without contact will spike.

With the massive earning from Q4 we didn’t see much of a pop, it grew before the report. I expect similar situations for Q1 earnings

Once covid subsides I would expect 1-800 to take a nose dive so we are talking 3-6 months max! My wifes boyfriend sends these to her all the time and she loves it. I have sent feedback to request crayons added for the smooth brains.

The company has a few subs that compliment flowers. their indoor plant business has also had a large boom with people working from home.

I supported the cause and got my boo thang some for v day. The product was amazing so i felt comfortable holding.

TLDR: 40$ is exit, short term strategy, wifes boyfriend sends these to her all the time."

Due to local fluctuations in the tropopause, the jet stream has been shifting rapidly in a counterclockwise vector, causing a rapid disincorporation of the Hadley vortex cells in the lower ionosphere.

Because of this, the geostrophic solar wind balance has deteriorated rapidly in the northern hemisphere. 

In essence, autumnal weather patterns in the western United States will lead to the smallest potato yield in recorded history.

Prediction, something along the lines:

""This is Ryan Cohen, I would like to answer this question while clearing up some rumors. So yes, it is true, we are pivoting the entire Gamestop company to a technology-based firm. We will leverage our existing relationships to achieve this endeavor. 

This will be no easy feat and the transition will experience hiccups as is typical with a transition of this magnitude. However our confidence has never been higher, in large part due to the creation of our new team and new vision. With such diversity of thought and an eagerness to shake the status quo, better days are only ahead for Gamestop

The Gamestop technologies will consist of 3 parts:

1.	Cloud Gaming 
2.	Gaming Development
3.	Artificial Intelligence

I bring this up because the significance of how exposed shorts are, in the market at large, is entering the common wisdom. The term “gamma squeeze” is a novel concept that the big players are starting to pick apart only now. With as many derivatives there are in the market now, nobody really knows how deep the rabbit hole goes.

One thing for sure, though - with interest below inflation and wages staying flat for decades, more people are going to wager more of what they can peel off into the market than ever before in the desperate hope of getting ahead.

I’m at a loss, because my best friend’s family and our mutual friends on her side all think I worked there. And they’ve always told others and talked about it. I even brought them around the area and said yeah that’s where I used to have lunch, etc etc.

This doesn’t sound like a big deal but it is because I lied for such a long time and it’s embarrassing to confess it, especially the fact that I played along for so long and acted like I did work there, to the point to keeping up the lie by bringing them around the office area.

Pretty good post from Yahoo:

Here we are with 60mil shares available to trade and about 3x that trading. As much as wallst and SEC together tried to keep the lid on the synthetic shares. News is getting out. How could it not? Let's face a hard truth, do you think the stock would rise 1300% in a month if there wasn't possibility of an infinite squeeze?

The squeeze is called infinite and the short is called naked because synthetic shares were created between the shortsellers and the clearing house. This is a hard fact. The squeeze will continue until all those shares, estimated to be about 3x actual shares are covered at current at GME price. Given the magnitude of the problem, this puts the stock automatically around $800, thus the $800 options.

Will it happen? It will absolutely happen if retail and instutional holders don't sell their shares and why would they? They together hold more than the float, in fact, they hold 2x the float. Even if today all retail and instutions sold their shares, it still wouldn't cover the naked short.

There is fraud here and the SEC will make sure those sythetic shares are covered by the hedges. Nobody will care about a few hedgefunds getting sacrified to avoid the problem from threatening systemic risk. I believe at this point everybody sees the reality, including shorts. With each dollar GME goes up, the problem grows to unmanagable sizes. Hold."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm looking at a bunch of possibilities and it's maddening.

AMC:  Did good for me today.  Analysts are against it, but NYC just reopened.  LA is reopening.  Sort of the redheaded step child right now with GME being the golden child.  Dare I buy calls in the face of possibly trading flat at 11 all next week?

GME:  Great news over the past weeks.  Great management coming in.  Surged like a son of a bitch back from 40.  Stimulus checks coming out and Hedge funds haven't figured out to leave this one alone.  But it's expensive.  I mean I don't have the cash for options.  It would eat up most of my stimmy check buying a few shares, but it's another Ape in the take over of the planet.

Ford:  Bullish good news with the EV.  Chipped into Tesla.  Rinky dink recall of 2.9 million cars for air bag inflator.  It's right there at it's 52 week high.  So does the mo carry this sucker over 14 bucks.  Or does the ""bad news"" and being near its high make it a juicy target and puts are the play?

BB:  So the EV news with Ford was cool.  BB worked with Ford and Jag for a time so there is a relationship there.  Ford owned Jag for a minute back in the day.  So why is that important?  Well Tesla is probably doing their stuff all in house, Ford will probably reach out to BB again.  Ford has been chipping away at Tesla too in the EV market.  So Ford and BB rise and fall together?

TESLA:  692 feels cheap to me.  I never got into the whole Elon thing.  But I listened to a few interviews and appearances on Joe Rogan.  He's an impressive idea machine that can sell the idea.  So yeah I can see it rising again over the next few months.  Also that spin off is going to be ridiculous."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The first time you saw her, she had sunburn on her cheeks. She asked you your name, and you stammered and fumbled to spit it out. She laughed, not *at* you, but *of* you--as if in celebration of the cocktail of genes and experiences that made *you*, a boy who stammers and fumbles when girls with sunburnt cheeks ask your name.

The last time you saw her, after many years of marriage, she had tears on her cheeks. She asked who you were, who you had become, and without hesitation you screamed ""DEEPFUCKINGVALUE!"" She laughed, *at* you, not *of* you--as if in confused concern for the integrity of the tiny strings holding your sanity together.

She's been gone for days now. Or is it weeks? As you look at your 3/19 800Cs, down 90%, you start to weep. Quietly at first, then violently. The cocktail of genes and experiences that made *you* apparently made a boy with a gambling problem."

A lot of people boarded the rocket late (as in when GME was higher than $10.00), which is sad for us, but we're still hodling...

There will be a window of opportunity if GME moons. Once we've cashed out, other securities are likely to have fallen substantially as those who were shorting GME into the ground will have to liquidate their holdings to cover their shorts.

When that happens, there will be a brief window of opportunity for people to roll their gains into NOT. MEME. STOCKS.

ACTUAL FUCKING TRIED AND TRUE PROVEN STOCKS.

TESLA

NVIDIA

MICROSOFT

BACK INTO GME (once the price becomes rational).

You know? BOOMER STOCKS? The ones that made these fat fucks ALL THE MONEY to begin with?

All I'm saying is NOW is the time to start doing some DD on OTHER investment opportunities and start looking for where you want to roll your gains to get even more sick gains.

Start looking into which stocks might be tanking. Start looking into their history. Are these companies worth investing? Do I LIKE THOSE STOCKS? Ask yourselves these questions and then get ready to (maybe) have ALL THE FUCKING MONEY!!!

Seriously I’m not joking. Go long on WMT with me on Shares and Leaps. It’s a legit 100% play in at least the next 1-2 years but patience is required.

As of their last earnings they are now second in the US for e-commerce sales.

They saw a triplet digit % increase in traffic flow to their e-commerce market place along with pickup & delivery

Walmart is the second largest company in e-commerce now, and the gap from 1st to 2nd is large so they have room to grow and get more share.

Amazon is #1 at 39% of e-commerce volume and Walmart is #2 at 5.8%

At 5.8% their e-commerce sales were 18% or 6.3 billion dollars of their net sales in Q4

Some simpleton math on my end is let’s say they grow and capture 10% of e-commerce by 2022.

That would be a 138% growth of their e-commerce sales which I believe they are already experiencing as of Q4

Gaining that additional 4.2% of the market would bring in an additional 34.8 billion a year to Walmart’s net sales of 520 billion

That’s a 7% growth in their revenue streams.

In addition Amazon is seeing an exit of talent that built them which could be risky for future business.

Here’s the breakdown:
1. 4.5 million for luxurious housing. A dope Miami condo is around 2 million, and would cost about 75,000 a year in taxes, HOA fees, and insurance to own. This would require an additional 2.5 million in order to use a SWR of 3% to cover annual costs.

2. 150k for mercedes, Porsche, jag, model s, low end mclaren, or Maserati 

3. 5.3 million left over for living expenses and discretionary spending. If you took 20 percent of that and wheeled blue chips with a bit of margin you could expect 130k per year after taxes and the remaining 80% in bonds/mutual funds with a SWR of 3% would get you 150k per year after taxes. That’s 280k per year or 23,000 USD a month at your disposal to spend on whatever you see fit.

Sure you wouldn’t have a super yacht or a massive mansion. But you could make a lot happen with that. And never work another day in your life."

You don't agree with them, you want to stay long the stock, you want to buy the stock, great. But if you're going to try to target us just because we're saying things that are not nice about a given company, well, then you know, we're gonna protect ourselves and possibly even look to capitalize on that kind of insanity.’”"

*If the long holders of GME shares did not break ranks and sell en masse, it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time.*

*That is because, without a critical mass of long-side holders selling into the market, the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered (bought back) their short positions.* 

*In this second scenario, though, the hedge funds that are short — with tens of billions of dollars on the line — could have decided to play a high-stakes trick.*

*The trick would be: “Make it look like we’ve covered our shorts when we really haven’t (because we can’t), so that short interest falls and the Reddit army gets demoralized, thus breaking the squeeze.”...""*

To give an example, one theater i worked at had a rent of 40k PER WEEK. I’m sure they’ve reached some deals with their landlords so they’re not paying their full rent, but it’s impossible for theaters to make a profit with capacity restrictions.

The goal is to provide as much service as possible while not running at a profit.

I mean, if the USPS wanted a profit they just need to change every day door delivery to a subscription service with a monthly cost in the same ballpark as a Netflix account, if a hundred million households and businesses signed up for USPS Prime at 10 bucks a month, you guessed it, drowning in money, but then the ethical dilemma of withholding service to those that couldn't afford it would cause Congress to strike it down.

Don't set your fellow apes up for failure.  Stress and anxiety are the distance between expectation and reality.   Ignore posts with specific dates.  Stop upvoting them.

As every sale also was bought again, to me is a good sign.

The positive sentiment and reinforcement of the idea that “liftoff is imminent” or “mooning today” is all good fun, but once you begin to ignore all of this rhetoric it becomes so much easier to just hold your shares, and wait. 

By setting expectations or buying into specific times lines for the squeeze, you set yourself up for disappointment on a near daily basis. A lot of people regurgitate similar information to what they have read posted by other users with no factual knowledge to back up any of their claims simply to be the hype man, but people latch on to it as if they’re Nostradamus.

It’s all in good fun and does a good job to get everyone excited, but I believe that the timelines proposed by users continuously failing to deliver is the exact type of situation that will cause people to paper-hand."

I have my doubts that it's gonna moon. not because anything's incorrect about the analysis, but because the hedges have a whole lot more ways to manipulate and play outside the game.    


I realized some modest gains today, and i'm glad i did. made about $400 that i'll buy back in when it gets down to the 30/40 range again. if i'm wrong, oh well. woulda been nice to moon, but i don't see it happening. this sub turned into Qanon for a bit there, moving goalposts and always hyping a date \*just far enough\* in the future that nobody would be surprised when it didn't happen.  


i'm not saying that GME is dead, there's definitely smart plays to be made, but i don't think we're gonna see anything above MAYBE $400/share.

this is not financial advice, i just like the stock"

Then DFV doubled down, and it spiked to freaking $90. I knew at that moment that this was all real and I will never doubt it again. I'm a patient man and can wait as long as is needed."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Because it wasnt 23/2 it was 24/2. I know because i was sitting with my family on my fathers birthday freacking out on the 177 after hours making almost 4x my money in about 2 hours. (Unrealised)
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You'll no get a shilling till yer gifts are rendered to a Scottish lass
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Need or want?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm pretty sure my options called it
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,All I needed to see was DFV doubling his position. I bought more the following Monday. I had a feeling it was gonna pop off again after that.  I bought more as it climbed until I was content with my position. No regerts.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"God that was the greatest day. I will never repeat that kind of return, but it was incredible to see my weeklies that were more than 5x OTM go from $4 per contract to over $3,000 the following morning when I sold. And of course, a day later they expired worthless."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Genuine question, what’s to stop two hedge funds from buying one share, then selling it back to each other and consider their short positions closed?

Or am I just not understanding this correctly"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s still #1 shorted stock on the planet yet it’s still having sell resistances and shit. I’m not a shill but we need to accept that we aren’t in the same position as Jan 28th. I don’t think the squeeze will be as massive as it would’ve been in January.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Was that Shakespeare?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow. This was fucking beautiful.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dips are for buying, yes? I'm hoping to get more than one or two shares next week but never know. I don't think I'll add any more than that if it's still over 250."

All the people who have hoped on, including myself, with little to no knowledge get discouraged every time someone says it's today, or tomorrow blah blah. There's thousands of people in here with less than 100 shares. And if they all start selling..... The little people who speak of are here as a whole and continuing to string them along on a circle jerk is kinda shit"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Retard. Tomorrow’s Saturday.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stop, you're giving me $ERXN!

If it dips to $20s or even $40s again, I may panic-buy again, good chance to average down and round up my shares to an even 100 count. 

$HODL $ERXN"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Speaking words of wisdom. Let it dip.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck, I hope they don't find out that if it dips to $5 on Monday I'm selling everything I have."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol this kind of posts is exactly what you describe. The squeeze is not GUARANTEED.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The question I have is what is going to be the “moon?” Is it 800,1K,5K,10K, 25K,100K ? Nobody really knows what the ceiling is going to be."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you just hopped on know that at some point you could be personally attacked for holding GME. This sub went from 💎👐🦍 and positive memes to a bloodbath of hate towards GME almost overnight. Some may be shills, some may be jaded people who never got on the rocket. Either way they will make you question your sanity and try to convince you to take money out of a falling stock and put it in a rising one to make money. Rule #1 of stocks. Don't let emotions run your trades. Stick to your thesis.

EDIT: there are screencaps proving shills are trying to come across as OG WSB. They replied to themselves as if they were two different users, but forgot to switch accounts. They want newbies to think that the members who were here before them have sold and openly mock their stupidity for bag holding."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have also never understood the $100k target.
With as much institutional ownership has there is in GME, I fully except them to sell long before it hits that target"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I would imagine buying dips could speed things along too.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,20% or 120%. What’s the difference really...?  Btw I’m holding 40 shares but the DD doth warrant some scrutiny

New buyers not knowing what to believe will come in with stimulus checks causing a big spike immediately followed by a dive bomb with no SSR. ""Fuck! Yahoo Finance was right!""

Poor, virgin-stockholder, paperhand apes.
T'is not their fault. They know not the ways of the squeeze.

Until they learn, I'll take my tendies with extra dip."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Went all in at $38.50 and averaged down.  In retrospect, it was a very good decision"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have to admit, the doubts had started to creep in for me too. I started to consider alternative investments that might be able to get back the money I'd lost holding the GME bag. Then like a ray of sunshine through the clouds, DFV spoke confidence into my heart without saying a word."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So you’re saying... if we want it to moon, all we have to do is hack the FedWire again?

*Not legal advice*"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How did FedWire breaking cause the price spike though?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Diamond hands?  And that we are well above 100% of float
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What are they gonna cover with if we aren't selling to them?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m a moron but this is what I believe has been goin on for two weeks
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Nothing which is why the short % had been steadily decreasing
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seems like that's what they've been doing these past two days. Given the reported short interest, it takes less than 2 days to cover all shorts."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shorts are basically loans.

The brokers ""owned the actual share"", not the hedge funds. The shares are sold on market, and the brokers don't want the cash back: they want the shares that were sold in the first place + interest/fees.

Once a share is returned to cover, it's not there for the hedge to sell. They already sold it in the beginning, they can only buy."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That's...my point.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it animated or puppetry? Because I might watch one but not the other.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Gamma to $350.... huh??????
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy boomers
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How is it not guaranteed? How can these guys unwind their 200%+ short interest without it resulting in a squeeze with this current climate? We all suddenly turn paper hands collectively? Nope. Government intervention? Nope. Assassinating Ryan Cohen? Maybe.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You answered your own question.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"What we have been seeing the past month is just a growing stock. When it moons you will fucking know. Did you see the big dip Wednesday? It will be like that, but up, and it will keep on going. Not a mere half an hour spike. That's partly what hold means. Hold your jizz in your pants so you don't blow your load too early and never get to see the moon. It won't happen in a blink. It could be going up over days."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Be prepared to take profits on the way up. I suggest planning when you can sell a small fraction of your shares so that you at least get your initial investment back, keeping in mind that you will need to pay taxes on profits. Then you can hold the remaining shares longer without risking big losses.

Next plan for bigger increments at which you will sell a few more shares along the way for profit, and also think about dips where you might choose to buy a few more. You’ll never correctly predict the peak, very few people will get lucky enough to sell at the peak."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only 800? No way. 1k? Almost certainly not. The math alone shows it should rocket through both with little resistance. Some finance person (I forget who) not that long ago even admitted that without Robinhood’s fuckery, it would have broken 1000 in the first gamma. On the other side, 100k? It’s possible if basically everyone diamond hands to then, but I don’t trust enough people to not sell long before then to keep the momentum going. My personal guess, if it all goes down smoothly, is a peak around 20-30k. That’s where I’m holding to unless the momentum looks like it’ll rip past that like it should 800. If it goes further, awesome."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm by no means an expert on bank plumbing, but the outage and the Cohen announcement were around the same time. My thought was that it tied up liquidity between banks and maybe institutions on the short side, so it could have been harder to access capital for shorts and options."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's the idea. We sell when we decide the price is good. Until then, it's a big fuck you to them. I want the squeeze to happen because potentially 3 shares could go to infinity as long as I sell before the whole joke collapses. Hedge fund killing is a bonus. I'm just here for a 300000$ payoff."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You are indeed a moron.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So the squeeze is potentially over? Being realistic here
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How are they covering if no one is selling? Your logic is flawed my friend and you don’t know how this works.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Short interest is self reported.  Melvin, Citadel, etc say

Dear Finra,

We cleared most of our short positions.  Promise.  Love you.  Bye.

There is no actual verification of whether they are or are not."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I have short interest (via puts).  The first one is at a $180 strike.  Do you really think they haven't taken the opportunity to cover the previous short position with an all new one at a much higher strike?  It's tendies all the way down.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You're not supposed to say that here.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Alright thx for the explanation!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Fomosphere talking about leaving the Exosphere.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hell it nosedived in one day this week and still ended positive.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Please let it keep nose diving. Keep in mind the charts at $260 look wildly different between January and today. Might not be lucky enough to see big dips going forward.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,LOL we'll be buying his shares at the next dip
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Not a short squeeze, a gamma squeeze. That's how we got our $50 jumps this week."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty subjective, like porn, you know it when you see it."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because no one knows what the short float really is.  Officially, it's like 30%, the rest of the numbers you hear are speculation.  Then, there's the fact that there are, literally, so many ways to hedge positions.  Hell, they're the ones who are probably selling wsb their calls and also selling retail shorts their puts.  Hedge funds hedge.  To think they haven't hedged their positions right now is sort of silly.  You can even hedge rho (the interest on the short float).  GME could ride flat here for two years until a market collapse forces the smooth brained to have to sell so they can actually afford real bananas. Or, any number of thousands of potential cases could force the stock back toward $40.  Everyone here was shilling on the last spike that it was spiking to $1000, no less, and it plummeted back to $40.  It could do this 10x.  Nobody has a fucking clue and anyone saying they do is a shill.

Nothing...absolutely fucking nothing in the stock market is guaranteed.  Ever."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"How do you know it didn’t already happen when it spiked from 40 to 500? That’s literally higher percentage-wise than the VW squeeze which everyone wanted to compare it to. What’s the huge catalyst that’s left to create a squeeze still?

Why is everyone ignoring that it already skyrocketed?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because some people understand opportunity cost, and not everyone is going to sit here with their entire life savings wrapped up for weeks/months if things don't happen quickly. It faded out before because once you knock out the initial momentum (by a 50% dip in 20 minutes) its really hard to regain that kind of steam. The low amount of shares makes it easy to rocket the price up when everyone has cash, but eventually people holding 1000,100000,10000000 shares are going to take profits, tanking the price until everyone left holding GME is just retail apes. I mean I hope it moons and we all get rich, but lets not pretend the hedge fund guys arent making up just as much as they are losing selling idiot noobs 0 dte  calls that are $500 OTM."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I am not a smart man.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for clarifying. Holding is exactly what I plan to do!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah unfortunately I only have 14 shares but I will most certainly take this approach while I buy more shares on any dips. Just hoping to come out with at least 100-200K after taxes but I’ll take what I can get. I know it’s a long shot but we’ll see! Best of luck to all my apes 🦍

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel that institutional funds will not 💎👐 GME to 100k for a couple of reasons-

1) some of the largest institutional funds as of 12/30 (the most recent date they had to disclose their positions), already have greatly reduced their holdings. Fidilety and Senvest (who held about 20% of the shares ) have already sold
2) Fund managers like to limit how much of their fund is in a single stock. If GME were to increase 300x from current prices, they will sell at least some of their GME so it doesn't account for 70% of their funds value.
3) I don't think that the incentives for institutional funds to hold for such a high price are as strong as they are for individual investors"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah man. Everyone has a different stake in this of course, but for me I see it as fun money. I will continue to put in what I can afford, when I can, and try and do it on a low. If this thing completely busts and I was wrong, oh well, I'm not upset that I no longer have the beer I bought last year. However, if it moons I might be able to afford a down payment on a house or actually buy a vehicle off the lot one day."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,My initial investment was around $330/share until the RH fuckery.  Took a big L but then watched it for a few weeks and it felt like 38.50-40 was the new floor so I YOLOd and brought my average down from like $300 to $48
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Makes no difference in reality.

GME is a battle of attrition between longs and shorts.

Whoever is more patient, wins.

Thats why the mantra of buy and hold matters so much. And why day trading HURTS because brokers don't have to actually deliver your shares for nearly a month IIRC. That gets reset every time you sell and buy."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm just here to kill a hedge fund. I'll hold GME until the sun goes Nova.

If I make some money in the process that's nice. But I can't make money without selling, unless options become cheap enough for me to snag a few.

As for the shares? They'll become family heirlooms. You'll have to pry them from some distant descendant's cold dead hands, because I like the stock.

And so will they.

Going to be a requirement in my will. They only get the shares if they agree to never sell them, and if they try they go into a trust they can't touch.

I've set fire to more money at a craps table and a roulette wheel.

99% loss in value don't scare me.

How you gonna get me to sell if I'm ready to hold to 0?

Shit, get low enough I'll buy the whole damn company, turn it around, make it the worldwide leader in gaming, online and off, pay every employee at least $75,000, and personally shit on the desk of any hedge fund manager that tries to take me down."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,$300k per share? Or total? Just curious what your prediction/goal is.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Either it goes to the ground and lose $200 on 2.2 shares @91 lmao 🤣  vs it goes to infinity and I ain't longer wage slave on the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀 That's all the DD i need.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are gamma and short squeezes. A gamma squeeze has already happened and isn't likely to happen again. The short squeeze is theoretically ongoing but the time line is even less defined. 

Gme at this price point isn't a good investment, it's wild speculation. It's still possible to make good tendies but in the last go around there were lots of bag holders at 300+/share."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"What do you mean no one is selling? 
Plenty of people are selling. 

If no one is selling, how is anyone buying?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"But you're confident and staking money on the premise they're lying? Or is it just a gamble you think will pay off? I sold my gme at 280 before the huge dip and recovery, so I no longer have skin in the game."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You have short interest. Via puts. 

Not sure you have any idea what you're talking about.

Also, if you cover your short at 300, and then short again at 300, you haven't done *anything*. You're in the exact same position you were before."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is so important. You know they planned and plotted for that one big moment and when it dropped it bounced right back as if nothing had happened. The wild rollercoaster has done nothing but condition and strengthen our resolve.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look what you’re saying makes sense but it’s pure conjecture. We don’t have the facts either so we need to [use logic](https://i.imgur.com/Av31GsB.jpg) to deduce the most likely outcome.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because the volume didn’t match up with the outstanding short float at the time is why. And brokers froze trading going up, is why. RH only let people sell and not buy is why. Also immediately after Melvin had to take another huge loan, is why. The squeeze is not yet squoze."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cuz their FUD tactics is out of control. No need to FUD if they don't stand to gain anything from FUD. The FUD and the bots are real, just check the DD. To say it's not is to deny reality. There's only one reason why they want us to sell gme, and that is that this is not over. Shorts haven't covered. Even during first congressional hearing they said the spike was from aggressive options (aka gamma squeeze), not short squeeze. And if 500 was the height of the short squeeze then they should have just let it happen organically, and not cut off our legs by freezing buying.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Say you took a short position in early January at the $10 level.  You saw the stock climb over $200.  You take a another short position at $200.  Six days later, it's back at $40.  You buy stock to close out both positions at $130 a share of profit.  Obviously, you paid interest in the process, but at the levels these cats are playing it, it's minimal compared to the gains.

The point is no one knows how high this thing will go if/when it does eventually rocket to the moon.  BUT, everyone knows that the price will subsequently fall back to reality at some point."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,">Also, if you cover your short at 300, and then short again at 300

Not necessarily. If you cover at 300 and short again at 300, there are multiple (potential) advantages. First and foremost, you covered. You are not lying when you report you have covered.

Secondly, your short FROM 300 can net more gains than the short you covered AT 300.

Lastly, I'll put this in terms of DCA'ing down: if you bought 100 shares at 300, them price tanks to 50, at which point you buy 1,000 shares, your new average is $72 per share. Similarly, if you short 500k shares and it goes in the wrong direction, so when you cover at 300 you then short 2,000,000 shares at 300, the shares only have to drop to (let's just throw an example out there) 150 for you to fully recover. This is without knowing what the losses were on the first short and assuming $300mil can offset some or all of your losses on the initial short.

We know they're losing billions, but ""they"" ≠ Melvin alone. Melvin is not the one and only GME shorting toolbag."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sometimes, they will take delta positions.  Not really a YOLO.  Doesn't take a large position tog et run over with a $300 movement against you.  But, that was round 1.  This is round 2, and fact is, there's bigger easier money to be made now than trying to guess direction by just staying delta neutral and capturing IV.  I mean, shit, literally thousands of free dollars baked into every option in IV.   Easy, literally printing money, as long as you stay out of a delta position.  

I mean, I'm just some ape loving in TN and I see this.  I'm sure that and entire department of IVY league educated Asians in the Quant department of Melvon, doesn't though.   Best to believe the pampers and shills on wsb with their populist bullshit."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Logically, Gamestop right now is a shit show and nobody knows if it will moon, or drop back to $40.  Nobody knows.   What is clearly fucking obvious is that volatility premiums are sky fucking high.  .

So, if I was Mr hedge fund and I was paying top dollar to the smartest quants coming out of Asia I would be de-risking the hell out of my delta position and moving into a Vega position where there are literally thousands and thousands of dollars in volatility to be captured per order.   So, I would build me a nice little delta neutral position such that I don't give a fuck which way it goes and wait to make billions and billions off the absolutely inevitable IV drop.

I mean, that's logical.  Getting into the details about if the short float is real, or not, isn't logic, it's wild guessing."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The shorts have covered a lot more since the first squeeze. So what exactly is going to make it ever go that high again if isn't not even shorted as much as it was then? And FUD isn't a catalyst. You still need a big catalyst for the price to get higher and for the  squeeze to happen. Remember when all the billboards were being put up and the internet was going crazy over it? You're going to need something like that again for it to even happen again. This sub buying 5 shares at a time isn't doing anything.

Nobody has a definite answer, and all concrete information is extremely outdated. Even s3 doesn't really know. Nothing wrong with calling a gamble a gamble. A lot of people made money on gme.

I went from 40 -> 280. 7x is not paper hands."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"We don't need  any catalyst. This is a situation of death by a thousand cuts. The fact that they have a huge short position and paying fees and interest on their position everyday means they can't hold their position forever. Short squeeze will happen eventually. Need a catalyst if you want it to happen soon tho.

And Q4 2020 report or Q1 2021 reports will be a big upcoming catalyst due to Ryan working CHWY magic on GME. Stop FUDing and just short gme and post your position if you don't have faith in gme. Your standing to gain the difference of current price to $40 if you really think it's going back to $40."

These last 2 days kinda feel like the last few days of january. I think there will still be a decent spike next week once people get those stimmies, but I also think people are gonna take profits , especially those who watched tens/hundreds of thousands of dollars vaporize in front of their faces. You can't honestly believe everyone in here is going to hold for 100k/share, or even 1000k a share. The only people who make money on a stock like this are the ones trying to stay 10 steps ahead of the next guy."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The issue I have with that logic is that if it was death by a thousand cuts and it's just a matter of time before the squeeze happens then why isn't every hedge fund or billionaire in the world investing in GME at this point? If a squeeze is happening then it's guaranteed money yet it's just small internet communities at this point. Yes, there are some big whales who own shares but you'd think it would be *more* if a squeeze is guaranteed. For example, why did Chamath Palihapitiya only buy calls instead of shares if the squeeze was inevitable? 

Sometimes this sub feels like it's the blind leading the blind and no one actually knows what they're talking about. I mean, just look at [this post from today](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m47vi8/gme_option_flow_by_the_number_just_hodl_smooth/). 99% of the people say they have no idea what it means but they accepted it even though it was completely wrong when it was first posted. What if that one person never visited that post and corrected OP? The person who corrected them even got downvoted at first. 

The people who are posting incorrect DD are the same people who keep claiming a squeeze is happening. Ever thought that maybe all this squeeze shit was based off bad DD in the first place? And like I said in my first post, what if the squeeze is when it went from 40 to 500 already?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Except 80% of the players are in the green at 270 😂 love me some heavy green bags.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats on the gains bro.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Genuine question, what solid reason do you see while looking at that graph to leave 7x gains on the table? (I'll still gamble with my remaining 8 shares, but that's just for funsies)

To you, is there a reason to be bullish besides believing in the squeeze and believing in your ability to navigate a bubble? I haven't seen compelling evidence for the former, and I'm too stupid to do the latter."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think there's anything beyond speculation. Shorts could have covered, or they could have doubled down, and we'd probably be in similar situations. Idk why speculation that shorts are fucked is more reliable than speculation that they're not."

2021-03-12 22:54:44,wallstreetbets,"Trading Tips for Novice Apes I scored me an Adderall yesterday and in my amphetamine-induced madness sat down and wrote a bunch of rambling crap about trading stonks and options for beginners. I know, let's let the newbies lose all their money and clean out this trash-heap, but come on, the paper trading competition is more effective than sheer stupidity. Anyways, here's some tips to not lose money, at least not as quickly as $800 GME calls.

  DiVeRsIfY!

Options are great. No, not those kind of options, but options like how normal people use the word. Basically when trading it’s hard to be right 100% of the time, so why risk your whole account by owning a single stock? It’s dangerous because *you will be wrong* and if you bet it all when you’re wrong, even if it is rare, you’re out of the game. All the money is gone. You might even *owe money to the broker* if you did something really dumb.

Diversification is sometimes laughed about, even by giants like Warren Buffet. He famously said something like, “Put all your eggs in one basket *and watch the basket*.” He’s not wrong, but most people don’t know what to look for regarding dangers to this basket. There could be a wolf about to eat all the eggs and we wouldn’t know it. *We wouldn’t even know what a wolf looks like!* My point is unless you’re an expert at knowing market conditions, economic conditions, and are great at reading 10-Ks and 10-Qs like a wizard, you probably can’t watch the basket very well.

Personally, I admit I don’t know shit about companies. I invest in meme stocks that have high options premium. That’s my investment strategy. My egg basket is, well, I don’t know what it is, but it sure isn’t something that has any business holding eggs. The eggs could be eaten, spoiled (there's probably an option expiration joke here), or be stolen at any moment and that’s why I have multiple baskets. One or two of the baskets can get stolen/eaten, and I still have eight more. I can and will be wrong, and at most it’ll wipe out 10% of my holdings. I, and you, can happily easily take a 10% hit to the investment account and be able to function.

This play more into my next tip: be stoic. By diversifying you can remove extreme emotion from your investing/trading.

## Be Calm. Be Chill. Be Stoic. It’s just money after all!

You are your main enemy to stock market success. It’s not market makers, shorts, or other traders; they only use you against yourself. Why? Because you’re a person. You have emotions. You’re stupid and irrational and emotional. Money is on the line; you know the thing we all trade for shelter, food, good, and everything? Money is fundamentally tied to emotion, so when your money starts to get messed with you get stupid. Think of all the silly shit you’ve done and said on an emotional high or low. You may have drunkenly told someone you loved them, kicked someone’s ass, bought something stupid, and apply this to your investment account. How are you going to treat hundreds or thousands of investment money if you’re emotional? When a stock you own (please be diversified!) drops 60% and your money disappears what do you do? You have a choice and emotion will only make the choice harder to make.

I don’t really have a tip here because it’s something you learn to deal with. There is no magical key to not being emotional when money is involved (besides shutting your phone off and going for a walk), but just know that it is immensely important, more than any other thing, to keep emotion in check in regards to investing. I do have a few tips on things to be aware of though. Luckily they have names so by labeling them you can recognize what’s happening and combat it.

## FOMO

Fear of Missing Out. You watch a stock you were kinda thinking about buying jump 300% in a few days. People at work are talking about their hot stock that's printing them tendies. You start to think that maybe you missed the boat -- you dragged your feet and are sitting out riding the rocket to the moon -- or did you? Maybe it’ll go up another 300% *if you get in ASAP!* Yeah, that’s a great idea. You’re not even greedy, you just want it to go up a little bit so you can feel like you were part of the moon mission, and that’s not hard to do, right? Surely if it went up so quickly, it’ll keep going up at least until you sell.

Wrong. This is a terrible idea. Hype is dangerous. FOMO is why people I work with are chucking money into \[redacted\] at $50,000 after it went up 1,000% in a year. This is why people are *still* bagholding GameStop at $450 per share. This is why a large portion of bagholders exist in the first place; their still holding onto their $18 AMCs they bought a few months ago no wanting to take the loss.

If you find yourself experiencing HARD FOMO and *just can’t resist*, buy yourself a small portion. Don’t go crazy. Don’t “invest” anything more than you’re willing to lose. Using \[redacted\] again, if you invested $1,000 at $50,000 and \[redacted\] went down to $5,000, would you be fine with it? You turned $1,000 into $100 and how would you feel? There is a low enough point where it’s stomachable, so invest that. I’m not buying \[redacted\] but if I did I’d be okay with a $500 ""investment."" If I lose it, it’s fine, and I won’t lose sleep over it. FOMO is dangerous so be aware of it.

## FUD/Dooming

The opposite of FOMO: Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt. This can be caused by your family questioning what the hell you bought, news stories, internet shitposts, etc. and make you scared to hold your stock/option because you're worried the price will crash. These pale in comparison to witnessing a beloved stock you owe totally collapse in price. You watch your thousands of dollars of gain disappear in a few days (or maybe hours) and what do you do? You panic sell. You're $10,000 profit is down to $7,000, $6,000 and $5,000 and *OMG how much worse can it get! I could lose all my profit!* You panic sell and realize a $2,000 gain, but oh how you kick yourself in the ass for not getting out at the top. You were greedy, you feel like shit. You're the worst trader ever.

Then the next day the stock goes up and you get a side of FOMO to go with your main-course FUD. *If only you held...but maybe it's not too late to jump back in?*

As before, no real tips on this one. It's also hard to give tips for when something emotional is happening. It's easy to say ""*don't panic sell!*"" but when you're on the verge of panic selling its hard to detach yourself from the numbers on your screen and actually not panic sell. Only with hindsight do you realize how much of a paper-handed bitch you were.

Like with FOMO, a good recipe for mitigating FUD is to give into your emotions just a little bit so you feel like you're doing something. If you want to sell as a stock is crashing, sell half. Sell a third. You don't need to sell it all and regret it later. And if you have truly massive balls, you can always *buy more shares on the way down!*

## No Regrets! No ""what ifs""!

There's few things worse than seeing an ""investment"" work out better than you expected but to not sell at the top. You're always haunted by the ""what if I just did this…"" A stock triples, you don't sell, and then it's back to where you bought it at. You could've raked in *so much money* but you held too long and raked in absolutely nothing.

Then there's the opposite problem: selling too early. You got greedy/scared and took a 10% gain when you could've had a 1000% gain. This was me with *GameStop* in January. I had 400 shares total and sold them around $30-40. Sure I made $5,000 but I could've had $150,000 if I held on for another week or so! Try not to kick yourself in the ass for missing like that and tell me how well it goes. It's hard.

At least I didn't FOMO back in. I realized my mistake -- I sold too early -- and am trying my best to not let it haunt me. Everything is clear with hindsight and what I did made sense at the time. Trading is stupidly hard and no one perfectly buys at the bottom or sells at the top and as long as you come out ahead, who cares? I'm not the guy holding bags at $450 a share, and at least I was in the play and made some significant cash. As always, easier said than done, but try not to be too hard on yourself for not being perfect.

My tip here is to take profits as you wish. You can probably tell that I'm a big fan of taking half-measures -- selling half, buying half -- because you're doing something and doing something feels good. If a stock goes up 20% and you want to sell, sell half. Realize some profits and let the rest ride. If it goes up even more, sell half of those, and so on. This isn't a rule, just an idea. You feel good taking profits but leaving some on the table does wonders for the ""what if"" thoughts that might haunt you.

The same is true for buying. Buy half of what you want and see how it plays out. If the stock goes down, buy more. This keeps you safe from tossing in a ton of money at a high price, but makes you feel good for getting some cash in the game.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You guys realize options won't raise the stock price, right?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How rich are you to throw away 30K like this? Incredible.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wouldnt have been as good a post though. Thank this man for adding blood to the sub
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,There was a time not long ago where someone mentioning buying shares would be laughed out this sub. My have times changed when the GMEtards attacked
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It was within my personal risk tolerance
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,“I’m here for a good time not a long time”
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol Jesus
“Hey Google, what is option chain”"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,value is 1k now original cost about 30k for 30 contracts
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s their value at the time he posted. He lost 29k
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,0DTE means zero days till expiration. He bought calls today at market open betting $30k these would moon due to GME high volatility. I don’t know think this $30k loss is going to hurt him so don’t worry.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the absolute state of the sub. 

GME has basically brought redditors that don’t even have 401k to “invest”"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Giving handjobs under a bridge is within his risk tolerance
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"All good, will aim to be as yolo as you"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh, I got it.
I thought the option cost was 0.01 originally"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s like people on this sub never heard of options before, then saw DFV’s options ply and thought “oh, that looks easy enough, let’s click some buttons see what happens”"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I saw that, my joke was like, buy more gme and we will be there as you make the money back. But I’m not good at internetting so who tf knows what I was actually talking about."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Usually autisic people are super smart. Not this dude but a lot of them
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,A tweet of a guy taking a shit was all I needed to see
2021-03-12 22:17:02,wallstreetbets,46 more gme at 270 total of 50 let’s moon my fellow apes! 
2021-03-12 22:13:00,wallstreetbets,Could you guess the day I found out about options?🤧 
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ayyy i see a little comeback there at the end, i think this is your time to shine"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s seeing stuff like this that makes me continue to be lazy and not jump into options
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Options are the fastest way to lose money, just ask Melvin lol"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Taking notes on how to avoid this post in my own future. So far:

\#1 Don't option; cause, like, what's an option.

Current Holding 7 shares I argued with myself about lowering to a \~182 entry (prior to the dip \~44). I should have bought that dip...

I am still working on entry points over here."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like you found out about this on the 16th day of the 10th month of the year 2020. Assuming this is also the day you found out about your wife’s bf and having that epiphany of why her puss always taste like goat cheese yoghurt
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Just buy the opposite next time
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How is this even possible? Did you accidentally exercise a contract or something?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Let me give you a tip: STOP BUYING SHORT DATED CONTRACTS. Buy LEAPS. Buy shit with 6-12 months. IV will be your friend and retain value even if the trade is going against yoh
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Longer experation dates. Bet you are only buying 1 week out
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Sir thats a picture of Oklahoma.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Put, not call. Sell, not exercise. 

Ape, not rocket science."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thats why I only let myself sell covered calls, haha."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it just the shitty picture quality or did you actually go back in time and lose money at the start of your options trading?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like a classic ‚DOMP ET‘ scenario to me
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I would say hold it upside down to make yourself feel better but I’m afraid it would not with this one.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I see a long line of red long before the big dip even happened.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How tf you lose money in November. Everything was literally running hard at one point
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahahahahaha
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you posted the picture upside down, or your contrast is set wrong....."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sell it as art, it’s a beautiful skyline"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Called the Florida pattern just keep at it
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Mf’s financials looking like the state of Oklahoma.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ouch. This makes me feel very good about my 1st options today today tho. Little over a hundred in unrealized gain hoping for much more next week before the expiration on the 19th
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Glad I’m not the only one. Except mines 4 times as bad
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Sad part is even upside down it looks terrible.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Looks a lot like Oklahoma, which in itself is another level of loss."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This actually looks like blood running down a wall. Bloody hell.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You must be retarded
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"My guess would be ""tomorrow"""
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What are you doing step-bro?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"OP: Look at me making catastrophic loses on options. 
First commenter: Cool! How do you do that? 
Rest of thread: we will show you the way!

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is Oklahoma here? I don't get it.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That's some big guh energy
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you give private lessons? Looks like you won
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What are you doing?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh no baby...what is u doing?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm in the UK and struggled to find anywhere i could even do it. I would only ever do calls due to the risk but have to say I'm glad we only do cfds as I'm definitely retarded enough to think otherwise after a few drinks or a few hours of browsing this beautiful fucking sub.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I made 3,000% on my GME options last week, 600% this week. My PLTR options expired worthless today. It’s big wins and big losses (percentage wise) in this game."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I absolutely do not understand the people who understand that you can lose big on options, but don't have the sense to carefully research how to use options before buying them."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"call=put put=call....if I assume I am wrong, I'm right🤷‍♂️"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It doesn’t want to be Oklahoma, we’ll take it in S Dakota.... hard accent"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,If he tries 49 more times he'll have the complete set.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This just sounds like selective post viewing. View the ones with 100x gains only and your mind will be changed!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"He definitely didn’t. When you buy stock they can go up or down, but they very rarely go to zero.  options however, go to zero all the time if they expedite out of the money, and then their buyer loses 100% of his investment. The buyer may also lose money if the expire in the money, but at least then he doesn’t lose 100%. 

In OP’s case it appears he bought a series of short term options (bad move) and kept on buying at higher and higher IV as GME volatility increased (= higher and higher premiums) and then found out that he’s buying a time-limited ticket that goes to 0 at expiry."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the stupidest advice I’ve heard on this sub, and that’s saying something."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,He got the color right.  Bonus points.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How are you on this sub and not know what an option is?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You bought an option over 200% OTM, on the day it expires?

You belong here brother."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What did you learn?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol.  Fidelity wouldn't let me be that dumb.  I was very upset.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That's what I did my first time. A single $37 contract just to try it out.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Youre helping people out which is good. But if you've literally just done your first option trade careful of handing out advice
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Saxo has options in the U.K. but commissions on trades  add up if you’re making smaller trades. Tastyworks has options too which is what I currently use
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Worth reminding you that 76% of CFD account users lose money
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,TradeZero I think allows that.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So expire, meaning you just lost the premium and no more on the call?

Sorry I bought my 1st few cheap calls today trying to learn."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm retarded though.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not both 🤷‍♂️
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,BUY MOAR SPREADZZ
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Just start with straddling positions.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Worse than that, that amount could’ve went into stock but instead it wasted precious ammo. Momentum go 📉"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats 42*100 tho. 1 contract = 100 shares
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It's easy to create loss porn
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Was that $37 total? So like a bid of .37 cents per share? Or was that a bid of $37 where it cost you $3700 total?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Doesn't like more than 90% of all day traders lose money?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I know haha. That's why I've only put in a little bit. Don't plan on using that too much compared to my invest account
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"How have they managed that? Just had another look and it says the following after a quick Google search

""Binary options banned in the UK

On 2 April 2019, we banned firms from selling binary options in the UK. This followed the European Securities and Markets Authority's (ESMA) temporary ban on the sale of binary options to retail consumers across the EU, including the UK, on 2 July 2018.14"""
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct, you can only lose the premium when buying calls. If you write naked calls, you can lose more."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you really wanna know? Lol!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I want to but then i get hit with a fucking straight line and lose double
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,My company is having massive issues hiring in Colorado and Oklahoma because we can't find anyone not on drugs. Workmans comp insurance requires drug free. I hope this changes soon. Shit that might make MSOS start heading back up if demand increases.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Who’s buying it?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"what happened is that volatility went up, meaning the amount of price range increased substantially. If if your price went from +/- $5 at $300, you expect price to move between $295-$305. If suddenly the volatility went up so much that the price is moving +/- $100, then your price is expected to move between $200-$400. When price moves more, people that are farther away from the strike price has a higher chance of turning their losing trades into winning trades, therefore the previously worthless option is now worth a little more- or in your case $18 more"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The former, .37 per share, and $37 for the whole contract of 100 shares."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably, but the FCA has mandated that CFD providers have to put a warning in now telling people that 76% lose money . Bit like those 'smoking jills' messages on cigs I suppose"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Company is registered in the Bahamas and give access to US market only. You need to request Options trading but unsure what the approval is based on as I didn't do it, they ask for financial info and experience bla bla. 

Good broker with almost instant 24/7 chat support or phone (which I didn't try). Pro desktop platform is $60/m including LV2 data."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Okay cool. Im definitely willing to lose my premium for the upside. Thanks
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What are naked calls?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gotta play both sides, that way you never lose"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,having lived in oklahoma... i can vouch for the fact that anyone that comes back as not on drugs... just hasn't been caught being on drugs yet...   there was at least one random house in the country burning once a month because a meth lab went sideways and exploded.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same thing in Illinois. Spent the better part of a decade building a resume in the cannabis industry in Colorado and California, and came back to the Midwest where my family is when the laws changed. Got out here and realized I could make a much better living doing electrical work because the average age of electricians out here is 56 and most of the guys younger than that are strung out or doped up."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You have to look at open interest. A lot of companies have very little options volume and it could be hard to unload certain strike prices. GME will not be an issue though.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Propaganda. Have been smoking for 20 years, and have not turned into a Jill yet."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks! Hope I stay away but I know how stupid I am haha

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Good luck!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,When you get it wrong you're left naked on the street
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well a covered call is when I own 100 shares, and then I write a call contract that gives someone the right to buy those shares from me at a set price. A naked call is where I don’t own those 100 shares, so if the contract gets exercised I have to buy the 100 shares on the market and then sell them to the call contract owner for the exercise price."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Just like it sounds.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Literally can’t go tits up
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I could’ve **sworn** someone here tried this once....
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep. Out here around St Louis you either got people on opiates unable to work a cash register or picking at their face. Meth is a much bigger problem in the area than when I was younger, prescription opiates are as bad as they ever were, and now there's fentanyl in the mix causing ODs. Feds are in the area busting labs and stuff. Truly crazy"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I've read the definition of it before but it didn't really click.  This did.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Not how it works :/
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Makes sense to me
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It can also be a problem for GME, the volume on some options is low and you can’t get the price it’s “worth”"

Oops, I mean ooga booga green crayon tasty"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is unironically true. But not because of GME. When I came here first some years ago I learned a lot by serious posts and comments. The guys here are actually addicted to trading so they know like every shit :D

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It's almost like smart people who are driven are better than educated people that are driven. Is there some method or resource that they have to educate themselves?  If so it should be posted on the internet for everyone to use...

Some technically inclined should develop a website that lets reddit/wsb users post, share, rate, and comment on DD. Inclusion of quick and easy charts would be cool, maybe a meme generator built in. Video embedding, hyperlinking. 

I feel like it should go far and be profitable via ads, premium service, selling aggregate DD data to firms or some shit. Idk.

I'm motivated or skilled enough to even begin making the website happen."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"When I was in IT, I was working at an investment firm. My take on this subject is that you might have one analyst tasked with scoping out 10-20 stocks. Whereas, the homegamer is likely researching only 1 or 2 stocks. If both the ""professional"" and ""amateur"" analyst have the same knowledge and understanding, the one with less stocks to look at has more time to really find out what's going on."

As long as even 5% knows what the hell they're doing, and as long as 20% realizes that the 5% is onto something, they can leverage the cumulative buying power of the rest of the group by starting something.

We have seen this many times during the subprime crises as well the first people to become helpless were the banks, hf's, insurance, reinsurance and other financial institutes. I go by this, when everything is good no one cares how you make money. I lost trust in the financial analysts and gurus during sometime around that time. Better diversify the portfolio.and do your own research before investing your hard earned money."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are so many autists obsessed with numbers and chart pictures here.  Most of the hedge funds are middle of their class business school students, and graduate business schools are easy and accept virtually everyone to begin with."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The test of a good hedge-fund is whether they continue consistently making profits in a bear market.

Most won't."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"TL/DR;

Stonks goes up"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I believe that only applies to mutual fund managers. Hedge funds regularly return over the market average, because they employ extreme strategies. High frequency trading. Naked shorting. Convoluted option positions and the ability to participate in 24/7 trading within dark pools. As well as flat out illegal activities like market manipulation through, lying and colluding."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because the real truth is that stocks are about as much of a deal life example of a perfect market (the econ term definition) as could possibly exist. All stocks expected return is pretty much whatever the S&P does. If it was ever expected to do better or worse the price would adjust. 

That’s why the key is to just minimize funds and invest long term in a diversified way (leaning on index funds heavily). Doing short term stuff for 🚀🚀🚀 is and should be treated like gambling. It’s fun and we all love to do it tho.

That’s just this retards opinion tho"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"But did they? You know Melvin isn’t the only hedge fund and they are investing alongside you guys. A lot of hedge funds reported solid Q1 returns.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"They're the chip leader at a poker table. They try to use their giant stack of money to bluff or bully their way into winning a pot by forcing their competition to risk most or all of their money. Many times people aren't willing to take that risk, so they bow out with 'acceptable' losses and hope for better luck. But then there are apes."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,They've also got sophisticated market instruments and data that isn't available to us.

They can pour money into research, dateline images, consumer reviews, whatever but at the end of the day the cheapest and easiest thing for them to do is simply go with the flow of all the other firms and work together. Their goal is to simply collect fees from clients and exist, not to actually outperform the other firms, but they are happy to profit off the retail investors who aren't allowed to the table of market manipulation."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Why do I have to scroll so far for the **BEST** comment.... hm
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,No. They are smart af at what they do. This is a fundamental shift of democratization of capital that they are not yet adept at. Watch how quickly that will adapt
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s funny because hedge funds and other investment firms all seem smart because they all get together and share the same 3 ideas. Then when they all pile into those identical strategies the guys who got there first look like geniuses. Then Jim Cramer  tell his crowd, retail market piles in and even the slow poke hedge funds get a slice of the pie. It’s all a circle jerk."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lost.  As if they're done losing...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The average HF has pretty shit returns compared to any reasonable measure.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"the reality is that virtually no one is ""that smart,"" and of the ones who are, most are lazy."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,And the people who call out on the bullshit already short those HF. One HF lose billions means other HF are profiting.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think they're just gamblers that have been playing poker against bots set to 'fold'. Enter WSB, a weird looking kid who keeps laughing hysterically, sits down at the poker game and asks for a glass of milk. 

Two hands in, Hedgie feels nobody has anything and he's on the button, so he raises with jack high. The kid instantly calls and takes a sip from his milk. A rainbow of crayon starts colouring the white drink. The turn comes a deuce. ""I LIKE THIS CARD!"" the kid says almost in a panic. He checks. ""MY WIFE'S BOYFRIEND HAS THIS CARD"". 

Confused but convinced he can drain this kids bank account as he drains all the bank accounts, Hedgie raises again and is met with yet another instant call. The river adds nothing. The kid can't have anything more than maybe queen high. Surely he's not calling a final all-in with queen high? Can't be. His check is answered by Hedgie shoving everything he's got into the middle of the table. 

""All-in, kid."" In the back of Hedgie's mind Clint Eastwood smiles and winks at him. A big breasted woman dressed in a green little outfit, topped off with what looks like a feathered hat walks up to him and works her hand towards his crotch. ""Can I get you anything, daddy?"", she asks Hedgie in a Bulgarian accent.

The kid instantly calls and shows his queen high. Another strange, almost primal laugh escapes him. He asks for a banana. Hedgie doesn't know what just happened. Doesn't understand. But he's been in this game long enough to know one thing for certain. If you lose a hand, just play it again in the exact same way. He turns to the short skirt lady on his right. ""Another 5 billion please, Creamey."" 

As the dealer collects the cards, he notices the kid hasn't returned his hand. ""Your cards, please, kid"", he says. The kid shakes his head, mouth filled with what almost has to be a big bite of an unpealed banana. ""IM HOLDING THIS"", he says. ""I LIKE THESE."" He puts a rocketship on the table. 

Before the dealer can say anything, Hedgie turns to the dealer. ""That's alright, Jim. He can keep that hand, it's fine."" He smiles. Damn he's cool. And my god, is this kid stupid. This is going to be the easiest money he's ever made.."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This ape speaks truth to power.  Without the collusion, cheating of the markets, algo bullshit, and insider trading - these mofo hedgies wouldn’t make the money they make.  They’re even more useless and retarded than our apes, but we are lucky enough have dedicated weaponized autists that just want to make tendies rain on everyone."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,they win because they cheat. easy.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"BTW these are the same folks that use to be constant assholes to us at school for the most part.

Some of these folks are from the popular kids crowd at school that caused sooooo much shame and depression for the rest of us.   Glad to show them that in the end we are the ones with the more wrinkled brains that should have a better life.

Popular folks I have always found would be better suited being workers at starbucks or restaurants.  They can chat folks up and be all bubbly while we make the world a better place!"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hedge fund is a pretty broad term, almost more of a structure. There are many different types of hedge fund strategies and some are certainly focused on providing uncorrelated return streams to equity markets, which reduces risk during downturn.

They can make options bets or just buy 59k shares of a stock and then have the cash on hand to push the prices where they want when they want. Once you start looking at share prices vs open interest on option chains - especially in the last few hours of trading on a Friday...  it becomes super obvious that whales drive the markets.  They can sell tons of naked calls and then make damn sure those calls expire worthless.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hot feces aflame smack dab in the middle of a sidewalk in Houston generally only means one thing - crude oil futures are about to crater. I'll bet nobody in CNBC even knows that.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Loved that one! Sockeye salmon charts ftw!

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol. You can go fondle stocks while I'm chilling on a new waverunner not giving a shit about stock anymore.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yo, 70% SPY 30% YOLO on your gut feelings based on a rando person on Reddit’s DD is the way to go"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Put a different way 10% on $1000, not a lot.  10% on $1m, very nice!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea, proper long term investing means using luck and risk to your advantage and rebuying if it fails. I mean I'm up like 100% this month, that saves me like 4 years of SPY gains right off the bat, I'm on pace to beat it by like 10x over next 10 years."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right? I have $1000 in TD ameritrade. You think I put that $300 in there because I wanted an 8% gain on the year? Hell no! $24 measly dollars? I could go play poker and make more than that. 

It’s fun and interesting to play with a small amount of money. Worst case I lose $300, best case I turn $300 into $1000 like I have right now! Then that let’s me make MORE bets. But sifting through the bullshit is important."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh boy.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,yeah i yolo'd 20k into gme and captured it at 70k during the first squeeze. At 24yo I then used that to more comfortably max my roth ira 2020 contribution and now can do it for 2021 and beyond. Also allowed me to put a couple grand in some companies I actually believe in.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe the technical term is ‘asymmetrical investing’
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"How could an index fund like SPY be a bubble?  Would that mean the entire SP500 is a bubble?  I wouldn't expect the price of SPY to move much away from SPY.NV.  If it did, it would be corrected fairly quickly no?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Adam: “That’s the fun in it.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Unless you’re poor
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Where have I heard that phrase from?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or in this case, blow all your money and owe the banks billions. It’s now the government’s problem."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,YES
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Not a single HF has been bailed out by the government. I'm sorry but 90% of this sub is now people that have absolutely no idea how the financial system works and parroting nonsensical narratives that they've barely read or understood but it fits their predetermined ideas of how the world is supposed to be.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,As far as I can tell everyone here just really likes the stock.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The only advantage that HF has is during a downturn. That is their purpose. They don't mind going up 10% instead of 15%, as long as when it is -20% they are only -10%."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Management Funds usually take fees of 2% of assets and 20% of profit.  On paper, they might show returns of 20-30% per year, but because they're dipping into your profits and not reinvesting that principle, you end up making less.

ETF fees are minimal, and because of the way compound interest works, the difference in the fees are reinvested which ends up making more money over a period of 10 years.  Although Michael Burry is a great investor, I'm sure his funds would run into similar problems, even if he consistently shows returns of 30%+.

It's not that management funds are worse investors, most of the time they're better, it's that they are scraping too much off the top and showing you obfuscated performance sheets.  Those funds are almost always closed off though and don't accept new clients.  It's very difficult to get in them."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, VOO and VTI are where the majority of my new money has gone. Up 20% in the last year even including the high before the COVID crash. 50% (60% including dividends) starting after that. Really not bad to not have to predict strong sectors or strategies."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm in a similar position. 36 and never exposed to financial education other than ""try to keep a rainy day fund."" 

It's a bizarre world where it took dumb memes on Reddit to get me to start paying attention to something that is very literally changing my life."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You get fucked by the dealer's association if you flip too many cars in a given year. I think it's six?

Elon musk is not unique, there are likely hundreds, if not thousands like him living in rural Africa who will never get the same opportunities."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You want a perfect example of the nepostism, mediocrity, and just plain suck at life but my daddy was rich? 45th president of the United States. Fits your point pretty damn well."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Keeping the spin in mind.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Well I hope it gets to 4. If not congrats anyway!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly so many retards here who think finance is just watching lines go up and down
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,JFC I know what the Chicago School of economics is!!! WTF dude
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Again, pedestals."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I've been playing with stocks for over twenty years. Just buy and hold. I just got into options. You can make it as easy or as complex as you want. That's my point. It ain't fucking rocket surgery prick.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,50 mil.. who do you think you are?  DFV?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The true function of the stock market and capital ownership in general is to give production a direction. It's a form of governance really. When hedge funds control the whole thing that can lead to very undemocratic results.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm already concerned with the Robinhood GME debacle.  They're focused on the wrong things.  Just like the PDT rule they'll probably just hurt the small guy.  They need to focus I the collusion to allow only selling and no buying that Robinhood put into effect.  Make sure it's truly a free market with no ability to tank a stock like that if it's not going your way.(hedgies)
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,THIS IS THE DAY WE FEAST ON OUR ENEMIES BLOOD OR WE DINE IN ODIN'S HALL IN VALHALLA!

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You have to sift through new. They rarely make it to the top list. A lot of the dd is also bad or people trying to hype up the options they are selling so you still need to evaluate stuff yourself. Its gotten a lot more time consuming lately with all the gme meme posts, though. Haven’t caught much useful info in a little while myself."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Get Apollo and set filters
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You can filter for dd
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean you say this like buying gme 3 weeks ago would have been a bad decision. Nothing even comes in the ball park of those kinds of returns right now.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah it’s definitely been that way ever since this GME drama hit the mainstream. But hopefully the real DD gems will return
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Obviously he just had bad timing, it takes skill to lose money on something as tendiful as gourd futures!"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How deep can the tip go?!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,A lot of people are going to tell you wild is better but hatchery is superior. Wild salmon typically has a lot of parasites so you have to cook the salmon in order to eat it. I go farm raised 99% of the time because you can eat it raw with no consequences giving it a lot more versatility in the kitchen.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Almost as if you're supposed to use investments in those *funds* as a *hedge* against a bear market...

Somebody should really rename them to better reflect that purpose. Something like ""hedge fund"" would probably work."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wonder how all the people who argue for free market capitalism and claim investment is more valuable to the economy than labor will feel, when the labor market dries up because everyone figured out labor was a suckers bet under the current system and playing video games with money has higher returns. 

I wonder how they'll justify trying to force the proletariat back to work for them to ensure the economy still functions and everyone isn't sitting at home fiddling with numbers on a screen, while still pretending what they do is more valuable than the actual work done by the laborer.

I hope one day the labor you were going to put into those vehicles is rewarded well enough to incentivize you to do it, instead of sitting here doing practically nothing. Until then, this is what the market tells you is most beneficial, by providing you incentive to do it, so GET YOUR FUCKIN' TENDIES HOMIE!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It really is. And ppl still ain't REALLY aware. Anybody I *mention* stocks to replies immediately w 'I dont understand that stuff' and it stops there. No inquiry, no interest bc 'cant dumb'"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Born into it really. My dad had a pretty successful Harley shop for most of my childhood and teenage years. I was painting bicycle frames and sandblasting before I could drive. Sadly he descended into meth and its ruining his mind and judgment. He now lives in the motorcycle shop, not working on anything in particular, just smokes meth and counts his inventory while other meth heads steal him blind."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, but this did more for me than just a small share in meme stock. I had 50$ when gme inspired me. I opened a STASH account and now have a portfolio worth 100$  Gme is 49% tho. I've been reading about options all this week. If you would have asked me what my portfolio looked like at the beginning of the year? *my wut?* I spread 10$ across coins as well. Financial freedom now feels attainable, and it's so fking relieving"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,🦍🍌
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I only made it to (and subsequently flamed out of) a moderately good state school but I was in fairly prestigious southern prep schools before that, and among my cohort--who were all similarly privileged--the Ivy Leaguers were by-and-large good, conscientious students. The only one I could say I was a better student than was one athlete.

Sure, daddy had a seven figure net worth, but the same was true of the morons who ended up at Alabama and Ole Miss (no offense to anyone who attended those schools).

I've observed the same phenomenon among the students I knew at the Philip Exeters and Grotons of the world with the caveat that their floor was slightly higher."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Painting with a broad brush is wrong some of the time, but stereotypes exist for a reason. I've known some extremely wealthy people who were legitimately good people, but almost anyone who is born into money is an entitled shithead. It makes sense and it isn't really their fault, but I guess you become so disillusioned to the concept of struggle that it's easier to write those people off as failures than it is to feel sympathy for the fact that they're in whatever miserable position they're in (you know, like throwing most of your life away at a job you hate just to survive).

I know that rich people can me miserable too because we all adjust our standards based on our environment and experience, but real talk I fucking hate rich families and yes I'm jealous"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hell 43 too.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe, maybe not. I make six figures writing code. I've made literally 10x gains in my personally managed accounts as a hobby investor in the past year. I'm not that impressed by the hedge fund managers who are proud to almost match the SP500 year after year lol.

The people writing the algos and doing the quant, yes, they are way smarter than I, no doubt."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I always hated using the word ""boomer"", but now that I've seen one call themselves boomer, I don't feel so bad. Lol. In all seriousness though it's nice to see people of all ages on here getting along. I'm 39 and most younger people probably think I'm a boomer actually."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"what does that even mean? 

Also it's easier to understand stocks than to learn how to code programs or rotate inventory? Sure, just ignore the fact that at a professional level, which is the level that as you say \~pays better\~, this is definitely not the case. On buy side, you are essentially either a data scientist working with random forest classifiers, binomial tree models and other stochastic processes or a financial whiz modeling out LBOs and asinine debt structures. On the sell side, you have to be really talented at sucking dick and thats harder than you think. 

And no, I don't work in finance. I have a comp sci major and I work in tech."

They think they struggled and earned their place but have no idea how much easier it is to navigate your 20s and take some risks career wise when you don’t have a $40k weight dragging you down. It’s truly wild to me how much someone’s reality can be skewed. They don’t appreciate or understand the grind but how can they? Like you said it isn’t their fault since they haven’t had the life experience of living on $40 a week like I had to. Still frustrating as hell to try to reconcile with.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"What the hell is this conversation turning into, I know we like to call ourselves retard but do you understand the different levels of finance? 

It can get majorly majorly complex and is not some easy subject at all which is what I'm seeing being said on this thread. 

I'd love for you to take a complex derivatives class. Do some research on google if it so easy and teach me how to calculate 'fair' option prices based on IV, dividend rate and risk free short rate. (btw these are the basic topics as well so won't be much of a challenge for you huh?)

There is a reason why you compete against the best of the best to get into investment banks or hedge funds, you need to be insanely smart about a complex subject. However I agree with you the industry is just run by connections, who you're parents are and what school you went to.

Also buddy I've been learning to code in my spare time and it is not hard at all compared to finance, shits fairly simple once you understand the main concepts. It's all about practical experience of that knowledge to solidify it."

So I began doing a little extra DD and I just discovered some BIG BRAIN here op... CVS is basically a **real estate company**, who *just so happens* to sell drugs. Peep game

[https://cvspharmacyrealty.com/surplus-properties/](https://cvspharmacyrealty.com/surplus-properties/)

[They want their freestanding locations on at least 1.5-2 acers of land](https://cvspharmacyrealty.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20-CVM-0160_Real_Estate_contact_Brochure_12021.pdf) as *"" most CVS stores are between 10,000 square feet and 16,000 square feet but can be as small as 9,000 square feet and as large as 30,000 square feet. "" (With room to park 60 cars minimum)*

[Detailed Description of Location Types:](https://www.fool.com/millionacres/real-estate-basics/real-estate-terms/what-fee-simple-ownership/) 

* **Zero cash flow ownership:** Here, all the rent payments go to the lender. The landlord would have zero cash flow during the lease term. This is typically for investors who wish to do a 1031 exchange, but their property is a high-debt one. The replacement property must also match the high-debt status.
* **Fee simple ownership structures:** Here, the owner has absolute ownership to use the property as they choose.
* **Infill** **ground lease structures:** This is a lease of the land only. This type of ownership separates building ownership from land ownership.
* **Leasehold ownership** **structures:** Here, the CVS property has a ground owner, and what's for sale is a leasehold position in the store, giving this investor the right to use the property for a predetermined length of time.

In total [they have over 9,900 locations in 49 states!](https://cvshealth.com/about-cvs-health/our-company-at-a-glance) 

Their Competition:  

[Walgreens has 9,021](https://news.walgreens.com/fact-sheets/frequently-asked-questions.htm) (Closest)

[Rite Aid has only 2,500](https://www.riteaid.com/about-us/our-story) (Hilarious in comparison)

I don’t have my price target set at where that red line ends (which looks like a it’s near 1k+ from eyeballing it), that’s just the arc of the path I drew.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The tiny script at the bottom is him hinting about box spreads. They literally can't go tits up.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I thrive to receive one of these letters
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,A Fidelity CYA
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes this means you have done very well.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If translated to Ape, it means “STONKS GO BRRRR!”


P.S. Green crayons are my favorite. STONKS!!!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ask your wife's boyfriend.  He'll explain.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How the hell did you lose in a bull market
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I love you sweet prince.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It says you are learning lessons which is good.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,At a certain point they should stop trying to send an individual letter to each of us and just get a post stickied on this sub.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh boy!!! I should probably check my mailbox!!!! I haven't checked it for a week.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"gme. . .  the invincible. . .  to the sky

Loving it. . .  great consolidation towards infinity"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Banana tied to a brick through window would have been better.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Read good. Do bad.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Shit ain’t a loss unless he sells. It’s Schrödinger's cat till he sells it could be a gain. Just 💎🙌 till is money!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I approve
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Good for the guy on the other side of your trades :(
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wonder if the account analysts who have to send multiple letter like this out a day just plugging in depressing numbers find it somewhat funny, find it depressing, or have all there fidelity paycheck in GME and cant read and just know number go here and here and print!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Loss has a new paper form
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Man I wish I had fidelity before. I would’ve gotten a few of these and hung them up on my wall lmao
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,🤦🏻‍♂️
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Why do I have the sinking feeling I am gonna be hearing about these letters right before congress screws us.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure they called you retarded.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got one of those. I'm now above where I was before the losses.

Your goal: make it back and then some, without revenge trading. Don't get emotional about it and don't get frustrated. Accept that it could take some time, but you will win.

... Then you'll probably lose again, but you will win damnit!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Those letters are proven to decrease suicides
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't know, it was too long and not written in crayon. So I did not read it."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,When you opened your account you didn’t choose ‘speculation’ as your investment objective.  That’s why you received this.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Notice how they don't send letters when you win?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,They probably sent out a million of these in the last month lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sincerely,
Michael Dunn Dunn Dunnnnnnnnnnnn"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,good wall decoration. frame it. hang it.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So was that down $64,752.33 out of $2,725,634.46 or $64,752.33 out of $64,752.34?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn, I really hope you lose this great tax deduction opportunity in the next two weeks."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck yeah, it says you are up over $64K!  Nice work Brotha. Ask an expert though before investing, banging other apes or eating glue. But toke the ganja if you have medical needs per a medical expert, which I’m not. Gotta go do blow off my hooker’s ass."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,They always send the negative letter but never the congratulations letter :/
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Joy Cometh in the Morning.  She’ll be coming around the mountain when she come...        we’re coming for you.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Good. They didn't close the account. So you are winning. Keep going. God speed
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s a very outdated method of calling you retarded
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,If you’ve lost $64k I’d take a couple more dollars to frame this.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Elitist Snobs rubbing it in!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s a letter that you need to frame. It basically reads that you are “An Honorable Member of Autist Of WSB”

WHAT AN HONOR!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Have a feeling Fidelity’s gon’ be sending a lot of these out...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,lmao
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thats your medal of honor, frame it on the wall"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn! They basically just asked if you had been hacked or had a your kid playing around on your account.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Monke read, you no get banana"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s just momma bird making sure that you are in fact an ape. If you are ape momma bird no worry.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I absolutely love this letter....it's somehow so formal yet seething....absolutely burning with subtext....it's glorious. Fidelity is awesome
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Its goddamned fantastic
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I think it says your a millionaire!

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,“You were so retarded that we want to make sure it was you.”
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Serious question: what do you do for a living where you can lose this much money and feel good enough to post it on reddit? lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,“Hey retard”
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I didn’t even get a stupid letter :-/
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"And i was crying because i loss 300 

but that was all i have"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just don't let your wife's boyfriend find out.

but let the wife know."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Kinda sounds like you just paperhanded everything and forgot the golden rule...Stocks only go up.  You musta sold everything during that gay bear market last week.  Honestly I don’t wanna make you feel bad but people who have 🧻👐‘s and freak out over some bond 10 year treasury note are the reason the stock market goes down. All fear driven cuz of you just revert to rule 1....they only go up.  It’s okay it’s just a learning experience fellow tard. Gotta get them hands stronger
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,congrats on graduating retard university
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude, you won the publisher's clearing house prize? Sweet."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, do you realise you're a retard? If so, have a nice day"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,good for a chuckle
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Badge of honor.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Do they send a similar letter if your up 60k. Like hey I notice your a savvy investor and we would like to chat with you about your investment objectives?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It says $64k, so I think it's good. Congratulations 👏🎉🥳"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Then how'd you know which parts to black out?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It just says hold
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,HAHAHA!! If you look at the first letter of each line it actually spells out “you retarded ape!”
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,They called you a retard
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s your participation award 🥇
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is a irl achievement, you should hang it on your wall"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Basically it says you're a charitable person. You should be proud. You have helped many people.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So what are they suggesting? Sell at loss? C*nts
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I remember getting this letter when it dropped to 40 looking at it now with fond memories. My resolve was test and I did not break. Onward and upward buddies!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, you funded hedgefunds to become better at stock market prediction. This is good for the economy. Thanks for the community service."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is it fidelity way of saying “don’t buy dumb shit, buy GME stock”?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,CYA Memo.  If we dont hear from you then obviously everything is ok so just ignore this
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Good for Karma
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Frame it. It costs more than my Bachelors degree.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Unlike Robinhood, Fidelity reaches out to tell you ""Hey retard, you're hemorrhaging money but if you already know that, it's your money and we'll assume this was actually your plan all along.""

This was part of the reason that I switched."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah your diploma has come in
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,They think you've retarded but aren't gonna stop you
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy fucks
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It says buy gme
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"No it isn't.

It looks like ""You are the father""."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Verification of true retard status!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It means buy the dip and hang in there . 🚀🚀🚀🚀
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah man, for sure it's good. No one would mail you bad news right? Not sure though I can't read"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You can add the paper to the burn barrel at the homeless camp you'll be living in soon.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Education is crazy expensive in the US
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Fidelity is going to start charging a shitload in order to make up for all the printer ink used on these letters to wsb members
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The letter is nice however pictures to accompany the losses would be better.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, you Gamified investing so I'm suing you.

Gtfo with that.

Lemme just degenerate in peace."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,They aren't calling him retarded.  They're asking him if he realizes that he is in fact retarded.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah!! Fuck them!  Only we get to call op retarded.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,In the nicest way possible
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Fidelity's app UI hasn't been updated since the 1980s.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Knew this guy wasn't smart enough to use email so they made sure he got the message
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Needs more bush.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,They sent me an options risk booklet dated 1992. This year. When I got approved for options a few months ago. Love those old school mfs
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,And he ain't dunn yet!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The amazing thing is Dunn is a verb, meaning mailing people bills for things they don’t actually owe."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Get it framed.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Proud card carrying member!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's called Fiduciary Responsibility (a covery-your-ass legal concept) and Fidelity is a pretty fucking great broker (albeit super old school, they sent me an options risk guide dated 1992 when I was approved for options...in 2021). Now that I think of it, basically the only ones who did NOT restrict buying of GME when all others (IB, WeBull, Robinhood, TDA) did. 

TL;DR: I like Fidelity lol I would not write Fk U to them, they're not the bad guy in this story I think"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait we’re trading with real money? Oh...fuck.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t know about that one, they are actually a solid company. This reads like your parents trying to help you out of a bad situation and less like someone covering their ass. “Is losing money part of your investment strategy?” lol"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"They did retard. They literally said that they just wanted to confirm losing $64,000 was in line with his goals."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity Cares is also the philanthropy arm, though I don’t think they’ll bail people out after hitting zero.  That’s what parking lot behind Wendy’s is for"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,🤷🏻‍♂️
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lost interest?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,After reading this thread I want to take a big hit just to have my own.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I knew fidelity was the right choice after opening my letter ❤️
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,literally going tits up
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree about Robinhood, but if it wasn't for Robinhood - Fidelity, TD Bank, and Webull would have never given $0 trades.  So I never had an acct with RH, but I thank them every time I execute a trade on Fidelity.  Just a couple years back, I would have needed $2500 in an account, and it would have been $4.95 a trade..."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Need to wait for another letter to see positions.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Search this sub for ""fidelity""

Same letter"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Every one of these letters are hilarious imo

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What's the cost basis? Are you down $64k on $1m? Or $64k on $65k?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got a letter mailed to me this week from them approving me for options trading on my new account. It was accompanied by some big book about the risks.

There were no pictures, so I couldn't really figure out what it said inside. I just colored in the symbols"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,They still are in some circles
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,TDA sent me a futures book from 2003. Crazy that 2003 is closer to 1992 than 2021.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,math is math and fidelity isn't selling textbooks here
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thats actually a good book, I hope you held onto it."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just did my first options literally yesterday and it immediately went down +50%, but when going through the videos on Fidelity's website I noticed the dates were all 2013.  Like, they haven't changed the basic design since 2013..."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,And add a picture of Carl Fredericksen for good measure.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,In crayon of course.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do you have an opinion on Oppenheimer? They are fairly old style, with brokers being forced to rectify several different apps including a mainframe terminal from what I vaguely hear from them. But they make ya the money. They weathered 2008 and hit 2009 with a profit. 

I sure wish they’d been this informative to me when I lost $6000 in one year. Legit lost, not just failed to make. They had part of my portfolio invested in some program that was set to expire and the price tank. It was all by plan but I just didn’t return their calls. They never told me I was gonna definitely lose money for no reason if I didn’t sign on the line which is dotted.

I just didn’t return the paperwork. To this day I’m Tony Roma. *six ...thousand ...dollaz*

Oh yeah except my portfolio just now went up 30% since September and climbing."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,he made 11 mil from a 5B position? that's only .2%. the hell was he trading bonds?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That was a shady Indonesia firm. Stole the money from him
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is wild
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, that’s nice to imagine. I wouldnt mind if it were true, but I sincerely doubt fidelity gives a shit."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Well when you put it that way. Seems like I need to speak to my financial advisor immediately.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, of course they won’t bail you out, that’s clear from the letter. It’s just nice of them to politely point out that after losing 60k you should probably reevaluate your life."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe in you! If you have a goal don't let anything stop you!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats on losing money with GME. Stay away from sharp objects.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,They’ve blown through their paper budget in 6 weeks because of all the retards
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Good for the moral
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Just Googled retard but I think I'm slow on the uptake
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"""This guy is fucking retarded...steve, grab the paper."""
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Email is forever. I could just say I never received it. How are they going to prove that I received it.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If they're doing it right, $64K down on $1k."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dumb fucks, 2003 isn’t even in the future, it’s in the past!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That took my brain a second
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Also the brokerage apparently made only 10mil the year. Was he their only customer? Weird story all around.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I have no reason to think that they don’t. Give them the benefit of the doubt
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is exactly why I dont post shit online. Mans is the digital Dick Tracy lmao. Y'all too damn smart.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Where are our stamps?????
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,it's a legal thing. go in front of a judge and they show that they did this according to procedure and the judge will likely accept it
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"No bullshit, my first few months trading options (so... last September) I was down 65k off 8k. I started with 8k. I wasnt in debt mind you, but SOME FUCKING WAY I made 60k but lost 65k overall according to my tax paper.

I never saw more than 20k in my account at once. How the fuck did I make 60k and lose 65k? Lmao."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe that's the option, to go back in time or not? This is all very confusing and I can't read."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,They are just making sure this is within your risk tolerance. Robinhood would just freeze your account and not tell you
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hope I'm stating the obvious here, but they don't give a flying fuck how you do. The only reason they send these letters is to have one extra layer of legal protection -- so if things ever go to court, they can point to these letters and say, ""Welp, sucks to suck. But they can't say we didn't warn them before they lost everything!""   


That's especially important in light of Congress hearings and young adults offing themselves after losing big, leading to their parents seeking lawsuits."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Screenshot new balance and reply back. 

“Sorry, you were saying?”"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,More like it's automated

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"""BWAAAAAAAAAAAA!"""
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Some of the best episodes were very adult-themed. Hank Hill unknowingly becomes a pimp. His fishing habit mimics drug addiction. Peggy is the only person besides Dale that didn't know John Redcorn was banging Nancy. Bobby cooks crank for his science project. Etc
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The problem with that is no John Redcorn gonna be fucking DFV's wife.

That episode is amazing. Her defense lawyer wins their case by letting her testify in her own words in spanish. She thinks she gave some big eloquent speech that freed her, when in reality the judge saw that she barely understood any spanish and realized she wasn't guilty."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I love that she thinks she can speak Spanish Spanish when she can't 😂 If anything Hank is the annoying one IMO
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Luanne became a victim of “dumb blonde” but if you watch the first episode she fixes Hank’s truck and she changes the flat tire in the intro. But then they never mention her automotive skills again.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,When Hank tells her off because he doesn’t believe her (actually correct) claim that Randy Travis stole a song it was pretty cathartic though

I highly recommend reading the Prequels before going ahead with the sequels. Disclaimer, this sequel will not be as good as the origin post!

So, shorts are still winning with the short volume ratio being 30.17 Yesterday(Fintel). Although some of the shorts had to cover to avoid paying the dividends, yesterday they got back at it with the ratio mentioned before. It's really inspiring how relentless they are! In addition, the borrow rate rose to 8.86%(Fintel).

**As of 03/11/2021(Fintel) the Short Volume Ratio is 30%.** To put things into perspective, If there's a short interest of %10, that's considered high. If there's a short interest of %20 or greater, **that's considered extremely high**. 

&#x200B;

[03\/11\/2021\(Fintel\) the Short Volume Ratio](https://preview.redd.it/ej84xpck5nm61.png?width=557&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc67440203d544cba39db6f3db68f0d3200870c3)

The only reason I could come up with as to why this is being shorted so much is due to institutional holders not wanting it reach the 10$+ where a Gamma squeeze could potentially happen on 03/19/2021 Calls. This would results in their premiums for Calls being lost(all opinion). Remember that there is a large institutional stake in $UWMC.(More on this paragraph in part 2)

**(NEWS)** Anyway, if you missed the recent [$UWMC news](https://nationalmortgageprofessional.com/news/76503/larger-broker-shops-already-signed-addendum), United Wholesale Mortgage reported that some large broker shops across the country have signed the UWM all-in addendum representing over 90% of broker shops who will no longer work with Rocket Mortgage and Fairway Independent Mortgage Corporation, exactly one week after the Facebook Live announcement.

The All-In addendum states that after **March 15**, broker-owners continuing to do doing business with UWM means they can no longer do business with both Rocket Mortgage and Fairway Independent Mortgage Corporation.

 ""The support and appreciation we have received over the last week has far exceeded our expectations,"" said Mat Ishbia(CEO).  ""Our partners understand the importance of working with a lender focused on the future growth of not only their business but the entire channel.""

**In summary, I'm very excited for next week. It'll prove to me either the CEO is as good as I expect him to be (He's a big reason why \~48% of my portfolio is in it) and he'll capitalize on the rare opportunity of a Gamma squeeze which could potentially happen on 03/19/2021 Calls (more on that in Part 2), or I would be very disappointed.**

 **I wouldn't buy any $UWMC 03/19 Calls anymore** because they are useless in my opinion towards the stock and have a high **risk of expiring worthless (More on that in Part 2).** On the other hand, **I would only buy shares** and maybe leaps if they are cheap enough.

**(Important Part):** If you like the stock and think it’s undervalued, you can share $UWMC posts or make your own DD to give this stock more exposure. If people believe in it as much as you do, they might buy it and we can hopefully all eat Tendies on the Moon(soon)🚀🌕🍗

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"At the current price in addition to being a short squeeze possibility, it's a straight up value play as well. 

This company makes boat loads of money and hoping to see management throw that around going forward be it through special dividends or what not."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I worked there a few months last year and I was impressed with the company. They have huge aspirations and a lot of the workers loved being there. They talked a lot of shit about Quicken and want to overtake as the top mortgage lender. I ended up quitting because I'm a bit of an autist and don't like being around that many people.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This company has good projected earnings (and a forward P/E under 7), a juicy dividend, and huge squeeze potential... sounds like very low risk with very high reward. Certainly better than getting in GME at these levels.

Another thought: 9 million apes * $1400 stimmy = $12.6B ... almost the entire market cap, and roughly 2x current float. This could go absolutely nuts!

I hope you don’t get drowned out by the GME noise... I’m with you!"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"been in since before the rocket change.  The was a time when Iv was 200 % which lowered the buy in costs with CCs. Yet the stock wasn't moving. Now the stock could explode one way or another and Iv is much lower. 

Still,  I've sold OTM CCs on  3/19 but will buy those out at  0.05 well before expiration ,  just in case the  CEO lands on Cramer or RUT inclusion makes it pop."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's true w deep ITM puts contract buyers can exercise at any time - but remember i got paid premium - 18 contracts = 1,800 shares * $9.50 premium = $17.1K total premium; since it's a CSP @ $17.5 strike i have to set $14.4K of my own capital aside to cover this strike ($17.5*1,800 = $31.5K - $17.1K premium = $14.4 of my own capital); the break-even SP for this set-up is $8.00 ($14,400/1,800 = $8.00) so if say contract buyer(s) were to exercise them right now and assign 1,800 shares to me at $17.5 it would be equivalent of me buying share for $8.00 which would be just fine considering closing price or $8.30 - i would be ITM... basically is a very bullish bet with optimum outcome for me of SP moving upward away from $8.00 ASAP and closer and above strike of $17.50 all well before 16APR so i can buy to close and keep most or all of premium; I also have the ability to buy to close anytime before 16APR if things go my way and I have until 16APR for flexibility; (max loss is $14.4 my portion of capital; that's of course assuming SP goes to 0; max gain $17.1K assuming contracts become worthless or very cheap before 16APR assuming SP reaches $17.5); i always have option, from now to 16APR, to buy back the contracts to exit either at gain or loss

TLDR: break-even SP is $8.00 SP moving rapidly upward and toward $17.5 very advantageous for me; subsequently shares moving below $8.00 i will be loosing either by getting assigned shares or buying back to close at higher prices than the premiums i received)"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,If most are not naked calls then gamma squeezes shouldn’t happen. Also OP said that the sellers of the calls would lose their premium if exercised which is just not true
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"He is wrong about his understanding of options, there is a lot more to gamma squeezes. Market markets are the reason"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,No there is. Hedgies have been righting naked calls on gme because it’s basically free money
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Goes down not up

They are not fully ""naked"" yet if plenty of calls the ITM they need to buy a bunch of shares still. I'm not going to take more time explaining why you're misunderstanding this, just look it up. Naked calls are not the only reason for gamma squeezes"

I mean I understand you want the shares because moon and all, but you’ll get more money if you sell the options (now, when they still have extrinsic value to them) than their value at expiry (assuming same stock price). That will enable you to buy more stocks than what you can assign the writer for, plus remove your risk off the table."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The calls were so deep in the money that there really wasn’t any extrinsic value left

2021-03-12 20:34:20,wallstreetbets,"A health guide for the storm we find ourselves in. Ok guys I get it and I have been there when it comes to making this money with GME. I have been the guy who hits the refresh button all day, who GUH's the dips, of course I have in the past had to use credit because I had spent more of my paycheck  than I should have.  I have seen a lot of people who are getting  obsessive to the point its could be unhealthy. We are one of the most chilled out group of autists  I have ever met. Which is why I made this guide to remind you all of a few things. I based this guide off of posts I have seen and replies to posts I have made. Please note I am not speaking about 1 stock in general, this applies to everything market related. I just use GME because its an easy example. 

1. It's a good thing the market closes on the Weekend. This cannot be the only thing you focus on. As your parents or wife's boyfriend would tell you "" Go outside"". You need to get out and do other things not related to the stock market. Keep your hobbies, play with your kids, go see your parents. You have to get out and do things other than WSB,and watching tickers all day.
2. Eat you Autistic pieces of shit. 3 Meals a day I dont care if its all Wendys, you have to eat 3 meals a day. On a serious note either eat some fruit or take a good multi vitamin. For the sake of not spending all of Melvins money on doctors visits please drink some water too.  

3. DON'T SPEND MONEY YOU DON'T HAVE. If I see one more question about how margin works ,how to get approved for margin or if they should yolo all their money on Margin im going to have a stroke.  If you thought losing more than half your initial investment sucks, Imagine losing all you invested because you now owe your broker their portion. Then of course you might owe some interest on that pending on the broker.

&#x200B;

4. Dont let this get in the way of your day job. I cleared near half my yearly salary on GME round one. I did this all the while working and not neglecting my responsibilities. I dont care if you're a  bagger at the grocery store or the stim man Crazy Joe. Do your shit so you can pay your bills. If you really cannot help it take some PTO on a day that you think you will need to watch it constantly. Just dont get fired.

&#x200B;

5. Your family probably thinks its cool you're in on something big ( GME for example),but they probably get sick of hearing about it. This should not be the only dialog you have with others around you. Keep that shit here, lets circle jerk. Told the wife today Im back in GME for 3k more ( I have been trying to swing trade it for RD 2 just to do something different all the while catching the squeeze). All she said was "" again?"". Now in RD 1 she was asking about it probably as much as I was looking at it . This is not nearly as cool as many of us think it is. Most people dont get whats happening or do not care. This is ok.

6. Know when to get out. I know this is hard for people from my generation but in this game there are winners and losers. Dont be a fuckin loser you fucking loser. When this shit can change your life take some profit. Stay in diamond hand the shit out of it but take care of you. Someone during this squeeze will still buy at the top Guaranteed . He/she will HODL and be stuck at sub 10% loss for sure.  Get in before its too late or just say this is not for me this time. 

7. Now this is kinda misinformation because the market makes no sense right now but.... Once something reaches the news,social media ,or is being talked about. Its usually too late. BUY the rumor sell the news.Someone out there already knew this before the media did, they got in when it was low. Once its common knowledge these people or firms are already selling leaving you bag holding. 

8. Do your DD. No!! not the DD your wife's boyfriend is giving her while you cuck looking at AH tickers on your phone. Research the stock , and decide for yourself. Go to investopedia and educate yourself on the vocabulary. You should know some basics behind stock fundamentals. If Im pushing a stock on here , you do not know me. I could just be trying to give you my bags to hold. 

&#x200B;

9. Exercise please , you need to move about during your day. It will help you mentally and physically .

10.Dont hate on others who dont invest in your stock. We are a support group, a fundamental group and above all else we eat crayons together. I bought GME in January at 40$ per share, got told I was a retard for doing so by my friends. Never said shit to them when it mooned,even though they told me WMT is where the money is. Not everyone is in GME, and those who are genuinely believe the hype. As my wife's boyfriend says to be when I get to be a grumpy gills "" If you dont have anything nice to say dont say anything at all.""

11. To make it simple if you dont know how to buy a Call option don't be buying call options. You need to do a lot more research into the fundamentals. You will lose your ass.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What’re your thoughts on a continued tech sell off though. Obviously this is a great play the only issue I have is if the market gets back into its tech sell off and this thing dips more short term. Would it be better to wait and see if it falls lower or do you expect that it already found its bottom?

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Go all in on GME instead
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,AMD is actually spelt GME.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you had invested 1000 into those Mar 19 100 calls at their inception in August and sold at their peak you wouldve made 19x. So in this case the sell and roll is better, but I feel like most of that could be contributed to the rise in price that happened before this option became available as you were already invested before that date. Interesting to compare the two strategies."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"What exactly is the ""roll""? Does roll 5 sell 5 means sell 10 of them, then reinvest the proceeds from half the sale into more options?

I'm new to options and don't understand this term."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't forget AMD is having talks to buy out Xilinx which will be huge if they do. I got 4 call options for AMD i bought 2 days ago for Sept.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Right there with you. AMD such an attractive price right now. Bought $84 calls expiring April 9th.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"AMD will never moon. Intel will rebound. If their stock was gonna rocket it would have done so with theater release of threadripper. The reason AMD will never launch into orbit is because they are like 90% consumer based, where intel.has a huge share of the corporate market on top of their consumer market."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Its like a breathe of fresh air
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you concerned at all about rising bond yields potentially hurting growth/tech stocks like AMD in the coming months/year? We've had dips over the past two weeks but I feel like the dips will continue for awhile. Tech stocks still seem to be on shaky ground.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What was the premium on those
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"AMD has already mooned.

Some years ago it was trading for like $1.50 a share. Criminally undervalued.

It still has tremendous upside.

Here's the breakdown...

EPYC allows for extreme density in data center spaces and is tremendously efficient. The value of this cannot be overstated.

Space, electricity, and cooling are all at a premium in data centers, and EPYC destroys Xeon on all 3.

Data center hardware purchases are typically on 3-5 year buying patterns. Old hardware gets replaced at regular intervals as it goes EOL. A lot of the new hardware purchases are AMD.

AMD doesn't have the weight of bad fabs around its neck like Intel does.

AMD is fully delivering 7nm while Intel is still fucking around @ 14nm. Intel's 10nm is a total bust, and they're being forced to look externally to get below 14nm reliably.

Intel still has architectural issues because they've spent more than a decade sitting on their ass doing nothing. The architecture is showing its age. They're still at least 3 years out from being able to reveal a fully new architecture.

AMD's Ryzen success allows them to fully compete in the GPU space again as well. They've trading blows with Nvidia for the first time since the Radeon HD 7900 series.

AMD is dominating new purchases in the consumer market making huge gains, and they've made tremendous gains in the data center space as well relative to where they were. Bonus, while they're creeping up big time in new orders, the existing installed base is growing as well which means more confidence in purchasers to buy more EPYC.

2020 saw a massive shift to the cloud across the board in pretty much every industry. That means tons of VMs, which all have to live somewhere. This is where the density, cooling, and electricity costs all payoff huge. If the next gen EPYC processors are even half as good as their current Gen ryzen counterparts, they will shit in Intel's mouth and Intel will thank them for the meal.

In short, AMD has made tremendous gains and still has huge upside potential. Intel has been slow to respond, constantly lying about their ability to compete and upcoming technologies, AMD is one again trading blows with Nvidia, and AMD has not shown any signs of slowing down on any front. AMD's strength (and weakness) is their refusal to sit on their laurels. They constantly try to innovate. When they're good, they revolutionize the industry (Duron, Athlon, Athlon 64, Ryzen, EPYC, ThreadRipper). When they're bad they fall on their face (Bulldozer, Vega).

But they NEVER stop, and they hit more than they miss.

And they survive to fight another day.

AMD is a good bet, even at its current price. Intel can't touch anything they have to offer, and they're slugging it out with Nvidia. There's incredible room to grow even in the consumer space still, but especially in the enterprise space, and there is NO ONE better positioned to break out against Intel's stranglehold there.

But I'm just an idiot in the internet, clearly not qualified to give financial advice, and am an admitted AMD fangirl, and own AMD stock (though not as much as I used to unfortunately)."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't forget that Intel just lost Apple as they are doing their next chips in-house and the fact that the last 2 generations of xbox & playstation consoles have all had AMD chips.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah. AMD falls with the rest of tech with the rise in rates. But money managers do these bulk tech sell offs, its called 'throwing out the baby with the bath water.' This has happened several times in the last 3 years with AMD and had always been good for buying. This time is no different. Once AMD starts taking big data center market share and people realize they have so much growth potential in the data center and that it's way more profitable than their consumer products, it will rocket."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What happend to this sub..
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This doesn't make sense to me. Far OTM options have a low delta which directly correlates to the change in value of the option. If you buy a call ATM and the stock goes up your call is now farther ITM and will continue to make more and more money as the stock price increases due to Gamma increasing the Delta even more. Why would I want to roll up and out instead of just keeping the call and letting the stock increase in price more (assuming I'm still bullish)? The farther OTM call I roll up to will have a lower delta and will have its work cut out for it to make money. What am I missing?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,My only question is how to determine how far OTM to look? Surely there’s some point at which you’re too far OTM to see significant movement as the stock price moves?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Since Jan 2022 is already kind of far out, wouldn't you eventually be capped on how far you can roll simply because there aren't any further out options available?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Would XLNX options be a better buy since XLNX is being acquired by AMD at the end of this year? Based on the exchange ratio, it appears XLNX is underpriced right now relative to how many AMD shares you can exchange for them. I would expect the prices of the two stocks to more closely match their exchange ratio as the merger date approaches."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,$2.20
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"AMD has some stuff going for them sure, but especially as data centers are concerned PCIE lanes are a premium since hdd is going away to be replaced by SSD and even NVME in these use cases in the future. AMD doesn't support more than 16 or 32 lanes across the spectrum. Until they get that handled they will always be a step behind Intel. Sure Intel needs to step up their game but I just don't see any situation where AMD takes any marketplace for Intel in any space other than gaming PCs"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hm...I like AMD but never bought in due to valuation concerns. I was waiting for it to hit $70 but it never dropped that far.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Faggy D
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct, sell some and keep the profits, roll the rest. That way if the market goes tits up, you still made a profit. For rolling the rest, it depends on the options market, you might be able to roll 2x into 4x and push it out or stay. I always try to push it out if I can since it's the safer play, but if it's too expensive then I'll make it the same exp and roll the dice."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"By the time you roll, there will be options further out. You aren’t gonna roll in a month. Maybe 4 months or so."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Do a DD on this and link me to it. Right now it looks like they're exchanging at equal amounts and options are at similar costs so there's no real difference ATM.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s... actually pretty good
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,All Epyc processors have 128 pcie lanes at gen4 speeds.

2021-03-12 20:23:24,wallstreetbets,"$BLDR Builders FirstSource Housing Play Builders FirstSource manufactures and supplies building materials, manufactured components, and construction services to professional homebuilders, sub-contractors, remodelers, and consumers in the United States. Basically they build to order construction elements like roof trusses, dormers, and cabinets to make the framing of a building much simpler, cheaper, and faster than if a builder was buying the lumber, looking and plans and doing all the framing themselves.

I like this stock and have been adding over the last 18 months.  It has a 5.5b market cap so within the thresholds of this forum. Why it is not a meme yet I do not know. The thing moves like NAIL with a beta of 2.58 while being wholly less likely to go up in smoke. 2020 was a huge year for them, the stock gained 146% yet still trades at just 17.75 P/E. It is currently trading near ATH making it both undervalued and a growth opportunity.

Honestly, I don’t know much about technical analysis so I’m just going to quote their CEO regarding Q4: “Revenue increased 3.6%, adjusted operating profit grew 22.8% and adjusted EBITDA increased 21.6%. Adjusted operating and EBITDA margins expanded 200 basis points and 240 basis points respectively, and adjusted net income increased 32.6% to $7.28 per diluted share.”

The stock is only around $47 a share with 206.5 million shares. There is currently unprecedented demand for residential new construction but all their sectors grew last year, including commercial construction.  Their earnings per share growth for Q4 2020 grew 237% over the same quarter of the prior year.

Cons: Volume is low, no one seems to know about it. Bid ask spreads fairly wide. Lumber prices are extremely high right now due to idiots who hoarded toilet paper and forest fires in the Northwest USA last year, I believe they can just pass this on to customers but could affect existing contacts. Related to beta, sometimes this can move a lot without an obvious catalyst (good IMO). It doesn’t get much coverage.

&#x200B;

# The New Normal (disruption)

Whether you're a believer in climate change or a denier of it, one thing we can all agree on is that extreme weather patterns  (by view of our short lifespans) are becoming more and more frequent, whether you think it's because that's just how things go or if cow farts are going to doom us all. Weather related damage to life, liberty, and the pursuit of tendies is now averaging 22 billion dollars a year in the United States absent of cost to infrastructure disruptions, with power disruption phenomena contributing to over 50,000 deaths per year.  As we continue to evolve and become more reliant upon technology, distributed data platforms, IoT, EVs, robot surgeons, etc., disruptions in access to power render us completely impotent to function as a society.

&#x200B;

# Our crumbling infrastructure:

&#x200B;

Thanks to the Boomers who have been wasting our immense wealth on blow, being able to see the pimples on Jenna Jameson's ass in 20 year old videos while they flaccidly beat off in their office, and in general fucking everything in this world up, the American Society of Civil Engineers has given our power grid infrastructure a D-minus grade.  Not only are there many single points of failure, the grid we presently have was only rated for 50 years of service, and a huge percentage of it is well beyond that expected lifespan.  Meanwhile, our consumption demands have increased exponentially and will continue to do so both as our population expands due to a combination of your wife's boyfriend continually getting her pregnant (or open border policies, whichever you believe in) as well as our fucked up attempts to become the Jetsons.  These are streams that should not be crossed, but we're doing it anyways because we're in the early stages of the Idiocracy documentary.

&#x200B;

# Enter $BE.  So what do these guys do?  The 3 R's:  Resiliency, Redundancy, and Retardedness

First, let's get one thing out of the way:  These guys are NOT primarily a play on replacing municipal infrastructure with green energy like solar or wind farms for large capacity energy production.  That's a crowded space, and they'd be a bad competitor there.  What they are a play on is providing MICROGRIDS for critical infrastructure to ensure continuous power delivery to essential services.  Their product provides RESILIENCY and REDUNDANCY to individual campuses and facilities to ensure that, even in the absolute worst case scenario, the wheels keep turning at vulnerable locales.  Think hospitals, water treatment facilities, nursing homes, airports, etc. at the lower level of Maslow's hierarchy and data centers, shipping hubs and the CEO's 7th vacation villa at the corporate level.  The things that will grind something to a screeching halt in the event of power failure.  The 3rd R is just a reminder that, if you're reading this, you're retarded.  Just thought you might need a reminder.

&#x200B;

# OK, HOW do they do it?  What makes them special/different?  Elon says solar and batteries are the futurez, man

&#x200B;

$BE is different than most green energy plays in that they make solid oxide fuel cells they call servers that will convert fuel (usually hydrogen, but they can run on RNG or ethanol, as well) to electricity WITHOUT combustion (that's the big differentiator here).  I won't get too sciency here because you smooth brains wouldn't get it, but it's got electrolytes, and that's what plants crave, bitches.  They require no precious metals (so no shortage concerns).  Each ""server"", which runs about 3/4 of a million dollars a unit, produces 250 kw of juice and can power 1 30,000 square foot commercial space or up to 100 homes.  These servers produce energy at 55% efficiency (for point of comparison, solar is 12%).  They do produce CO2 as waste, but only half as much as natural gas power stations.  When using RNG as the fuel source, they are a net-zero carbon emission product, which is good both for government spending programs to appease the Sierra Club as well as carbon tax dodging companies.  They're also presently burning all their positive cash flow into figuring out how to harness the CO2 these produce to turn it into some other form of energy, which would make them a CARBON NEGATIVE product if they pull it off.  That's Star Trek shit right there. These servers pay for themselves in an average of 3-5 years, making them an attractive long-term investment, especially against the 17 years it takes for solar to pay for itself.

&#x200B;

Most importantly, they operate completely independently of a power grid and are not subject to adverse weather impacting their functionality (like a solar panel getting covered with snow or temperatures falling so low that nat gas plants and windmills freeze), guaranteeing reliable access to power.  Elon's mega batteries are still constrained by the limitation that power needs to be injected into the batteries and those batteries can be drained.  These fuel cells will always operate and never run out of juice barring a component failure.

&#x200B;

**All of this is important because it highlights the fact that $BE has no real competitors on the market for the niche they've filled, and aren't going to be hampered by price increases/hunting for lithium, rare earth metals, chip shortages, etc.  The only comparable company out there is Ballard Power Systems, who is focused more on buses, industrial machinery, trains, etc., not infrastructure.   Ballard is trying to fight in the battery space, which is very crowded.**

&#x200B;

# Fuck you, Mr. Wizard - TENDIES, fucker!

&#x200B;

Alright, alright, alright.  Chill the fuck out.  I'm sorry your wife didn't peg you last night and now you're surly.  These dudes are gonna make money 4 ways:

&#x200B;

* 1 is the human life aspect.  Loss of life is tragic, but let's be honest:  Mostly, it's just bad optics if you're a politician, and what happened in Texas and California threatens political job security.    If they can spend YOUR money to ensure that they can keep TAKING money from you, they're gonna be all ears.  Expect a lot of regulation in the coming years mandating that essential facilities have access to reliable off-grid power in the case of natural disaster, Hungarian hackers or Chinese invaders.  And we can't just have Becky from HR run out to the Generac every 20 minutes to fill it with gas from the Exxon station down the street.  Interns won't blow you if you're working at Wendy's after getting voted out. The fact that it will save lives is just a nice bonus
* 2 is corporate greed.  It's bad for business to be ground to a halt, and corporations know they can't rely on the government to give them juice.  Most of $BE's money thus far (we'll get to that in a moment) already comes from corporate America.  Companies like $EBAY,  $HD, $WMT, $INTC, $AAPL, $GOOGL, $ORCL, etc. already use these guys to ensure that their data centers and shipping depots are always powered on and operational because just because the apocalypse is here doesn't mean you stop making money.   Secretaries won't blow you in the executive washroom if the board fires you.
* The 3rd is as an add-on to replacements to our current grid infrastructure to harden it and provide insurance against limited disruptions.  Customers  won't blow you if their nipples are frozen.
* The 4th is a future product, but as they hone their product and reduce their cost of production, adding a small consumer grade sized server to your home could provide about 1kW of power at a cost of about 3 grand, making it a favorable alternative to a generator or a Tesla wall paired with solar panels.  Your wife won't blow you if....well, let's be honest, she just won't blow you.  Sorry.

# Under the hood:  Financials:

&#x200B;

At the time of this writing, $BE is trading at $27.14 with a market cap of 5 billion dollars.  Their 52 week high was $45, and their 52 week low was all the way down at $3.  They were recently dragged down in the broader market correction on the NASDAQ because, even though they're an energy sector play and thus shouldn't have been hit as hard, they're ""tech energy"", so they got pulled down unfairly (right along with last week's DD, $CLNE - you're welcome on that, btw).  Even th ough they have a gross margin of over 25%, they are not a profitable company because they put all of their money into R&D.  They do about a billion dollars in revenue annually and are looking at a growth rate of over 420% in the next 2 years (no, I didn't randomly pick that number off the top of my head, that's where the math leads.  It's a sign, bitches).

&#x200B;

If we look at total returns with companies $BE gets lumped in with, we see that they severely lagged in terms of return during this green energy boom:

&#x200B;

Now, there are 2 ways you can look at this:  You can be the bad kind of retarded and say it's a bad investment because  some of these other plays have performed better, or you can be the good kind of retarded and realize that these other plays that outperformed were all in the BATTERY space and that Bloom was overlooked because it plays in infrastructure, and now gets to CATCH UP to the rest of these guys that are already very crowded trades, making you a fuck ton of money.  You want to throw money in something that's already fully vested, or something that's ""got next""?

What's the smart money doing?  Let's take a look at the short interest:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Short interest](https://preview.redd.it/yb6brzpgkmm61.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a24d64a1c40698b7cc63a144f7488828f018c49)

&#x200B;

The smart money is getting the fuck out of the way because they know this thing is coiling and is gonna bust a nut all over their faces if they don't.

&#x200B;

Normalizing all of their numbers, the price target for this stonk was trending along nicely till the broader market correction the last few weeks.  And these targets were before a light got shone on how shitty our power reliability is

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Stonks only go up](https://preview.redd.it/jxssf1o2lmm61.png?width=495&format=png&auto=webp&s=527a481b906f993df7f6659046875a760421c4ab)

&#x200B;

# Technical Teabagging:

Looking at the technicals, we see a few things.  First, on the daily it's not the smoothest price action, but we had a nice upwards channel up until the correction, and it's since gone into a descending wedge with a strong bull flag to the upside.  Now if you're looking at this and thinking to yourself ""self, this looks like a very traditional head and shoulders pattern and we've formed the right neckline"", you would be correct looking at the chart blind, but in so doing you would be ignoring the larger market correction that caused the beginning of that pattern to form, which means it'll probably be a broken H&S.  Again, these lines aren't great because I'm too lazy - I usually just eyeball it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Daily](https://preview.redd.it/21azp5m5mmm61.png?width=1207&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6e59b9f8192944a323c329bde077cc52309be70)

Expanding out to a 2 hour 20 day, things get cleaner.  Your light blue line is the 20 day moving average, the dark blue is the 50 day SMA, and the cream line is the 200 SMA.  Descending resistance, ascending support.  It's nearing the end of its coil for a breakout.  The 20 day and 50 MA will very likely be crossing in the near future at that $34 mark.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# So, to summarize:

&#x200B;

* $BE has a lot of tailwinds at its back as the result of the recent infrastructure debacles and the calls for regulation and upgrades to infrastructure, which will only become more frequent as time progresses
* With a 3-5 year return on investment, these products present an attractive investment to corporations looking to both hedge their bets against corporate incompetence as well as reduce their exposure to carbon tax measures
* Because their products don't go into EV's and aren't working with supervillains trying to get people to buy joke currency, they were largely left behind in the recent surge in green energy valuations because people largely didn't understand their voodoo or that these guys even existed, but social awareness of them is raising.  Leaving them a lot of room to the upside to run
* Even though they should have been immune to the broader market selloff as an energy sector play (the energy stonks actually went up during that correction), they got unfairly dragged down because they're still sort of a tech play.  This creates an interesting and attractive buying opportunity, even if this stonk has run a bit since I started touting it in the dailies (as I only do one DD a week, you've missed the absolute bottom, but this is free so fuck you if you want to complain)
* They're definitely going to be getting some of that gubmit corporate stimmy money to shut AOC up.
* Microgrids to critical operations such as hospitals, nursing homes, water treatment facilities, etc. are going to become a big thing and very likely an architectural standard in the future
* **They have zero competition in the space they reside in, which is really fucking unusual**
* There's a long play here by which these things could be attractive power assurance features to new home builds or as retrofits, particularly in parts of the country where natural disasters and adverse weather frequently affect access to electricity
* They're immune to weather phenomena (and actually operate better in colder weather), making them an attractive power resiliency option

&#x200B;

# Price Targets:

&#x200B;

As I've said multiple times, this stonk was positively FLYING as it caught up to $PLUG, $FCEL, etc. in the sector as people became more aware of it as a value play.  Couple that with the tailwinds it now has as a result of a shitty winter and never ending California wildfires.  A short term price target of $32 by mid April is a bet I'd have 70% conviction on.  Barring continued market manipulation because of Boomer bonds, 45-50 by mid summer, and a long term price target (given their growth projections) of $72 are entirely within reach.

&#x200B;

# How do you play it?:

&#x200B;

You can actually FD this one, if you really want to.  This thing has a very standard behavior:  It tends to pop at the open and then fades into the day.  Further, if you time that coil right, you can experience a really nice breakout on a weekly.  Personally, I like the 5/21 32cs at anything under $4 and I was buying the shit out of them during the correction, but that's just because my brain still has like 3 wrinkles in it that I can't seem to iron out.

&#x200B;

One thing to note is this is not a high volume stonk.  Only about 35000 shares will trade hands near the open, and options interest is low enough to where if you're playing with a big bankroll, filling a large order will take time.  As such, the spreads tend to be pretty wide on this guy, so you're going to want to manually enter something that's 10 cents above the current offer price and babysit it till its filled.

&#x200B;

# Position Disclaimers:

&#x200B;

I'm balls deep in these guys, and have been since early November of last year when I purchased most of the shares my VC had from funding them a decade ago to my personal accounts as we shifted the nature of our portfolio.  Since that time, I've only added to my positions on the options chain.

&#x200B;

* 263,800 shares @ $14
* 2000 5/21 32c's at an average cost basis of 2.60
* 1000 1/22 60c's at 3 even
* 500 1/22 65c's at 2.70

I'd like to say my position is fully vested, but I've been buying every single fucking dip on this one.

&#x200B;

All my love,

&#x200B;

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"No it's more insidious than that. I've been troll spotting since 2016 and they are pretty easy to spot once you know what to look for. The <100 day accounts are usually just spam accounts. The really insidious ones buy up old accounts (seriously, I've seen accounts >5 years that follow this pattern) to get around the new account filters.

Generally, you can spot them with a combination of the following (this is only my second comment here in WSB, so I fail this check):

* **BlueMAGA posting in /r/politics** 

* Unironically commenting in /r/neoliberal

* No comments on WSB before the last week of January

* Lots of posts in sports subreddits

* Long gaps in comments

 * That is, you'll see a bunch of activity from a long time ago, then the account goes into hibernation, then it gets woken up to AstroTurf in more recent times

----


Generally speaking most AstroTurfers abuse sports subreddits and defaults to generate easy karma off other AstroTurfers in plain sight. I've noticed a fuck load of accounts following this pattern since this subreddit exploded back in the end of January. I've been subbed here for over a year but never commented because this generally is the account I normally use while very stoned, and I still have no idea how any of these stonks work.


These accounts used to be extremely easy to spot during the Presidential Primaries because they almost all were the ones unironically using the term Bernie Bro and decrying online abuse. I started RES tagging them and they started popping up in tons of subreddits, even geographic local ones. A huge number of them end up in /r/politics and /r/neoliberal.

Once /r/neoliberal started up, they all started flocking there to generate activity to make it look like an organic subreddit that just of course hates Bernie Bros **and** Republicans, as if a large number of Reddit's demographics falls into that category...."

The current price is absolutely not a reflection of the long term value. Its a reflection of a once in a decade squeeze + good marketing. 

For an actual proper valuation you’d need to start at 40 and go from there, looking at financials, cohen’s plans, and the market they are competing in. You don’t just start at 250 then say it needs to go up because of Cohen + speculation on what they COULD do. Thats how you lose a whole lot of money in the long term. 

It doesn’t take a shill to know its overvalued today. Cohen hasn’t announced a single plan yet. That doesn’t mean there isn’t money to be made. The people who actually know what they are doing and making money on GME know the difference. This is a momentum play right now, not a growth play."

The term gamma squeeze is thrown around in almost every post including some hilarious “due diligence” explanatory post, with no real connection to reality, math or actual facts. If market makers and markets in general operates they way people here think, the stock (any stock actually) would be at $1,000,000 already. 

This guy doesn’t even tell between volume and OI, or understand that the 300 calls will have a delta of one when GME is way above $300, or that MM don’t just sell options naked, and that hedging options is done in more ways than just buying the shares.

But there’s also a logical way to see why the closer expiry hour is, the more definitive and clear moneyness becomes. Delta can be ultimately thought of as the probability of expiring ITM; so considering a 300 call, If an 5 minutes before expiry the stock goes up from 240 to 260 does it really change the value of the option or the probability of it not expiring worthless? Nope, it’s still as worthless as it were a minute ago. The closer expiring is, the more definitive the move has to be to affect the probability of it expiring ITM, that’s exactly why delta converges to 0 for OTM options and to 1 for ITM options towards expiry.

Tl;dr : near their expiry, options will the lowest gamma, and OTM options delta will converge toward zero. Gamma squeeze (hate how it become this empty buzzword in wsb) will happen as ATM options with high OI move the deeper and deeper ITM."

Speculating that something is FUD is not the same as doctoring information or data to craft a narrative. Actually it's the opposite; it's a call for scrutiny.

Maybe before you start flailing your retarded arms around, try at least googling stock greeks."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are completely wrong about what causes a gamma squeeze.  It can happen when the option is completely out of the money and it certainly doesn't happen at expiration.

A gamma squeeze is caused when someone who needs to maintain a delta neutral position has to buy more stock as the stock increases in value (causing the price to rise even more).

For example if a MM is short a bunch of .2 delta calls they might own 20% of the stock to hedge (20 shares per contract).  Then if the price rises, the delta might rise, causing the MM to buy more to maintain their delta neutral position.  If the delta rises to 0.3 they have to increase their position by 50% (now they need 30 shares per contract instead of 20).

2 things to notice here:  first, the contract is still well out of the money, and 2nd, this all happens before expiration, not at expiration.

At expiration delta will either be 0 or 1 and so a MM maintaining a delta neutral position will either have 100 shares per contract or 0 shares per contract.  There is no squeeze at expiration because they already have the shares.  The squeeze happens as the price runs up prior to expiration.

It's worth pointing out that this can cut both ways; if the share price drops they are going to need to dump shares to maintain their delta neutral position.  So the effect is higher volatility, even if there's no directional pressure on the stock.

It's also worth pointing out a MM has many holdings and so their hedging is not as simplistic as we make it out to be.  They may be long calls at other strikes, or they may be short puts, giving them protection against larger stock moves, negating the effects of delta changing)  It's not like Citadel is just going to look at total delta and call it a day as far as RM goes.  They are smarter than that."
2021-03-12 19:55:42,wallstreetbets,"AFRM offers 84% upside potential. I’m putting a price target of $145 on the shares, representing enormous opportunity from current levels ($79).  Here’s my thesis:  Affirm charges merchants -- including COVID-19 lockdown beneficiary Peloton -- to take on the risk of customers who want to pay with installments. Millennials are driving a change in the traditional idea of paying by credit, and investors now have a way to play that trend in the U. S. Affirm allows consumers to split purchases into installments. The company is modernizing the world of payments by offering an option to make purchases over time without incurring interest for consumers.

Affirm makes money on its ""0% APR"" installment options by taking a cut of the merchant end of the transaction. The idea is that merchants are willing to pay Affirm to conduct risk modeling and offer its service as a way to boost conversion to a sale. The 0% APR options generally nets the company its largest fees from merchants, though it also offers "" simple-interest"" loans through which it receives fixed interest payments on the consumer end as well.

Max Levchin co-founded Affirm in 2012. He has an impressive pedigree as one of PayPal’s co-founders. While everyone recognizes Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, you shouldn’t dismiss Levchin’s contribution – he is a powerhouse. We are impressed when someone creates an empire and helps revolutionize the way business is done. We have great faith in him as Affirm’s CEO.

Levchin is a disruptor and is changing the way people pay for goods and how they pay for them over time. Seeking to set the credit card world on its head, the company appeals to both consumers and merchants with a simple, attractive proposition. His vision for the company is to be as “ubiquitous, secure, and convenient as legacy networks, yet far more transparent, honest, and both consumer- and merchant-centric.”

The company is the online lender on the consumer front, and brings clarity on the amount owed and when it is due. A major portion of its business is helping merchants provide 0% financing, and it has signed up major companies like Priceline, Gucci, Dyson, and Expedia. The consumer-centric approach means the company doesn’t charge late fees and interest is not compounded. That is, it is simple interest. The company profits by treating its customers fairly, rather than by gouging them with high interest and unreasonable fees. Profitability is based on growing consumer acceptance, which in turn, makes it more valuable for merchants to offer. For merchants, the company is focused on helping them improve their brand, gain more customers, and increase sales. Affirm earns revenue from this source when it facilitates a sale and payment.

Affirm and Shopify struck an agreement in July through which Shopify would list Affirm as a payment option, giving the company exposure to Shopify's vast base of merchants. Affirm will pay Shopify a fee for each sale processed through its platform, and the company will be Shopify's exclusive partner for such payment options over the course of the arrangement, which lasts three years initially and then subsequently renews for additional one-year terms unless one party decides to discontinue the arrangement.

The company is past the proof-of-concept stage. There are over 6.2 million (!) consumers that have signed up, having completed over 17 million transactions, and the company works with over 6,500 merchants. Gross Merchandise Value\* (GMV) was $10.7 billion over the last three years. Last year, about 64% of its loans were made to repeat customers.

The company went public on January 13th at $49, pricing 25 million shares above the $41 to $44 range. There was strong demand for the IPO. Opening at $91, it reached $103 on the first day of trading. The following day, it went to $138.  Now the stock in trading in the 80s meaning you can get it for less than the IPO.

There is a long runway for continued strong revenue growth that will drive earnings improvement. This will continue fueling the stock.

Founder and CEO Max Levchin controls 20% of the company. Counting him, directors and officers control 31% of the shares. There are very well-known investors that continue to hold major interests. The Founders Fund (a venture capital firm with $3 billion under management, which includes Brian Singerman, Peter Thiel, and Keith Rabois,) has 7%. Khosla Ventures (5%), Lightspeed Ventures (7%), Jasmine Ventures (9%), and Shopify (8%) all have significant ownership. With strong leadership and a unique business model that continues to prove itself, Affirm will continue attracting younger consumers and merchants. Revenue growth is just in the early stages."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree. Can't PayPal just simply add this on to their service as a feature? Like literally writing one line of html on their site offering payment plans and poof, there goes Affirm? I see they already have PayPal Credit where they breakdown into 6 payments. Lol.

Like GME has shown us... the world is a circle... history repeats itself."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Any attempt at satire on the internet will be met with an r/woosh
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This ""murdered and exploited by white invaders...."" is not factually accurate at all; there was peace and co-existence with very mild disputes over nearly 100 years (yes killing and death occurred, but often times it was due to an Indian tribe leader demanding servitude or advanced items of metals/glass/fabrics from your claimed ""white invaders""... during that period.  

You're claiming the people who left oppressions should have put up and kneeled down before the Indian tribes and became oppressed yet again.  Do you know anything about this info or just spew some shit.... anyways... moving on....  Many beginning colonies came to arrangements/negotiated agreements to work together and barter for exchange of knowledge/items.

Colonists needed info about the land and region along with food/water supplies and Indian tribes wanted the advanced items the colonists had (fine textiles, storage containers, iron (that's right Indians didn't have ANY metallic knowledge beyond what they could find on the ground before colonists showed up) and eventually guns/gunpowder (a highly valuable item to Indians as it was viewed as magic to them.)  Anyhow this advancement in negotiation and agreements led to the celebration of the colonists first bountiful harvest in the new land and is why we have Thanks Giving as a holiday for a reason! (to celebrate that unity and coordination between the Pilgrims and Indians and their success of a first bountiful harvest (in the late fall)).

It wasn't until the mid-late 1700 period where fighting escalated due to nomadic roaming tribes over land disputes and ""alleged"" disruption of game herds.  Indians blamed the disruptions on the expansion westward, but it's entirely feasible droughts and other environmental factors were the real cause of these disruptions.

At this point, hostages were rarely taken by native Americans (as they blamed pilgrims for this disruption) and thus why they became WIDELY known as savages.  This kill or be killed mentality escalated when entire towns were slaughtered and then it the mentality became shared by those ""white invaders"" - and was basically ""if they don't want to negotiate anymore and only slaughter, then we will do the same.""

Also your mentality of these white invaders thing is just so unbased.... I hope you do realize the KINGDOM OF ENGLAND claimed rule over the land and people during this period right?  THIS WAS BEFORE THE USA WAS EVEN A THING and the ""white invaders"" literally turned around and killed those ""Englanders"" for the fucked up shit they were doing to whites and Indians alike.

The Kingdom's of England/Dutch literally incited violent incidents using their military by killing when conflicts arose, that's not the colonists fault!  There was 3 major factions and everyone wants to Fucking ignore this and paint it as 2 like cowards,  1) government

2) colonists which hated their governments Dutch, French, and England   -  Middle American Colonists fought off their fucked up government  ( that's why we have the USA and Constitution and Bill of Rights)

Northern colonists (mostly French but included many Englanders) didn't revolt against the French government's occupational attitude over them and hence why it's still a major language there they were part of France/London rule for a very long time (it wasn't until 1867 before they separated to form ""Canada!"" This was the age of fucking trains we're talking about.... )

and and 3) Natives"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,A reaction to the treasury yield going up because tech has been overbought for the last year lol.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, they do not have “buddies”, MMs are computer programs in servers co-located inside or around exchanges. They don’t have any friends and don’t play favors. They also do not care what the stock is trading for, or whether it goes up or down; they’re just looking to fill your orders to buy GME while simultaneously fill someone else’s order to sell - and make the spread between what they pay and what they sell for. Nothing more. 

So, what was that dip you ask? Well, broadly speaking and in attempt to keep it short and not technical, when the stock hits a level of $344.29, and the inflow of new buy orders apparently dries out, while the influx of sell market orders is rather heavy. At that time the bid side of the order book is thin and as the barrage is sell orders keeps taking out more and more orders, the order book thins out even more (this is no coincidence, but we don’t want this to get too technical and deep) and quickly there aren’t any buyers to take on all these sellers. 

Again: a market maker wants to have a buyer for every seller and a seller for every buyer (so that he may maintain “a flat book”), so when they see that price X draws a lot of sellers, but is apparently too high to entice buyers to grab more stock, they lower the quote, knowing that at a low enough price buyers will return; they lower their quote and offer the stock at lower and lower prices until buyers return and resume buying. They didn’t lower the price because they hate apes and wanted them to lose, they lower the price because apes weren’t buying, and they wanted them to.

I recommend watching [this video](https://youtu.be/CQyqhhUI9eM) to learn a little about how this is actually works. This video deals with options market making, but most principles remain; you’ll notice that at no point does any bias regarding the stock or where it’s going comes into play."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s trying*
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The Manhattan rents do that just fine, no wall needed"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ohhhh man! Flash back to [this song right here](https://youtu.be/vsQrKZcYtqg)

Even old NY was once New Amsterdam 🎶"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Savage"" in the modern context of the word... Where it's a plus and not an insult.

Much like ""bad bitch"" -- you wouldn't call a woman that even 15 years ago without a punch in the mouth"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,🤣🤣
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"In fairness... Native Americans didn't invent scalping, it was learned from the white man too.  

I don't come to reddit for politics or history tho -- let's get gack to memes and stonks"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You have the right to be offended not appologied to if the person  doesn't  care if your offended.

Op obviously doesn't  want to offended anyone regarding the native population and was using the language  of the time in an ironic context.

OP likely doesn't  care about your insecurity complex."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I only caught the tail end of it, but I assume we're not allowed to assume its gender. But vag and dong attachments would be interesting."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Mr Potato Head and Mrs Potato Head are still separate toys but the entire brand has been changed to drop the title to appeal to a wider demographic. Suddenly people on Facebook are experts on children's toy marketing and *very concerned* though
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tell them you lost it all and cashed out with next to nothing.

Just lie."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can always tell them you broke even.

Just don’t buy your lambo for a couple years if ever.  Stealth wealth.  Treat yourself just enough to make them always wonder..."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is all in theory, tell me you are exactly during that moment in front of the screen and looking at that stock, but not somewhere cooking your dinner or taking a shower. Or you might have that idea when the stock was around 220 and you set your stop loss at 200."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,If the $200 sell stop happens I’ll dump it into Nokia for a hail mary
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m the best! I used to play all the time at catholic school!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s NOT a mouth based Bloomberg terminal.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Not that dip. LoL. Context buddy. Context. Edit: I derpped. I meant Wed. The big one from nearly $400 to $173.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Think esport on the side could be awesome for it. Like a small monthly aoe2 tournament ah half yearly and yearly. Do this for alot of smaller games with very active online multiplayer
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Becoming the new steam? Enforcing anti scalper rules? Helping distribute game merchandise? Even becoming a publisher?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe they'll do a store epic games style to get on the action, while also catering to the video game crowd, really the potential is endless"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'M RECLAIMING MY TIME!!!


*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, Im struggling to find any real facts that point to this. Beheading was big in Europe, but not scalping.

We can agree to disagree though."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh the irony. We can just go in an infinite loop at this rate! True retard if you can't see that...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"When I was the age where I was playing with that toy, I'd be putting on the Ms shit on the Mr and vice versa anyway.  It's a fucking potato head.  

I'm sorry I can't lie.  I still play with that toy to this day."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Na, they're just rebranding. It's so blown out of proportion it's ridiculous."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The toy itself didn't even change names. They just renamed the overall line of toys that also includes Mrs Potato Head to Potato Head.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It better fucking be a non gender vag, or I'm hanging me a white guy tonight."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a way
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It depends on the time, but the stop loss plan involves only setting them in the green. I could miss some of the 🚀, but I would have made a profit at least. I also plan to have a bigger gap, around $50 or more, maybe a lot more depending on how high we go, between the current price and the stop loss. Their purpose is to make sure I don't hold from a large profit in the squeeze all the way back down to earth since the trip to the moon won't be a one way trip."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that's my bad, I was hopping between threads and though we were talking about tech."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Think esport on the side could be awesome for it

Ah yes, the ultra-profitable esports industry."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What do they offer to make them become next steam? How is limiting anti-scalper rules limited to gamestop? Any store can help distribute game merchandise and things are moving online anyway.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The logic you people are using can be extended to so many companies, where you vision unlimited upside."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its not ironic it just takes a basic  understanding  of history, context and empathy."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Time to execute the plan ;)
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,the future is now old man
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because the marketing they are getting is immense. They have a proper wind of ads AND capital, and becoming a meme makes them leave the old ideas to become something to the new generations.

If your brand has a new start, the options available are realistically limited, but right now, GameStop is in a position to become WHATEVER they want, and I am not even joking.

Their own social media, their own news site, their own merchandising brand..."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Such as? No other companies have the same momentum gme does rn, origin and cockstar games launcher for example are complete shit"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe the PC crowd should learn history and stop using it for their political agendas. The ""apology"" was sarcasm. Again, the irony of being empathetic toward one group while putting down another."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but what capital are Gamestop going to use to pivot? They've been hemorrhaging for years under terrible management.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Uh hu.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"From our own autistic diamond hands, plus they're under new management now, also as DFV said, it is criminally undervalued"
2021-03-12 19:36:02,wallstreetbets,AMC majority stakeholder down to 9.8% of total shares 
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I see this as an absolute win. Chinese companies will always do as master Pooh Bear says, better to not have them involved."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,♪♪ It was Chinese Wanda all aloooong! ♪♪
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, Wanda had a convertible bond they flipped into stock during the peak of the first mania for AMC and sold at the top, why this is news now is very strange to me"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Top notch comment, def underrated."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"buy the tip, sell the dip."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Here we thoughts we were getting short laddered into oblivion but really it was Wanda dropping millions of shares
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,USA ultra smelly anal urinal sex addict
2021-03-12 19:29:55,wallstreetbets,Eating a ghost pepper because I'm an ape of my word 
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone make this retard and honorary Mod. r/wallstreetbets
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re a brave guy. Most people delete their account. Have 1 reddit karma on me, sir."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this why y’all call each other retards?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I’d like to believe that all male redditors look like him
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,My asshole hurts tomorrow just watching this. May this movement never end.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,His reactions are how I imagine sex will be with my wife when we are in our 70s.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If GME hits $500 I will cry, as I do not currently own any shares."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is what us retards do for fun
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"cant imagine why this retard didnt even take his beanie off, probably drenched in nasty head sweat"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is why I love Reddit and WSB. In terms of investment knowledge it’s one of the worst, but the people man, the people... love it."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Shit got deep at the end. Hold. Hold.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The fact you didn’t touch it with your hand was brilliant... for a retard 🍌
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You look like what would happen if Vlad and Keith could rub two sticks together and make a baby.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Did this need to be 10 minutes?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Cant wait for the guy who said he would eat shit
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If AMC hits $100, eat a Carolina Reaper"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How’s it feel right now? The worst part of it for me wasn’t going down. It’s feeling satan’s beating heart travel through your digestive system.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the shirt.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I wonder if you took a couple TUMS would this help you handle the heat in your belly and throat? I'm too much a pussy for this and would rather risk a tattoo (I don't want a tattoo either)
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,A true retard! Kudos!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"He saw the moon up there, and $$$ I hope. Cheers!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Did your asshole catch on fire?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"TL:DW ? 

Does he shit himself, throw up, call 911 or yes?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,If GME reaches 800 I’ll eat 2 of the hottest peppers I can find and chug watered down hot sauce
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Be an environmentally friendly retard and stop drinking almond milk. Oatmilk is better for the environment .... and better with spice lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Your poor poor bhole
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes waiter, I think I’ll have the crayon please."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey, maybe this works...if GME hits $10000, I will eat a pack of crayons and drink a full bottle of sriracha to digest them."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The real agony will be on the way out. God speed!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Let us know how it comes out
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Retarded ape with a hot 💎🖐.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Where’s Silent Bob?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Be careful, dude. Eating ghost pepper could actually burn a hole in the esophagus that requires ER surgery. It [happened before](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27693067/)."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahaha respect. I want your t-shirt
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,so this is what almost took down billion dollar hedge funds. nice
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait, where did you get that shirt"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"""The videos did not inspire confidence"". 

Lost my shit"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,My esophagus and stomach hurt watching this cause my acid reflux would not let me do this bet lol. Seriously much respect to you though. 👏🦍
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Motherfucker, you will now never die of cancer and live to be 110."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow dude, you handled that like a boss. I would have been puking and  rolling around on the floor. My tacos get too spicy and I have a fucking  melt down, I couldn't imagine eating a ghost pepper."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I ate a fresh one once.  No chance I would take a dried one.  100% Full Retard.

Good news though, when it comes out the other side, there will be enough fire to fuel our 🌛🚀."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Now go suck dicks behind Wendy’s before it wears off so you can get the last laugh.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,one of us!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,FAKE!! MAKE HIM DO IT AGAIN😂
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t understand the hat
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You kept your word!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yo, for anyone out there that overdoes it with spice: put the fire out with a spoonful of sugar. 

Used to do challenges up to 2.5 mill scu, trust me will save you tons of pain. Milk and shit doesn’t work past 500,000 or so and drinking water is like trying to put out Greek fire. Will immediately put out the mouth fire. Coming out the other end is another story."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Well that was boring.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"If gme hits $500 I'll post a picture of my balls to gone wild.  



I'll need someone to remind me"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Can we continue this Inception music trend xD Time is my absolute favorite piece from it
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Those last 20 seconds were fucking Oscar worthy
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Props for lettin that one marinate in your face hole instead of swallowing it with milk
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I felt so connected to you while watching, that I was scared to touch my eyes, because I didn't want to ""transfer the burning"""
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Should’ve rehydrated. Lol.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What a god... sorry ape
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Best relief for peppers is lemon juice. Not the flavored shit...but pure lemon juice. Don't cha wish you knew that before you ate that pepper.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Like a boss.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,True ape 🦍👐💎👐👍🏻
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hands aren’t going to be the only thing quivering dude 😩

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shit man, i could’ve hooked you up with some frozen reapers and scorpions. I once ate a tiny ghost because I didn’t think it matured....boy was wrong."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That shirt though. To the fucking moon you apes
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope u/jiggerson is seeing all these posts by real men and that it’s a constant reminder to him that he is an insignificant coward
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,much respect

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude. You could have put the ghost peper in some nachos and eat it... but mad respect for following though.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The worst part about eating the ghost pepper was the pain I felt in my stomach.  I also tried eating the carolina reaper.  Eating peppers with 1,000,000 plus units of Scoville is a dumb stupid dumb fucking idea.  It's an interesting experience but expect to be in pain for the rest of the day/night.

I recommend eating ice cream to dull the pain."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m buying more gme monday cause of you.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Where do I get the shirt?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh God. So proud you kept your word, but ghost peppers are like eating lava."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"**HE IS AN APE OF HIS WORD!!!!**

Also, almond milk won't do shit for you.  Capsaicin is fat-soluble, and almond milk has no appreciable fat.  You want something that will help the burn?  *HEAVY WHIPPING CREAM*.

Edit:  Also, you thought the party was over?  Wait until it comes out the other end."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Peppers originally developed their heat as a defense mechanism against apes and other mammals because we tend to chew the fuck out of them, thus destroying the seeds. Birds don’t have capsaicin receptors and can eat the peppers with no problem and disperse the seeds in their shit which sprays out of their cloaca. For those of you who don’t know, the cloaca is where the bird’s poop-hole and pee-hole come together to form one hole for all the bird’s expulsary needs. Now that’s efficiency."

1. Bite the 🌶 / buy the stock

2. Go through a lot of initial pain / anxiety / pant-shitting

3. eventually settle, emotionally/mentally regroup, apply support measures to abate negative feeling

4. Become a tougher MF

Guess you shouldn't eat spicy peppers on an empty stomach!"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was told this by a friend when I was younger, and yes I have tried this. Young rach never once had a wrinkle in her smooth brain"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol it’s probably bad for you, but I always burn out my sunburns in the shower. It hurts like fuck but the sunburn stops hurting and turns brown super quick."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,These are the same people that voted for Trump
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I once saw a mentally ill and presumably homeless man dump a can of Spaghetti-Os into a tub of sour cream and go at it.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,More so the casein protein in milk washes it away but yea almond milk doesnt help. Either gotta go big or go home. If youre lactose intolerant best thing is to go buy a jar of casein protein powder.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,a mouthful of sugar also works wonders
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"OP polished off his pepper with hot sauce, i dont think he is worried bout milk."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thankfully almonds are mostly fat...
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Honey as well
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Sugar actually helps a lot too
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ahh i see. So go with my wife titties when i am eating spicy food. Got it
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,use creamline whole milk.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Save comment!!!

Thanks, today I learn something."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wrinkly brain ya got there, bub."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,So eating your mom should make it go away even faster than milk?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What is you just ate butter then?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait, now I’m wondering if the non homogenized milk with the chunky curds would be better than the homogenized?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yum Yum sauce is like a fourth of a day’s worth of fat so it probably works well

Now that I think about it that must be Why ranch dressing pairs so well with hot wings"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Soooooo taking a bite lard would also work?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,What if I just eat a spoon of bacon grease
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"For lactose intolerant people especially: casein protein powder >>> ""milks"" > water."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Where does ""one's own piss"" fall on the scale?  Keto diet, but well-hydrated."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Would melted butter be even better?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,A true brother-ape 🦍
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope he has a bidet
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh I love reapers, someone brought reaper chips in to the office a few years ago and I just kept munching on 'em.  My Indian co-workers thought I was crazy, it was too hot for them."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Monday is not very far away
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know all about that shit. I got it on my pp and in my eyes one time. 

I had a bottle and I had to keep it in a plastic bag and only handle the bottle with gloves because I had gotten the oil on the bottle and it just would not come off. 

That is hands down the hottest shit I’ve ever eaten. A ghost pepper ain’t shit on that stuff."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've spent so much there... they've got a Ghostly Garlic sauce that's phenomenal, pickled spicy garlic cloves, ""world's hottest"" beef jerky, salsas and dry rubs, it's heaven for pepper heads."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You did......Eat them in the way in correct? 🤣🤣
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh my! it’s great to have a theory now for that crazy irrational mattress flipping rolling around screaming hyena out of his mind time I had a few years back after a pretty bad sunburn nothing I hadn’t dealt with before I thought. I got some shot at the er and everyone laughed at me and told me to wear sunscreen. 😩
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow I didn't know there was a name for this, but I remember having it in college. I'm fair skinned and decided I wanted to get a tan, so I went to the beach without sunscreen for a few hours and got absolutely roasted. My skin was redder than my stock portfolio. But for real, I was writhing around the floor, crying in pain. I would have gone to the ER if I'd had health insurance. It felt like deep itchy daggers running all over my body. It's frustrating trying to describe it to people, because you can't really understand the level of maddening pain, unless you've experienced it. It was not a light itch that a simple scratch or some aloe would solve. I tried all kinds of creams, lotions, and home remedies. The magical cure for me was vinegar in a spray bottle - for some strange reason, this stopped the itch and also seemed to take some of the color out of the burn. I think I did ice baths too to numb the skin."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I had a similar experience after a bad run-in with a bunch of biting flies during a camping trip last year.  I was itching for a couple of weeks after and it felt like it would never go away and I was starting to worry about scarring from scratching so much.  Hot showers were a lifesaver.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have Celiac's and get this bad reaction sometimes when I get sunburnt in a chlorine shocked pool. I thought it might be the chlorine and this rash that is basically Celiac's of the skin. But this sounds just like it tbh, I wonder if they are similar. I can't remember the name of the skin condition, DH or TH I think, don't know what it stands for."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"What do you mean by ""not sure my wife's bf is faithful""?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actually not a bad idea. Alcohol is a good solvent, too."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You had me at white russian. I'm in.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The shits after eating a ghost pepper can’t get much worse.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Came here to say this. Whenever I eat something too spicy for me to handle I just shovel a bunch of sugar in my mouth. I couldn't believe it worked, but it's pretty instantaneous. I was blown away.

With that said, I have no idea what it would do for something like a ghost pepper."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,And an 8oz cup of almond milk is like... 3 almonds.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hemp milk is a thing? Where can I buy some?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Got some almond milk?

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I had hells itch so bad once I literally scratched like 4 layers of skin off on like 10 different spots on my legs and had huge gnarly scabs like I had crazy road rash or something. 0/10 would not recommend.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit!!! I used to get this as a kid. Literally the worst fkin thing, and I've never been able to explain it to anyone. I used to call it prickly heat rash. But it felt like someone was rubbing a cactus on my back and shoulders for days. It used to ruin my holidays. Only thing that would help is Aloe Vera gel"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have you tried anti-histamines or hydrocortisone?  Sunburns cause histamine build up in the skin, which can cause itchiness.  I am not a doctor or a cat."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Easy man I’ve got a beverage here!

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,It's really hard to grow the plants where I'm at I've been struggling with my ghost and reaper plants
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Not the same but it reminded of the one time I went running and had to take a shit. Got poison oak on my ass and balls. Plus I was wearing good socks so... rip good socks. And my asshole and balls.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Is almond milk sticky?

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Im from austria and I can tell you that it would be free and depending on how busy the hospital is and how deep the cut is you can wait for a few hours, or be done in 15 minutes.

I had a cut at night that needed 5 stiches and was done in 15 minutes and never payed anything (well exept for taxes are now significant that I earn more, but it does make sense)."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets, It baffles me how they accuse us of manipulating the stock. How exactly does one manipulate stock by buying it and holding it? While the hedgies do all kinds of shady stuff we sit with diamond hands. I guess that we are to ignore that the hedge funds donate heavily to the campaigns to elect those in charge. After they exit office they then work for the hedge funds but obviously deepfuckingvalue is the criminal. 🤷‍♂️

While the 'suits' will have no idea why you want or need or are using red crayons and coloring bar charts; all of use degenerate gambling autistic smooth brained retarded apes here will know exactly what it means and will hoot/howl/gibber \[gibber is what is called the sounds that apes/moneys/etc make\] when we see/hear about it. 

And when they got you in an interrogation room badgering you 'to confess to market manipulation' that is going on with stocks like $GME, where people are buying because of the absurd open short interest; start coloring bar charts that are all red and the trend is lower and to the right; all the while talking about 'I like the stock' and how your wife's boyfriend seems like an 'ok guy' since he has driven you to the emergency room several times because you keep jamming red crayons in your nose.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Overstock the company? Like overstock. com or like overstock a term?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"One recent theory of the current state of the world is that we are living in 'Clown World'. A few years ago Clown World theory only seemed to explain parts of what we see in the outside world, but more and more the whole world seems like it is Clown World.

Another part of all this is that large organizations have reached the point that only simps and psychopaths are rewarded and promoted; people of competence/merit are systematically purged from the organization or leave over time.

Psychopaths being rewarded and promoted can be understood, since those people 'will do whatever it takes' to get ahead of other people. They will do anything to make themselves look better, take credit for other people's work, lie when lying will get them ahead as long as they will not get caught, etc. 

Simps get rewarded and promoted because eventually, as people leave or retire, people are needed to keep the organization running; so the most compliant and agreeable people are rewarded and promoted. The psychopaths will want people around them and reporting to them since the simps will do whatever the psychopath wants. Note: For a simp, there is always the possibility if anything gors wrong that the psychopath will shift the blame to the simp and ruin the simps career.

Anyone of any merit or competence is viewed as a threat to both. The simp does not like a person running on competence since the competent one will likely not be willing to 'go along just to go along' especially if there is some legal or moral issue involved. While the simp usually will not engineer the removal of the person of merit, they also will do nothing to support or help them.

The psychopath will get rid of people of competence over time since they are a direct threat for them getting rewards and promotions, since they are usually not as competent."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"A lot of people here who's about to get rich off GME are also bonafide morons, and are possibly way dumber than any lying piece of shit to appear on CNBC. Majority of the new traders here don't even know how options or greeks work. Getting money don't require you to be smart, it's just luck and timing. People who can buy loads of stocks would be a lot richer than those who can only afford to buy double/triple digit amount of stocks. What you're looking at are those people.

Hedgies aren't stupid, they just got cocky and did not expect anyone to buy GME. They would have succeeded if Cohen didn't get on board. Reminder, GME was a legitimate brick and mortar that was about to bite the dust like Blockbuster prior to Cohen entry. They posted a loss during a pandemic that obscenely benefited all game and tech related companies, if you're a new holder then it should be obligatory to go read up about the GME crash to $4 in Aug 2020."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look up 'The Peter Principle' if you're not familiar with it. Everybody rises to the level at which they're too incompetent to get promoted any further, so therefore hierarchies always fill up with people at their most incompetent."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This, I think, is the 'big shock' to the elites. The election of Trump was another such incident. (It is still strange that a billionaire like Trump could have been viewed as a 'person of the people' in 2016. I distinctly recall people in 2016 voting for Trump specially because a lot of political insiders (of both parties) and financial insiders seemed to be having a meltdown that was way out of proportion to anything they had seen in their lives before.

The while thing with Melvin Capital/Citadel/RobinHood/Interactive Brokers; where the head of Interactive Brokers was on TV almost in tears because of the possibility of the 'entire system defaulting'; and the cause was a bunch of degenerate gambling autistic retarded apes, buying a stock that was heavily short.

Other have mentioned, and I agree, just exactly how strong are these firms is a short squeeze on ONE stock could implode firms and then the whole market?

Of course, we know the problem is the constant 'redlining' of financial leverage these firms use to make their absurd high returns, and that is the problem. The typical person, after they were up a few billion, would 'back off' on the leverage so no matter what happened they would always be ok and in business; but not these guys. No matter how much they made this year or last year; they gotta leverage everything up like some degenerate gambling retarded autistic ape. It does not matter if you were up 90% for 30 years if on the last year you 'blow up' and end up down 99.9% because they 'never took anything off the table'.

Even after seeing how fast things can go bad, some of them are STILL way up on $GME shorting, like over 30% or so. While not as bad as 140%, it is STILL bad and still at risk. That is why I wonder the people putting on such dangerous trades are somehow looking at blowing up their own firm for some reason, because it is insane to lever up on a short like this and think it is going to turn out well."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"There’s a difference between investing and trading. Investing is buying into a stock because you think they have solid fundamentals and has the greatest room for potential growth. Remember, buy low sell high. Think of it this way, would I want to own this stock 20 years from now? Trading is usually done in a very short time frame, usually less than a day. Additionally, analysis is done via technicals not fundamentals. Trading is done by looking at trends and potential swings. If you’re looking to invest, there’s a bunch of good books on amazon or whatever over the basics of looking for investments. If you’re looking to trade, YouTube and the day trading subreddits are a good place to start. I hope that helps a bit."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't know about how to figure things out, but you can broaden your horizons while losing money by reading calendars for upcoming earnings stocks, and then just read the summary and check financial stuff on anything and everything.

Maybe they are about to file bankruptcy, so do a lot of research on the ones that make your list.

I started reading IPO stuff too, and am interested in AFGY(agrify) to name one."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s for the info.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think part of the problem is that it is almost impossible to find any company to 'invest in'. most companies are either completely broke, and will eventually file Chap 11, but somehow the stock keeps going up; OR the company goes nowhere for decades and pays a .01% dividend but sales have been flat for years.

It did not use to be that way. I can remember in the early 1980s there were lots of stocks paying dividends in the 5% to 10% range and covering them with cash flow from profits, and revenue was growing. 

Today any stock paying 10% per years is probably declining 20% per year."

I'm gonna get worried if the pattern start to look anything like this since last time it dropped from 220 to 90 after this pattern. Keep in mind though that we are still on a strong bullish pattern and this one was after a bearish pattern:

2021-03-12 18:43:45,wallstreetbets,"General Motors Tendies! I wanted to bring more of you along for this run, but [couldn't get my DD posted a few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll2yeh/gm_has_more_gas_left_in_the_tank/) during all the madness going on here.  I think GM has more gas left in the tank even after this run.  I took this gain because the size of position had grown and with the expiration next week I decided to lock this in, as well as I'm transferring out of Interactive Brokers.  I still have 20 more calls (also shown below) that I'll try to press to a $60 strike before closing/rolling that position.

My basic premise is that while most are viewing GM's rise as an EV play, the share gains are actually because of Boomer metrics.  GM is producing too much cash and growing earnings too much to have a dying industrial PE multiple.  They're sandbagging earnings and have a history of such.  When they beat earnings again next quarter, GM will moon, again.  You don't have to view GM as a Tesla rival to have tendies print now because of large SUV's.  **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

2021-03-12 18:01:09,wallstreetbets,"The most overvalued stock of 2021 - SEAS A while ago /u/cyphonismus made an excellent DD on one of the most clearly overvalued stocks on the market: [Seaworld Overvalued - SEAS](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lry7dt/seaworld_overvalued_seas/)

(due to all the GME hype, it didn't get much attention)

&nbsp;

*How did it get this way?*

The small float at 50 million shares and incredibly high institutional ownership with low volume translates to it being easily manipulated. Institutions got lazy and let this thing slipway past where it should have gotten. No retail investor is long on fucking SEAS.

In other words, if take your 💩 and make it look like a [chocolate bar](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Cadbury-Dairy-Milk-Caramel-Bar.jpg), no one will be any the wiser as long as they don't get close enough to sniff.

""Just skimming the fundamentals, this company looks like absolute dogshit."" -/u/ethandavid

Seriously, there is no bull argument at all for this being above $20, and this stock is starting to *stink*. 

Check out this article: [SeaWorld attendance dives 53% in the final quarter of 2020, but stock soars](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/tourism/os-bz-seaworld-earnings-covid-rebound-20210225-fs7wmwm3zrh7jlzwm5qdsbdz7y-story.html)

A small dip in the fake momentum and this thing comes **tumbling down**.

&nbsp;

*But what about the cute killer whales? I'm not evil!*

Watch Blackfish. It would be doing them a favor if SeaWorld was bankrupt.

Even without that knowledge, the company itself is run by some really scummy individuals. 

The starting wage at SeaWorld Orlando is current $11 an hour. Instead of raising the minimum wage, the CEO plans to ""increase automation efforts overtime"" to solve their cost problems. Not only are your Orca's being kept in a cage, but they also won't even pay the people to take care of them.

&nbsp;

*But we only know how to get tendies with undervalued stocks!*

Indeed young one, but everyone can learn. The bold get the tendies. 

You usually need to apply to get shorting approved on your margin account. Fidelity has a pretty quick turnaround time, so if SEAS is still above $40 by the time you get approved it can be a great play to make.

There is a lot of benefit to having at least one 🌈🐻 position in your portfolio. Probably even more than one (explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxf7y0/whats_happening_with_the_bond_market_or_how_i/))

Long puts work too, but I recommend shorting since it is less a question of *if* and more of a question of *when* the stock tanks. Even bankruptcy is not out of the question as /u/cyphonismus explained in his DD.

There is a reason hedgies love it. 

**TL:DR** - short SEAS, use premium to buy more GME 🚀🚀🚀

Obligatory: This is not investment advice. I am not a financial advisor."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jesus this is crazier than I thought.

How insane would it be to use the short premium to buy puts?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,TD Ameritrade has total institutional ownership at 99.85%. I'm sure they don't mind letting others borrow their shares to short and then they buy up the float to fuck them. I could be wrong but still would prefer puts to be on the safe side.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you think I got into GME early?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not really. Yes, all the calls are ITM and the puts are OTM, but the volumes are low. This looks like the result of it trading at an unexpectedly high spot price, not being driven up by options. Or, if you mean short squeezed, definitely not as the borrow fee is 0.3%."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it at least easier to take care of water-dwelling mammals?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"That is your call. I personally would not mess with it unless I did serious DD, Charts, News etc. Personally not worth my time atm. u/fuzzyblankeet has some epic posts on company analysis. What he did for a living AFAIK. Want to go down a rabbit hole? Check out his WSB posts."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Alright. Im intrigued. It will force me to read this security analysis book (Fundemental analysis) book I have been letting collect dust while I chased FD's, dug myself into a big ass SPAC hole, and sold puts (to wheel) on NIO that fucking drilled through my strike like my wife's boyfriend on steroids (now I am rollin,, rollin,, keep the contracts rollin). Time to revisit that post, load up [sec.gov](https://sec.gov), [fintel.io](https://fintel.io), and learn me some fundamental analysis for great good by shorting the exploiters of willie.

With this said. The market is fucking retarded as you know. I would not put it past the market to keep this business afloat. All the kiddos wanting to see sea life. Still that business is (IMO) going the way of block buster.... BUT people said that about GME.

Good luck if you sell to buy and put on your 🌈🐻suit. Have an exit strat!

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Almost all of this advice plays into the rugged individualism of capitalism that is absolutely plaguing this planet.

What is the difference between anonymous philanthropy and sharing your wealth with your family? Personally I would find it unconscionable to turn my back on my loved ones in that way.

Also, doesn't the need for redistribution of wealth come out of those who currently hold the wealth acting unethically and hoarding instead of putting it to ethical uses? 

Again, I feel that your advice plays into all the worst tropes that we are raised on in capitalism that destroy everything they can. Based on transformation stories & anti wealth hording sentiment I've seen on this sub, I don't think these opinions are popular."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have a problem with this whole ""you can't tell anyone you're a millionaire"" thing. Alot of people say this, but why not? If the entire reason is because you're going to have to say no to them when they ask to borrow money, then say no!

How is that any different from currently? If my friend asked me to borrow 10k right now, I'd tell him no. What's the difference? Because they'll know I have more money? My financial situation is none of their business, and if it ruins a friendship then you should probably ask yourself were they really your friend to begin with if money put a wedge between you?

Now I get that there is a safety concern bundled into this, meaning if people know you're a millionaire then the word spreads, and soon someone will come to rob your ass. I get that, definitely. That's a valid reason to keep it a secret."

Imagine knowing there's a rocket that's available to take you away from a dying planet, and to a lush and happy and healthy place. You are one of the few who know that your planet is dying, and one of the few who know that the rocket exists. You are one of those brave enough to search for and find the rocket, and you're right there in front of it, but... *you can't afford a ticket*. You just have to stand there and watch as your once-in-a-lifetime chance blasts off into space without you, for no reason other than that you're too poor to get on it.

I've got 4 shares, currently, and while I'm happy to be able to get anything at all, a part of me is always going to be a little bit angry if this thing really rockets and I missed out on being a millionaire -- something far beyond my wildest dreams -- because I couldn't afford to lose more than a few hundred when the rocket was gassing up. There are apes here who can afford to post $20k in loss porn like it's nothing (sure it hurts, but they'll be okay), but $2k of loss is enough to absolutely, maybe permanently, break a person who lives in poverty.

How depressing it is, to be one of the people in the know about this, following this, constantly looking and being ""in on it""... only to be ""in"" with the bare minimum amount.

> There are apes here who can afford to post $20k in loss porn like it's nothing (sure it hurts, but they'll be okay), but $2k of loss is enough to absolutely, maybe permanently, break a person who lives in poverty.

Funny you mention that - I had to specifically check if I had written about it (I hadn't), but I actually hovered over a 2k loan application at one point. Yes, I admit I was being ridiculous. 

I then listened to my own reason, as admittedly a 2k loan and losing it would ruin easily a good few years. IF I would take such a risk, I guess I'd take a much bigger loan. That would ruin my life it went ass up though. So... best not to do it.

But hey, we gotta remember to respect ourselves for only being in with amounts we **can** lose, without risking actual livelyhood.

Though that's pretty much the reason why I'm down enough to even write such a post. Been feeling the pain of how much it sucks to be this poor and having a life situation you can't really change at the moment. Especially with the pandemic going on... 

I guess if it was only down to me, I might take a bit more of a risk, but currently basically being a caretaker for my old mother due to this pandemic and her having had a ""Transient Ischemic Attack"" seizure not too long ago. Gotta have some funds to help her out too.

If this truely skyrockets... I don't know if it would've been easier to not even know about it than knowing what kind of an opportunity flew by.

Just oddly (even to my complete surprise), in a few incidents where there's been a medical emergency related to another family member, I've stayed completely cool during it, while for example my sister who doesn't have any of the issues I have, freaks out and doesn't know what to do.

 It gets you to like the after WW2 times of living, where you can afford to be a 1 income family that owns a home and has a savings account.

 All I am saying is 1m minus the house and debt probably leaves the average family with 700,000 or less, maybe a young person who is single can make that work, but it isn't retirement money for most, and anyone who does retire on that amount is just 1 car accident away from bankruptcy."

GME is the only real risky gamble I've taken, but the short interest DD was legit. I also only hopped on board when it was clearly happening. This is pretty much all shares btw and theta.

I should say I've made some bad picks too. But the winners have been bigger than the losers.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty good post from Yahoo:

Here we are with 60mil shares available to trade and about 3x that trading. As much as wallst and SEC together tried to keep the lid on the synthetic shares. News is getting out. How could it not? Let's face a hard truth, do you think the stock would rise 1300% in a month if there wasn't possibility of an infinite squeeze?

The squeeze is called infinite and the short is called naked because synthetic shares were created between the shortsellers and the clearing house. This is a hard fact. The squeeze will continue until all those shares, estimated to be about 3x actual shares are covered at current at GME price. Given the magnitude of the problem, this puts the stock automatically around $800, thus the $800 options.

Will it happen? It will absolutely happen if retail and instutional holders don't sell their shares and why would they? They together hold more than the float, in fact, they hold 2x the float. Even if today all retail and instutions sold their shares, it still wouldn't cover the naked short. 

There is fraud here and the SEC will make sure those sythetic shares are covered by the hedges. Nobody will care about a few hedgefunds getting sacrified to avoid the problem from threatening systemic risk. I believe at this point everybody sees the reality, including shorts. With each dollar GME goes up, the problem grows to unmanagable sizes. Hold."

A bunch of people are saying “MONDAY TO THE MOON YEE” and shit because some people have the stimulus money pending to their accounts. A lot of the brokers take days to deposit new funds, that money WON’T enter gme until probably Wednesday at the earliest. Stop saying shit’s going down on Monday, kick back and chill the fuck out."

Chill out on the thoughts of Monday bringing big gains. The market is like a nice marinade that bakes in the oven so we have to be patient. We have to realize that just a little over 2 weeks ago it was trading at $44 ish a share to closing today at $267."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, one last one before heading out.  I've been wondering for a while now (probably a lot of guys have) about who this DFV guy is.  What's his background?  Financial super-genius?  Phd in Accounting?  Reincarnation of the guy who invented velcro?  So I did a little reading (probably could have just tuned in to his YouTube channel), just to clear things up.  Super-genius?  Nope.  But for sure a very smart guy.  Accounting wiz?  Nope. He had a job in life insurance (he did have his broker's license at one point) until, well, until just recently.  He's not a world-dominating, stock market mastermind.  He's a smart guy with decent instincts who swung for the fences on a 3/2 pitch in the bottom of the 9th with bases loaded.  He took a chance.

And he bombed it.

And what's he talking about doing with his new-found wealth? Lambos? Gold Rolexes?

“I always wanted to build an indoor track facility or a field house in Brockton (Massachusetts). “And now, it looks like I actually could do that.”

And that, friends, is a beautiful story.  Good night."

I trust DFV’s math, and if he could see somehow that the squeeze wouldn’t still happen, he doesn’t seem like the type of guy to fuck with thousands of internet strangers with mysterious signs. Not that he can foresee everything, and I’m not into the hero worship stuff, but I trust his math.

Like I'm a tiny player here but this is going towards health insurance and tattoos. And yeah, both of those are ""luxuries"" because I'm currently uninsured.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, this is definitely not the take where he improvised it. There is no way the shot would be framed like this if he was just supposed to walk out the door, and there is also a perfect camera focus shift from the newspaper to Jim's face when he turns around. If he did improvise that bit, he did it in a previous take and the director liked it so they did a new take."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Started playing 10 years ago. Haven't played in a while now. Probably the best game I've ever played when the game was its peak fun. Since then I think they've added too many blinks and dashes, reduced cool downs waaaaaaaayyyyyy too much, and made other balance changes that have made the game less interesting. S2-4 era League was unrivaled in terms of gameplay, community (sure there were toxics, but the engagement from Rito with us was amazing and stuff like Summoner's Showcase and Phreak dancing were amazing), and hype. From OGN with CLG winning the first World Championship (WCG) to TPA pulling off the upset in S2 to Faker becoming bonjwa, I can't think of a video game I had more fun with than League.

This video still gives me chills: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9H1Y1GI-EM"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice Lore. Okay game, but I dropped it because my sessions were always 50 to 75 minutes. Also stressful."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Well aslong as it gave you cancer. Oh I mean had alot of fun with it.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,My most favorite of these is the trailer for [DC Universe Online.](https://youtu.be/H7Nf-m6WGl4)
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bud, go watch the cinematic trailer and then watch LOL gameplay. Please don’t try to tel me it’s same hype."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,The game is actually really fun and addicting so be careful. I started 4 years ago and now I can't stop.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Only the same shit if you’re bad.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm pretty sure it's called cross fit
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Never play with pubs.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love lol, but RIOT games keeps forgetting shaco, my favorite champ, so every time I urge to buy a new shaco skin, I just buy stonks."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,😏
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Because the people who can tolerate it are the ones who keep playing after 10 years I guess?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,ARAM mode is pretty cool too. I only play ARAM.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t even play any more bro. 😂
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean there's nothing to ""tolerate"" because those things aren't an issue. Complaining about voice lines is like saying that CS:GO is a shit game because the gun sound effects are pretty much the same since release. It just makes no sense.

I also want to add that they *did* add new maps, but ended up removing them because literally no one played them."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but your hormones change - and when you get a wife and a home you'll lose the interest in lifting. We will see you back in gaming in 4-6 years . 😉
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah you'll be good. Take care of your body and it'll take care of you. I'm in my mid 30s and getting a bit creaky, but I didn't spend my 20s excersizing properly. 

Just be nice to your back. Proper form left lift with your legs and all that. 

I'm still not super into video games like I was in my teens. They are fun but I just have so much to do and see. I just don't have time to sit down and play for hours like I used to."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s the play for this coming week, probably will buy premarket Monday"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didn't read his post correctly. When he said he would ""sell puts"" I read that as selling put options, not selling the long puts he already owned. Hence why I inquire as to whether he owned the underlying shares."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you're just missing info on when exercising happens.  If it expires in the money, be it a call or put, many brokers will auto-exercise.  if you don't have the cash or stock to cover exercising, many brokers will auto-sell the option, saving themselves and you in the process.

Do not rely on your broker to save you.  Sell options before expiration if you can't afford to exercise."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Then change the market fundamentals to better suit us.  Lol.

Not trying to be a negative ass but we've have zero examples of HFs getting more than a slap on the wrist and a million dollar fine."

Gamestop was a meme then also, but a different one."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think people giving the 300$ number are assuming a fair market value for gamestop is the same P/E ratio over 'just' it's online revenue as what $CHWY trades at. (basically valuing the company as 'online only'). 

maybe OP has a different reason, but that was the reason I saw the other day when someone floated a 300$ish figure."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’d love to see a green candle up his ass, but then again he might enjoy that"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup. Short selling is actually a force for good when naked shorting is limited. 

In the 80s, short sellers were traditionally activist investors who frequently were on the front line of catching company fraud. They’d investigate financials way before the SEC would and back up their bet by shorting.

Shorting isn’t bad - fraudulently shorting is."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol i'm honestly curious to see if the majority of 'apes' ever catch on to this fact, or just simply shrug it off as a oh well, i yolo'd and i lost but i was fun to be a part of something 'cool'."

 I think there may come a time when what ever remaining B and M showrooms that survive the digital age will end up having to charge a show fee or end up being bought out by Amazon if people continue to do this, but most of those types of places do price match these days to remain competive, so maybe they have it figured out."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I also make sure if I go to a store to look at the product I buy from that store, it cost me a bit a few times because I missed a deal or something but I think it is more than fair if you are taking the time to show me a physical product I will buy from you. Now as you said, with price matching I get the best deal if I know about a cheaper price."

Humans are fickle creatures and this could have more of an impact than we think on downloaded vs physical games.

I can agree that the depictions of Chinese people in some of those books definitely isn't offensive, but you can't pretend that there was nothing in there that was bad. Seuss himself didn't like what he drew of the Japanese, hence why he did the Lorax as part of an apology. His estate merely made a decision that aligned with his own views on his work. So I want you to explain to me how that's cancellation because I'm still waiting."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've seen his WW2 art and I've seen his books, I appreciate all his work and I don't owe you a fucking explanation. I can decide on my own what I am allowed to enjoy. YOU have no right to force YOUR shitty, emotionally underdeveloped, ignorant opinions on ME. The sense of entitlement and privilege from you people is fucking disgusting.

And yes I would say ""cancellation"" is the wrong word. This is not a new ideology you are espousing nor are these new tactics. Civilization has been around long enough that these are not new things pretty much everything has been done before by someone else at some point. The correct term for what you people are doing is ""struggle session."""

10:32 Mountain time, Someone bought 650k shares.

10:33 Mountain time, someone bought an additional 1.4 million shares.

Then this:

After spiking to 28 points in January, BB became hard to borrow (HTB) on TD Ameritrade (TDA). This occurs when there are few shares to loan out and causes daily margin rates to increase. Noticed this morning that BB finally became easy to borrow (ETB). This ties in to the upward price movement in two ways. 1) Shorts have closed. 2) Improved Margin.

Why have a family pay 14$ at home when you can force them to pay 60$ at a movie theater.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Releasing just to streaming is a massive cost cut. You up charge the films, as it's expected people with have friends over to premier it, everyone splits the movie bill to save on their end. 

You save on labor hours from staffing, cleaning, maintenance, etc, potentially save on not needing a brick and mortar, and without screen times, if someone wants to watch the latest hit at 5am they can chuck 30 bucks at their screen and check it out. 

On the question if Hollywood can make 2.5b, Netflix made around 540m last year on their schedule of reruns and people scrolling the front page. Big hit movies can draw that in easy, or like some films rely on in film advertising."

You're gonna sit here and tell me Gamestop a completely dead business is worth 18 billion but the largest theater outlet in America is worth 3.3 billion? I think you all forgot this past year what its like to go to the movies. 

If you think the next avengers movie is gonna be able to profit 2.5 billion dollars worldwide again from people at home buying 10$ streaming 2 day rentals. You've lost your mind. If this goes through, that means Hollywood's profits will cut in half, because instead of a 5 person family paying 70$ to buy tickets and go to the movies, they will just pay 14$ to watch it at home. Hollywood will be crushed by this lack of profits, and they will realize this and you'll see no big movies coming out on streaming apps till 6 months after release."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Amc made 30% average of each ticket. I still think amc is gonna blow up on the short term anyway.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You make it sound like Tesla and Canoo are competing in the same market. They’re not. Canoo is making everything that Tesla isn’t: a compact pickup truck, consumer minibus/robotaxi and commercial cargo van.

All of Canoo’s models share a single skateboard allowing them to drive the costs down. Their MPDV starts at $33k, making it cheaper than any cargo van, gas or electric. This is before a federal tax credit which brings it down to $26k. While Tesla has driven their costs down, they no longer qualify for the federal tax credit. Meaning buyers are willing to spend more for a non-Tesla vehicle, than a Tesla.

Since all Canoo models share the same skateboard that has completed crash testing, they can rapidly develop models on top of it. Should the market demand a cross-over, they can rapidly develop it if neeed.

As far as the Canoo’s skateboard limiting the design of a car, that is far from the truth. Since the skateboard is the flattest in the industry, it offers the greatest flexibility in design. There are no protruding strut towers, the HVAC is built into the skateboard allowing greater interior volume, it has steer-by-wire so no steering column and rack would get in the way, and so on.

I also like Tesla. But you make it sound like it’s the end all, be all, of the auto industry. I’ve reserved a tri-motor Cybertruck with FSD, but I fear this $80K truck will have the build quality of a 1990s KIA. Tesla consistently ranks low, if not the lowest, among its peers, for build quality. On that note, should Ford, GM, VW and etc kill their EV platforms? Of course not.

As far as investments go, who do you think will triple first? Tesla from $700b to $2T+, passing Apple and Amazon, making it the world's most valuable company? Or would it be Canoo from $3b to $9b, making it a fraction of its nearest competitor, Lucid at $65b?"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is what I’ve been saying just think if they buy ZNGA (actively looking to get bought) makes games sell games 🚀🚀🚀GameStop
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The developers do not need to give GameStop anything nor do they need twitch or any Amazon products to succeed. Although they could partner with them at some point, who knows. Imagine if they created a respected competitive arena to play in?Given the fact that they’ve already set up competitive stations in their Dallas location. They’re just getting started. I have a feeling with Cohens competence they could potentially dominate the esports arenas."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,If you’re talking to the older generation they most likely won’t agree here. Sadly they don’t understand the amount of training one does to become an actual pro or semi pro at gaming.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"No disrespect intended here but you truly have no idea what you’re talking about. If you think these pro’s are pro’s because they picked up a controller and just happen to be awesome at the game you’re really misinformed. These pro-players put in some massive time to become the best at their game. It takes time, training, and dedication just like anything else in this world."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You do realize how much since then gaming has changed right? I’ll just touch on one of your last points because there are many imo that seem to be a bit outdated. The point you made about GameStop trying and failing at hosting a fortnite tournament. At the time they tried you’re right there were many more of players that played it on PC. Currently there are reputable console and tablet tournaments as well. In fact I believe tablet tournaments are more popular now then they’ve ever been. A few years back Tencent held a Dubai pubg competition for 1.2 mill on devices only. So there is plenty of growing Cohen can bring to the table to make this company successful.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy shit! Total lady boner here.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol i knew this would be the place to trigger someone with my comment. I understand. Ill admit i might not know the full extent of their 'game training regiment'  But then i guess you'll have to admit neither do you when it comes to actual athletes physically training either. 

I never said they dont train or put in dedicated work. But so do musicians. Are musicians athletes too? They train for hours. They have to master and control their breathing. Their finger dexterity and muscle memory has to be sophisticatedly synchronized. They require stamina and endurance. But just because you train, it doesnt make you a physical athlete. And skill doesnt necessarily equate to physical abilities either. 

Traditional athletes actually do physical work for their said sport because their sport requires it. There's a reason high school football players cant jump to the league because its literally illegal and they would die. There's kinetic energy required from your whole body and theyre too young to physically match up to actual men. 

Ill just go out on a limb and say professional gamers exercise the same way a normal person would exercise to stay fit and healthy with added drills focused on reflex and reaction times as well as hand exercises. But again, gamers are training for an e'sport' that only requires them to sit and focus. Thats not my definition of a sport. 

And if thats the case, racecar drivers, who go through much tougher training regiments for practice and actual races, are much more athletes then gamers. Their demands are pretty damn similar, but do gamers lose 5-10 lbs during sessions like drivers do from physical conditions alone?

How much physical stress are gamers going through? Or can they just sit up, stretch, take a swig from an energy drink or a bite of whatever snack they have handy while sitting in a comfy ass gaming chair in a cool a/c controlled gaming room/arena? 

I look at traditional athletes as those who must train their body to be physically capable and adequate to perform a skill at a high level against other traditional athletes. This doesnt translate to gaming. I could be 50 y/o and slap anybody in Mario Kart so long as my fingers work. Or i could be a teenager and spank everybody in the rocket league. You dont see this in a traditional sport that is physically demanding. Except maybe golf and soccer. But that would be a tangent. 

You assume just because i say egamers are not athletes that i imply they dont train. But you know what? Ppl train or practice with guns, musical instruments, chess, eating, math.. Does that mean they are athletes? Sorry but to me it doesnt. Why are you so worried about gamers being called athletes when they can just be their own thing? True athletes can be gamers sure. But i also dont think true gamers care to be athletes meaning playing actual sports. I see this with kids growing more interest with video games and watching streamers online. But thats also me painting with a broad brush"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,UNDERRATED COMMENT
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Not everyone is a Korean kid prodigy though. 😂 The actual pro’s that are being paid to play and win are on strict schedules. You should at least try to research what you’re talking about given the fact that u have such strong opinions about it.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Universities are providing scholarships for esports athletes. 

These athletes do have a strict cardio and diet protocols that are followed. 


There is a lot of other information within Professor Ingo Forböse study that contradicts much of what you believe to be true. 

Esports Athletes have heart rates that are approx. 
140 - 180 bpm (similar to a runner)

The amount of cortisol produced is about the same level of a race car driver 

The esports athletes that play competitively and pare sponsored do have to partake in exercise and body conditioning. 

You didn’t trigger me. Yes, is somewhat annoying to me that someone who has not ever been in the esports competitive arena can have such a strong opinion on something they haven’t taken the time to get to know much about. However, it’s a normal reaction that you and people like you who haven’t been in the pro arena would think what you do. 

I’ve seen what these semi pro and pro players go through to become the best in their field. They work just as hard as any professional athlete to be the best they can be. 

Sadly esports has always had this stigma tied to it. If you were to take the time and research what an actual esports professional goes through to be the best your view on it may change."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here's my one question about options: 

What's the logic behind the trades that make autists into millionaires? Like I get the concept. Yolo a ton of money, the stock goes in the right direction, and you sell for a massive profit. 

But are those all FDs? Far dated far OTM? Far dated slightly OTM? 

I guess what I'm asking is, what's the most optimal way to Yolo?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"The YOLO is in the eye of the beholder! No easy way to land on the winners, which is why we’re all here and not on a beach somewhere on our mega yachts. Lot of contracts ATM, far DTE and that the market doesn’t expect to have any major movement would prob be the winningest combination. Best combination of delta, gamma and theta. If the stock goes gangbusters, IV will increase the price of the option as well (that’s why it’s not always smart to chase rockets with options). Then knowing when to sell... not as easy an answer as “at the top”. A lot of times you sell (or hold) while looking longingly at the top that’s now far behind you."

We have an inventory issue in our area though, so while purchases aren't coming in as fast as they could be, the mark ups are insane.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did not buy most over $300. I first bought in at $400 and didn't even buy a full share. That was just to be part of something.

Then I read up on it and realised what's going on. I don't care if I lose what I've put in but I don't see that happening. Can't see this going lower than $40 long term so I'll be fine.

Personally I'd be more pissed off at giving away my chance for a lot of money than losing a little. I hope you sell at $300 you pussy because I think you'll regret that.

The point you were making was not ""do what you want with your money"" because you only suggested selling. You did not suggest buying more or holding. On top of that you suggested selling for what many think is a very low figure."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re a fucking retard and a follower. I guarantee you have no more than 100 shares because you’re a broke bitch so your chance at a lot of money isn’t there. Have fun being broke and staying broke.

You also like to make a lot of judgements based on nothing.

I have a job. No mortgage on my apartment. Don't need medical insurance since I live in the UK. I'm fine and definitely not broke.

Who cares how many shares I have. It depends when you sell them. By the sounds of things you've overstretched yourself and put more money in than you can afford to lose cause you wanted to brag about your shares 🤣

You are scared money and a pussy paper handed bitch."

but, thanks OP!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,oh man thank god cuz i bought 100c yesterday and it dipped even more today lmao
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice sounds like a good plan. 

I managed to get a good amount of 2022’s today at value. I’m not hedging mine unless politics becomes an issue honestly. 

I did write some April 16th 85 strike puts today though, which I only hedged with March 18th 70 strikes. Hoping to leave them naked by the end of next week, not quite ready to do it yet though. 

What else you got leaps on?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just so everyone is clear:


Starting with $5000, it would take 27 days, 
$5000e^(.20*27)= $1,107,032 

Starting with $10,000, it would take 23 days, 
$10000e^(.20*23)= $994,843

Starting with $50,000, it would take 15 days, 
$50,000e^(.20*15)= $1,000,276

So are you going to do it in a month? Probably not. You’d need to diversify and still manage 20% a day. But you can definitely do it, especially if you have a decent amount of equity to begin with."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Got some 2022-2023 leaps on BABA as well, also currently running the wheel on BIDU and NIO. Last few weeks were pretty rough but I'm pretty optimistic in the long run. JD has tended to trade in this $80-$100 range the past few months so I'm hoping to lower my cost basis with some calendar and diagonal spreads, along with some PMCC's."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"He swapped to the straddle after realizing he was being a dumbass saying just OTM. He’s never bought a spread in his life though, I can tell. 

The spreads are definitely something you can look into though, he’s correct in some ways. If you want to bet on stocks that have already seen a lot of growth, and trade at extreme PE ratios you should be hedging. I don’t recommend them here, but I do use spreads fairly consistently. The reasoning for this is not everyone is allowed to write contracts, spreads are ultimately much more complicated, and most people aren’t even interested.

The positions that I recommend are positions that unless there is major news such as a pandemic, or maybe a scandal involving the specific company, (Think Enron) I know they’ll raise above their current stock position before the expiration date based on their fair value, revenue, growth, and institutional purchase points. Then by removing decay using ITM calls opens the ability to hold and ensure the calls break even. 

It’s why I don’t post positions here on stocks at their ATH, (with the exception of ON) and typically stick to value positions for what I post here. These stock picks essentially hedge themselves. Stocks can only fall so far based on their underlying fundamentals. Only thing that brings them past that point is extremely bad news."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seems like you’re a big fan of Chinese companies hahah, though I don’t blame you. 

I like NIO too, but haven’t traded or looked much at BIDU, I know that’s an expensive wheel though so atta-boy. 

Baba just keeps getting hit while it’s down, honestly think I might do the same and buy some leaps."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"When you talk about investing the same amount of equity in the positions, the increased loss from OTM positions come from holding more contracts on a speculative position. Since the value of the option is cheaper, you don’t need much delta to drastically reduce the premium on the position from a percentage basis. 

You could have a 0.3 delta, but if the contract is worth $100 you’re going to lose 30% on a one point drop. 

You would lose 100% of your money on a 30% drop on the underlying stock with OTM positions. Theta is the daily decay of an options speculative value, you still lose value on OTM positions equal to delta during a slide. So not sure where you’re going with that, but it’s incorrect. 

The idea is to enter the position when it’s on a down slide, and buy ITM calls below the companies fair value. Companies that make tons of money like JD, or for example a previous position of mine UNH, can quite literally only fall so far. 

By understanding a companies baseline value and taking into account the typically PE ratios in the sector, you can establish accurate price floors, and the fair value will essentially hedge the position for you. It’s why value based companies shrug off market corrections."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is not financial advice and is for entertainment purposes only. I am not a financial advisor.             

Sorry, just got done posting. Personally, my hedged plays change intraday and based on options pricing, Greeks, and expected volatility ahead of earnings. I like the the $125p 4/23, $130c 4/23 for a total cost of $2.60. The JD $84C and $84p 4/23 for a total of $8.90, and plays similar to this that have a high delta % payout while allowing you to stay hedged. A 5% move thanks to volatility in the stock means you are 100% itm and selling one leg of the option is profitable and you now get a free play going the other way. I already did this same play to success a month ago before the drop to $120ish and was able to cash out on the put and reroll into cheaper calls and puts that were tighter after 2 days of waiting(dont ever buy options after an IV spike as that is a losing trade 9/10 imo). My play on PG is based on the ceo expected 30% growth in sales next quarter(stock was at $140 at the time), and I expected a major drop because I was bearish on the stock. I was able to find a hedge that paid out over 100% of total cost as soon as the contract went deep itm but within my expectations. As earnings is before the expiration date, I expected some volatility moving in one way or the other."

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Doesn’t the government already control you guys? They pay for something like 40% of farmers total net income through subsidies.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m gonna say this with some assumptions in mind:
1.	You set high expectations for yourself
2.	In the past, you had the expectation to get into residency and proceed with medicine along with your peers
3.	You didn’t meet the expectations, which has taken a toll on your mental

With these assumptions in mind, I think that what I would say with regards to forgiving yourself is to not be so hard on yourself for not meeting expectations - past and present expectations alike. I know it is shit that you were pushed back a few years despite putting in the hard work. However, I think that your expectation that you should have made it sooner is really dragging you down. 

Something I’ve heard rather frequently lately is that expectations are the key to self resentment. By putting expectations on yourself, you anticipate that things will go your way - but sometimes they don’t, even though you worked your ass off for it. And after hitting wall after wall after wall, you eventually become bitter because you failed to meet those expectations. 

I think what I’m trying to get at is that you have to forgive yourself for not meeting that expectation. It’s ok to be set back. You’re still a surgeon now. What’s a few years of practicing surgery gonna change, you do that every day and probably will be doing that for decades to come! Life is too short to bear grudges over that which we can’t control. 

We cannot control the outcomes, but we can control our efforts. Be proud of the effort you put in, and set aside your expectations. I know that this is huge in surgery. If you had the expectation that 100% of your surgeries would finish with no complications, you’d probably hate yourself. You simply cannot control the outcome of every surgery - you can only control how much effort you put in. 

I’m not sure if this made sense. I think the last paragraph is the good one. But if this resonated with you, I’d encourage you to check out the podcast “The Happiness Lab” by Dr. Laurie Santos. It’s based off her class on how to be happy (can be accessed for free on Coursera). I think the episode that resonated with me the most is season 2 episode 14, has to do with Buddha. I’m not religious but I felt that the philosophy was great, and it introduced me to the expectation thing. Maybe also HealthyGamerGG on YouTube, I think he talks about expectations."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m gonna be honest, I related well to EpiStat because I’m in the health field. I won’t have as good of a response for you, unfortunately. However, I think that some more info would be important - like what are the issues with your wife, and if you think the marriage is repairable. If you think it’s worth a shot, I’d suggest marriage counseling. A lot of couples have difficulties due to differences in their “love language”, and this causes communication errors. To my understanding, marriage counseling can help address this. But, if 1 party doesn’t want to work on the relationship, it’ll fall flat. 

I appreciate that you’re putting up with your wife for your children’s sake, and I know they appreciate it too. I’m not sure how old your youngest is, but maybe consider once they hit an age where they understand things, to talk things out with the kids.. and then potentially, consider the divorce :/ it’s a really shitty situation, but you need to look out for yourself at some point. 

Also, it sounds like you’re going through a tough time. I think personal therapy/counseling would be beneficial. It might take a while to reap benefits (gotta get comfy with the counselor) but having a counselor that you mesh well with is incredible. Also, exercise. Just a 10 minute walk every day :) 

I’m sorry if these suggestions are kinda shitty, I don’t have any experience with this sorta thing. I will say that it sounds like you raised your 13 year old well, she sounds emotionally intelligent :) I wish you the best"

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, i personally don’t have a very high opinion of Burry even as I recognize his ability to find value.  I recall reading that about Burry having trouble recalling shares, though, and the Hestia/Permit proxy fight and the partial share recall that caused a mini squeeze—even when literally no one was paying attention to GME. 

Think there are many, many millions more shares here than there should be. Like an astronomical number more than there should be. And the float is essentially well locked up now.  The churn is more fuckery from the liquidity that’s created from all these synthetic shares. 

Basically, the way I see it is that shorts tried to shoot the moon and kill GME last spring to avoid paying taxes and MMs wrote a fuck-ton of naked calls too—not thinking this shit was ever gonna reverse on them. Dead men tell no tales and all that. And they woulda gotten away with it too if it wasn’t for RC and those meddling kids!  But now they’re all in too deep and digging a deeper grave there each day.  So GME is trading in a house of mirrors because of it and it will stay that way until we get some legit accountability of all the shares outstanding here. 

In sum: Time for some turbolax. 

And I agree that RC sees this too.  Then he can turn this thing into the tech first juggernaut we all know he’s gonna create."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao time for Turbolax!

Totally agree Cohen sees this too. I think he smartly laid low heading into the first hearing. 

Given neither hedge funds, politicians nor regulators made any changes as a result... he decided to resume the march. 

The fact he hasn’t stepped off the gas pedal one iota, even in the $260s, tells me he knows what’s up. 

I don’t think he wants to disappoint out of the gate (earnings etc.)

A) fast delivery is not an advantage but a must in Korea. B) only retail and thats barely profitable until volume. C) no cloud service. It was fine for amazon because the internet wasn’t around yet and they need alternate revenues. D) overseas growth is impossible such as the States. Offices mean nothing to the business. Infrastructure? Warehouses? All bought by other industries and way too much land to cover. The network they have in Korean is special to their population density."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Easy meddling by the government? This ain't Park Chung Hee's 1980s Korea dude. CPNG actually benefitted heavily from the South Korea's transportation and digital infrastructure.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Fast delivery is a must"" -- Absolutely, but  CPNG also has the highest customer satisfaction rating out of all the e-commerce platforms. It is the most dominant.

""Only retail"" -- they have food/beverage delivery and are setting up a streaming service too. Also, S Korea is projected to be the third largest e-commerce market by 2023. There's still room for tremendous growth in Korea alone, but they are expanding worldwide. Contrary to the lies many tell for whatever reason (including Business Insider), the CEO himself said he plans to expand to new regions in the near future.

""Overseas is impossible \[especially in the United States\]""--I don't know if you ever lived in the US, but some of the biggest grocery chains in our country are actually Korean (H-mart, Zion Market).  Also, there are Koreatowns in every major US city. Setting up an E-commerce presence from an allied nation like South Korea is not a stretch by any means."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay being bullish on CPNG is just a difference in opinion but denying easy meddling is peak autism.

Literally why CPNG decided to list on an American exchange is so major shareholders like Sohn and company management can avoid stricter Korean regulations on major shareholder management rights."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Highest customer satisfaction means nothing if they dont have a good conversion rate and changes is hard enough as it is. They won’t be stealing from Amazon any time soon in western countries. Labor laws are different. What makes CPNG labor better? Dawn delivery? Graveyard shift. 

Retail is their main source so far. It’s hard to even count their other services. Can they beat Netflix? No one wants ANOTHER streaming service in America. Do they have any exclusives? Hard to say they will be the next Disney+ who have made it out the Netflix dominion. 

Don’t doubt S Korea will be a large market but penetrating a saturated market is hard. This isn’t a innovative industry and its becoming mature. First Mover advantage really is important because it’s not like Walmart doesnt exist. The logistics that they tout in S Korea will need to be created too and thatll be a major issue in its own. Amazon would have done it already if they could or found it profitable. 

I live in the Silicon Valley. Hmart is great (once again into korean cooking) but it’s not like a Lucky’s, trader joes, safeway or wholefoods, or even a local Asian market with korean goods. Local cultures matter and the korean footprint is still small. I dont expect mass adoption of korean cooking ever in the states. So many other cultures to rotate around. Same for any other country.

I dont doubt that CPNG can become a ecommerce presence but i don’t think that theyll grow as big as Amazon, Netflix or Food delivery. There is a limit to their growth due to the competition and their current valuation is based off potential BASED off of the current industry leaders. This isn’t Tesla or Amazon where EVERY OUTLET denounced but CPNG is coming after. This isn’t like Samsung after Apple because their isn’t Android for a cheap OS. Local dominion. I’ll give them that. Overseas? Maybe in large cities, if they can build the infrastructure. Competition includes, doordash, ubereats, postmates, target, bestbuy, walmart, and many others. This doesnt include supply chain issues. 

The recent CNBC interview did not provide a estimated time for the first year of profits. He dodge the question at least twice to mention investors who believe.

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"But what if the baby end up with different skin color than the OP, wife and bf?  2nd bf? ...... or come out furry?"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is there a class to take the series 7? You read the book for like 8hrs and take the test.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,said\*

03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope this does better than your qqq calls
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re a damn sheep, lost out on 30% more profit. I never said to sell and quit it. You buy back in lower and keep stonking the whole time, but have fun with your 50 dollars in profit lol"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the dumbest shit I've ever seen. And I browse this sub a lot
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,RIP in peace
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,OP may be the smoothest of all the smooth brains.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,F
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This did not age well
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,RIP
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Give this man more awards so he doesn’t turn into an hero.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,guh
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Oof
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Is there an update on this? >>
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,guh
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Rip
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ooohwee! 😬
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,shit
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only one thing to do now, double down"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You won
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ahem. SooooooOOOOOO?  What’s goin on boys?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,well?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I own MSOS too. The attraction to me for MindMed and Compass is that they are apparently getting a lot of psychedelic related, pharma patents. These are my main, what I consider, moonshot stocks."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Too soon to tell what happens with that cannabis is way safer,"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Like if it’s halts at 200$ and is up. It doesn’t just open back up at 200$ it could potential resume at 210$. That would be a 10$ gap
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You buy contract (100 shares) at strike price of 600/share. Ask price in the scenario was 850/share. (Ask - strike) * 100 = profits , in other words (850 - 600) * 100 = 25,000"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Equities generally have intrinsic value based on a multi-dimensional aspects, fundamentals, sentiment, market potential etc. A stocks price usually reflects this through natural market demand. I think shorting is likened to kicking someone when they're down, price gauging during a disaster, etc. It's somewhat debatable, but there is also hearsay that heavy short positions are followed by coordinated public attacks (media, market access, etc.) to ensure profitable outcomes to those who have shorted the stock. Again, none of this is my advice. I recommend you do more research on derivatives and market principles."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey your Optiok expired worthless?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ohhhhh ok yeah I’m thinking more on the lines of premiums and break evens, I’m overthinking it lol. I’m retarded."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly I wasn't suggesting it was going to happen - just speculating on the feasibility. I actually did get genuinely curious about this the more I thought about it and did some research, as settling on only the close auction seems rather open to market manipulation. It turns out the definition of settlement price differs between exchanges and contracts. Some exchanges use closing auction price, some use an average of open and close auction, and some use trade-weighted averages from throughout the day. It sounds like it is actually feasible for two investors to hold the ""same"" option contract, but obtained from different exchanges or brokers, and to end up getting a different payout because of differing definitions of the settlement price."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, thank you very much for your time. I appreciate it!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes sir. No tendies for me this weekend, Ramen it is!!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah pretty much. but what I meant was buying a single call in the 3-400 range with a long expiry. then sell weekly 800c FDs to collect premium, where your low strike call acts as a protection in the case of an explosion in the stock price. even if the 800 ends itm, you will still have made the difference between the two strike prices. 


then he can keep on selling 800 weeklys to collect premium with no real risk, since the long expiry call is just lying there to defend. 

you can argue that this is bullish, the 800c weeklys are just a sprinkle of realism, hehe. 

haven't checked the prices for options lately though, but I guess there is a hefty IV these days which should make the sells slightly more juicy. even so it's a pretty limited upside play"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,I too am retarded. I say this all with confidence even though I learned about it four days ago lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure thing, good luck out there"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, Better luck next time :D"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bahahaha, yeah I never keep options to expiration tbh, I always plan on making money on the premiums, so premiums are the first thing my brain started thinking of, like how could he know that lmao."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeppers, we're going back to the cages next week. Im just waiting for that home run to tendie park!"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Especially since it started at 120% and they have only increased their position since.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hosted for 5 years and just got out. The $$ is good vs being a landlord but the work involved in offering a high level of service is too much for the support that they give when things go sideways. Back when traveling was a thing I would split between Airbnb and hotels as my Airbnb experiences was VERY mixed and sometimes I just want to roll up to a hotel and know that everything is going to work and be clean and easy and ready to go.

I had a chance to get in pre IPO and just couldn’t muster the will. Hosts can get burned out, which leads to turnover, which perpetuates inconsistency. Airbnb pushes hosts to use their tools that make it easier to book, a good thing for guests, but these same tools lead to more bad guests: parties, drug dealers, meth weekends, etc.

Those bad guests further burn out hosts as Airbnb does nothing to ban the guest or support the host. These guests also take a social toll on the neighborhood and the host’s place in it. So much so that municipalities are instituting more and more regulation and taxation, cutting into the incentive to host.

My city hosted a Super Bowl in the last few years and took a very accommodating approach to Airbnb vs the neighboring city which essentially shut it down. Now my city has just announced a new batch of requirements. People don’t like living next to Airbnbs and I don’t blame them. 

Airbnb will probably continue to grow, maybe even aggressively, but there are notable headwinds coming from a few different directions. The requirements of guests do not align with the needs of non professional hosts. The cool feeling of staying in a neighborhood does not align with the vibe of the neighborhood itself. It’s like when my city banned smoking in the club. I didn’t smoke and didn’t like that going there made my clothes stink, but banning that shit ruined the vibe. A bunch of people wanting to experience some authentic shit but then complaining about and legislating away the parts they don’t like fuck up the experience. Airbnb has to deal with that same dynamic on like 2 or 3 different levels, otherwise they’re just going to plateau."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,They hated him because he told them the truth
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You think this thing is done
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure, we might get one more random spike for no reason, but if I had to take a position it would be short"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Same
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,i reject your reality and substitute my own!
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,😂😂😂😂😂
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,But this rocket is leaving next week. No way he won't have the cash in hand to pay that back before the next bill cycle.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,You brilliant son of a bitch.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Awesome - great work, love the lyrics"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"It comes with an aggressive expansion strategy though, think about how long Tesla bled cash for"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree, I think Elon helped keep in afloat while it bled though. Don't know if the Chinese variants will have the same success, but thats why its a bet"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Noice.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s exactly where I got it from
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think the government knows because they won’t direct deposit my money, they mailed me a letter and told me there’s mail me my tax returns in 3-4 weeks by check because they didn’t want me to gamble it on GameStop. So no I have to wait an extra 3-4 weeks to buy more."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Woah, really? That’s crazy"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s sweet if that’s what you did with your windfall
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"This one guy, yeah. But the majority of us have <10k, and are losing money. Maybe 1-2% are winning big, but it might seem more because small gains/loses don't get much upvotes. 

And when I lost $7-8k (pic on my profile) that's pretty much all I had in my brokerage and bank account. Thankfully I'm now up $5-6k all time, but WSB is more retarded than rich. 

DFV made 50M, but his initial $50k was pretty much all the savings he's been accumulating over time. If GME went tits up then he'd be broke."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Personally I just feel like if you are yoloing mid to high 5 figures you got to be loaded. Or maybe I just have to much faith in people lol
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a gambling forum (WS BETS) with a lot of people who have gambling issues. Including  college kids who take out 5 figure loans on weekly options. Quite nice isn't it?
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yikes...just wait for the market to tank again. Eventually it's gotta go down hard again - THAT is the time to buy BIG.  Trading during a bull market is a lot of fun, you almost always will come out ahead but waiting for the entire economy to go on sale is a real slick move hedge funds always take advantage of. Time to play their game but better ; )"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Hola
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice one thanks dude
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Otayyy
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are being pretty blase about the high likelyhood of you broker buying the 100 shares at the strike price and putting your account massively in the negative.  And possibly liquidating your other positions to help cover.  There's a reason there's horror stories from this.  There can be serious consequences to letting an option be exercised.

"" so what happens is your broker will automatically reimburse you for market value x100 of the stock. ""

This doesn't always happen."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,Also worth noting that Fidelity straight up told me they will buy the shares on your behalf and put you deep into the red until you add additional funds to cover...  They said they try to avoid that happening lol.  But it still happens.  Hell they try really hard on the phone to get you to not turn off auto-exercising to prevent that from happening.
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, and the fact that the official numbers that drove the spike in January, all of a sudden are not to be trusted once it doesn’t fit the narrative is a bit sus. The confirmation bias is strong in this sub. You’re being downvoted for calling out numbers pulled out of thin air 👀"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"I disagree as they tried to pass legalization in December. Also, they only have two years to pass it, in mid terms the dems will lose control and have no chance at that policy. There is too much money for them not to do it ASAP (funded by wall street)"
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"Further more their app is vulnerable to user manipulation. Internet connection speed, battery life, and storage capacity can all affect outcomes of cash gameplay. Not good for a gaming app. I think you were wise to buy puts."
03/13/2021,wallstreetbets,"All great points!

I dream about what happens if the Apple Review team decides to remove all their app because their monetization model cuts Apple completely out of the loop.

Ya know, what got Fortnite removed from the App Store."
