2021-05-05 19:48:09,stocks,How will inflation make debt repayment easier?
2021-05-05 19:58:51,stocks,"Won’t all stocks & currency be devalued? Their debt would be less of a burden but their profits are also less of a gain. Maybe  taking on extra debt just before an inflation spike would be the move. 
This is not financial advice, it’s spitballing."
2021-05-05 19:55:52,stocks,"You’ve got this backwards. Look up the definition for “monetary policy”. As inflation starts to increase, central banks will start to raise interest rates to cool off the economy. This will cause interest expense to increase and debt servicing will deteriorate. You wouldn’t want to be exposed to a company that has excess leverage (too much debt) when interest rates start to rise."
2021-05-05 19:51:27,stocks,because profit will increase in dollar value as companies charge more due to inflation and debt will become relatively less as the dollar depreciates
2021-05-05 19:58:50,stocks,"Also inflation doesn’t happen in a vacuum. There are causes to inflation; demand-pull or cost-push. Just because prices are increasing doesn’t mean that profitability is increasing. Prices may be increasing because the costs of production are increasing as well (labour, raw materials, etc.). Again this would hurt debt servicing (ability to make debt payments)."

2021-05-05 18:42:59,stocks,How much did you lose?
2021-05-05 18:50:12,stocks,So what do you do that works 80% of the time? I like technical analysis but if you have something that works for you 80% that is not TA please share that instead of your rant.
2021-05-05 19:35:51,stocks,I think the issue is people are criticizing technical indicators and charts in a vacuum rather than reality. The reality is people with far more money than you can ever imagine seeing much less having(MMs and algos) all use the indicators to some extent and will therefore give weight and accuracy to them in a self fulfilling prophecy.
2021-05-05 19:33:46,stocks,You got exposed and now you’re upset. It’ll be okay. Relax.
2021-05-05 18:36:11,stocks,"Technical analysis is like astrology, if enough people believe in it it can help move the market"
2021-05-05 18:37:03,stocks,I want someone to definitively show me that it works 80% of the time. Then I would be a believer
2021-05-05 18:50:35,stocks,"Regardless of what you think of TA, GME is a unique situation and no TA can predict what will happen. Any TA for GEM is useless. It will not behave to any perceived logic.  We are dealing with very greedy people and will do anything to protect themselves. Desperate people do desperate things. 

All we can do is buy and hold.  This is no longer about the squeeze. GME is becoming a viable company that is growing stronger every day. Even their credit rating has improved.

2021-05-05 19:17:23,stocks,"Technicals provide you with context and trends, but trends can always ne broken. They are indicators, nothing more. I find MACD and Stoch RSI useful, and multiple indicators agreeing is even better, but at the end of the day, there will always be an element of intuition or conviction. The markets are as chaotic as the weather is. The sooner people accept that the better."
2021-05-05 18:41:57,stocks,That’s not like astrology at all. Astrology will never be true no matter how many people believe it.
2021-05-05 19:30:29,stocks,"The problem with you and OP is that you don’t actually understand technical analysis. Nobody would ever advise you make a trade solely off of a single indicator, that’s ridiculous. They are simply visual tools to view data, that’s it... Again, nobody who legitimately understands TA is advising or even suggesting that TA predicts the future."

2021-05-05 19:04:36,stocks,"> 
I've been on record multiple times saying how much of a red flag it is that the CEO only talks about growing market share. You can grow market share all you want but if your market shrinks 30-40% YoY (like the mortgage market would if it regresses to the average annual market size), your stock price isn't going anywhere.

First off, it's brazenly false that ""all the CEO talks about is market share"".  

But that aside, gobbling up market share is actually a very strong factor in this case as it's accumulative, and has very long term implications.  The factor you're speaking about (the much feared and rumored boom and bust cycles) are, by definition, temporary.  And the boom and bust tend to be wildly overestimated.  

On a numbers basis, Rocket's stated target has been to go from 10% share to 25%.  Their management has a long track record of actually doing what they say.  But even if they stumble and ""only"" grow from 10% to 20%, that market share dominance outpaces your temporary doom scenario of 30-40% market shrink.  And that's not even considering the fact that an operator moving from 10% to 20% m.s. would be reaping some breathtaking efficiencies and economics of scale.  

Rocket is widely misunderstood, and traders act as if all lending and mortgage activity will just vanish.   It won't.  It never has.  It gets busy, then it gets less busy, then it gets busy again.  But what's more significant is that in those waves, the weakest get clubbed the most and the strongest get the spoils.  And no matter what one thinks of the industry or sector, Rocket is undeniably the strongest.  They will most certainly benefit from a deceleration by hoovering up business from the weak sisters."
2021-05-05 19:15:49,stocks,"For a mortgage company with fluctuating income and no dividend I have to ask why would anyone invest in this...?

2021-05-05 18:06:39,stocks,"Indeed.   Except the management could announce a dividend tomorrow or share buyback to boost the price.  Look at Apple,  they’re literally printing money and the stock drops,  there’s investment bank scams going on here."
2021-05-05 18:18:32,stocks,Based on what? We have a 20% drop in revenue incoming
2021-05-05 19:11:50,stocks,"This statement couldn't be more wrong.  Rocket makes something like $12 to $15 BILLION in profit per year.  The overblown fear right now is that that they might ""only"" make $10-12 billion next year, as if that's somehow bad..."
2021-05-05 18:45:34,stocks,Lol. I can't tell if you're serious or not. Look at the balance sheet. Over 2.4 billion in EBIDA this quarter.
2021-05-05 19:07:08,stocks,"There's already a massive share buy back provision already approved 2 ER's ago.  As of the previous ER, they hadn't done any buying.  Haven't listened to this call to hear if that has changed."

2021-05-05 18:11:00,stocks,you mean hedge funds.
2021-05-05 18:47:51,stocks,"The entire planet knew that the red hot housing market would cool down. Chill out for a minute and focus on the fact that they are growing their digital closing business Amrok, their auto loans business Rocket Auto, and their real estate data business. There is a lot more to RKT than home loans. This is a fantastic long term play."
2021-05-05 19:12:10,stocks,Technically P and L but yes
2021-05-05 19:13:02,stocks,"At this point, the buy back seems more like something that they're holding over the head of anyone that wants to short rather than something they are actually going to  do. At the current share price, they're authorized to buy back over half of the outstanding shares. When they only sold ~15% of the company to the public, you'd have to ask why they went public in the first place if they start that buy back."
2021-05-05 19:06:28,stocks,"Mortgages were $4.4b of their $4.5b total revenue for the quarter. 

Exactly how much money are you expecting Amrock, Rocket Auto, and the real estate data business to make long term? It doesn't seem like those segments are big enough to make up for the loss in revenue that they're going to experience from the mortgage business."

2021-05-05 19:28:37,stocks,"Not sure the 15% is accurate, wasn't it less?  Regardless, I agree. The buyback that was initially announced was a bit confounding to me since it created the following odd optics:

They sell stake in the company that's initially valued at $18 by the market.  Then a few months later they're buying back at presumably similar levels?  It called the whole going public thing into question.

At the time I screamed that establishing a dividend program would have been better.  Regardless, i appreciate that at the worst, the buyback provision does offer some notion of perceived plunge protection, that Rocket could get propped up near $18.  

I've lost a bit of that confidence.  Seeing it hitting on every cylinder and yet the fickle market and manipulators have it at $19?  That makes me worry how exagerrated they could drive the price down on *actual* bad economic news, compared to the damage done here on just speculated economic forecasts."
2021-05-05 19:20:03,stocks,"You say loss in revenue like its gone forever. We knew that the market was red hot and it was going to cool before today. Here is an excerpt from the CFRA analyst report from last week. They have a $26 price target for the stock right now and I expect it to be maintained or raised tomorrow.  


""Following record revenues in 2020 of $16.9 billion, we see $14.0 billion in 2021, declining to $11.5 billion in 2022, as the mortgage market is likely to ease with higher expected rates, especially the refinance market.  


RKT is extending its national brand and platform to other markets such as auto loans and personal loans in the U.S. and geographic expansion to Canada through two acquisitions, Lendesk and Edison Financial. Net client retention rate was 91% in 2020, which speaks to RKT’s brand loyalty. Rocket Auto was started in 2019 and realized $750 million in gross loan volume in 2020 on 32,000 units."""
2021-05-05 19:22:41,stocks,Housing prices are insane but ppl aren't selling.
2021-05-05 19:21:57,stocks,Yes youre right that house prices are still up but transactions have cooled. Rising rates and low inventory has slowed things down for Q2.
2021-05-05 19:35:15,stocks,"So the market is going to shrink by 40% over the next two years. Which means they need to gain 60% to maintain their top line. 

The stock price is based on revenue and earnings. Not market share. Your quote means the price is going down down"
2021-05-05 19:32:32,stocks,Man plenty of people are selling at really high prices I'm in the process of looking for another house now and everyone I contact these things are barely on the market for a day or two and they're accepting full cash offers way over list
2021-05-05 19:43:32,stocks,Where are you seeing 40% decline over the next two years? Yes there is a projected reduction in revenue and earnings next year which is why the price targets are in the mid to high 20s and not in the 30s.
2021-05-05 18:00:06,stocks,"Your 3 points are the same that people pointed to in August last year, and again in November, and again in March. Now we're talking about it again in May. Odds are, the market will keep being unpredictable as it always is.

Just don't overextended yourself based on your risk tolerance."
2021-05-05 17:59:54,stocks,"A thesis based around the COVID relief bills causing stock market overvaluation, rather than insanely low interest rates is certainly thinking outside the box I'll give you that. One question though: How did most of this bull run happen *before* the relief bills if it was in fact caused by them? Was it temporal overvaluation?     

I'll give you this though: If you keep making these posts every month, you'll be right eventually, then you can tell us you told us so. Too bad the previous ones weren't right though."
2021-05-05 17:57:42,stocks,So you pulled out? I mean the market...
2021-05-05 18:08:18,stocks,"This is well-written and poorly-thought-out. You say a crash was probable a month ago, but not something to worry about in your opinion. But then the intervening month ""may"" place us on the precipice of a crash. Besides the weasel words (I note you also haven't even pulled funds from the market, but are just ""deeply considering"" doing so), you haven't made a case for either of those assertions. The three factors you list were equally present a month ago. Why weren't they something to worry about then? Why are they something to worry about now? Will they continue to be something to worry about if the market keeps going up, and at what point will your hypothesis actually be falsified?

In essence all three of your points are ""stock prices are high right now."" That's not a given, and even if it is true it's not enough evidence to support your claim."

2021-05-05 18:09:44,stocks,Time in the market beats timing the market! So I’ll continue to dollar cost average my investments…
2021-05-05 18:48:10,stocks,"its interesting that nowhere in your thesis do you talk about the earnings that occured. y'know, the ones where pretty much every company that's not garbage had blowout earnings?

that's probably relevant but idk"
2021-05-05 19:08:30,stocks,Heard this for the last ten years
2021-05-05 18:09:17,stocks,When I said a crash was coming two months ago everybody tried to put bananas up my butt
2021-05-05 17:56:24,stocks,This is called Asset Inflation
2021-05-05 18:09:43,stocks,"Well when it does, just point me in the direction of the best ones to short and I’ll make money on both sides of the swell."
2021-05-05 18:15:26,stocks,"I'm trying to keep some of my very limited cash on the side in case a full fledged correction does happen but it's hard to resist the urge to trade, especially when I see one of my postions dip."
2021-05-05 18:46:17,stocks,"It will come when fed raise rates, it’s pretty freaking obvious BUT you’re missing gains now until then. It can raise another 10-20% and the crash still leaves you with a 40%+ return. You then buy the crash again and make more money."
2021-05-05 19:07:15,stocks,"I believe in a normal, healthy market, we still will spend a lot of time near or at all time highs. This would just mean that over time the values of stocks are increasing and if they aren’t then i wouldn’t want to own them. It would take a very large and scary event to stop the market from growing. I do agree that things have increased way too fast though"
2021-05-05 19:21:05,stocks,">*The stock market may be overvalued*

Or the dollar got devalued.

>35% of all US dollars in existence have been printed in 10 months

It means your dollar could worth 35% less than before.

So instead of worry about the stock market crash, start thinking about what you gonna do if hyperinflation happens.

Me, I will keep my money in the stock market, worst-case scenario I will hold some bags for few years."
2021-05-05 19:46:14,stocks,What is a market crash and when will it end?
2021-05-05 19:50:28,stocks,🥱
2021-05-05 19:59:08,stocks,Cool story bro.
2021-05-05 18:05:42,stocks,"Thanks for your comment!

All those months that you mentioned in your comments had some kind of stimulus bill in force or being put through. I still believe that once that ends, fresh new money may start to become more scarce.

Unless if you think of something different?"
2021-05-05 18:03:15,stocks,"I think that was down to new investors entering the arena.

Let’s face it, people got bored in lockdown, and when people heard there was money to be made in the stock market, they rushed to it.

I think GME (sorry to mention it) also had a part to play. People saw how others became entire millionaires from it and got the illusion that it is quick and easy to make money."
2021-05-05 18:16:03,stocks,"Thanks for your comment.

I’ll be entirely honest, I haven’t been in the markets for a great deal of time either, but the recent movement is unsettling. Companies are announcing amazing quarters, but the stock is barely making a move.

AAPL is a great example, they announced a great quarter last week and the stock barely held.

Ultimately, the reasons that were existent months back are starting to materialise in my opinion."
2021-05-05 17:57:11,stocks,How do you know that?
2021-05-05 18:17:09,stocks,"We should have a ""time in the market beats timing the market"" bot, it would save you some time."
2021-05-05 18:51:29,stocks,"Absolutely, that’s a great point :)"
2021-05-05 18:16:17,stocks,ARK funds look yummy for a short when the time comes.
2021-05-05 18:09:14,stocks,"But most of the bull run happened *before* COVID, so how does lockdown boredom cause it? Let alone GME."
2021-05-05 18:45:43,stocks,"I think it's a big jump from ""the market isn't reacting to good earnings reports in the way that I, a novice investor, assumed it would"" to ""a market crash is imminent."""
2021-05-05 19:07:53,stocks,"So many companies are reporting out amazing quarterly performance, with big tech having record setting earnings, but there’s no fundamental reason we’re reaching all times highs?

I think the corrections needing to happen are in many pockets that got a bit overheated, but the market as a whole seems pretty healthy."
2021-05-05 19:02:48,stocks,Time saved by the bot saves beating the bot
2021-05-05 18:12:45,stocks,I kind of disagree with you thought that most of the bull run occurred pre-COVID. Take a look at the 5 year graph for any prominent blue-chip and you’ll see a higher rate of increase in the past year compared to the previous 4. Even the S&P500 shows it.
2021-05-05 18:55:17,stocks,"Well, if a company announced a blowout quarter and the stock collapses, do you think that is normal behaviour?

I’m not saying that the strange fluctuations from earnings reports indicates an imminent market crash, I’m merely saying that it may be something to consider."
2021-05-05 19:03:42,stocks,"Earnings are complicated. There's a convergence of increased data, updated company guidance, investor sentiment, trader sentiment, pre-earnings expectations, all sorts of stuff that comes together on a given date. That means that more or less anything can be normal.

The easiest example is, if a company has a blowout quarter because of a one-off event then I wouldn't expect the price to skyrocket as well, since that one-off has no bearing on future events. Another is a company whose price rushes up in advance of earnings and doesn't move even though the report is good, because the expectation of good earnings got priced in."
2021-05-05 19:22:10,stocks,"A 2-5% drop is hardly a collapse. I'd also like to point out that these companies *did* have amazing earnings, crashes tend to happen when the prices *aren't* backed up by earnings. Sure the stocks might be overvalued, but that's why they had a pullback/stayed flat on earnings. Essentially the company value was catching up to the price, that's normal and happens all the time."
2021-05-05 19:38:08,stocks,"Thanks for your additional input, it’s nice seeing things from an alternative perspective :)"
2021-05-05 18:49:54,stocks,"Stock price is still too expensive, maybe crazy earnings will justify it."

2021-05-05 19:42:55,stocks,Yeah hopefully a dip after earnings? but who knows.

2021-05-05 18:50:31,stocks,"IMO, they are overvalued and hyped. BUT, I do like it, and I do think there’s value long term. But if I think it’s valued at $100, I wanna try and get it for 50. So I wait."
2021-05-05 19:01:54,stocks,Look I don’t like Roblox but if you think the company has a great upside why wait?

2021-05-05 17:41:29,stocks,Probable an expression of the market thinking that this is the top. Outlook would be that the revenue sinks again after Covid is over.
2021-05-05 18:01:16,stocks,I'm a massive Esty bull and I expected this type of pullback and guidance. Small businesses will not stop using them post COVID and this entire situation has shifted the ways they operate forever. My personal price target is 1350$ and I really don't think it's unreasonable at all.

2021-05-05 17:00:02,stocks,putting money into MSOS every week
2021-05-05 19:18:42,stocks,"The main thing you need is a company with the ability to go national because right now theres some demand that's being demanded from the non legal states. People are buying weed, vapes, and gummies and driving them to other states. If it gets legalized federally, or if each state just decriminilzes it for the tax benefits, than some of the companies currently in business will lose some market share to the illegal runs. 

Another note about the growers, most of the little guys are getting bought out or pushed out by the big corps. A lot of these companies are more like conglomerates and to be honest half their grow situations are worse off than homemade grow equipment I've seen in people's houses. 

Do your research here, not only is the industry bloated but market share will get eaten up as more states legalize. Make sure you're with a company that's in it for the long haul, makes a good product, and that you researched. Just as a smoker in Washington I cant tell you how many brands I get used to that just disappear a few months later. For all the success stories theres 3 disaster stories. 

Just a disclaimer, the feds do crack down ont he accounting of these companies sometimes. It's legal in the state but currently the IRS harasses a lot of these companies. So there is an ever looming risk of the IRS or DEA messing things up for you. Until its legal federally that just exists."

2021-05-05 17:29:48,stocks,"Well PYPL did a free fall prior to earnings so it may actually be okay - assuming there isn't a broader market sell-off, ofc."
2021-05-05 17:38:38,stocks,"I'd give it 4 or 5%. 

PayPal's p/e has been 50 for over a decade. This latest bull market really shot it into the stratosphere, and its p/e is finally starting to come down with these earnings but... it's still closer to 70 than 50 for no real reason at all.

I think the bear case goes something like: of course revenue, payment volume, active accounts and cash flow went up. PayPal has been on a spending spree. I want to know that buying up Honey, iZettle and building out Venmo is building a real payment ecosystem and not just churning and burning through IPs.

Profit margin hasn't budged, number of payment transactions per active account hasn't moved, the number of payment transactions is steadily growing but in context disappointing since total transaction value is sideways etc. Paypal is what it is, there's just more of it. 

Which is just a long winded saying of 4% drop because people who are unconvinced won't suddenly be convinced when they're informed that PayPal is in fact bigger after buying up multiple other companies, and you always sell on the news"
2021-05-05 17:49:08,stocks,That depends on how much you buy.

2021-05-05 16:25:26,stocks,"Numbered points below not my words, copied from another comment a while back that put forth a good case for why individual active investors shouldn’t compare themselves to professional money managers:

1. Money managers have performance carrots and sticks that require them to think short term.
2. Most work for a fund that is restricted to a given strategy, even when that strategy is not the optimal one.
3. Many simply have too much money and so many highly profitable but too-small-dollar opportunities are out of their reach.
4. Money managers have to worry about an influx of money after a run of good performance, swelling their funds after the good money has already been made.
5. Money managers have to worry about outflows of money after a negative event, being forced to sell at low prices and forfeit cash right when opportunities become plentiful.
6. Money managers have to fear being caught in losing (or early) contrarian bets and looking foolish or stupid.

Small investors can invest in small-cap companies or other opportunities that are too tiny for institutions  to bother with.

Uranium miners are a good example of this. Their market cap is so small that for someone like a black rock to take even less that 0.1% of their positions in them, they would end up outright owning the company. And so they don’t bother - it’s not worth the amount of time for them, even if they do get back 500% gains.

Buffett has spoken about the advantages  small investors benefit from, in that they’re nimble and can take significant positions and always find buys and sellers from the market makers without it affecting the stock price.

Graham Greene before he passed away had spoken about how value investing is still possible once you look outside large-cap stocks - too little places to invest in for institutions makes large-cap the only way to go, and so you have a lot of sophisticated money looking at the same subset of stocks, hard for the individual investor to beat.

I agree though, S&P 500 and other such indexes are great. Just food for thought.

Edit: Grammar

Edit2: more context"
2021-05-05 16:28:31,stocks,"I think the biggest thing in beating the Indexes(for individuals) is really patience. I mean, there are a lot of amazing companies that for the last few months have been beaten down. Now that's nothing new, but most people in this recent selloff and uncertainty have been buying into hype, selling at a loss and then getting super pessimistic about anything that's not a boomer stock or an index fund. Most people don't have the patience or the conviction to hold through 2 months of red, they just wanna see instant money in their accounts and sell anything that isn't green (losing a bunch of money)

Yes, not every company will succeed and outperform the market, but I think that at any given time, given the tools and time necessary, any basic observer can select a few undervalued companies that will outperform the market over a span of multiple years. It's not that hard to find a great company at this time, and lots of amazing companies are beaten down so low. The real difficult part is trying not to get emotional seeing unrealized losses everyday and keeping them unrealized. Adding to a position that you're confident in after it's tanked. The hard part is keeping your conviction, sticking to your plan and holding through."
2021-05-05 18:40:48,stocks,"True but right now when the s&p500 is valued at 45 p/e and apple, Microsoft etc are valued at around 30 p/e  most of the old-school logic of s&p500 above all isn’t very valid anymore"

2021-05-05 19:35:08,stocks,"Why is this a constantly parroted argument against investing or trading? I'm not ""most"". Why do I care what happens to most people? Lol.

Tbh, I think most don't beat the market because they don't really have the dedication to do so."
2021-05-05 16:38:49,stocks,"Why only the s&p500? I invest in the rest of the world too. The American market is the most expensive. You have the opportunity to ""beat"" the s&p500 investing in emerging markets, that are riskier."
2021-05-05 16:47:47,stocks,"There is a good reason why indexes beat most individual investors.  Indexes are cap weighted which is a fancy way of saying they don’t buy equal amounts of the stocks in the index, they buy a quantity proportional to the market value of the company.  The proven winners get the most new money and the not-so-hot stocks get the least.  Most individuals don’t invest this way.  They have a stock go down and they hope it will go back up and they add to their position.  They have a stock go up and they sell out because they fear losing their gains.  This is exactly the worst way to get really big gains and to keep losses small.  Strategy counts for a lot in investing.....its not just WHAT you buy and sell, its HOW you buy and sell."
2021-05-05 17:41:14,stocks,I beat the SP500 this year with Doge Coin. Want to beat the SP? Follow musk on Twitter and ride his pumps until he gets shut down. Though I doubt that’s possible for the SEC to do.

Also size is a real issue, a smaller team can move quickly and get deals. However once you grow to big you'll be slow to act and getting big returns without taking to much risk gets extremely difficult."

2021-05-05 15:50:05,stocks,"First, don't invest all of your savings. Is that 10k in addition to an emergency fund (3-6mos of expenses) that you already have set aside?


There's nothing wrong with going heavy in ETFs. In fact, most investors should probably be 100% in index ETFs. A total world stock ETF (VT) is a great foundation and I think you should put the vast majority of your money into it. No one can predict the future, so own the world. I wouldn't put more than 25% into these popular thematic ETFs that keep springing up on Reddit. They're unlikely to outperform over the long term."
2021-05-05 16:05:08,stocks,"It depends on your gameplan. If you just want to set and forget it, then wide market ETFs are a good bet to just leave sitting there and accrue value over time while you pick up some minor dividend payouts every few months along the way. I like VTI, VOO and SCHD for that. 

I'd go 40/60 on Stocks/ETFs if you wanna be safe about it, reverse it if you want to be more active with trading and whatnot. I'd also recommend making sure you have enough for your emergency fund/monthly expenses on hand. Once you establish that, feel free to put your leftovers into ETFs and just sit. It'll be way more profitable than just leaving it untouched in a savings account."
2021-05-05 15:30:09,stocks,"XLE.  5% dividend and Tom Lee of funds strat thinking it's gonna keep going up when oil hits 80 dollar a barrel by summer.   Not advice, I think he's good"
2021-05-05 15:30:31,stocks,"Long term passive investing in a good strategy to match with ETF investing. I know nothing of the rules in Mexico but look for low cost ETF’s that track the major indexes (SP500, Nasdaq, DOW). Check out SPY, DIA and QQQ or QQEW"
2021-05-05 16:00:20,stocks,"Yes exactly. These 10K are separate of my emergency fund. I thought 25% VOO/SPY, 35% VT, 15% emerging market ETF and the rest spread in other ETFs or blue chip stocks"
2021-05-05 16:14:33,stocks,I prefer to be passive. Also my broker charges a commission of 0.25% per trade so I don't want my account to be eaten by commissions.
2021-05-05 16:01:36,stocks,I'm not that high on Oil ETFs tbh. I prefer a renewable energy ETF as QCLN
2021-05-05 16:15:16,stocks,"Great! I think owning VOO + VT + an emerging market (EM) ETF is overcomplicating things. Currently, VT is comprised of 57% US stock and 43% international stock (with approximately 8% of that international being emerging markets). So just having 75% in VT is going to be close to what you want in a single security. Good luck!"
2021-05-05 16:41:18,stocks,"I see. In that case I'd just go with ETFs initially with your biggest lump sum contribution to start off, then periodically invest a set amount into stocks you want to mess around with individually. 

I don't know if you have a Roth IRA equivalent in Mexico, but what I usually do is keep my safer investments there for long term growth. I fund it up to the 6K per year limit early on and mostly just stick it in ETFs to sit around and grow + give a small dividend. Boring, but it'll do its thing over the long term while following the market trends as a whole."

2021-05-05 16:29:04,stocks,Wait for a drop - which will happen with a call that expires 8 months from now. And buy it back. Roll it into a higher strike price to cover anything you lost between your original premium and what you pay to purchase it back.
2021-05-05 15:23:21,stocks,I’m definitely feeling the opportunity cost right now
2021-05-05 15:39:02,stocks,"I appreciate it and that’s why I sold the call in the first place. I’m not losing money, just limiting my upside so I can’t complain too much. But the FOMO hurts and it’s a lesson for me"
2021-05-05 16:39:38,stocks,I’m on the fence about buying it back now. If I catch the right dip I will definitely consider it. I’m debating how much the $9k will be worth to me in January and if I just want to “sell” the position by letting the call ride and enjoy the increase for the remainder of my shares
2021-05-05 15:41:12,stocks,Think of those way.  If it went sideways for a few more months would you have sold it for breakeven if you didn't sell the covered call?  Getting greedy fucked me up a bunch of times cause I thought the stock can keep going up then it takes a big ole shit and I need to avg down again and again
2021-05-05 16:44:41,stocks,"I understand the FOMO and can’t speak to your specific goals for this holding. In general when I sell calls I just make sure I’m ok watching them go. It usually means I don’t earn much premium because my strikes are high. Gotta ring the register every so often. Hope you can learn and move on to the next. Still green, friend. Green can’t be the one that hurts too bad."
2021-05-05 16:23:02,stocks,Sometimes the best thing to do to your portfolio is to walk away from it for a few days/weeks/months.
2021-05-05 15:51:36,stocks,I appreciate this insight. Honestly that was my thought process: if I would sell today for $90 why not sell the cc and collect the premium. I honestly did not expect to feel this frustrated seeing the stock jump though. It definitely makes me reconsider how worth it collecting the premium was
2021-05-05 17:03:52,stocks,"Thank you man and genuinely appreciate the sentiment and advice. I just sold my first few covered calls in the last couple weeks. I’ve been a traditional buy and hold guy until then. I’m still fine tuning my strategy. Ultimately I agree with your sentiment that as long as I’m ultimately selling at a gain that I would be ok with there’s minimal downside.

The FOMO this time really came from how long I’ve been holding CVS and defending its fundamentals with minimal movement, then it feels like as soon as a sell a cc it explodes lol"

2021-05-05 15:54:48,stocks,Yeah man if you sold at 90 today you get hit with short term gains at high tax rate.  Looks like you sold a leap so if it's over a year of holding then it's a lower tax rate.  This is assuming your living in the US.  I have no idea how it works for other countries.
2021-05-05 16:01:08,stocks,"I have held the shares for over a year at this point anyway so the taxes would be the same for me in this case.

Timber is a lot more expensive than before, but thanks to low interest rates, buyers aren't balking over that. Meanwhile, their profits up 20.5%, net income per share is up 63.2%... And their CEO feels ""confident"" all their orders and construction will lead to higher earnings next quarter and each subsequent quarter this year....

Really is a head scratcher. Like, I can't imagine a better earnings release that they could have put out, unless they announced a ""cloud-based/blockchain"" initiative lol.

I'll probably wind up buying more shares tomorrow."

Companies like Aurinia are the domain of savvy long term biotech investors and of the usual manipulators of the biotech market. It doesn't have genomics or AI written all over it, so it is not part of the hype train which controls this nonsensical market; moreover its international potential is poorly understood by most US investors.

It will continue to be subject to FUD, algo trading and short selling games until it is either bought out or delivers sustained successful commercialization of Lupkynis. It's an old-fashioned long term play of the type that's entirely out of favor nowadays."

So, from what you're saying, it sounds like ER's might hold a little more weight for these stocks *because* they aren't on the meme-stock hype train?"
2021-05-05 16:00:01,stocks,"Yes. However you should be aware that Aurinia (like other biotechs) is subject to heavy FUD and price manipulation so even if there is a spike on good earnings it could be followed by a grinding downslope for months (despite no bad news !) until the next earnings call.

Hedge funds count on naive new investors buying the momentum on earnings, so they tend to take short term profits and short it afterwards (directly and through options) in order to shake out those impatient people; after which they buy more at a lower price.

That's what you saw with AUPH after their FDA drug approval in January (and this kind of stuff was done to this and other biotechs also before that).

It only makes sense to invest in this company if you are interested in the long term and prepared to ignore short term games."

2021-05-05 14:36:47,stocks,"It is in fact even worse. Assuming a simple game of flip a coin with 50% chance of winning, and that you can increase the bet each time with no limitation on sizing or how many times you can play, you WILL eventually win. You can generalise this with games of known but smaller probability of winning. But there is usually a practical limitation in that even if you have practically infinite funds, there is usually a maximum bet limit so you can't actually apply this strategy without significant risk.

In the stock market, first the probabilities aren't fixed or even known, assuming that each time you bet on a *trully* random stock, then you can probably get a half decent estimate from recent previous performance of the stock market. But still sentiment can change at any time, therefore making estimation useless. What is even further worse is if you do it with one stock, since it is even more dependent on the underlying business the details of which are unknown as well as general markets sentiment AND sentiment in the people who are trading the particular stock. 

Tldr, do it in a flip the coin game if you can afford doubling bet each time and it is actually allowed without limits on the bet, but not the stock market ffs we had enough of random bets already :)"

Right there."
2021-05-05 14:42:21,stocks,"There is no gambler’s fallacy because games like craps have set probabilities. The stock market has no set probabilities, it is a game where anything can happen. There are no limits preventing a $5 options bet from becoming worth $1,000 in matter of hours. Stranger things have happened. 

Future stock prices are also highly dependent on past performance. For example, if people are buying a stock on margin, a series of down days is likely to have a cascading effect where the stock falls, people who bought on margin get called out of their position, in turn causing more people to get called out and dropping the price further."
2021-05-05 18:16:58,stocks,yes
2021-05-05 19:50:22,stocks,"This is not a study but a simple exercise. 2 groups where A flips a coin and B make up an imaginary coins result. The one that is made up is very pattern like such as no heads more than 3x. True random is not pattern. Long run it reverts but during that time it can streak. Like 10 heads in a row. 

Stock performance does auto correlate which it means yesterday’s performance does not affect today. Volatility of performance auto correlates but not the actual performance. That’s why gambler fallacy presents itself because you can’t predict when a stock bounce back based on how many red days you see."
2021-05-05 17:13:38,stocks,"Stocks are a lot like poker, where knowledgable people can do well most of the time but where also clueless idiots can win enough to keep going until they go broke.

To address your original question, I don’t believe so. Technical analysis has a wide variety of ways to help (but not with 100% certainty) determine supply and demand and show visually how stocks in an uptrend and move two step forwards and one step back. So, yes, buying on red days for upward moving stocks is profitable. 

We can also see how independent events affect how stocks will perform on several levels. Growth stocks are suffering as investors move towards value stocks. Sectors and different types of assets also often have negative correlations as well, sometimes due to various traits they have (i.e. consumer staples doing better during a recession versus consumer discretionary in better years)."

I worked in the financial world early on in my life, and I was fortunate to get that education (not college, real live hands on experience) at that young age. Ended up joining the service at 21 (the financial landscape wasn't great for a young kid after the 1987 crash) and getting out six years later. I was 27, and although I knew all about retirement investing I had little saved (military didn't pay much back then), a wife, a kid and a mortgage. I felt I was way behind.

My first job out of the service I worked with these old, retired military folks. Some had 20, 25, 30 years in the service and were working at 60, 70 years old, running around on ships to make $12.50 an hour instead of playing with their grandkids. They needed the cash because the pension wasn't cutting it and they didn't save shit. I was absolutely determined to not be one of them.

Life still comes at ya, but I wavered little in my plan. I'm 51 now and I'm targeting retirement somewhere between 57 and 60."

2021-05-05 14:13:19,stocks,"First off, I am debt free, including my house. I have always invested in my 401k and IRA but after paying off my home in 2019, I have started investing more and following the markets a lot more closely as I know that it’s one of the best ways to grow my money. I have liquid savings for various things, but really try to smartly invest anything I can now as often as possible.

My main priority is investing 20% of my income into my Roth 401k and Roth IRA for retirement. It’s ultra boring but effective vanguard and fidelity index funds. Aside from that, I invest in index funds in a general brokerage account for goals in the 2-10 year range. I also own chunks of google, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft as I believe in their long term growth and capabilities. It’s all about growth as saving all extra money and keeping it in the bank doesn’t really benefit you. An added benefit is that it gives me something to follow. I am interested I the day to day moves and news. But fortunately I’m not so freaked that I feel the need to mess with my portfolio much. I just add when it’s a down day.

I read and research stocks and funds on Morningstar.com because I believe that making smart decisions on what you invest in is a very important component of investing. I’d rather have something that can slowly grow over time versus GAMBLING on some garbage like GameStop. 

I know that at retirement I will be very well off. If I can afford to retire even sooner, great. Otherwise, I don’t have grand goals. It’d be nice to use some of my gains to purchase more real estate in the future."

It was money I decided I wouldnt necessary need tommorow or half a year from now. Specially with Covid situation and lockdowns. No travels, local or abroad, no shopping, no restaurants.  Basically NO LIFE. Nowhere for my money to be spend. 

Was that good decision overall now given year passed since I started investing? Yes. Did I make some profit? Yes, but nowhere near enough I though I would. I would have being happy making even 15% on overall investment but  I made but I made less which actually makes me angry.  Because many profited from 100-900% in same span just choosing different stock than I did mine.

After 8 months on stock market that frustration lead to investing into something which likely wont make me take profit 3 years from now.  But lets say I do have enough patience to get my money and more back.

Pre-market works well only when getting positive news before they open US market. Then it's possible that stock price goes up and can sell at profit.

Europeans bought AMD +1.70%, but in US market it's now -0.50%

Europeans bought Amazon +0.40% up but in US market it's nearly -1%

One of my favorite green stock was up +1.61% (EU market) but now it's -1.23% in US market

Europeans usually trend to sell more oil stocks, buy green and tech but Americans seems to do opposite."

EPD because it feels undervalued, has a considerable pipeline and general network, lots of LNG too, delivered robust results in a challenging year (Covid, Texan snow and oil/gas prices) and has a great dividend. It's also an MLP, an advantage in terms of tax (at least for me, as a Brit, means no 15% tax on the divi) over other similar companies.

HUN (especially under $30) I see nobody talking about, but they have made significant changes to their business over the last couple of years, so although revenue is falling, earnings are looking great. It's become a leaner business with a war chest for suitable acquisitions.

I feel both stocks have 15-20% share price growth in the medium term. EPD feels like a solid defensive and divi stock, whilst HUN could be a great growth play, though a respectable current divi all the same, and last week they announced a 15% increase in the divi."

2021-05-05 00:00:00,stocks,"Peloton Recalls Treadmills After Safety Warnings https://nyti.ms/2QZBxiN

Peloton is recalling its Tread+ and Tread treadmills, the at-home fitness company said on Wednesday, less than a month after it fought the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission as it warned that dozens of injuries and one death of a child had been linked to the machines.

The commission, which issued an “urgent warning” for the machines in April, urged people who own the treadmills to immediately stop using them. Peloton is offering a full refund for the $4,295 machine with a 32-inch touch screen that allows runners to work out with the aid of instructors.

John Foley, the chief executive of Peloton, said in a statement Wednesday that the company had “made a mistake” by fighting the agency’s request to recall the treadmills, and apologized for not engaging “more productively with them from the outset.”

“The decision to recall both products was the right thing to do for Peloton’s members and their families,” he said in the statement.

The machines were sold in the United States from November to March. The company is working on a repair to be offered to customers “in the coming weeks,” the commission said in a statement. The software improvements will automatically lock the Tread+ after use and require a four-digit passcode to unlock it, the commission said.

“Today we have taken steps to prevent further harm from these two products,” Robert S. Adler, the acting chairman of the commission, said in the statement.

The commission said it had received 72 reports of adults, children, pets and objects being pulled under the rear of the treadmill. Twenty-nine involved children, including a 6-year-old boy who died.

After the death of the child in March, the company urged users to keep Peloton products where children can’t get to them and store safety keys away from children"
2021-05-05 11:52:41,stocks,Anyone going to try to catch a falling knife?
2021-05-05 11:48:23,stocks,"3 month chart is scary but with this dip, is anyone else gonna buy Peloton stock too? I hope to get in at around $60"
2021-05-05 15:10:31,stocks,Good luck PTON removing the behemoth tread out of my basement. We basically had to remodel around it. Our tread will be sucking in kids and pets for generations to come.
2021-05-05 12:06:01,stocks,"To put this into perspective:

Each treadmill costs ~$4000, and the recall covers all 125,000 of them (they are offering a full refund or partial refund if they dont request by certain date). So do the math: $4000 x 125,000 = $500,000,000. Yikes. A $500 million dollar loss under the worst case scenario (actual loss wont be known until next earnings report).

If you look at their quarterly earnings/revenue this will put a gigantic hole in their balance sheet...tread carefully if you are considering buying the dip here..."
2021-05-05 12:07:03,stocks,They will install a guard and ship them back out. This is temporary for them. The key is in their subscription services.
2021-05-05 17:21:14,stocks,"This may be a great buying opportunity... soon. Just wait for the knife to stop falling... then wait a little longer. There will be a tidal wave of bad news for the company in the days and weeks ahead. The time to buy is when the stock stops dropping (flat or up for 3-4 days), and ideally, after an overall market correction. The next quarter earnings will take a hit, but after that the world will move on. If you buy the dip in a few weeks, or after the next quarterly earning report, and hold for a year or two, it could be a great investment opportunity. 

The questions to ask:   
(1) Do I think this is a solid company with good long term earning potential?  
(2) Would I want to own this stock a year or two from now? 

If so, watch and wait... then buy the dip when shares are on sale."

2021-05-05 13:35:26,stocks,Here are my unprofessional thoughts. PTON has been dropping ever since the feds said they were dangerous. So this huge drop today seems excessive because its been dropping for a while already. I had a buy planned at 80. Given this excessive feeling drop today I bought some in the low 80s. This is literally 50% of its high. I think the hit from the recall has been occurring for a while.

and actually a great example of risk mitigation. 

its far cheaper to recall, refit and resell then to risk more and more lawsuits piling in on them. 

there have been other companies that were in similar situations and it barely slowed them down.

think about all major car companies that ever had to recall their products because of a design flaw or mechanical failure.

Dont invest in companies whose revenues are essentially tied to one product and are hit driven. I think there is a world where PTON can succeed long term (I think acquiring Strava and creating a fitness social media platform already based on cycling and running makes a ton of sense, as well as creating in person gyms and cycle bars similar in caliber to Equinox to maintain premium brand), but too much risk for my taste"

There's something off with this product. This isn't heavy machinery, it's a treadmill that's meant to be placed in the house. Peloton fucked up with this product. Why do I have to explain this. 

I don't know how many treadmill company/brands there are, but Peloton is being targeted here cause they exploded in popularity in the last couple years. They've had a treadmill for 3 years now and over that time there have been 72 reports and 1 death. I'm not saying that is nothing, but let's look at what the government has on treadmill injuries and deaths overall, not just Peloton.

> There were an estimated 22,500 treadmill-related injuries treated at U.S. emergency departments in 2019 — including about 2,000 in children under 8 years old, according to the CPSC. The agency received reports of 17 deaths associated with treadmills from 2018 to 2020. One of those fatalities involved a 5-year-old child, but it was not clear what occurred in that case.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/04/16/peloton-treadmill-injuries-death-cpsc/

In 2019 there were about **22,500 treated** treadmill related injuries in the U.S., 2,000 of those being children. 

That's an average of **61 people per day who went the the hospital** for treadmill related injuries. **5 children under 8 years old per day sent to the hospital** for treadmill related injuries.

vs Peloton having **72 reports** over 3 years. These are reports to the CPSC, not necessarily hospital visits. I'm sure some, maybe a majority did go to the hospital, but over 3 years there were just as many reported injuries for Peloton treadmills as there are injuries per day in the U.S. for all treadmill related hospital visits. 

72 instances in 3 years of: ""Hi government agency, we'd like to report we got an injury with the Peloton treadmill"" 

vs 

61 instances per day of: ""hello 911 we got a treadmill related injury and we need to go to the hospital""

I don't think we need to spend much time comparing the 17 treadmill related deaths from 2018-2020 to the 1 death in 3 years for the Peloton treadmill. Numbers speak for themselves.

I'm not here to shill for Peloton. No membership. No shares. No nothing. Just putting some numbers in perspective. Perhaps if we broke down all the treadmill related injuries per company we could compare this better. Maybe then Peloton stands out as being bad."

Under strict liability theory, one has to show Peloton was knowingly at fault in their design or operation (like if Peloton didn't put warnings in the owner's manual or stickers on the product).

That's a high bar to hurdle because lacking evidence, one cannot testify to another person's intent.

Rather what someone needs to prove is does the product have an ***unreasonably*** dangerous defect?

Or that the product caused the injury in a manner in which it was designed to be used.

So YES, it is parent's responsibility to keep their 6 year old from the high speed moving thingy at the end of the device which was not designed as a toy... not Peloton's as you incorrectly assume."

When they come to deliver their product you direct them as to where to set it up.  There has been more than one incident and one fatality is absolutely too many.  Quick search shows in 2019 there were 22500 injuries that resulted in emergency rooms from treadmills 2000 of those were children under 8 years old.  All workout equipment is dangerous and proper precautions need to be taken in order to protect people from being on them that shouldn’t. There’s a reason why I keep all my stuff in the garage and it take me 15 minutes to set up to workout, and about 15 to safeguard it again when I’m finished.

Everyone is saying to add a guard.  That doesn't look like it would improve safety to me.  It looks like a good way to remove fingers.  Put a sensor on that guard maybe....like a chainsaw brake.

Or a sensor like a garage door?   Some are talking about a resistance sensor, but I can't imagine a kids fingers cause more resistance than me running.   In the end, they already have a sensor to indicate if you have fallen, but nobody uses it.  Maybe they need to enforce the use of the existing sensor, and put a second one at the rear or underneath."

2021-05-05 14:26:52,stocks,Haha so good
2021-05-05 17:43:16,stocks,"Math speaks for itself. You are correct.

Peloton has roughly 125,000 treadmills sold in the US since 2018. (Assuming all sold in 2018 its a 3 year average of 125k treadmills).

The US has between 50mm to 60mm people that own treadmills. Let's go low and say 50mm treadmills.

That is a 0.25% market share for Peloton.

Over the last 3 years, 17 people have died on treadmill accidents (for arguments sake, lets say that they were all due to a design flaw or a defect or something similar to the warning Peloton had).

This means that Peloton, in 3 years, had 6% of the treadmill deaths while having only a 0.25% market share.

Peloton's treadmill clearly and visible and publically has a different design than traditional treadmills and has more space under the treadmill. This allows for things to be sucked under more easily.

The data, the math, the reports, the recalls, the news, and the design all clearly show it is a product with a flawed design.

Can they fix the design? Maybe. We will have to wait and see on that.

Disclaimer: I have no positions in Peloton long or short. I am not saying anything about the stock's value or how this will affect them. All I am saying is people saying the product isn't defective or ""all treadmills are dangerous"" are severely severely missing the point and ignoring the numbers."

Under a strict liability you don't focus on negligence, the plaintiff merely needs to prove:

* the defendant manufactured, distributed, or supplied a product;
* the product was defective;
* the defect caused injury to the plaintiff; and
* as a result, the plaintiff sustained damages."

Edit: ok, I read that again and I sound like a dick. All I'm saying is they don't pass the sniff test for me. The market for extremely expensive exercise equipment is not overly large, and I just don't see how they justify their current price.

You frame the issue as if the problem is a small cohort of negligent parents but the reality is that, when it comes to kids, they do stupid shit sometimes regardless of how great of a parent you might be.

That sentence as written itself is incorrect.  Just because vendor supplies a product doesn't automatically make them liable.  You're misinterpreting the 'strict' part in 'strict liability'.

Using your misinterpretation of the strict liability theory, you're addressing the controversy in the theory -- which is any vendor would be automatically responsible for anything related to their product.  Including misuse cases.

That last part is simply not true.  Misuse cases do NOT fall under strict liability theory.  That's even downstream from the link you sent me.  You're not very good at proving points are you! Ha!"

Strict Product Liability is not *Automatic Liability* - simply because a plaintiff is required to prove less in a strict product liability case (compared with a negligence-based action) does not mean a defendant’s liability is automatic.

Typically you defend against strict liability by showing:

* the plaintiff used the product in a way that he or she knew  could lead to injury, or used the product despite knowing of the defect, or
 
* the plaintiff's own careless actions contributed to or were the only cause of the injury, including using the product in a manner for which it was not intended"

2021-05-05 14:51:18,stocks,">But it isn't Peloton's duty to make the impossible guarantee that people won't ever get injured.

You're taking my point to an absurd extreme. What I'm explaining is basic tort law. Ask any lawyer and they will tell you something similar. While you may have strong opinions on Peloton and parenting, there is an objective way of analyzing liability, long established in the common law. If you want to throw out decades of legal precedent, then good luck. 

At this point there is a case that any potential action against Peloton will not be too remote given that dozens of injuries have been reported and one death. If there is a way of altering the machine with some sort of guard so that children won't be sucked in by the belt, then Peleton has an obvious burden to do exactly that. Your figure of 0.056% over simplifies it too. That figure only takes into account incidents that have already happened. If no alterations are made to the machine, then by this time next year or next decade that percentage will be much higher. Keep in mind we are talking about household treadmills, which tend to be located in places accessible to children. Ideally all treadmills would be in locked rooms with signs that say ""No Children Allowed"", but imposing all treadmill owners to do that would be more practically burdensome than having the company fix their machines in a way that children can't get sucked in under the belt. I would safely assume that, until now, most Peleton treadmill owners didn't think that such serious incidents are foreseeable. Even if some did, the burden is squarely on Peleton's shoulders to ensure their products are safe around allured children. We are not talking about heavy-duty construction equipment here; we're talking about a household workout machine. 

With all due respect, and I sincerely mean that, you don't know what you're talking about. You're free to have your opinion regarding what should fly in the world of liability, but the law is the law, and the reason Peloton is recalling their machines is because they realize there is a serious chance of them being in trouble if they don't fix their product. Think about  how often cars are recalled versus how little you hear about fatal accidents occurring as a result of design flaws.

The solution almost certainly has to be sensors....and the motor resistance sensor solution proposed by some seems iffy to me.

I want to talk about this ETF I haven't seen mentioned here yet, and one I think could be a very good choice on a short investment.

So NRGU is a gas and oil ETF that tracks major gas and oil exploration/refinement companies on a 3x leverage. It is currently sitting at $157 per share as I write this post.

It's lowest evaluation was at $26 back in October of 2020. Due to the pandemic this ETF fell an astounding $1174 from March 2020 - October of 2020.

For the 4 years before the Pandemic I can track, this ETF traded at anywhere from $700 - $1200.

Even if it only manages to gain back half of it's value post pandemic, that's still $500 - $600 per share.

Am I missing something or is this one that we should be looking at?

Edit: Oh and My position - I'm not in this one yet but thinking about throwing $2K at it today.

Edit 2: There was a stock split on this in October of 2020"

If you write a put on a stock that you don't own and the other party decides to exercise the option, then you will be forced to buy the stock from them, and money will be taken from your account to pay for it. You can instruct your broker to set that position to do a ""cashless exercise"" if the other party exercises it. A cashless exercise means that when the stock is given to you it will automatically be sold. What you end up with is the difference between the strike price and the sale price, which is in addition to the premium you collected when you wrote the option.

Writing uncovered options is a fairly high risk proposition, and you won't be allowed to do it if you don't have experience trading options. At first your broker will authorize you to write covered calls and maybe to buy calls and puts, because these are low-risk propositions for which you always have the capital to cover the maximum cost."

Do some more research, this has been explained in nearly every explanation of puts that I've seen that wasn't extremely basic.

Essentially, if you get called on the put and you don't have the stock, your broker *may* contact you and give you a chance to add the money to buy the stock to your account or they will liquidate enough of your assets (of *their* choosing) to cover the costs. They may do one, then the other if you don't respond fast enough to a request for funds but that's up the terms of service with your brokerage. They'll also lock down a portion of your account so that you can't pull the money and leave the other party in the contract in a lurch."

I would like your opinion of Fiverr and Upwork. They had a big drop down these two days. Why is that? As I understood, the focal point is Biden reform that will make harder for companies like Uber not to consider employees their gig workers.

But that's it, right? Fiverr is a platform for freelancers that work for several companies. How is Biden reform affecting them and in general the platform? It has a complete different angle to the gig economy. 

Let me know your thoughts and ideas!"

2021-05-05 00:00:00,stocks,"Can I use margin for limit buy orders without paying interest? TD TD Ameritrade.

I'm an average joe. I don't do options, period. I accidentally applied for margin through TD Ameritrade because I thought there'd be more to the application process and I was just wanting to look at rates and how much I *could* be approved for. Turns out it's a one-click thing and they gave me a boat load of margin. I have sense to use it responsibly.

The ONLY thing I want to use margin for is so that I can keep my cash 100% in the market but be able to ""buy dips"" and strategize (if you could call it that). And before I get recommendations not to have all of my cash in the market, I don't. I have a healthy emergency fund. It's just not through TD. 

When I place limit buy orders that sit out there for a while, it locks down the cash obviously. 

My question is: if I place a limit buy order with available margin (no cash or tradable funds except margin) do I have to start paying interest on that margin while I've got it locked up? Or only when it fills?

2021-05-05 00:00:00,stocks,"The 6 phase model of how this uranium bull market might unfold The recent run up in equities has people questioning if they missed the top, if they are too late and if this was already the end of a young bull market in uranium. This couldn’t be further from the truth, as a long term price per pound of uranium is still in need of between 50 and 60 dollars. If it doesn’t reach this target within the next three years, we are in for much bigger issues and this will not be allowed to happen in my view. As part of the research document I wrote on uranium investing, I constructed a phase model that walks us through every part of what I think will be a generational bull market. We are very much still in phase 2 of my 6 phase model, but with phase 3 slowly emerging on the horizon. What are these 6 phases you might think? They can be categorized as follows in a stadium like model:

Phase 1, constructing the stadium (2016-2020):

\- The early/smart money, the first time we come out of a prolonged bear market. Equities may not have really moved yet, but it is finally starting to look brighter. After the price of uranium bottomed several years ago, it has crept up slowly but surely, but without proper reaction of the underlying equities. Catalysts are building and around the end of this phase (between July and October of last year) is when I first started sharing my due diligence on here. This phase ended at the start of the first big run up we have seen.

Phase 2, getting on the bus (2020-2021):

\- Once share prices finally move (as we have seen between November and February of this year), it is time for more of the smart money to come in. Those who see that we have finally come out of a bear market and that the busses are slowly being loaded. Price movement will justify the narrative and sharp minds accounting for both retail capital as well as institutional capital will start to position themselves for what is to come. This is the point where we are currently at, waiting for the next move up and for this bus to get going.

Phase 3, arriving at the stadium:

\- Word is spreading of a new investment opportunity and this will likely be marked by the price per pound of uranium going over the 40 dollar mark. As was mentioned above, price movement justifies the narrative and 40 dollar is the first ‘line in the sand’ where we will see increased interest from institutional capital wanting to position themselves for this bull market. This phase can be the shortest or the longest of all of the 6 phases depending on a number of key factors that need to be paid close attention to.

Phase 4, the game begins:

\- This is where the bulk of investors will come in. While we are not early anymore, we are well into this bull market and it still has some legs left. Some people might start taking profits here and leave before the game ends. This can be a smart plan, as scaling out into strength will save you from being hit by phase 6 once it rolls around. In this phase it is clear we are in a full-fledged bull market and it will become more and more regularly discussed by investment communities. Institutional money will be well positioned at this point and will look for a possible exit. I am currently writing an exit strategy on it, based both on history, market psychology and asset valuations. I am not able to share this, as it wouldn’t be fair to my platform, so I apologize for that. This phase will likely be the most volatile as a whole.

Phase 5, the final minutes:

\- As with every highly cyclical bull market, all good things most come to an end. Just like with a game that is all tied a few minutes before the final whistle, emotions are running high and you will see people scrambling to get a glance at the game. This is when general media such as CNBC and investors on social media will be talking about uranium as being “the next big thing”. This is a massive red flag. Yes, you might want to watch this game till the end, but it is much better to try and get out before the mass euphoria reaches its peak. When you see that uranium is as broadly discussed as things like digital meme dogs or EV's for example are right now and spot price severely overshooting the long term price, there is no reason to not take out most of your profits and watch this game go into phase 6.

Phase 6, the game ends (2025):

\- As I said before, all cyclical bull markets must eventually come to an end and this one will be no different. While the timing of this, which I think will be somewhere around 2025, is nothing more than a calculated bet (it could be longer, but also shorter, depending on prevailing market specific but also broad equity market circumstances), fact remains that the final blow off peak we saw in phase 5 in the final minutes of the game will be just as steep to the downside. This will leave a lot of people holding the bag and it will be a rough wake up call, don’t be left standing when the doors close and the lights go out.

Conclusion:

When a game is exciting, you want to stay till the end to make sure you don’t miss anything, this is very understandable as it is human nature to want to get the most out of something. However, the risk associated with trying to time the whistle to the minute is not worth it in my opinion. This doesn’t mean you should sell before the bus even arrives at the stadium, but perhaps it is smart to consider scaling out every few minutes and leave only a very small position (or nothing at all of course) to watch the final minutes of this game. Phases and associated timelines can shift very quickly, so make sure you are adaptive, patient and disciplined, because this will be quite the game and no one will know how long it will last. It could be 4 years, but it could also only be 1 or 2. You have to be adaptive and make sure you have the right information and strategy to make the most of this opportunity. Thank you for reading and as always I wish you all a great day."

You can then go onto your broker's website and type in the ticker and look the charts and the financial information that you use to decide what the value of that stock should be.  

If you watch these price target changes every day (especially later in the day), you'll start to notice some tickers appearing frequently. Keep an eye on what analysts are saying about those stocks and watch what direction the stock moves.  This can help you know what's going to happen to the price of a particular stock before it happens.

2021-05-05 16:57:44,stocks,"A few tips and things to be aware of:

Only a relatively small number of stocks are responsible for the stock market’s gains. Those are often those large companies you mentioned.

It sounds like you want small and midcaps which have a huge potential for returns, but the volatility can be nuts and research into the companies becomes crucial. If you can stomach the rollercoaster ride and have the time to learn even basic fundamental analysis (Fundamental Analysis for Dummies, seriously, it a good book for this), it’s a start. As many have mentioned, ETFs might be the way to go and/or sticking with large caps if the above sounds unpalatable.

Sometimes, it’s just as easy to invest in companies and sectors you know. 

As for companies that make and do stuff for other companies, you want to look up ‘pick and shovel’ stocks. Applied Materials is a good example of this in the semi-conductor industry."

The top holdings are here: https://etfmg.com/holdings/MJ_fund_holdings.csv?=1620230786


So you can see this ETF holds all of these stocks in this alternative Harvest ETF. 

You could take a look at the price of some of the individual stocks it holds and say hey that sounds interesting  and do some research. 

It’s basically just to start finding stocks in a specific field

ETFs don't just hold stocks/equities, depending on the ETF, the holdings could include bonds etc. but yeah, just whatever makes up a given ETF.

So this guy is saying if you think a sector is ripe for some success, check out some ETFs in that sector.  You could just bung your money in the ETF or look into what they hold and maybe bung your money into some specific companies instead, if you like the look of them for whatever reason."

I expect them to beat earnings and give better guidance 

Long-Term I really like the stock b/c of the TAM, Growth, and the future of plant-based meats.

With a $8 billion market cap, I can easily see this 10X within 5-10 years.

People are starting to eat healthier and I am betting on Ethan Brown a visionary CEO to do this.

While there may be competition they have partnerships with YUM Brands, McDonalds, PepsiCo, and others. This gives them quite the competitive advantage going forward.  They’re trying to dominate locally and then expand which is the smartest idea.

Half of the food Americans eat is takeout and I believe that if we go through some sort of frugal decade people in general wil start to eat more healthier and start to be more conscious of what they eat

Even if this is not the case, BYND will be in McDonalds and those big branded restaurants so people will have the choice to order from them. 

Think about it like this: How many times have you gone to McDonalds or fast food and thought to yourself “ I feel guilty for ordering this Big Mac or this disgusting chicken sandwhich”.

Truly health-conscious people eat whole foods, not processed foods.  The fake meat products taste pretty darn good, but are still high in sodium and saturated fat, which defeats some of the purpose of consuming them.

While Beyond and Impossible appeal to vegetarians who miss an occasional hamburger, or someone at McDonalds - like you say - who feels guilty, I am not sure it's a real growth product.  It hasn't met its potential yet in any case.  Part of this is because someone who's at McD's in the first place is there for a guilty pleasure, not to compromise on some less-bad-for-you meal.

Finally, the partners are big enough players in the food industry that they may eventually create their own plant alternatives, leaving Beyond, er... behind - as it were.

Heavily manipulated and manhandled by short sellers until the momentum and culture/paradigm shift caught up and there was no dismissing it. And you know how quickly it climbed after the tipping point. It wasn't just technicals and fundamentals, it was because short selling allows for artificially devaluing a stock price at the whim of hedge funds and market makers that reap profits from their machinations that are ignored by the SEC. 

So, with the plant based movement growing exponentially - it's crazy to me that Seaspiracy was top of Netflix's watch list for so long - it's just a matter of time.

Considering Tyson (was on Beyond’s board and then gave up all their seats and sold their position citing a conflict of interest; pretty much sealed the deal for never investing in BYND. 

Tyson learned what they needed to without buying the company, then will use their superior logistics to undercut. Their plant-based chicken nuggets are already in stores and they just launched their meatless burgers.

>Don’t sleep on this paradigm shift in consumer choice because of your own preferences!

O rly...

Flavor is easier to replicate than supply chain, logistics, and buying power.

The Tyson fake chicken is a good product. Bought a bag on accident and no one noticed a difference.

Tyson’s meatless burger has not been shipped to stores yet. It was announced a couple days ago. So not sure what taste you’re speaking to.

Tyson was the one on Beyond’s board. 

My comment was in addition to the parent comment. It’s not all about taste.

It’s also important that a manufacturer like Tyson can introduce hybrid low-meat options and market higher protein and lower sodium than plant based competitors. That reaches a wider audience. Beyond cannot do this as it completely contradicts their mission.

Also, the day Tyson announced their burgers, BYND fell 3.5% and Tyson climbed 1.2%."
2021-05-05 12:26:01,stocks,"An entire food universe including vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, legumes, and whole grains is also not meat and is there for the taking.  In other words, a world of pre-existing whole and natural foods already solves our nutrition problems and obviates the need for meat.

BYND is a single company making a tiny range of niche food products. It is not a status brand like TSLA or a required solution in the food space.

(I am not a vegetarian or vegan, for the record, although I've dabbled in those choices.)

Electric cars, on the other hand, are not a niche product.  They are definitely the way of the future. And TSLA is a status brand amongst them, making them ""cool"" for those who fear being derided in a Prius. I just don't see the link between TSLA and BYND here."

2021-05-05 12:10:04,stocks,"The Tyson Chicken Raised and Rooted, right? It's decent but it's actually not plant based in the truest sense. They use egg. As someone that has cut out meat and dairy, I learned as much because my partner and I had severe cramps all night after eating the stuff. It's really misleading packaging, disingenuous even. 

So far I haven't found a really great vegan chicken option. Curious how the Beyond ones they trialled at KFC will be. My favorite so far I found at Wegmans - a jackfruit based 'chicken nugget'. 

I don't agree with how simple folks think it is to make products like these. Just as a consumer, I love trying all the new brands especially the smaller local ones. And I'm usually left in dismay at how bad they are and how expensive.

I meant Nestles burgers. Talking about the big manufacturers in general. Tyson specifically has had a half plant based and meat blend burger on the market for over a year. I've never tried that because it's got meat in it. My dad did however and said it was an awful frankenstein. And again, to really know what the sentiment is on these you have to talk to the ground floor employees selling them. And it's that they're waste of space, poorly marketed. Wind up moved to frozen bc nobody wants them. The hybrid options alienate everyone and they offer no superior taste or health benefit. Imo the fact that's the direction these guys took first shows how poorly they understand the consumers they are targeting.

As far as big brands go, Wegmans generic plant based items are probably the best of the lot. I literally try every single brand, so I'm not casually tossing out contenders I promise. 

Like you noted - production and distribution will also come into play here and both Beyond and Impossible have been creating their foundation of supply chain for a decade now. Their pricing is getting competitive. I also think the branding will play a role.

It's actually mind blowing how inept the bearish sentiment is on the likes of Beyond and Impossible. It's like Tesla's early days. I genuinely can't fathom how some of these so called elite analysts never learn. They comment and make decisions from their own bubble and preconceived notions without even the most basic of homework. Like with Tesla, back in 2014 I remember feeling like I saw double the number of them on the road. Then the following year again. Their showroom in the mall was next to the apple store and had a similar crowd. It was all right in front of my eyes. I guess the difference is I was commuting 90 min to work and going to the mall as opposed to taking a cab to my madison ave 50th floor office. Same thing with these plant based companies. I have to make my decision on the word of mouth from the likes of grocery store employees and my own experience."
2021-05-05 12:02:42,stocks,"Yeah, I agree. Morningstar Farms (Kellogg) and Tyson both have really good imitation chicken products. The scale you need to have to compete in food is immense."
2021-05-05 12:56:37,stocks,"You could be right to some extent. But at the moment that's my perspective personally speaking, partly because I personally feel that it is becoming a lifestyle branding effort. Both Impossible and Beyonds social media campaigns aren't solely focused on the food. It's a lot of emphasis on changing the world and impact. We've seen how powerful that social mission has been for the development of brands in the last decade as the influx of younger consumers crave that story. 

I can't remember the quote, saw it trending on reddit or twitter, somewhere. Something along the lines of Gen X and Millennials looking back at the generation prior as the most selfish and destructive to the world, across all areas. ""boomers f*cked makind"" something like that.

So thinking beyond status in the traditional sense, there's a place for these ""niche"" companies. And that goes beyond the food space as well. I look at Virgin empire and envision a more contemporary set that can become blue chips of sorts a decade on"

I’ll admit I over estimated the hybrid products. Those are a bust.

BYND may produce returns, who knows. If you believe this, then now is a good price. The stock is battered because of 3 poor quarters of financials when almost all other food manufacturer financials are improving.

Wonder if it's still as crispy. Also wonder if the stock situation might be like Qorn. They were supposed to become all vegan a few years ago but I routinely find stores with egg version in the freezer. If they have made the change then I have to temper mh opinion - maybe they are finally learning more about the customer base. Will be interesting to see how their burger tastes vs Impossible 3.0 and Beyonds own third iteration that came out. Can they ever keep up with those two/will they ever seek to or just launch products to compete with the big hitters (burger, beef nuggets)?

From an investing perspective I really don't follow some of what I've seen, both here and places like seeking alpha. Your opinion is pretty well-balanced and time will tell. But then there's those that say competiton will be eat into revenue etc etc referring to companies like Meatless Co and Tattooed Butcher. The latter in particular I've seen thrown around A LOT on subs. I don't fancy their stuff much and wonder about the motivation behind some of those voices when they are so bearish on Beyond and the eventual Impossible listing."

IRS decisions are not always immutable, so trusting what someone else got them to agree to is a crapshoot.

2021-05-05 00:00:00,stocks,"Some thoughts about the current state of the market. *This is a weird market right now.  Markets are at the whim of Yellen and Jay Pow, there's uncertainty due to Covid, inflation fears, lots of new money and retail coming in.  Is this sustainable?  Are we headed for doomsday?  Here are my thoughts on all of this.  (Originally meant as a response to the daily thread so it may seem kind of comment-y)*

Me personally I have decided that even if we have a major correction I still like the fundamentals.  There are things to watch out for like high levels of federal and corporate debt, but I don't realistically see that as being an issue at least in the next 10 or so years.  Not all the debt is being put to good use but a lot of it is... the US economy still looks strong and growing.  Inflation is a concern as well, but one can hedge against that and I don't think we'll experience anything truly terrifying like hyperinflation.

The economy is opening back up.  There's pent-up demand for consumer goods and for travel, which encompasses various industries itself.  Biden is pumping money into infrastructure.  High-growth opportunities exist, as we all know, with tech in AI, cloud computing, EVs, renewable energy, etc.  The outlook looks healthy IMO.

Uncertainty around the corner, for sure.  Geopolitical tensions with China (not expecting war but this is a new dynamic).  Climate change.  Inequality and rising debt.  Definitely unprecedented challenges here.  But again, I don't see this as being a serious issue at least for another 10 years if not further out.  An optimist's take would be that, despite a lot of BS in dealing with Covid (anti-masing, anti-vaxxing, etc.), it seems like humanity did alright.  We could have done a lot better, for sure, and I'm sorry for anyone who lost loved ones to this.  But we could have done a lot worse, too.  That makes me somewhat optimistic even in the face of these long-term challenges.

I like the way Biden is handling things, too.  I didn't vote for him.  I actually didn't vote (shoot me).  But from the madness in the Capital to the way things are looking now... this looks like improvement.  It's may not be major, but at least we're headed in the right direction now.  This makes me optimistic for the future as well.

But again, folks.  In the next 10 years or so I'm not really worried at all.  Longer-term, let's see.

This is coming from a new investor who was hesitant about putting his money in to the market this year.  I did the research and I've gotten a handle on things, and my conclusion is what everyone has always said: ""time in the market beats timing the market"".  Now is as good a time as any to invest.  Even if the market falls off a cliff tomorrow, as long as you're accumulating good assets then you're good to go.  I'm sure we've all heard of ""Bob the world's worst market timer"".  He made it out alright.  (If you don't know about him, see [here](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2014/02/worlds-worst-market-timer/)).

I recommend diversification, too.  I'm mostly in index funds and that includes VXUS, also.  I also like dividend paying stocks (more than bonds at the moment).  Nothing wrong with alternative assets like real estate or precious metals, either.  Be smart, be safe, and I think we'll be good to go.

This is just what I've gathered over the last few months of diving into all this and doing my research.  I'm new but FWIW my degree was in economics and I've been using that as a launching point to really dive into trying to understand what's going on right now.  The outlook to me looks good... just be smart, and reevaluate a little later on down the line.

And do your own research, of course. =\]"

That makes me somewhat optimistic even in the face of these long-term challenges.

What I've been thinking the past year is: It's amazing how well prepared we were for a *total shutdown*. Video conferencing, online shopping, an mRNA-based Covid vaccine in one year... if this virus had hit us 20 years ago, we would have been much worse off. This is the closet optimist in me speaking but I interpret the positive market trends as the world economy having been tested, like never before, and it staying quite strong all things considered.

I think it will take another year or two to see how it works out long term. But we could be in a way worse position right now. Consider how much stupidity had to be overcome, it's amazing we found a path out of this at all, even if we've not yet escaped."

I was researching BHP and came across a copper mine in Arizona they are trying to develop.   Copper is expensive right now and any green infrastructure will need a lot of it.  They've been trying to get permission to start developing the mine since 2012 !!! If they finally get permission the expectation is ten years to develop before full production.  

This is one example,  but it's representative of how long it takes to bring new supply of anything to market.   Cape wind started trying to get permission to build in 2009 and died in 2017.

Fracking undercut OPEC and limited the price they could charge.   Fracking is now limited by both a lack of capital and political limits so drilling new wells aren't going to happen quickly but OPEC will raise supply at some point to balance more money vs incentives to Fracking investments.   I'm guessing $80 to $90 per barrel,  but that's just a WAG.  Big oil is plenty profitable now and pays a nice dividend but a crazy price squeeze isn't likely."

2021-05-05 10:10:57,stocks,"I have a crazy amount of faith in RocketLab, which is becoming public in early Q3 though a SPAC, currently trading under the ticker VACQ. I've looked a lot into space plays that I can make now for the long-term (or even medium term in this case if you'd like), and rocketlab is the most solid space company around after SpaceX. They have actual products, having already launched 104 satellites (next launch is on the 15th!), plus they've also contracted with NASA to be part of the Artemis mission to the moon (sending the Capstone probe) and the Mars missions in the future. Their thing is 3D-Printed reusable rockets in the small-medium satellite space, which with the growing demand of constellations is going to be a big industry in my opinion. They are now based in the USA, but were founded and still heavily operate in New Zealand, having launch sites in both countries - with the New Zealand location actually having the highest available launch frequency in the world. Based on other DD I've read, financials look very strong and might actually be underestimated, and employee experience within the company is also really good, which I believe is an important factor in long-term outlooks of a company. I could go on and on about this company because I truly believe in its future potential, but it's worth looking into yourself. VACQ is currently trading so close to NAV that the risk is relatively low IMO, especially because I do not expect this merger to fall through given the legitimacy and future potential of the company (compared to a lot of other lackluster space companies/spacs right now - cough cough Virgin Galactic). This play is pretty under the radar at the moment I think, once people hear about its potential and realized that if you want to invest in SpaceX, this might be the next best thing, people will jump all over it, so this might be an opportunity to jump in at the ground floor.

2021-05-05 00:00:00,stocks,"Norwegian Air Shuttle Hello, im new to trading and was hoping someone could help me understand the current norwegian situation. Lets say i have 200 stocks and now due to company restructuring more stock is being introduced. As far as i understand i now have the right to buy 300 additional stock for 6NOK a piece?

2021-05-05 06:22:01,stocks,Yes in a preferential rights issue the existing shareholders have the right to purchase in the mentioned ratio - this one being 3 for every 2 held. Generally you can also subscribe for more if you wish as everyone may not purchase their quota and you may be allocated additional shares that you pay for (assuming the rules of Norway allow this).
2021-05-05 06:40:33,stocks,how is the price 6nok for the new shares when it's trading at 40nok at the moment. won't this cause a massive drop with the ratio being off by that much? (even more than the 50% drop yesterday)
2021-05-05 08:48:45,stocks,"How do you exercise this right? I also have stocks in NAS, but dont know how to buy the stock for 6nok."
2021-05-05 07:00:00,stocks,The price will be adjusted in the ratio of the issue which is why it always makes sense for existing shareholders to exercise the rights issue; assuming of course you still believe in the company
2021-05-05 08:52:14,stocks,Don't know yet. Talked to my bank and according to them its not time sensitive so gonna wait a few days and see what's up
2021-05-05 07:07:42,stocks,"Which you should not in this case. Crap stock, diluted, uncertain future at best, higher valuation than pre covid if you account for dilution. Just a personal reflection."
2021-05-05 07:08:25,stocks,"I will definitely exercise at that price, i mean it would be crazy not to, when the price is around 40NOK right?"
2021-05-05 07:30:50,stocks,That's upto you mate depending on where you think the stock is going to go. I don't track it and know pretty much nothing about the company to comment on whether you should exercise or not

I'm thinking I should I pull out, move on, and ignore the noise from people saying ""you'll be missing out on gains"",  ""you're not keeping up with inflation"", ""money in your savings is dead money with terrible interest rates"". Honestly, how am I keeping up with inflation by losing consistently on my investments, fx conversions and trade fees? I kept up with inflation much better before I started investing, was not missing out on gains cause my money would at least go up instead of down, and sure my money felt a little stagnant but at least it wasn't vanishing into thin air every day! I don't believe I am cut out for the market and I think I'm slowly coming to terms with that."

1 - sell mega caps high

2 - blast to the financial media that there is a rotation out of tech.

3 - retail sells

4 - mega funds rebuy at a lower price

Market manipulation at its finest.  I know nothing will be done about it, but its complete bullshit.  They made an insane amount of money over the past 24 hours."

Looks like these stocks and ETFs (like ARKs) will probably slowly bleed down over the course of the year. The big question is, when will they run up again? curious to hear thoughts.

I'm thinking early to mid next year for EV before nio starts heading towards 45 consistenyl, and a few years ahead for other specs like palantir to reach back to 25-30 a share.

I'm looking at the NASDAQ and drew a trendline using the close on 3/8, 3/25, and 3/30.  It looks like the NASDAQ moved up, hit that trendline, and moved back down, suggesting it may be acting as resistance.

There are quite a few trades I'm eyeing, but think I'll wait until we either consolidate above or break below.

Be careful guys and gals, this might be the initial wave of ""buying the dip"" (it's not uncommon to get a bounce on the way down)

Edit - I'm not saying it will or will not move down--nobody knows that  I'm just suggesting that you use stops and limits, maybe tighten them if you have profits, and stick to your trading plan.

Edit - Just saw this pop up on Marketwatch (not trying to spread FUD, but it seems to corroborate my suspicions that institutional traders may be offloading)

I’ve lost lots of money on stocks that just randomly open -5% and I never had a chance to sell because the price moved past my stop loss while the market was closed.  

With a 24/7 market, my stop losses hit every time.   

That being said, I’m not ditching stocks for crypto, but it’s an interesting argument in favour of a 24/7 stock market."

So isn't it risky to buy some stocks at the moment? Aren't people new in the market (because of the pandemic) and need their money in one/two years?
Is the market not certainly high at the moment and won't it collapse in one/two years?

But if ARKK breaks the March lows and can't reverse, I expect that everything else is not going to be so lucky this time and that will be the end to the 6 month trend for the Dow and S&P too then. With the way it's going, neither will really get hit ""that"" hard if so though (probably 5-7%) and the trend will be the continuing story of ARKK type names continuing to get an a** beating."

I remember people being all up in a tizzy about how there are no commission charges for selling stocks on their platform because they track your trading habits and sell that information to hedgies or whatever. Does this mean that all non-commission brokerages are like this? I stopped using Robinhood because of all of the backlash they were getting without fully understanding why they were frowned upon: should I really care if they use/sell my information? I mean, most companies nowadays do anyways...

As of now, I use Merrill Lynch because I know they are an established financial company that have been around for many years. However, they don't charge a commission fee for selling stocks either... does that mean they use/sell my info as well? And if that's the case, is Robinhood really all that bad?

2021-05-05 16:56:23,stocks,"If you could control the price of a stock, what would you do to make lots of money?

I asked that hypothetical question myself last night and came up with what I think is an interesting answer. My answer starts with my understanding that short term prices are mostly based upon emotions, with fundamentals and analyst opinions factoring into those emotions. Long term prices typically fall into line with fundamentals. The emotions are basically greed and fear. Nobody can magically impact financials, but impacting emotions is not only easier, but it happens all the time.

So here’s what I would do. I would start with a volatile stock that has lots of support and hopes of quickly rising prices. I would buy some calls and help that stock rise slowly by buying shares carefully and slowly as the prices rise. Then, after selling my calls and buying puts, I would quickly drive the price downward with selling spurts. The slow buying encourages greedy buying, the quick selling triggers panic selling. Once I have sold my puts, I can repeat the process.

Now tell me, this isn’t such a crazy idea is it. I bet you have seen stocks moving in patterns that match this idea. 
Is it illegal?"

For some of these companies I just can't quite shake the feeling that it's a big bag holding exercise where angel investors and midlevel++ employees hand over inflated shares in return for cash. That's the real money here, working some dead end sales job at ""Peloton, what's that?"" in 2013

2021-05-05 19:48:36,stocks,"It’s the specter of rising interest rates.

Generally speaking, a REIT is heavily incentivized under tax law to pay 90% of its earnings as a dividend. 

The REITs you posted I believe buy long mortgages. They borrow with shorter term credit facilities and notes. The difference between long and short rates is how you, as an investor, make money. 

When rates are going down, the mortgages those REITs own are worth more. When rates go up, the value of the mortgage typically goes down. If they borrow 2 year paper today for 2% and own 30 year paper that yields say 5%, they just print money. It's a great business. But that 5% mortgage is what it is. At 6%, they are suddenly upside down and because rates have gone up, the value of their collateral, which is the long mortgages they own, shrinks.

Now bull’s will say that REITs have enough cash on hand to figure it out and they’re smart enough not to refinance at the top end of the interest rate cycle.

Bears will obviously say otherwise.

I think the takeaway point is that since REITs are almost always going to be sending out **90%** of their profit income as a dividend then they’re essentially sending out the highest value to investors as they can. Even a slight change in profit affects investors bottom line. There’s no fat to trim even if the core business is doing great... but even a small change to 90% ends up being a lot of money"

If it were me, I would stage my buy in over the course of a month or two and keep 30% in cash on the off chance things really nose dive. There is the inflation concern that could become a very real thing if the FED does raise rates. However if you entered your position in say QQQ or VOO buying in slowly on red days and getting your average as low as possible while keeping 30% in cash then I'd say you would be prime to take advantage of any major correction stemming from interest rates rising."
2021-05-05 10:02:00,stocks,"Hard to really say if there will be a collapse. There may be a correction in the near future, which would most likely occur in the event that the Fed hikes rates and/or tapers easing faster than expected. However there has been persistent talk of a crash really since we bottomed out on March 23 of last year, and we are up big time since then. So a lot of people that have been waiting for an eventual correction/crash have missed out on one of the best 12 month periods for stocks in decades.

If you're in for the longer term then your entry point does not really matter as much, although obviously no one wants to buy at the top. As the other commenter said, most of the expensive valuations are in tech (especially EV), so there's not a lot out there in that industry that is a great buy at the moment. Personally, the only thing in tech that I'm considering loading up on in tech atm is AMD, since they reported blowout earnings but the stock has traded down 10% since then. There's probably better buys in other industries at this point, but if you want to own tech and simultaneously worried about a crash, you're gonna have to pick and choose wisely."
2021-05-05 09:22:44,stocks,"Well there is definitely a lot of overvalued stuff out there (especially tech and EV), however the current stock market is really weird right now that I don’t even know what to buy. Every time the fed talks the market drops. Yesterday was a very broad red day, personally I bought CRSR because they had very good financial results and still went down due to the overall market sentiment. 

A good stock would also be O, (Realty Income Corp.), which is still on its way to pre pandemic levels and beyond. A very good dividend stock as well."
2021-05-05 15:40:47,stocks,"How do you know it’ll go back up long term? It’s a growing company, but its current price is completely detached from its earnings. 

Even if Nio becomes a major EV player now and in the future, the price of the stock is not going to scale with its growth. 

I’ve said this before as an example, but Nio produced ~20k cars last quarter and Ford made ~500k. Yet somehow Nio’s market cap is almost double. 

Nio is overpriced in my opinion."

2021-05-05 16:20:47,stocks,"Depends on how that tax hike and spending bill comes out, if tax hike is more than 25% and spending bill didn’t get cut down much, raw material price like lumber will go up even more. People will flock to crypto, banks, materials while mid cap tech will get crushed from both tax hike, rising rates and inflation. The only tech stocks that might survive is semis and big tech, they can just raise prices together. Mid and more aggressive growth tech stocks will be severely hurt. 

If manchin negotiated both spending and tax hike down, mid and small cap tech might have a big comeback probably back to January highs, still don’t think February highs is possible this year no matter what. Not even if the whole tax hike and spending bill is blocked, that high was just overvaluation."

Once that petered out, you saw the Nasdaq follow it up by hitting correction territory at the fastest rate ever apparently (I couldn’t link you but I’ve seen that in two areas).

Even if you don’t play options, option buying can drive the market (on both sides to boot as well).

That happening is a much bigger problem.

And based off what's been going on, I don't think the major averages going into correction territory is going to be very helpful to the cause. Well, it might be helpful in that everything else needs to get corrective before it gets better for fun/speculative stuff, but if...let's say the Nasdaq/.IXIC is headed back to the low 13k's, my suspicion is that ARKK would fail around where it is (the best gauge for risk appetite)."

The reason I'm not using the 50 is that it hasn't generally respected the 50.  The lows tend to respect the 100-day during dips which tends to correspond closely with the trend line I drew.

I know this and I don't mind getting in now, but this is the reason I am afraid for.
It may be the best period in stockmarket, so it's on its top right? Doesn't this mean it will go significantly lower on a certain point? And if I buy stocks now, I will definitely have a hardtime getting profit out of it when it once it is at a low point, right? 

>If you're in for the longer term then your entry point does not really matter as much

I am not willing to spend everyday on the market. I am indeed in for the longer term (4 to 7 years, something like that). But see my fear above. Whenever I buy now, and let's say in one year the economic will go down (which I expect (lots of unemployment, lots of bankruptcy, higher prices vs lower incomes etc)). At a certain point it must go up, but will it be that much I will take a good profit?

2021-05-05 15:06:51,stocks,"[https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amzn](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amzn)

Well, if we look at the stock price over the past 3 years:

1997-2018 it had a fairly consistent run up to $1900

2018-2020 were flat

2020 had a huge breakout up to $3300

2021 we've seen the stock hit a high of $3550 on this last earnings report and despite the sell-off this past week the stock continues to fluctuate around $3300.

I'd be more concerned about ""sideways"" trading if we hadn't recently seen very convincing upward movement on very strong earnings. Yeah, we could be in a relatively flat period like 2018-2020, but the company seems poised for more.

How soon that is is totally a valid question.

Personally I have a share and I feel confident that I'll be able to escape at a fairly profitable position (e.g. as in last week at $3550), even if I have to wait 3-12 months. Of note, even in the ""flat"" trading from 2018-2020 there were very definite peaks where one could get out of a position at a good profit."

Take ETFs for example, half this subreddit has money in the ARK meme ETFs. When you sell that because it’s a piece of crap, you’re not only selling overvalued stocks like Tesla, but you’re also selling AAPL and other stable, profitable companies. So they all take a hit."

You gotta buy stuff with personal targets in mind. Doing what the crowd blindly tells ya to do will get ya burned in a heartbeat. Especially when it’s based on pure speculation. 

AMZN is a strong company that’s pretty safe to invest in almost regardless of when you buy but it won’t make you rich instantly. Something you gotta hold for a while to really see ROI. Especially if you bought in recently. 

Regarding current price, The market is in a funky spot right now and might need some time to sort itself out but as long as nothing horrible happens to the company itself there’s no reason to to panic sell it unless you think you’re overexposed and need to rebalance like I did with it several months ago.

PS: Earnings tend to be volatile time for stocks cause that’s when many take profit. As long as the company keeps it up, the price will generally move past this with time. If anything you may want to wait after earnings for some companies so you can snag a bargain price in all the mania."

2021-05-05 11:09:49,stocks,"His point is that if you think the stock will go back to your original price, why aren't you doubling down? And if you don't think it will get back to your original price, why are you still holding it? Simply holding because you're not comfortable admitting the loss is a dangerous mentality, and lots of people (including yourself) get caught holding the bag because of it.

As for what you should do in your situation? Well, that's something only you can decide. It depends wildly on many different factors, such as what stock you're holding, why you're holding it, how long you intend to hold it, if anything has changed about the underlying company since you've bought it, how much of your portfolio it is, and much much more.

I can't tell you what to do, and frankly you shouldn't listen to anyone on reddit that does tell you what to do. You've gotta figure it out yourself. Even if I did tell you *what I would* *do*, maybe the opposite will happen and you'd end up feeling like an idiot because you based your financial decision making off of an anonymous reddit comment.

2021-05-05 13:00:38,stocks,"> My opinion is that the market is quite at its top atm and there will be a reset

There absolutely will be a reset at some point but will that be next month, next year or in five years? We don't know. People were saying the market was at the top for months last year but it kept going higher. For a massive reset there is usually a catalyst. That catalyst could be Fed raising rates or something else. That was my point in holding 30% in cash. In the event it plummets, you don't want to sell and realize those losses but with 30% cash it would allow you to lower your average considerably when it bottoms out. You'd then be able to ride it back up and bank some serious profits. Once it starts to reach new ATH's then you would sell some to take some profit and replace that 30% in cash. From that point let it ride and enjoy more profit or wait for the next correction. Rinse and repeat."
2021-05-05 15:46:24,stocks,">Doesn't this mean it will go significantly lower on a certain point?

Not necessarily. The year following most recessions often has outsized returns because the market overshoots to the downside. For example, in the 12 months following the great recession, the stock market rose 71%, which is quite close to the 74% return we saw in the 12 months following the coronavirus crash. And there was another 10 years of gains to be had after that period. Similarly, the tech bubble of the late 90s gave outsized returns for five consecutive years. No one would've wanted to wait out the gains of 96-2000 just because the S&P rose 34% in 1995. 

The real reason for worry about overvaluations is that, considering the economic conditions, the market did not fall that much to begin with, and because interest rates are so low, there aren't really many good alternative investment options besides the stock market, so everyone is disproportionately funneling their money into it. The other side of the coin, though, is the tremendous amount of Fed support that essentially has the market believing that Powell can cancel any recession by slashing rates and printing endless money. Who's to say the Fed keeps rates at zero and doesn't stop QE for years? I mean it just happened last decade with the recession. Rates were kept at zero and QE was enabled all the way until 2015. The only chance that we see a real, steep correction is if Powell is forced to raise rates and taper QE because of inflation. Otherwise, the economy will be pumped hard for the next few years, and so will the stock market. If you wait on the sidelines, you're essentially banking on inflation getting out of control in the near future (which is obviously possible, but I wouldn't 100% count on it). 

I think what u/Fearstruk said is the best idea: invest most of what you want to invest now and keep a somewhat sizeable portion, like 30%, aside in cash so that you can still take advantage of a correction if one occurs in the near future, without running the risk of missing out on gains if a correction never appears or only appears much later than you expect.

>At a certain point it must go up, but will it be that much I will take a good profit?

Seven years is a long enough time horizon where you are very likely going to see gains on your investments, even if you went all in at the top and then saw like a 30% correction immediately after. Again, this is where I direct you to what u/Fearstruk said, because having some cash on the side will dramatically lower the chance of you getting screwed by bad timing.

>Like what? Bio-industry? Healthcare? Energy (curious to this industry as well)?

Well that's where doing your own research comes into play. The point was that tech is at an outsized risk for a major correction compared to all of the other industries since their valuations are stretched much further than any other sector. You're going to find better risk/reward in stocks in those other industries than you will tech, especially if you believe that there will be a correction in the near term. Energy could be a decent value play, but a lot of the upside has already been realized this year."
2021-05-05 10:03:08,stocks,"Personally I would tell new investors to hold their horses and be very aware that 2021 will not be like 2020 for the stock market, but I could be completely wrong. At the end of the day it’s speculation in either direction, but be aware of what the Fed does because the market is very volatile when they speak. And even if you play it safe there are still no guarantees. 

The way I invest currently is more short to medium term, simply because I fear a correction. And always keep a significant amount of cash ready for opportunities. But I won’t lie I also have some risky investments as well pt. I diversify by having Danish, Norwegian and American stocks that are also very good long term, and a bit of cryp.to. But at the end of the day the American market decides where we are heading."

2021-05-05 00:00:00,stocks,"ETF portfolio feedback Hi All,

I was hoping for some feedback on my current ETF portfolio as a long term investment.

I hold: VUSA (60%) , INRG (20%) , IITU (10%) and ECAR (10%)

I’m wondering whether to sell off my shares in IITU as a few companies overlap into the S&P 500 ETF which I hold (VUSA). Then rebalancing my ETF portfolio to: VUSA (70%) , INRG (20%) and ECAR (10%). 

The other option was to add a high dividend yield ETF as I’ll be using this as a retirement fund.

Any feedback / sensible suggestions welcomed and appreciated. Thanks."

2021-05-05 10:11:14,stocks,Half a share of BRK
2021-05-05 11:13:33,stocks,"Ok, some great answers here, some terrible, and some terribly funny. 

I split my money up a bit. First, I have cash in a regular bank account for monthly expenses. Then, I have my “grown-up portfolio”. That’s a mix of equities in all 11 sectors and a number of ETFs. Please note here... if you own Tesla directly and own an S&P and own a whole market & own ARKK, you’re basically buying a whole bunch of Tesla. So balance your ETFs out beyond just the top 5 or 6 companies that dominate the entire market. 

I have small, mid, and large cap ETFs. These are fire and forget. Put the money in and don’t look at it ever again until you retire. 

My horizon is 20-25 years so I have more in direct stocks than in safer, more boring broad market funds. Of those, some are value and some are growth. 

Then I started to play with my bonus income on my own, outside of the portfolio. I went into genomics, MRNA, stuff like that, I went into weed, I went into some Overweight international companies that I think can give me a 50% return in 2-5 years. I am looking to beat the grown-up portfolio here. I research to exhaustion, I buy dips, I almost never sell. If I buy it means I really believe it will grow to a certain target within 3-5 years or better. 

Then I tossed some into Dogecoin... and lo! Only my Tesla has outperformed this goofy crypto. I was super conservative so I won’t be a millionaire. That was the right decision. I’m too old and have too many dependents to YOLO on memes. But if you quit smoking, drinking, or buying lattes at Starbucks you really should use that “found money” in something crazy every once in a while. 

Also, NEVER fall victim to FOMO or Paper Hands. This is a business. Emotion has no place in sound investing. Set your rules, set your percentages, set your entry and exit strategies, then stick to the plan. Readjust the plan periodically to make sure it still makes sense, but stick to what you decide is best for you in that moment. 

Finally, whatever Elon Musk does... do that. He’s never let me down."
2021-05-05 04:31:52,stocks,"I’ll use ETFs only to keep it really simple. 

In your 20s: 50% VOO, 25% VGT/VUG, 25% ARKK or another thematic investment ETF

30s: 50% VOO, 10% VTI, 25% VGT/VUG, 15% ARKK or another thematic investment ETF

40s: 50% VOO, 20% VTI, 20% VGT/VUG, 10% ARKK or another thematic investment ETF

50s: 50% VOO, 30% VTI, 15% VGT/VUG, 5% ARKK or another thematic investment ETF

60s+: 50% VOO, 30% VTI, VYM 20%

When you’re young you want to build wealth and invest in high risk investments. As you get older you want to reduce risk by investing in safer ETFs. Everyone’s answer will be different bc their goals are different but I hope this makes sense. I wouldn’t start chasing dividends until your 40s or 50s. Again it depends on goals and where you are in life but when you begin to work less it’s nice to have a passive income stream from dividends."

2021-05-05 09:07:28,stocks,"Frankly 200k isn’t enough to really have a huge meaningful impact on your day to day life in terms of investing, IMO. Meaning, it’s not such a large sum that I would do much different than if it was 10k. Safest play is index funds, and you’ll have a few million extra when you retire at 55. 

House seems pretty good too, if you don’t have on already, but the interest rate of return of S&P 500 (6%) still gonna be higher than what your mortgage interests rate is (currently around 31% I think?), So even then you’re probably better off just putting your 20% down and putting the rest into the market in something safe and long-term."

Another fun idea when you have that much money is putting it in something like PSEC that pays a monthly dividend. IIRC each share gives about 6 cents per month. 200k / 8 per share = 25,000 shares. At 6 cents a month each you would be getting 1.5k deposited each month, either let it grow from there or cash it out each month and use it to coast through life."

Not necessarily the 50,50,50,50 ratio but you get the point, which is that in a bull market you get some of the upside of growth stocks and in a bear one your downside is limited because of your ETF and Blue chip holdings and because you can temporarily increase exposure once your portfolio falls significantly (to get some upside on the way to recovery).

2021-05-05 12:21:37,stocks,"60k in SPYX, 80k to DCA the rest in over a year or two, that leaves you about $10-14k a year in appreciation. Then 10k for speculative, 50k for expanding existing emergency fund / house down payment (for rental income or living in). Don't really care if 60k crashes 20% if I have majority still in cash to buy more.

Tempted to say R32 GTR with 40k of it for a weekend / garage car because they've been appreciating 15%/year on top of being legendary, but less liquid than S&P, and less guaranteed (sorta) than real estate. Fun is important though, and something to work on if you're like me is a nice stress reliever & thing to focus on. But purchases like that are probably more responsible only if you already have another 100-200k in assets, so that the inheritance is on top of some existing financial stability, especially if you have kids.

So basically, the safe play, with 95% of it, is probably my move. Only to watch some guy who YOLOd Cumrockets hit 1M in 3 months off $5k lol"

 - 3 months of bare essentials spending in a CD/ pretty liquid fund
 - any debt with higher that 5% interest I would pay off

B) depends on how old you are for where to put it:
 
- 20's: growth plays. You have the time you can afford to be risky
 - 30-55: I would say all in equities, mix of growth and value stocks with at least 65% in ETFs
 - 55+: mix of growth and dividend plays, put it in things you could trim the profits/ use dividends for expenses in life (hopefully fun things!)

C) make sure to set aside 1-10% for yourself in the here and now. Check some things off your bucket list!

For long term stuff I rebalance annually. I pick stocks that I would want to hold for 3+ years and only let myself make trades on that account during 1 month of the year.

Diversification. With the kind of money your talking about, as long as you have exposure to at least 8 stocks in various sectors that all meet your personal criteria for a good investment then I wouldn't worry to much about it.

I don't typically keep cash in investment accounts those are for investments in my mind and my opportunity cost is always stock a over stock b intead of keeping cash for an opportunity."

But I'd have to do some research. But apparently, according to google, it can cost like $10,000 to $20,000 to build a basic house. Which, if true, will change the whole market. Also, it can be done in a day. 

Which means, if you have the technology to do it...you're sitting on a goldmine.

Like, as someone who doesn't have a house....I could probably scrounge up 15k for a plot of land somewhere. 15k for the house. 15k for hookups and inspections and permits. 

50k for a house. I'm hoping that becomes a reality real soon.

Anyway...if this does become a thing...I wonder what happens to the real estate market? If all of a sudden it only costs 50k to build a house...doesnt that drive down home values even if traditionally built? People are going to owe half a million for a house that the market will only value at 150k lets say. 

Sound familiar?"

In fact, once I sell all my high-risk stocks, I will re-adjust my portfolio along these lines.

Knowledge and experience may help you make better or safer decisions but the truth is there are plenty of experienced and knowledgeable investors who lose money regularly - most of them are hedge fund managers.

My advice, buy something you know and use in your personal life.  If you drink tons of coke, buy coke.  If you eat at McDonald’s 5 days a week buy McDonald’s (but also maybe consider a diet).  If you only buy Apple products, buy Apple.  Etc.

I don't know, but I think doing this might also cut out a lot of the ""middle performance"" stocks that are in the S&P."

It doesn't need to be so complicated."

2021-05-05 14:49:36,stocks,200k of GME right now would be less than 2k shares. This is less than the daily volume. What are you smoking?

I don't mind GME, I just want a place I can go to talk about other things. The problem with WSB is ALL you can talk about there is GME. So I unsubbed."

I’m sure Cohen will do great things for the company but it’s a long term play and that’s not why most people bought in. DFV and his early followers made bank in the real squeeze, anything else is a cherry on top. He exercised his last set of options and bought more. Great, he made millions before that at a much lower cost basis. It could drop down to $40 and I’m sure it’s still a good gain for him off the initial investments. 

All that said, I was going to tell the OP to put in all in call options at a 🌕 strike price. WSB needs more loss porn."

2021-05-05 18:16:29,stocks,BND is a waste of time. It's done nothing in 10 years of history. Why ever invest in that.
2021-05-05 11:05:43,stocks,"I am doing a meeting on this precise topic with a CFP, today.

My inclination is to throw it all into VTSAX and VGT.  But, I will take advice.  My goals are strong growth over 10 years, preservation after that with 4% SWR."
2021-05-05 12:29:04,stocks,"Dividend etfs have higher taxes, so unless it's in a Roth IRA or IRA it's not going to be great.

Large cap bond index is odd, do you mean a large cap index + bonds?  Large cap like S&P500's symbol is VOO.  You can compare and contrast VOO to VTI.  What you'll see is very little difference, but VTI out performs by just a few fractions of a percent over the long term, so you end up with a bit more profit, but for all intents and purposes either will work just fine.

Bonds you want to buy when interest rates are high and sell when interest rates are low.  The Fed has capped interest rates at 0% right now so it's the worst time to buy bonds atm.

Bonds are for preserving wealth.  You can't retire early on 200k in the US and anywhere in the first world.  You need to take your annual living expenses and multiply it by 25 to get your retirement number.  Every dollar after that number can be put into bonds, every dollar before that number can be put into index funds like VOO/VTI.  Premature allocation of bonds reduces the ability to become wealthy enough to retire.  After all, isn't that the ultimate goal when it comes to the stock market, to be able to retire early?  Everything else is peanuts."

2021-05-05 13:23:19,stocks,This isn’t actually true. There are many different species of bees. And the honey bee is an invasive species to the americas. If it were to go extinct the only consequence we would have is less honey. But there are still plenty of animals that would be pollinators.

2021-05-05 10:54:57,stocks,Yep if you are getting low 2s for a 30 year loan that is probably less than inflation. Better to keep the debt and invest the cash.

Typically when someone buys a mortgage they get a fixed rate loan."
2021-05-05 13:59:15,stocks,3% over 30 years is 100k savings guaranteed plus you'll have nearly $850 free to invest monthly over the next 30 years.  I'm not educated on how to do that math but I feel recession proof with my house paid for and an extra $850 each month.
2021-05-05 13:39:19,stocks,They are - but our location likely has a bit more staying power due to some massive development that is about to take place nearby. We still believe we're on the upswing here.
2021-05-05 11:58:45,stocks,Cuz why not
2021-05-05 11:23:18,stocks,I think VOO just tracks the S&P and VTI tracks the entire US sector.
2021-05-05 11:29:56,stocks,"VOO = Only Large Cap

VTI = Large, Medium & Small Cap

Not same thing"
2021-05-05 16:56:52,stocks,Do you understand that sector? Did you do any research? Asking because if you have faith in the holdings in that ETF then think of it as a buying opportunity because it’s “cheap”. All high growth names are down in the last few months. You will be rewarded later on when it goes up again.
2021-05-05 16:55:18,stocks,It could yes but your investment strategies may change over time at some point in your life. This may require you to sell to decrease or even increase your risk in another asset. Again everyone’s strategies are different. You could just buy VOO or VTI for 30+ years until you retire to keep it simple and hands off.
2021-05-05 16:51:33,stocks,VOO has a lower expense ratio than SPY. VOO is better for buying and holding. SPY is better for options because the volume is way higher.
2021-05-05 16:58:14,stocks,Yeah if you want more mid caps you can look into VO. Or QQQJ. VB for small cap.

2021-05-05 16:28:57,stocks,"I respect your candor.

I'll answer your last question first. No, I don't think GME will squeeze again. I don't have any reason to believe that the short interest data is incorrect, and I don't think the total short interest is large enough versus the available float to cause a squeeze. GME has a minimum daily volume of millions of shares a day and this is enough volume to cover short interest without causing a massive squeeze. I do not believe we will see it at $300 again, but if we do I would bet my life savings and more that it will never reach the crazy numbers on some of these GME subreddits. Even with the strength of the retail numbers, coordinating non-selling during any type of squeeze is very very very very difficult.

*-Back to your first point about orders-*

If you place a limit order above the market price, I believe it should show up (I will admit I don't spend any time looking at lvl2 data). However, I don't think the volatility has to do with the reason that these orders will only be partially complete or won't complete at all. When the bid/ask spread meets above the limit price it will sell as many shares as it can before the spread moves down below the price.

During that time, the broker will fill partial orders of 1, 2, 100 shares, but you won't see large orders going through. This is to maximize the volume at the current bid/ask spread."

While yes there is a lot of overlap between VOO and VTI percentage wise since large cap stocks make up the majority of the market, you are still tracking a lot of different companies with VTI since there are a lot of small and medium cap stocks out there. A lot of what is in QQQ and VGT is also in VOO too."
2021-05-05 14:04:16,stocks,I look great in orange. Check the GME fundamentals and sentiment. Very bullish. The short squeeze is just the catalyst
2021-05-05 16:38:40,stocks,"I appreciate your response and that is an interesting take. I too have wondered if the daily volume has been short coverage, but then I question why the stock is going down while covering. Also, the timing of the decreasing volume and deep ITM options in correlation to the new rules being passed seems to me more like hedge funds losing their ability to kick the can down the road and being forced to accept their fate(if the DD on float ownership and short interest is true) On top of all of that, GME being long term debt free and cash positive seems like a good bet to me. 

What are your thoughts on Ryan Cohen’s remark about, even without the squeeze being a happening, he believes the price could reach $1,000 by December?"
2021-05-05 17:32:01,stocks,R/tradexiv is the sub I think. Basically people were trading a 3x leveraged derivative that inversed volatility. The crash happened overnight and literally wiped out portfolios overnight and the entire fund went insolvent.

2021-05-05 12:41:33,stocks,So you thinks it’s best to have VTI and VOO?  I just threw out QQQ and VGT as an extra option.  I like VOO or VTI with VXUS.

2021-05-05 12:58:34,stocks,Actually after looking it up VGT only has 22.6% of its holdings in VOO now QQQ has 78% of its holdings in VOO. I guess VGT would make more sense here.  VTI is a different story for both obviously.
2021-05-05 14:41:53,stocks,"It's still running over 20% short float, and those are people who have seen what can happen.

The business case for it is weak. Gamers complaining their skins won't load aren't grannies looking for a better flavor of Fancy Feast for their tabbies.

You know what would make me buy it? A credible report that the console manufacturers had signed an exclusive US distribution deal with the company. But that isn't going to happen.

Ryan would love for the price to be $1000 by December, I guess why wouldn't he say that? It wouldn't be based on fundamentals though (what is these days?), there is no way even a positive cash flow could mean that the price was worth that much to shareholders.

Last year GME lost money, so that in effect cost shareholders equity. Lets see if they can start making money, let alone be worth 50B. They have to take a lot of sales away from Target, Walmart, Bestbuy, Amazon, Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft to do so."

As soon as someone from the FED or the Treasury comments on the topic of interest rates and inflation, all hell breaks loose here on Reddit. People are asking why the market is losing so much and others are writing ""stay strong"" messages.

You have to remember that interest rates in the US are at an unhealthy low level. Look around the world: Japan has had zero interest rates for decades, Europe for about ten years. And that's not going to change there anytime soon. Italy and other southern European countries have immense mountains of debt, and the ECB cannot raise taxes under these circumstances. The average person in Europe still tends to have his money invested in bonds or in a savings account, and his money is worth 2% less there every year thanks to inflation. Zero interest rates are robbery! The states in Europe deleverage themselves for 10 years at the expense of their citizens.

At the moment it looks like zero interest rates are a one-way street. The U.S. should return to a normal interest rate level as soon as possible to avoid such conditions. Even if you have to accept that the market will drop 10% (if you are *somewhat* diversified)."

Facing this sort of backlash that is basically tantamount to, ""The Fed/Joe Biden/Congress/Powell crashed the market, sent us into a recession or worse, and crippled the economy,"" would the Fed just placate the kids throwing a temper-tantrum and reduce rates **again** as they have for decades, digging that hole ever deeper?

The sad truth is that big business pays 0-1% interest in Europe.

But EU inflation is rising (it was under 1% for part of last year) so they may raise lending rates to keep it from jumping higher.

I also don't think you are using that Maastricht number right. It's not a hard limit on inflation, it's the limit on the excess inflation to enter the EU. E.g if UK wanted back in, its inflation rate couldn't be more than the current EU inflation rate plus 1.5."

This is the information on Lowes yield % per share.

So at a cost of 200.30$, you're only getting 2.40$ back every 3 months? You would have to own a very significant amount of shares to make this worth while, no?

2021-05-05 03:21:03,stocks,"Time and consistency. You are correct that you will need a significant amount of shares when you look at it today. But simply taking share price now and dividend now and calculating how many shares you'd need to buy to make a ""decent"" income is not taking into account many things.

Good dividend stocks tend to increase the dividend per share regularly. So in a couple of years, the yield for the shares you bought now should be much higher. At the same time, share prices should also increase. Somebody who got JNJ in 2013 would get 4x $0.66 at a price of around $50 per share. Today, share price is almost $170 and you get 4x $1.06 dividends. If you bought back then and get the dividend now, the yield for those shares is much higher.

You should also take into account compounding. If you reinvest your dividends every time, your dividends should slowly but surely increase. Over long periods of time, you get a bit of a snowball effect going on.

Last but not least, there are higher yield options but they tend to have some downsides. There are stocks that yield 7% reliably but they tend not to grow much anymore. There are stocks that pay around 7% and distribute monthly which makes compounding even better. And last but not least, there are special ETFs and strategies for increased cash flow.

When you say *any sort of passive income*, you need to be clear what your goal is. If you want to make a couple hundred every month on the side, you'll need six figures invested if you want it on the spot. If you're willing to wait, you can do it with less.

If you invest regularly over the course of several decades the effect should become quite noticeable.

In addition it is truly a matter of dividend yield vs capital gains, more like the best compromise that would work for you based on your individual investment preferences.

Here is probably the best way to think of dividends while you are still growing your portfolio: leave them to auto reinvest. If stock is high the dividend helps pump it and you have gains anyway, if it’s low you are buying on a dip so the percentage of share you are getting is better.

If you are really curious about dividends as pàssive income look at something that pays out monthly like PSEC. You’ll still need a considerable amount of money in it for the monthly payout to be something you could live off of.

2) People buy dividend stocks for long term growth. If I bought a stock for $100 when it returned a 3% dividend ten years ago and the company has grown and is now $200 with a 3% dividend, then at my $100 basis, I’m getting a 6% return. Not too shabby for a pretty secure investment. 

I would also add that stocks like this are great hedges again inflation and great opportunities during inflation.

2021-05-05 10:19:08,stocks,"Dividend investing is a long term strategy to build wealth. Essentially a few key things to it are:

* Companies raise their dividends overtime, so you want to be in a company that consistently grows and raises their dividend each year.

* The longer you hold a stock the more your 'yield on cost' goes up due to said dividend raises. For example there's a lot of long time investors in stocks like MSFT, AAPL, MMM, JNJ, etc. that are getting 10% annual yields on shares they bought many years ago. These high quality companies dividends were never yielding at 10% at any point in their history, but they have been consistently raising their dividend overtime.

* Overtime the more dividends you have coming in the faster you can build your 'dividend snowball'. For example say you can only invest $25,000 a year. If you start bringing in $5,000 a year in just dividends you've increased your investment capital by 20%, which lets you build more dividend income faster.

If you want to see what you can really do overtime with dividend investing I'd suggest checking out the 'GenExDividendInvestor' Youtube channel. The guy recently retired and now lives off of $80,000 in annual dividend income from a $2.2ish million dollar portfolio."

A crude example would be a dividend yield currently at 10% on a $100 stock suggesting the dividend you receive will be $10.  So if your equity falls to $90, you haven’t lost money.  And if the $10 dividend isn’t reduced then the next dividend cycle will have a higher dividend yield.  

The trick to dividend investing is to select stocks that have both increasing equity and increasing dividend payout and reinvesting all received dividends. Won’t always find what you want, but it’s the golden standard as far as I know.  

Doing so increases your annual return and thus your compounded annual return over the lifetime of your portfolio."
2021-05-05 12:05:31,stocks,I agree. That’s why I’m sticking to low cost index funds. XIC.TO and XUU.TO was most affordable for me
2021-05-05 12:06:44,stocks,"Focusing on dividends doesn't make sense to me. If your goal is to live off the returns, there's no difference between collecting dividends and selling shares. You want what will give you the highest returns, and dividend stocks typically under perform growth stocks."
2021-05-05 12:13:06,stocks,"Look into some renewable energy companies and telecommunication companies. Ex. Bell, Telus, Enbridge, and Emera. All are reputable companies that pay out high yields per quarter.

2021-05-05 12:26:31,stocks,I heard that you need at least 100k to make good gains
2021-05-05 12:27:52,stocks,For passive income you can probably make a lot more buying growth stocks and selling covered calls.
2021-05-05 12:30:18,stocks,"you need a lot of money to get a decent amount in dividends. How old are you? 

I’m 32 and I just switched everything over to growth stocks.. super aggressive plays. My top 5 positions are EXRO.V, FCC.V, HUT.TO, PLTR. And I’m going to be patient with all of them for the next 1-2 years. I’m
Hoping to find good aggressive growth plays until I’m 50 then start averaging into good dividend stocks. Hopefully I’ll have a mill or two by then. 

Basically growth stocks should beat dividend stocks but they require a lot of attention and patience. You want growth stocks when you are young because you have time on your side. If you buy into something and it goes down you have time and income (hopefully you have a job) to average down and wait for it to make 100-500% gains Over the course of a few years. Then when you are older you gotta capture your growth stock gains and put them into solid dividend stocks so you can keep those gains and get consistent percentage returns/income from them

I’m not saying to invest in what I did... I’m taking some risks because I gained about 130% last year so I figure I’ve got some wiggle room. 

But if you don’t wanna be aggressive. Dividends with DRIP and steady contributions will snow ball greatly after about 10 years"
2021-05-05 12:31:06,stocks,"You have to think 10-20-30yeas from now if you do care about dividends as passive income. For example, if you bought $KO decades ago and held... you are receiving 50% of your original cost basis each year in a dividend.

IMO, you should just reinvest them for now and focus on building your share position in good companies. I did that with Microsoft and Disney. For Microsoft the dividend is .9% but because I bought \~3 years ago technically I am receiving close to a 3% yield on my original cost basis. I continue to  reinvest the dividend in shares and 1-2 decades this dividend will be a significant portion of my original cost basis. Of course, the growth in the stock will be way more important IMO."
2021-05-05 12:34:13,stocks,"For one, the $2.40 dividend is paid annually, not quarterly as you stated.

2021-05-05 12:35:43,stocks,"Passive income requires a significant portfolio. Dividend yield for passive income stocks is usually about 3-5% average I would say. So do the math to see how much you would need to reach whatever income goal you want. But it's not with a 20k portfolio that you'll make anything enough to support a lifestyle, it's in the 7 digits."

2021-05-05 12:59:14,stocks,"First off, it’s 2.30 over the whole year, not every three months (based on the data you provided as written) so let’s call it 1% returns in cash. 100 stocks would cost you  approx $20000, and return $200 a year. And that’s just now. Look at how the dividends have scaled with the price over the years. Chances are the stock has raised in value over the years, therefore a number of years down the line if you held long, that dividend could be $3 a year and you only paid $200 for it. To add to that idea, if you have 100 stocks in Lowe’s at the figures you gave, that is essentially a free stock every year.

In essence, dividends are the rewards for investing in a company, if you are not receiving dividends from the investment, then what exactly are you looking to gain from your investment. If you’re looking for a quick buck play, dividends are not your play. 

As many have said, the first million is hard, but if you invest that million into dividends, you could either dump a years pay back into the market, or take it and just not work for the year."

2021-05-05 18:03:41,stocks,I like ATT and TWO. Good dividends in my opinion.
2021-05-05 19:27:36,stocks,"Simple answer is that you get some return from the stock price and some from the dividend.  It does 2 things for you, the stock price is less volatile, which it sounds like you might not be interested in, but the second thing is it just gives you another way to recoup funds or get gains.  It's really the same concept it's just a split reward, stock price goes up slower but they pay you out some just for being patient 

Stock prices also move slower on these so if you're done with the crash rush on your fast moving stocks these usually lag behind and give you something to do after the big rushes. 

The real trick is to find a dividend stock with a buy back plan. Cause then they will drive the price up for you while you sit back and collect the dividend for simply storing your money there.  It can be profitable long term, just try one or two and see how it goes. Just make sure their dividend is active currently, a lot of them are suspended right now if they got into trouble during covid."

2021-05-05 12:15:01,stocks,"If a stock has an 8% yield in today's market there's likely some sort of risk. There's no guarantee that the dividend will remain that high

T has a 6.5% yield, their risk is their massive debt
XOM has a 5.71% yield, their risk is they're in an industry that is under tremendous political pressure as of lately, and is vulnerable to price swings in a highly volatile commodity that is influenced by OPEC.

If you invest in a broad high dividend yield index like VYM to diversify, the yield is slightly under 3%."

Then there are all of these Beautiful Mind experts that swear that dividends are a lie because every dollar paid out is a dollar stolen from the value of the stock.  I fail to see how a 10% yield on dividends is worse than a 6% yield on a conventional stock."
2021-05-05 09:44:50,stocks,"> Good dividend stocks tend to increase the dividend per share regularly. 

Yeah, this is really the key right here. My dad used to manage assets for trusts and his favorite investment in the late '80's was SO. Basically if you bought that thing at $8 back then, your current yield today on that initial investment, even without reinvestment, is 33%. Your principal is up 7 or 800%. Obviously there are plenty of investments that did better and even a SPY would have outperformed, but for assets that generate current cash flow, a diversified portfolio of solid dividend stocks that you hold for a long time is pretty hard to beat and it will absolutely crush bonds over the long haul."
2021-05-05 12:40:06,stocks,"Yes, this. Also, on a DRIP, assuming a person owns enough to DRIP, there's no fee for the purchase. It just keeps going.

This is an incredibly misleading framing; the only people who use ‘yield’ this way are people who are writing bad articles about why dividend investing is great.  You’re using the word ‘yield’ to describe the dividend payment today relative to the money he invested in 1988, but the actual relevant comparison is what the yield is today compared to *what else he could be doing with the money today* or, if you really want to compare over time, how much he’s earned since 1988 compared to what he would have earned if he had put all his money in a growth stock that paid no dividend.

Here’s a chart showing what one would have if you invested 100% in AAPL vs KO in 1985 (stopping in 2012, when AAPL began paying dividends.). TLDR: the non-dividend paying investment was an order of magnitude more successful.

You need to dig a bit deeper and look at the whole income statement, here's AT&T operating profit from 2011-2019 (in millions, USD):

2011 12,128	
2012 12,997
2013 30,752
2014 14,332
2015 24,820
2016 23,904
2017 22,884
2018 26,142
2019 29,413

For comparison, Facebook (a world class company with an EV 2.3x higher than AT&T) made $32B in operating profits in 2020 (just highlighting how much cash $25-30B really is).

How are they getting marginalized? Do you think that high speed satellite internet is just behind the corner (think about the capital investments required and what kind of margins would be required to seriously compete with current LTE wireless), or is it perhaps more likely that 5G will be a good new revenue stream (despite the required capex) for the wireless providers?

Btw, the MVNO competition in the cell phone space does not impact Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile like normal competition does in industries with low barriers to entry.

The hard question is not whether or not AT&T is a melting ice cube (it's not) or if the dividend is sustainable (it is). The hard question is, does the market offer much better opportunities today than a 6.5% yield with some upside optionality from HBO Max."

The truth is that dividend investing (in the sense of seeking it out at the expense of other investments) is, *for most people*, a poor decision. It made sense back when brokers charged commissions to buy and sell shares, but apart from the convenience aspect a portfolio seeking to maximize dividend return will consistently perform worse in terms of total return than just buying the whole market.

2021-05-05 11:38:05,stocks,"No no no no no no. I got blown up in Anthracite Capital over 10 years ago so trust me - I've seen the vicious cycle that can happen. A REIT is obligated under tax law to pay 90% of its earnings out as a dividend, so its payout ratio is always at least 90%. 

But here's the thing about mortgage REITs. They buy long mortgages. They borrow with shorter term credit facilities and notes. They make money on the difference between long and short rates. When rates are going down, the mortgages they own are worth more. When rates go up, the value of the mortgage typically goes down. It trades just like any other fixed income asset. 

The other problem is they borrow on the short end. So if they borrow 2 year paper today for 2% and own 30 year paper that yields say 5%, they just print money. It's a great business. But that 5% mortgage ain't gonna budge on the rate. So if they have to refi that 2 year paper at 6%, they are suddenly upside down and because rates have gone up, the value of their collateral, which is the long mortgages they own, plummets and they can't access further loans because their credit risk is not acceptable. And because the REIT has to pay out 90% of its earnings, it has very little accumulated capital cushion. 

I don't know this particular company's business, but if it is heavily in the mortgage REIT game you have got watch interest rates and credit markets like a hawk if you have a big position. Those things are really sensitive to rates moving up."

Gross margins have been declining steadily for about 20 years now. They used to be over 60%, now theyre around 52% and still declining.                                     

Net Income:

* 2015 = 13B

* 2018 = 19.37B
* 2019 = 13.90B
* 2020 =  -5.176B (other companies did fine in covid)

Lets forget about 2020 for a second. How do you explain the 2019? They are basically back to pre-Time Warner earnings. They paid around $80b for Time Warner and their rev is up, yet earnings keep decaying.

In the last decade:   
EPS = $19.81  
DIV = $19.09

... this is called living by the skin of your teeth. Its not sustainable and it doesnt look like the Time Warner purchase is going to turn anything around.

As a comparison, Verizons gross margins have been the same since around 2010. Their net is also climbing and they had no major issues in 2020.

As for sat internet. Musk claims they have 100k customer for sat internet already. Its priced around $60 I believe which is competitive. Sat internet is actually pretty cheap to deploy compared to wireless due to needing far less real estate. They still need sites but nearly as many.

2021-05-05 09:18:41,stocks,Literally the central decision to make when investing is “How much return would I get if I invest it in this thing instead of that thing?” Claiming that decision is “irrelevant” is a heck of a flex.
2021-05-05 10:06:21,stocks,"Thats right.

How much I pay and how much do I get in return. In my mind I will almost never sell my dividend portfolio. That means that the dividends are my only returns on the investment. The original purchase price is gone gone gone. Except how I calculate my returns.

The guy who insulted all article writers by comparing them to me is only half right. He is right that opportunity costs matter. He is wrong to compare an hypothetical growth stock with a real investment that happened in time. Opportunity costs are not compared to hindsight trades.   


He also has an unusual opinion of how to amortize an investment. If I buy a horse to pull a plow I don’t calculate my returns as if I purchase the horse each year. That’s why people are nice to their horse. The longer they live the more years they produce.

What he, in my opinion, has misjudged is the easy to find a better play without hindsight. Suppose the writer Can easily look at price histories and find many plays that would have been 1000 better than Buffet’s play.

But if the probability of finding a new good one would have been something worse than 1 in 1000 then the writer would be wrong and Buffet would have been right. The writer didn’t know any better than Buffet what companies would do better or worse.

Some people can’t fathom a time when growth isn’t king because they have not been exposed to the entire business cycle. Many people in accumulating phase don’t understand the spending phase either.

Sometime between now and 8 years from now I will receive my last wages, my last paycheck. Retirement means spend the nest egg because you don’t have a job anymore. It doesn’t matter if the market booms or goes bust. It’s all I got.

Which portfolio would I prefer on that day? A volatile growth portfolio that may be up or may be down on the day I need to pay bills? A portfolio where each month I sell seed corn to pay the bills.

Or I can have a portfolio that pays me a regular dividend as long as I live. Yes, if I run short I may have to sell seed corn. But at a slower rate."
2021-05-05 09:22:44,stocks,"But actual dividend amounts (not the yield you calculate after the fact from the current stock price) stays the same (or grows, for those companies that grow their dividends) regardless of what interest rates do or what CD you can get, no?

2021-05-05 07:37:58,stocks,"Yea was that sarcasm? If not, then wow are you wrong...

Div stocks are the fuel for over performing. Why? Because they give you power to capitalize on dips and crashes. Never use DRIP on dividends. Always let them accumulate and deploy them yourself. Div stocks also act as wonderful portfolio anchors and lower risk a lot. Without them, you need to manually add to your basis to take advantage of the markets. Life doesnt always make that easy.

Ive average 35% yoy returns for nearly 15 years now so your thesis about ""never"" is false. Though I do buy growth often, and they do indeed make up at least 50% of my portfolio, if not for the dividend/distributions from investments, I wouldnt be anywhere near that kind of return."

Regarding the other numbers, like Frank Slootman said: ""Accounting is bastardization of economics"". Think about it: there's absolutely no way that AT&T really lost $5B of cash in 2020 while paying out $15B of dividends. To assess AT&T's dividend coverage, you need to start from the net income *and* add back non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization minus capital expenditures. That's why I used operating profit originally because the closer you are to top line, the better. AT&T state their 2020 cash flow and dividend coverage ratio (45%) here:

The satellite internet topic is interesting. I can see its viability for rural area customers as a lower cost option vs having to build towers like you say.

asias in particular china produces most of industrial goods, and they need all those empty containers all over the world back but coz of fakedemic restrictions, only small amount of them came back to china. this has caused shipping rate to double.

also, air freight is fucked also due to fakedemic. majority of air freight was actually carried by commercial liners. with international air travel greatly reduced, so did air freight rates skyrocket, and many have to be offloaded to sea shipping ie. containers, further causing container shortage.

the freight charge increase has caused almost all commodity price to rise in cost. the key is its temporary. once fakedemic is eased due to vaccines and reopening, the empty containers gonna come back online and the shipping rates gonna return to normal. 

in terms of oil, oil price went fucking NEGATIVE in 2020. of course in 2021 with the rebound it gonna INCREASE IN PRICE. like holy fuck, all these fucktards talking about inflation while mentioning oil prices increase. what a joke. and oil price increase (or more accurately, RETURN TO NORMAL) not only gonna increase transport cost back to normal, but also increase deriratives such as plastics. 

timber... its simply fakedemic restriction on timber mills. timber itself has no shortage. and also freight rate play a huge role.

2021-05-05 03:52:20,stocks,"Both, however at first there were talks that producers were not running at full capacity or that China would dump the markets again, however the Chinese export rebate rate has been cut from 13% to 0%, so less incentive for Chinese steel traders to sell it internationally, take into account that China has high domestic demand right now and they‘ve also lowered import tariffs.

Which both raise international prices, and China has been cutting BF usage in multiple provinces due to the emission, I think we’re going to see a shift on the international market and of course, steel prices will eventually come down a bit (right now q3/4 2022 is trading at 2x what analysts predicted for q1 2021, that’s how high the prices are, with no relief in sight).

However in my personal opinion and for the multiple weeks of research I have done into this sector, they will stabilize at a higher price point, companies that have been improving their line of production / vertically integrated (own iron ore due to more competition on international market (what I mentioned; china removing import tariffs for iron/scrap steel)) will be rewarded.

Thus far it has been rewarding me very well and I honestly believe we’re only at the beginning.

Operations
With the first string of casing set and cemented in the 6-1 well, the Company owned and operated 1000 HP rig (Jarvie-1) is drilling ahead to a target depth of 3,800 meters (12,500 feet). The 6-1 well is designed to evaluate the petroleum systems discovered in the first well (6-2) in an area of maximum thickness. These first two wells are within one of five major sub-basins of the larger, more laterally extensive, Permian aged deep Kavango basin.
The Company will take whole core, side-wall core and conduct a full logging suite of all zones of interest (conventional targets and source rocks). As with the 6-2, a comprehensive state of the art logging program over both sections will be provided by Schlumberger. In addition, a Vertical Seismic Profile (VSP) will be run to enable the most accurate tie-in possible, of well data, to the 2D seismic program scheduled to commence in June, 2021."

Of course not all the shares are available on the capital markets, so the owners still have ownership and cash in on the net income. CEOs  and others on the management board are all on salaries.

Lyft’s revenue fell 36%, to $609m, compared to the same period last year. Lyft said it had 13.49m active riders in the first quarter, down more 36.4% from the 21.2m in the same period last year.

Lyft reported an adjusted EBITDA loss totaling $73m in the first quarter, which was far better than anticipated. The company had expected a sharper $135m adjusted EBITDA deficit for the period.

In addition to beating its own Q1 2021 goals to some degree, Lyft posted 7% revenue growth over what it recorded in Q4 2020, a detail that Lyft pointed to as a sign that the company was on the road to recovery. Lyft said ridership also improved some 8% from the previous quarter.

Lyft remains deeply unprofitable, reporting a net loss of $427.3m in the first quarter, a 7.3% worsening from the $398.1m net loss it recorded during the same period last year. Those losses included 128.0m related to changes to the liabilities for insurance required by regulatory agencies attributable to historical periods.

Despite the heavy losses, Lyft executives said they were buoyed by stronger rider demand, which has picked up in recent months.

Lyft also emphasized the sale of its self-driving unit, called Level 5, announced last week. Lyft sold the unit to Toyota’s Woven Planet Holdings subsidiary for 550m. Uber also recently sold its self-driving tech (Uber ATG), work that was once seen as existential to the ride-hailing game.

Lyft’s so-called Level 5 division will be folded into Woven Planet Holdings once the transaction closes in the third quarter of 2021. Lyft will receive 550m in cash, with 200m paid upfront. The remaining 350m will be made in payments over five years. About 300 people from Level 5 will be integrated into Woven Planet.

Lyft's younger but much bigger brother, Uber, reports its own earnings tomorrow.

2021-05-05 00:00:00,stocks,"REITs vs inflation? I don't want to discuss a certain REIT. Just the idea in general.

At first glance, Real Estate Investment Trusts seem like a good play if you expect the cost of real estate to go up and the value of the dollar to go down. You *should* see regular distributions while the underlying assets increase in value. Theoretically.

HOWEVER, after putting some thought into it: do you really think the book value of the underlying assets really translate to realized gains in a timely manner? The idea behind these REITs is long-term leases. 20 year leases. 30 years. Maybe more! Just because the property is worth more doesn't mean that gets passed along to the clients. They agreed to a x% increase per year regardless whether that real estate appreciates in value or not. Their pricing leverage is severely hindered in that these properties might not be up for renegotiation for another 10-15 years!

So, anyway, I just wanted to see what others thinks. I'm not convinced REITs will do better than the rest of the market in high-inflation times. In fact, I'd be worried that they are actually more vulnerable. I'm sure I'm missing a lot, but I'd like to see how the rest of you think on this topic"

2021-05-05 00:00:00,stocks,"$PERI - What's up with the market cap?? Israel Based Ad Tech Company Perion Network reported strong earnings today before market open.

Q1 March 2021- EPS of $0.09 (200% increase)- Revenue of $89.8 million (36% increase).- They also announced that they are now debt-free.

The company said it expects 2021 revenue of $390.0 million to $410.0 million. The company's previous guidance was revenue of $370.0 million to $380.0 million and the current consensus revenue estimate is $375.56 million for the year ending December 31, 2021. This guidance also does not include travel-related advertising revenue which could come 'flying' back at any moment. This influx of revenue that is not being accounted for in guidance could easily send FY 2021 revenue much closer to $500M.

Considering their current TTM rev is already $328M and their FY 2021 will very likely be in the range of $400-420M, how is their market cap SO low?

As of today their market cap sits at $569M ($16.73 Share Price on 33.85M Shares Outstanding). Given that this company is debt-free, profitable, and growing at a steady rate should the market cap and P/S ratio not begin to catch up with other players in ad tech the sector?

2021-05-05 00:00:00,stocks,"If you're sitting on cash, I'd like you to think about this So, recently I've been seeing more and more people saying that they're sitting on cash, which has got me thinking for a while. If everyone is waiting for a drop, it will most likely never come. Now I want to explain myself on why I think this, feel free to critique it. Suppose you, and 10 others are sitting out of the market, waiting for a correction. Now you don't know these people, but you all have the same intentions. Buy when there's a big enough sale. 

First question you should be asking yourself is what you consider a sale. With this in mind, would the others consider a sale to be above or below your price? If the answer is below, then what's to stop the other 10 from buying out the bottom, leaving you with your dick in your hand? This is on a small scale, but in reality, there's a lot more people, many of which are holding a lot of cash. On the other hand, suppose you think your price is above the estimates of others. Now the other 10 people are not idiots. They are probably thinking the exact same way you are, so if they move that limit buy up, suddenly you've reached the same conclusion as scenario 1.

You see, the issue I have with holding a lot of cash on the side is that you're holding a deprecating asset, in that your money is worth less with inflation. Why not put it in gold for example if you're worried about the market. 
Another issue I've seen is that a lot of people can't put a number to what they'd consider a sale. We have seen a couple pullbacks in this past year where buying would've been very advantageous, and yet a lot of people still sit with cash. For example, there was early November. We had March gone by. I'm sure there were also pullbacks along the way that offered nice entry points, all of which were missed by many. What's to say that you manage to get in at the next sale? What if you miss the next sale by setting a price too low? Will you still be sitting on that cash in 2 years time? There's a reason people say you can't time the market. 
If you really think you can get in at a cheaper price, why not buy 1 share now, and set up a scaletrader to buy 1 share in equal increments until it reaches that point? Worst case scenario, you get 1 share, and have to either wait, or buy in at the added premium. Best case scenario, your prediction was right, and you've now bought all the way down in equal increments, putting your DCA somewhere between the top and bottom. Sitting on cash however is probably not the best thing you can do though."

The Director of Macro at Fidelity has an amazing twitter. I recommend it. I posted above a specific tweet showing a comparison to a previous similar time period. Notice that the past trend predicted the fall, the bottom, and the rise (all from last year). Then, see the 'correction' that started in April and lasted over summer. Maybe it will happen again?

Obviously there is no way to predict the future. But that type of data analysis can be helpful. Plus, that analysis seems to be a compromise position between the doomsayers (e.g,, the market is going to crash 40%!) and the optimists (e.g, its not going to crash for a very long time, until interest rates rise).

In that situation, holding some cash is a way to diversity your position, in case a market correction does occur, to some (small?) degree."
2021-05-04 20:45:28,stocks,"People I know sitting on cash aren’t waiting for a crash. They’re just looking for good undervalued stocks. Very hard to come by atm. Which hints at a looming crash.

Also inflation is not good for stocks... just look at the early 80s"
2021-05-04 20:17:57,stocks,"Sure cash is trash at the moment. However no one knows when the market might correct 5-10% or more and “cash” investors come in. Sure they missed out on a bunch of gains, but I’d wager that plenty already profited an are just waiting for better entry points."
2021-05-04 20:15:32,stocks,"It's worth on average 2% less per year. Could be 3-4% in a few years. But I'm not sitting on cash continuously, just jumping in and out when I see fit. No point in buying into a market that is showing signs of a longer term downtrend. 

When I find something I like and believe has potential and isn't overpriced or in a downtrend, I buy. If it starts to tank, and my conviction changes, I sell. I'm often wrong. Protect your gains. I sat out a large amount of last year and still managed 70% while others crushed me. But this year I'm up 10% so far and I've spent 80% of my time out of the market. 

If you're gonna just dump it in and hold forever then just lump sum in. Just make smart investments and watch and watch and watch some more."
2021-05-04 22:42:27,stocks,The NYSE often times swoons (-5% to -10%) generally from May to September. History shows that. Do you pay MSRP for everything? Or  does a discount encourage your purchase?
2021-05-04 20:53:37,stocks,"In my opinion holding your cash in a fairly uncertain situation like we have right now with the Nasdaq and the tech sector is an aggressive move. You hold out, research, and narrow down your list of favorites to buy to a certain few companies. When any of those few companies share prices reach that magic number you’ve developed through your research and chart analysis and when the market conditions look favorable enough to jump back in, you start scaling in and testing your hypothesis while DCAing if you were a bit high on the initial entry. 

I would kinda compare it to playing in a poker tournament. Folding preflop is aggressive, because you are intent on taking big calculated risks when the time is right. I don’t know what’s going to happen but I think tomorrow and this week will be very telling with regards to where we’re headed with this tech selloff. I think the best thing to do is hold what you got, and keep plenty of cash available for when the time is right to get good value."
2021-05-04 20:33:46,stocks,"Inflation narrative is a fib.. and if any currency goes down, usd will go last.. history is what invalidates your thesis.. and a matter of probabilities, mean reversion.. extreme extension from technicals has to retest to instill confidence in current and future rallies.. explains why volume has been as low as it has, of late (SPY indice used for reference)"
2021-05-04 20:07:05,stocks,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this!  I am a believer that if I want to invest in a company.  I scale in.  My example is Nike.  I started a small position at $144.  It has dropped since then and I am adding in increments.  I have DCA Nike to $133.  Is Nike going to tank? Maybe, but unlikely...it is a global monster.  I will keep adding while it trades sideways before everyone sees it as a bargain again."
2021-05-04 21:12:38,stocks,"I consider 1% cash to qualify as ""sitting on cash."" Right now, I'm nearly 4% cash (not-so-humble-brag: just cashed out my 100 shares of CZR w/ CB 17.34 for over $103 each after today's earnings), and I feel like a fat kid in a candy shop looking for the next place to put it. 

I don't understand how people can decide that something crazy like 50% of the funds they have allocated for investing are best positioned on the sidelines."
2021-05-04 20:13:01,stocks,"You make a good point. I cannot speak for others, my thought on the matter is such as I am sitting on cash to enter at a lower buy point if my plan is for a short term trade. When it comes to long term investing, it doesn’t matter when I buy as I’ll be buying on a consistent basis over the long haul and I would not expect the price to stay the same now compared to years later especially when it comes to Index funds."
2021-05-04 20:12:33,stocks,"Cash is trash. I’m too risky with mine and I might have a problem in that even tho I’m decent financially, I still wonder every month how I’m going to pay my bills because I do not keep cash. It does nothing for you. Invest in my side hustle, invest in stocks, my rental property. I do not hold cash, it does nothing but provide a false sense of security. 

The rest of this is very over simplified scenarios that do not happen like you think they do. 

There is a lot of dumb money in the market, mine included, in that I have 20k in a stock that have never been profitable. Not all the money out there is “smart”. 

If you are patient and have balls of steel, you don’t have to worry about timing the market. It is very difficult for most people to watch 50% of their life’s saving fall in a scenario like covid, which is why panic set in, that’s why people stay cash. There are scenarios where you can buy deeply discounted stocks because of things like 2008 or covid, and if you wait for these and time these can you can return massive gains in a short period of time, but you still, will not beat the returns of those who just stayed in the market for 10 years."

2021-05-04 23:47:42,stocks,"Selling stocks for cash when you're down is dumb.   On the other hand if you already have cash on hand you've been saving up to invest, I personally wouldn't buy until the next correction happens.  Since 1920, the S&P 500 Index has—on average—recorded a 5% pullback three times a year, 10% once every 16 months, 20% every seven years, so I'll wait until these inevitably happen to put any extra cash I have into the market.   The major indexes haven't had a correction in over a year now so it's statistically almost assured that another one will happen within the next year, especially since we're in the middle of a once in a lifetime worldwide pandemic.   Avg returns are 6-10%/yr on index funds, so screw the Directory of Macro at Fidelity... I'm sitting on my extra cash until the next correction happens."
2021-05-04 21:02:29,stocks,Thank you for this Twitter suggestion. Just followed and will catch up on his account.
2021-05-04 21:13:40,stocks,"Am I seeing that correctly? It seems like he overlayed the past year to 2008. I dont think you can compare the 2. I'm not trying to say you should go throw all your money into Nasdaq, the post was not really written well. I was trying to say that you should put your money into something like gold, silver, etc that will move alongside inflation, however that being said, I dont think really think you can overlay this years chart on the 2020 chart and call it a pattern."
2021-05-05 00:20:35,stocks,"Right, I sometimes keep cash as I don’t find a good stock to buy. Timing market, even it is possible, seems harder than picking a good stock."
2021-05-04 20:36:23,stocks,"No one knows when the market might correct, and that's the issue. It could be next month, it could be a year from now, but if its the latter, that money could've been better placed in something like gold, silver, etc. You don't have to put all your eggs in 1 basket, but you shouldn't let your money sit idle either, and that's especially true for long term investors."
2021-05-04 20:29:52,stocks,"Depends on what you consider a long term downtrend. The DOW has been flirting with ATHs for quite a while, SPX is only about 50 points from its ATH. The only index struggling has been the Nasdaq. If you look back at March, many thought the pullback would go farther, myself included. However, I didn't let my emotions get in the way of buying.

Studies have shown that you're far better off with money in the market than out, and that more money tends to be better. If you're worried about a downtrend, get an account that offers margin. If your conviction is right, use margin to get in at that price, but in all likelyhood, we're more likely to be wrong than right when it comes to timing the market"
2021-05-04 21:45:40,stocks,What do you do when you don't hit your magic number?
2021-05-04 21:50:51,stocks,"The USD is literally always losing its value to inflation, the Federal Reserve's job is to literally make sure that happens, that's why they target 2% inflation."
2021-05-04 20:46:50,stocks,"I'm not saying the USD will go down, I'm saying that it will lose value to inflation. Inflation is not a joke, it's natural, about 3% per year. If you're relying on mean revertion, I recommend you take a look at the run we've had since 2009, 9 of 11 years had returns of over 10%, 4 of which have returned >20% returns YOY. If you had waited on mean reversion, you wouldn't have had the opportunity to get in, with the exception of March, if you didn't already think the market was overvalued after 10 years of watching from the sidelines."
2021-05-04 20:13:02,stocks,"My company has been APD, I've set up a scaletrader and let it do its thing. If APD ever does dip, my scale trader will pick that up, no human emotion involved, and in the meantime, I make profits on the upward movement. 1 better would be to set a trailing stop loss to lock in profits, but I'm more of a buyer and hold, so I try stay away from trailing stop losses if I'm buying a company I like."
2021-05-04 21:26:46,stocks,"1% cash sounds crazy, I'm an optimistic bull 24/7 but I have more than 1% cash. Do you ever buy anything besides bills?"
2021-05-04 20:21:39,stocks,"I really think you should make sure you should have enough money on the side to pay bills before you go investing it. If you're able to let that money sit for 10 years, and be fine without it, then that's money you should be investing. I don't believe in holding cash on the side when it comes to investing, that's what margin is for in the extreme cases.

Of course its oversimplified, which is why I welcome critique on it. The point I was trying to get at is that somebody has to be the final seller and the last buyer in a pullback. When there's a lot of people looking to be that final buyer, the bottom many people seek for never comes around, because there's always going to be someone who wants to get in a bit quicker with a market buy/higher limit bid."
2021-05-04 21:21:58,stocks,Not necessarily. It simply means there are more buyers looking to get in than there are sellers looking to get out. That doesn't imply most people are not sitting on cash.
2021-05-05 11:58:11,stocks,That 20% once-in-seven-years pullback may happen 40% up from here.

2021-05-04 20:55:30,stocks,Yes it’s better to be In those assets besides cash and most people will lose out on returns. I just can’t downplay a current cash holder who hesitates jumping Into an index fund near all time highs but instead has their eyes on a specific stock or 2.

People are cash because they feel the market is over valued and everyone has a different idea of about when they see value again. I would love to buy Tesla, I love that company, but I don’t think it’s at a justified valuation, so I do not buy it. There are people who feel that about the market as a whole. If there are people who are trying to time being the lowest buyer, I would love to meet that person and learn how they believe they can beat the millions of traders and computers on the market."

2021-05-05 08:51:42,stocks,"You don't measure inflation by comparing a currency to other currencies because they're inflating as well. Saying the USD hasn't lost value because other currencies have lost just as much value is like saying an apple that's started to rot hasn't actually started to rot because every other apple has started to rot as well. Sure you could probably trade that apple for another apple the same way you would before but try to trade it for something else and you're gonna get way less than you would before it started rotting.

That's why we use CPI, it's not perfect but the value of a currency is what you can buy with it. If the totality of what you can buy with it goes down year after year then the currency is experiencing inflation. 

As it applies to stocks, sure a stock price could tumble and you might be able to buy more of that stock this year than last year, but if everything else goes up in price you're still experiencing inflation. It's like arguing that inflation isnt happening because you bought beans on sale when you went grocery shopping."

2021-05-05 07:14:56,stocks,The dollar spikes in war? It devalues from currency printing and debt associated.
2021-05-04 21:05:57,stocks,"Good point on valuations like Tesla, but I wasn't saying that people are trying to be the last buyers, I was trying to say that when you're trying to buy at a price that you think is undervalued, especially when it comes to a big company, like Apple, naturally there's going to be a lot of competition to get in at that price, which makes it very difficult to find an undervalued company, and even now, a fair valued company takes a lot of work to find, because its not as simple as looking at the P/E and putting down a number you would consider undervalued. For example, Ebay has a 14.18 P/E, which sounds crazily low for the company at first glance, but looking deeper, they expect to see less revenue in the coming years. Future revenue means a lot for a stocks price. If people think there's no room for growth in a company, it won't go anywhere. If people think that in 2 years time, business will be booming for a company, then that's usually reflected in the price."
2021-05-04 23:18:24,stocks,"Thanks for that trend analysis. Part of my interest is macro stuff, so thanks. 

On a larger note, can I try to merge our thoughts together... if you look at that the original twitter graph (from Macro guy at Fidelity), two interesting things stand out, to me anyway. Notice that exactly when the 2009 data line starts to dip a little (around March 21), the 2000 data line shoots up at the same time. I think that they are trying to pump as much money into the system as possible, and keep it from repeating the 2009 data. If Timmer at Fidelity has this info, then all the big players do, and they are trying to prevent it from repeating.

And thus, that is why I think you may be right, about the trend analysis from the Tweet your provided. I think they know its on verge of correcting, and they are going to prevent it at any cost, and the money train is going to keep on going for a while."

Amazon ipos in 1997 at 300mln w/ 15mln revenue. at the time this is 20x sales.

300mln today is around 7bln.

Amazon was a literally game changer and pretty much introduced online shopping to the world.

Amazon also had about a decade of unchallenged growth/competition.

Which new companies that IPO within the last 5-6 years match this in terms of valuation similar to this?"
2021-05-05 13:30:45,stocks,"People were saying the same thing.

Amazon just sells books, how can this be a billion dollar business?

Netflix just rents DVDs. How can this be a billion dollar business?

Today:

Peloton just sells exercise bikes, how can this be a billion dollar business?

Zoom just does video calls. How can this be a billion dollar business?

History repeats itself."
2021-05-04 20:08:49,stocks,So you want to know all the IPOs that were valued at around 7B as of 5-6 years ago because you believe they will all be the next $AMZN?! Did I understand you correctly?
2021-05-05 14:23:37,stocks,"So here's some basic info for you.

\- Amazon, from the beginning always had its end goal of selling EVERYTHING online. In hindsight, it looks like they started with only doing books to building out their logistics chain and to not draw attention from the big players.  Amazon collected user data right from the beginning as well and was ahead of their time in that sense.  I'd imagine amazon would not exist today as it does, if the big retail like jumped in and started directly competing. 

\- Netflix as per its ceo, was never only meant to rent out dvd's online. its goal was to bring movie streaming service to the masses and it did. It too had very little competition for a long time.

Today, 

AMZN and NFLX ipo valuations are ""cheap"" compared to the companies that are coming today in comparison to what their actual end goals are and the current market's environment. 

AMZN is 4x sales

NFLX is around 8x sales

PTON is around 8x sales,  - arguably the only one in this space, but again what is the actual end goal? sell equipment at a premium, when people can buy this on their own or go to the gym? Most people don't even pay for personal trainers as it is. 

ZM is 33 x sales - has plenty of competition. What is its end goal here?

Just using this one metric, you can already see that these two new companies are pretty rich as it is in valuation."

if amazon was viewed by the masses as only that, then you wouldnt have people buying into their shares year over year, which is the main driving force of any stock.

2021-05-05 00:00:00,stocks,"$CLOV Investor DD - What is Direct Contracting? Hey ya'll.

So I have been and will continue to invest in Clover Health regardless of short interest or meme-relevance or anything that has actually seemed to make people interested in this stock. But then, it doesn't surprise me that people flock to this stock for meme hype more than anything, because looking into something like Direct Contracting for myself, I realize how *boring* this shit can appear on the surface. Especially if you aren't familiar with the language of healthcare - which for the life of me is so interesting to armchair philosophize about how it got to be the way it is that I have to berate myself from tangenting on it. But that's beside the point.

In this post, I am looking to focus on the forward-looking plan regarding Clover's relation to the CMS's direct contracting **(regardless of the Biden medicare age catalyst or short interest BS or meme hype)**, where it's coming from, and just what the purpose of the program is in the first place. I want to do it all in simple terms, too. I assume most of us aren't experts on this stuff (although not including people dumping literally a million dollars into CLOV... such whales may look down on me as the tender nemo fish that I am). I'll also be including some of my own speculative opinions on it, and I'm using the same unnamed healthcare billing source I've used in my past DD ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLOV/comments/lxgdfv/on_clov_and_doubt_or_why_i_will_continue_buying/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLOV/comments/m2x9dv/excoriating_vivek_garipalli_or_why_i_will/)).

# WHY IS DIRECT CONTRACTING SIGNIFICANT?

So far as most of us odd-to-witness CLOV possessed apes are aware, Direct Contracting is the government program that *should* give Clover access to 200,000 more patients, and when they got approved for Direct Contracting [Vanguard bought 18% of the float](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/7afa14c7-a614-4017-8b29-d4fd59772317) the day of the leak. However, those 200,000 patients seem somewhat variable to me (at least management wasn't totally clear last earnings call); so I deciding to look into what it is about Direct Contracting that prompted one of the most astute investment firms to buy such a large chunk of the float. To give my discovery outright, **I believe it has to do with** ***how the CMS incentivizes change*** **and** ***how Clover Health seeks to take advantage by aligning themselves with the aims of the CMS***. The Clover wiki ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLOV/wiki/index)) is great for explaining how Clover is disrupting healthcare, but I want to emphasize that *the CMS is actually totally in line with this mission*, and it's not just CLOV spinning its wheels trying to enact disruption on its own. (Which is a hella good thing, btw - I'll explain further later on).

*If you want to make up your own mind about all this stuff I'll link the places I'm getting the info here.*

# WHAT IS DIRECT CONTRACTING?

Global and Professional Direct Contracting is a program created by the '*CMS Innovation Center*' as an alternative payment structure to offer risk-sharing benefits to providers, building on what was learned from ACO models in the past five years. I believe Clover stands out because they not only will be sharing the risk, but **because of Clover Assistant, they will be** ***literally*** ***collaborating*** **on the risk**, making them perfectly designed for MSSP and similar programs the CMS is trying to aggressively push towards - against FFS.

**Did you get that?** **If you did, no need to read further.** If you didn't, my fellow small fish CLOVtards, that is what this post is for.

&#x200B;

# Breaking It Down:

It's good to start by clarifying some language.

When you see ""Global and Professional Direct Contracting"" - ""Global"" and ""Professional"" are not empty or generic buzz words. They denote specific things in terms of healthcare terminology.

""Professional"" refers to the Doctor or the Physician. The Doctor is the ""professional"" of healthcare. They're the pro players getting stuff done.

""Global"", I initially thought, meant ""International"".

**IT DOES NOT - DO NOT BE SMOOTH BRAIN APE LIKE ME**. ""Global"" refers to a payment structure that involves an insurer (or Medicare) paying a ""global rate"" to a specific organization for taking care of a patient. This is the essence of what the CMS is doing to push past Fee-for-Service, but it can be a little complicated so **I'll give an example below.**

# Capitation Example

""Capitation"" is an example of a global AND Professional contracting structure (2 birds 1 stone, baby. Respect the layered density, here). **Capitation is where medicare pays a doctor a specific monthly fee for certain patients they've been 'assigned'**. (Assigned is the literal term used, where each doctor is assigned responsibility for a certain group of patients by medicare or the insurer.) This means **THE RISK OF THE PATIENT IS TRANSFERRED TO THE PHYSICIAN**. 

Why? Because now the physician doesn't get reimbursed for the service costs of the patient, instead they are paid each month a flat rate. **So if the patient's health is poorly managed and incurs a lot of extra fees? The Doctor now takes a financial hit.** That is the essence of a global payment plan - **Paying a global fee from a top-down perspective, and allowing all the gritty details to work themselves out under a payment structure that inherently incentivizes ""cost-saving measures"" and ""improved care"".** (This concept is being spread across multiple structures in healthcare, including medicare advantage, you may have noticed).

# What is Fee For Service

To clarify, FFS (Fee For Service) is simply that the doctor provides a service and charges a fee for doing that service (which the insurer or medicare normally pays at least partially). Direct Contracting is the program opposed to this - aggressively trying to enact 'risk sharing' measures like capitation. **Although the CMS is trying to move away from FFS, it's not so simple. FFS is nice and reliable for doctors, as it involves no risk for them.** They can simply provide their services, and get paid for those services.

(Side note: FFS actually does incur some risk for the Doctor, but that risk has been explained to me as ""dumbassery"" or rather ""insidiousness"", as what some insurance have tried to do is use bureaucratic means to avoid paying for services whenever they can. This is part of the ongoing issue involving ""physician-insurer tension"", which I think Clover also is poised to address very well, also. Back to FFS, though.)

**The** ***problem*** **with FFS is it incentivizes ""quantity over quality"".** The more services a doctor provides, the more they get paid, regardless of how it actually affects the patient. (Both CLOV wiki and the CMS DCE page explain this well). What FFS peeps will tell you is they are actually ""well regulated"" and there are many preventative measures in place.

However, these measures are extensive and legalistic - making them *convoluted and difficult to stay on top of*. **So when you realize all these elaborate legalistic measures are in place** ***because the underlying payment structure is skewed towards perverse incentive -*** **that is when you start to see why some of this stuff is so innovative and why moving away from FFS altogether is reasonable.**

# What is an ACO

Another term to address is 'ACO'. ACO stands for Accountable Care Organization. **It's a global payment structure**, but it's not just physicians who participate. An ACO can span hospitals, doctor groups, specialists, etc. And when these groups partner up with medicare or an insurance company, **they engage in something like 'MSSP' - which stands for 'Medicare Shared Savings Program'**. I'll explain with an example.

The idea is this. The ACO (let's say it's just one hospital, for simplicity) is responsible for a group of patients. Medicare says to the hospital 'last year the population you covered cost around $400 *per member per month*'. So one person costs $400 a month on average that medicare has to pay to the hospital. Entering an ACO agreement, Medicare or an insurer says ""We will pay you a flat rate of $400 a month per member, and if you can get the cost *below* that, we will split the savings."" So if the hospital is able to reduce costs to $390, $5 goes to the hospital and $5 goes to the insurer. Obviously, spanning that across 10,000 patients - you earned an extra $50,000 for your doctors. So by taking on risk (again, that risk being the population could exceed the target price of $400), you were rewarded by reducing cost.

# Clover Assistant is Perfect for This

**Direct contracting will build on this model. And I think the Clover Assistant is almost perfectly built for this.** Where an insurer such as United Health will engage an ACO, and contract efficiently on their side to then allow a hospital to do its own thing and cut costs where it can, **Clover Health is actually set up to** ***collaborate*** **on cost-saving by offering the Clover Assistant to help ensure the population is well managed and both parties can share in the savings. It's absolutely a win-win - and it's set up so both the doctor and Clover share in the savings.**

Think of this especially if you're a smaller doctor group. You're told you have to cut costs, but you're not some hospital that has the resources to track that on a grand scale and implement systematic changes. **How can you also participate?** Well, Clover Assistant gathers data across a much larger group of patients, tracking their data, and uses machine learning to provide actionable data. Now, even a smaller doctor group without extensive patient data can maximize their savings and the health of their population.

# HOW THE CMS INCENTIVIZES CHANGE:

This is super important in my mind and is one of the main reasons I'm really bullish on CLOV in the relatively near term. CMS talks a lot about how Direct Contracting allows providers to 'take on risk and receive rewards'. The rewards part is what I'm most interested in.

Back in 2015, some doctors were still using paper for patient reports and diagnoses. The CMS was like ""Aye, that's not efficient - it adds burden to the system and most of ya'll write like shit. Fuck you"". So to incentivize doctors to use electronic medical records, they said ""If you use electronic medical records and include a certain degree of detail, we will pay $16,000 to EACH doctor who meets our requirement."" Now, you may be unaware of this - but usually doctor's want money. And $16,000 is an exorbitant amount.

So everyone gets on board, of course, and starts using electronic records. Now the next year comes around, and this time medicare says ""we will still reward you for using electronic records, but now only $7,500 per doctor' and also the list of requirements a doctor has to fulfill gets longer. Of course, everyone agrees because they're already doing the majority of the requirements from last year. The following year the rewards diminish and the list of requirements lengthens, and now in 2021 the reward is literally $0, and everyone uses electronic health records **and the system is more efficient**.

This is what happens if you collaborate with the CMS on where they're trying to push for specific changes that benefit the system long term. They reward you well, especially in the beginning, and as you get more efficient and the system improves, those rewards get more strict. **Personally, I think that is absolutely perfect for a growth company like Clover Health.** If you're trying to get off the ground with growth outside your established states, the CMS is the road to that. They can get you on track for growth, and reward your efforts to improve the space (significant especially in the beginning, which is when you need it most as a growth company). Because Clover is newer, it can be more flexible in its alignment with the CMS, **while many much larger companies (United Health and Humana) are going to find it more difficult to shift from FFS -** ***as that is the default and rooted position.***

(Listen to the podcast I linked in the beginning - the CMS is moving swiftly and despite some outcry that they *are moving too fast*, they continue to go ahead with their 'geo model', which eliminates FFS altogether in select regions.)

That is what I think will be the great underlying wave that will allow them to expand and take market share from much larger insurers. **By aligning their aims with the CMS, Clover will have the opportunity to be rewarded early on and prepare for the long road ahead.**

# Conclusion

This is a changing time in healthcare, and I frankly believe Clover is positioned incredibly well to take advantage of it. This stock is more than just a couple of catalysts or a pump and dump. And I'm pretty excited about it.

I am thinking of this as a discussion. Any dissent or thoughts please comment!"

2021-05-04 20:21:23,stocks,"Definitely appreciate you saying that. 

This is certainly the gist I get about their software, especially how it relates to Electronic Medical Records; pretty standard fare.  What makes me interested is the suite-like modular and iterative component as well as the people working on it - specifically Andrew Toy. I actually would have a bunch of questions for you if you don’t mind - (maybe DM me?)

What extent does your other EMR software pertain to actionable patient recommendations? Or rather, what are the comparable features you are referring to?

How often does your other EMR software get ‘updated’? Clover has talked about the intention to update their software every ‘2-3 weeks’. Have you witnessed one of these updates with the Clover Assistant? What kinds of changes took place?

Clover has talked about tele-health features being implemented in an update. Do you have any vision on this?

A big part, in my mind, of the software taking market share in the early stages, is Clover incentivizing doctors (especially PCP’s) by paying them more for using the software. Do you have any vision in this? (Although, I guess you did say it was a demo...)

I can leave it at that for now. I know I’m probably asking a lot from you 😅but it would definitely help me out!"
2021-05-05 00:10:11,stocks,... they were approved for direct contracting already
2021-05-05 10:51:33,stocks,"Sorry for the delay! I hope this helps!

1. Our EMR, and all others I've tried, has actionable notices/alerts on each patient that we can configure with our own settings. eg. Mrs. A's last mammogram was 5 years ago, they are due now. We also have query tools where we can find every patient that is currently due for a particular measure, as well, so we can address is individually or as a part of population management. Clover's appeal seemed to be ""full automation,"" but we are a part of several different reporting and quality programs that all have slightly different recommendations, so they ""human entry"" portion of the measure alerts is actually quite important to us. 
2. Depends on the type of update, really. We use eClinicalWorks and the software goes through complete version updates every year or two, minor bug updates every 2-3 months, and Rx/Coding/Measure database updates every month or so. I didn't get much info on the updates, but I'm guessing the 2-3 week thing is really only for the databases, but I don't know. Would seem unnecessary and difficult to train on if they made fundamental changes to the software that often. 
3. Our EMR has integrated TeleHealth visits for about two years now. Schedule appointments and patients just sign into their portal account on their phone or computer and we can video chat directly inside the EMR. Pretty cool, but they charge $2 every time we use it. Free for all other visits and no up front costs, so it isn't too big of an expense. 
4. I'd have to see the incentives! I tend to prioritize simple workflow for our staff and efficiency for our patients, so it'd have to be seamless to consider it, regardless of how much they pay us to use it. 

I hope that helps!"
2021-05-05 17:01:15,stocks,Yup.. in several states to boot.
2021-05-05 13:28:37,stocks,"That helps a ton thank you! I appreciate you taking the time I also have a few more! I’ll try to keep this list shorter, though.

What were you looking for when you tried the clover assistant? Or, what would have made you think it was a ‘truly innovative tech’?

I believe another portion of Clover’s incentive (beside doctor pay) was that while most EMR software has a monthly fee - the clover assistant is free because it is vertically integrated into a Medicare advantage insurer. Do you have any vision on that? Do you pay monthly for eclinical works? (You mentioned telehealth but I wasn’t sure about pricing overall)

Also, how often does anyone else pay you to use their software? Or what are other incentives?

Possibly separate and unrelated - how do you feel about the direction the CMS is taking with direct contracting? Are you an ACO or do your physicians participate in capitation? What is the state of FFS of the industry, in your opinion?


That was longer than I intended, lol. And I’m sure you’re working atm - but when you have time please let me know!"
2021-05-05 16:17:48,stocks,"No worries. I'm actually home sick right now (not Covid, just sinus infection) so I don't have much else to do, anyway. :)

1. They sent our practice a cold call email with the features and it seemed cool looking, so I tried it out. I tend to try lots of demos mostly just to see what is out there, but I never really have plans to make a full switch because we like ECW. It was more curiosity than a desire to switch, really. If it had been a platform that could have integrated directly into our EMR, that would have been better. 
2. We pay a quarterly licensing free for ECW and had/have some setup costs with new features. Overall, the expense is roughly $15k + $5k per provider, per year. I think the biggest hurdle is that it isn't using practice data, but insurance claim data. In theory, that should be the same, but it is definitely not in practice. We are also rather unique in that we don't participate with Medicare, so we have very few MA patients and wouldn't be able to use this for 95% of our patients. That point was probably my biggest reason for not adding one extra tool, even though it is free. At some point, there is just too much data and you can't expect employees to navigate it efficiently, so we stick with basic measures and just try to do really well on them. 
3. Nobody else has offered to pay us to use a service, so that is unique. Athena has a free EMR version, but it is ad-supported so our visit notes would look like they're sponsored by a drug company, which isn't a good look! The financial incentive selling points seem to be the ability to easily qualify for Medicare Meaningful Use, but we don't participate so that benefit doesn't help us. 
4. I have had more pitches for a direct contracting service in the last two months than I've had in 14 years, so I feel like a ton of companies are trying to jump on what they are as easy money. We are a part of an ACO, but are not subject to capitation. I think FFS is going away, but not until something like Medicare for All is passed. Not sure of the timeline there, but I'd expect 2023 to be the point where smaller primary cares actually start moving towards something like that. Our ACO has put December 2022 as their ""you must promise to at least consider a capitation model"" deadline, but we are not required to switch at that point. 

Lastly, because we don't take Medicare, I don't think we are exactly Clover's target market right now and may not be the best perspective on their sales pitch. All the commercial insurances are already doing their own similar thing, so they'll be competing with existing products from BCBS/Cigna/UHC/etc. if they ever mean to expand past Medicare."
2021-05-05 18:36:16,stocks,"Wow, thank you very much for your time. These are the last questions I'll ask and hope you feel better soon. It's okay if you're not really their target market  IMO - this info is, like, profoundly juicy to me. But here goes:

1. From what I can tell, the risk-sharing models do seem to be in good faith and have a reliable chance of reducing the cost of care and at least *maintaining* quality of care. Other than the reliability of FFS, why is there resistance to these changes? (For large and/or smaller primary cares)
2. In your opinion, why have healthcare startups failed in the past and why are there so many cropping up now? I am personally a simp for Chamath and I did some previous DD debunking misleading info on the CEO. This has caused me to kind of fall into favor with CLOV, but I'd like to know what you think about the general health insurance marketplace.
3. Related to that - Why has BCBS/Cigna/UHC/etc. been so difficult to meet competitively? Has it just been economy of scale issues and that's it? To what extent do these companies legitimately meet their reputation of being corrupt in various systematic ways? Or do you disagree with that at all?

And that's where I'll try to curb my curiosity haha. Really appreciate your responses and I've gotten more from this than I could've hoped in the first place! Thanks again!"

Using any form of „advanced“, but easily accessible metrics and drawing triangles on the graph is as useless as rolling a dice. 

However our brain is stupid. Winning/Losing a lot of money in a short period of time needs a reason. Even though the real explanation is luck. 

Ask yourself this question: Whatever you are calculating and drawing on the graphs, couldn’t that being automated by some of the smartest data scientists in the world? If that’s the case it goes two ways:
1. It is a good strategy, and the ones who apply it first will make a lot of money (those connected with fiber cables directly to the market, not you), and you will be buying and selling after them every time giving them your money. 
2. The strategy is random horse shit and you are just paying trading fees unnecessarily often. 

In my opinion TA should be considered casino. Not because „haha sometimes you win some, sometimes you lose some“, but because you will actually lose over the long term and the only ones winning are the exchanges, or Hedge Funds with their supercomputers.

I really think there should be some sort of enforcement against misleading TA, which is in my opinion any TA.

Why not do an experiment? Use just TA and see how you do for a week or month of trading? Then, use just TA and do the opposite of what it says for the same length of time. Then, ignore the TA completely for the same length of time. That way you have three conditions.

Those narratives would suggest that restaurants, hotels, airlines, and auto manufacturers are all flying high right now. The problem is, none of it is true.

Since \[edit\] **mid**\-February…

* Tripadvisor, Expedia, and Booking are flat
* Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt are flat
* Ford, GM, and Toyota are flat
* Restaurants are mixed
* Airlines are down

The real rotation isn’t toward any of that. If you put conventional labels aside, this is really a rotation from feel-good stocks to feel-bad stocks. Since February, anything young people actually want to invest in has been annihilated: technology, e-commerce, semiconductors, renewable energy, cannabis, disruptive tech, EVs, and so on. Even if you exclude all the speculation and only include profitable, well-established companies, this is still very much the case.

What has done well? Energy, financials, materials, and industrials. In other words, dirty money. Gas and oil = drivers of climate change, financials = sharky capitalism, industrials and materials = environmental degradation and warfare. It's almost like the more nefarious the business model is, the better! (Lockheed is up 16% since March 1. Northrop is up over 25%. Feels bad.)

Now, I know what some of you are thinking – some version of “the stock market isn’t the place to change the world.” I'm just making an observation. It’s kind of a “if you can’t beat ‘em, do you join ‘em?” moment. Will this rotation be a short-term blip or a long drawn out shift away from feel-good investing?

**Update:** There's not much love for ESG investing on this sub. Still got a few ideas for how to feel good in times like these: Food and beverage (SYY, USFD, UNFI), outdoor recreation (ONEW, CWH), homebuilders and building supplies"

Why ETFs? Because I haven't done proper research on specific companies yet, but the Macro picture"
2021-05-04 21:20:56,stocks,"I think, no offense, that your statement is a little bit off, for two reasons. One, I don't think the market gives so much as half a shyte about politics. ""Dirty versus clean,"" I think, is probably meaningless to the machine. Secondly, this is an observation you were supposed to make a year ago. In other words, you were supposed to anticipate, somewhat, and buy the recovery stocks months ago. (Although, there's still a need to be discerning; some in your list, imo, are risky.) And then you'd probably also be sitting pretty right now with more recently purchased oil, gas, fin and industrials, etc. Although, honestly it doesn't matter, you're still going to be unhappy when there's a contraction. We're only happen on the green days, regardless of entry point. But that really is the issue, it's generally not what we buy, but when we buy it. And, you know, there's two factors at play here, too, because buying a recovery stock so early, in anticipation, would seemingly involve greater risk. And I suppose it does."
2021-05-05 01:55:13,stocks,I just bought a Financials ETF and an Industrials ETF a couple months ago to counterbalance the tech in my portfolio and couldn't be happier about it. Makes days like this easier to handle because at least I've got some green in my portfolio.

2021-05-05 07:15:42,stocks,"I mean... how are speculative stocks ""feel good."" Especially all the IPO's weve seen in tech? There is nothing good about them. They are carbon copies of other companies and a lot of them are morally bankrupt with CEO's and execs lying out the wazoo. And yet, they all ran up 2x-3x IPO.

There is no way that run up in speculative stock was sustainable. Half of those new IPO's from last year are probably not going to survive the next 5-10 years. But good companies did ran up a lot too and like anything else, but some have held up pretty well. But like anything, you cant keep going up that fast. Eventually value becomes important and will put a stop to it unless you have some crazy fundamentals to keep valuation high, but most do not."

2021-05-05 11:54:53,stocks,"The reason I'm personally not worried about that is because it's not a zero sum game with financials / Industrials and tech stocks. They're just on two different tracks currently.

Industrials and Financials do well during economic expansion, which were certainly going to be experiencing for a while as we recover from self imposed covid financial devastation. So these stocks are working right now and they'll continue to work over the medium+ term as well.

Tech stocks on the other hand are experiencing a sell off and people are profit taking to fund their rotation into these other areas. As fears of interest rates rising causes people to value companies that are profitable now rather than high growth unprofitable companies. And even the profitable mega cap tech companies are getting sold off due to their high valuations, because these other stocks are just cheaper. So these stocks just aren't working in the short term. I do believe they'll come back with a vengeance in the future, so I've averaged my base down in some of my favorite tech stocks and I'm just sitting and waiting for these to come back into favor. So this is more of a long term play.

So in short, I'm using Financials/ Industrials as a short to medium term play and my tech stocks are a long term play. They don't cancel each other out...they'll just hit peak performance at different times and my strategy is to benefit from both of them rather than putting all my eggs in one basket"

And as evidence I would present personnel records: Large company, daily testing, hundreds have tested positive, yet very few - certainly less than two present - have suffered any symptoms at all.  Obviously I can't actually present personnel records. But if you are asymptomatic there are only two possibilities - either a false positive or natural immunity.  That's a fact; without testing you/ we/ wouldn't even know you've had an exposure, or, ""have"" Covid. This isn't the Black Plague here, it's just not. It was politicized, first as a mechanism exploited to influence, actually manipulate an election; second, to ensure passage of spending bills, the theft of taxpayer dollars. Meanwhile many young and healthy are refusing the vaccine, and refusing, as they rightfully should, the vaccination of their children.  This against a background, a party history, of taking lives, in some cases by the tens of thousands, for example at Benghazi, or in Iraq, simply to enhance political stature. Some 40,000 civilians died in Libya; likewise it was said, in Iraq we bulldozed 100,000 right into the desert sands, and then we turned heels, to Afghanistan. The point is, our political machine does not care one iota about lives and possesses zero scruples regarding the taking of life. It does not mind sacrificing Americans to risky vaccines, even to such a bioweapon itself, to maintain its wealth and power. And we ALL know it. So I think it's time for the political idiocy to stop.

The only way to hedge against inflation is to diversify into multiple different areas and to sell off when one area gets pumped and buy the others when they get dumped. It's why you see treasury yields jump some days, or digicurrency or the gold mines. Everybody has their own way to hedge inflation, some just buy raw gold and hold it.  Real estate works when the markets not stupid high, good time to offload properties though. 

And to make sure you make money off the inflation spending before the inflation drops.  Some of which has already occurred. 

Good luck out there, just remember above all else some inflation is healthy and historically inevitable, excessive inflation is disastrous. We dont know how close to the edge we are but it's a ways away and theres lots of market mechanisms that can be used before raising interest rates.

2021-05-04 21:47:14,stocks,Depends on what people want to and can buy and what folks expectations of inflation.  The economy is unlikely to soak up all the money but will likely soak up more money than the alarmist are screaming about.
2021-05-04 23:46:38,stocks,"depends on where the money goes. Give 25% more money to billionaires and they just blow it into equities since they can't increase their consumption and the velocity of money doesn't increase at all. Give the money to poor/lower income people and the increased demand can actually cause CPI inflation.

So the value of the dollar in the first situation won't change at all unless you want to buy equities. Whether or not the value of that dollar changes is highly dependent on where you plan to spend said dollar"

Demand can increase the price of certain goods if supply cannot keep up, but this is a temporary phenomenon as the increase in these prices raises the incentives to produce these goods and reach equilibrium again.

A bear certificate or a sell option is not the whole market. A bond or a commodity is not a bear derivative. 

A REIT that has to reprice it’s assets will generate a P&L profit. 90% of that profit has to be paid as dividends. Problem is that there is zero free cash flow generated from that profit. Add increases interest rates as they are always heavily leveraged. 

You see a problem here? I don’t think you do based on your recommendations. 

Inflation is devastating for most REITs."
2021-05-05 04:45:40,stocks,Yes but for some goods I think the prices will be elevated for quite some time. For example building a semiconductor factory costs billions and years to build. Companies aren't going to increase capacity if they think this high demand is only temporary. Then they would have a brand new factory in 2025 but no demand to produce chips.

Started in Dec. Was sure solar (TAN), Lithium great buys got into tech etc (ARKK).

Mid Feb was up 20%, cloud-9

Then the crash in March, starting selling buying other things. Decided to do the wheel w/ CSP / CC (thinking it is safer).

Slowly started to buy more value ETFs and dumping my specific stocks.

Kept telling myself that I need to be patient, at the same time checking the stock app 10 times an hour.

Today I think was the last of it. I had FSLY CSP for 63.5 (did my DD, love the company) but today that CSP was negative 200$ (but, would end up getting assigned, got scared, sold the CSP took the loss, and bought VTI).

I still have some speculative stuff, one being TAN but think I will end up holding it,

This is exactly the opposite of true. By your logic, every single person new to investing, who is everyone as some point, tried to time the market and aren't in the market (what???) by being inspired to try get into the market due to a event.

The entire point of the post isn't that new investors deserve huge gains or sympathy, it's just providing the perspective of the current influx of new investors (nearly all of which started at the same time with the same reason) who likely will progagate these sorts of subs with our posts/questions are experiencing this particular journey."
2021-05-04 20:46:09,stocks,Same for even the best. You can’t predict when or sometimes why to rebalance. Have your settings allow you to notify your risk. I usually cut the cord on newest buys for less than 5 years maybe 2 years. If 20% is your tolerance for loss. Your choice. I my case. I need to harvest losses as well. Last few years that was hard. Lots of gains. Nice 👍🏻 problem. Rebalance when you think about it. Look Kathy Wood. Ark investments she’s smart. Has her intuition and produced winners. The run may continue. The portfolios are great. Some speculation on the space ark. Any how that’s the fun stuff to own now.
2021-05-04 22:19:47,stocks,"Sometimes being a consumer of a company can help you see some trends that can help you find a good purchase, but over time learn to separate your outlook on various companies between your perception as an investor and as a consumer.

I bought a laptop with an Intel chip this year, but I got over $20k in AMD.

A few fundamentals I see some young investors struggle with, myself in the past included, is understanding P/E, revenue, and net profit. But more importantly, go a step further and understand what competitive advantages a company has to gain future profits without the rise in competition from other companies that will undercut them. Certain companies can find ways to get more pricing power in contracts with other companies or be able to price a little higher with consumers. 

Firstly, since the peak in February I'm up 9%, something to keep in mind. 

These high-growth companies everyone gets excited about should be a part of your investment portfolio, but only a part. Many of them will fail or one day be out-competed by another company, while 1 will remain as the next big thing. They're riskier and more volatile in the interim. They haven't made it yet, they're just on the cusp of maybe making it. Look beyond just the recent price performance of the stock.

&#x200B;

Take CHWY as an example.  They've yet to make a profit. Let me say that again, they've yet to make a profit.

In 2020 They had revenue's of $4.85B, but their net income with expenses was -$252.37m. 

They still need to do 1 of 3 things generally speaking:

1) Get pricing negotiation power over suppliers to get a higher cut of the products they are retailing.

2) Get a higher price from consumers that are buying the product

3) Get more efficiencies to lower expenses per amount of revenue they take in.

CHWY is getting traction on their stock price, because they are on the edge of being able to turn a profit and possibly grow larger, but they haven't yet.

If there is any small downtrend in the market, stocks like this are bound to fall faster and deeper. Investor's are paying a premium for a stock that might turn a profit later.

In the meantime, they offer no dividend, so the stock doesn't give the investor anything back directly. The fwd P/E ratio, with analyst expectations they will be profitable in 2022, is still $442.89 (CFRA).  This means you are paying $442.89 for each $1 they earn. That is extremely high. To be worth the current price, not only do they need to start turning a profit, they need a high enough profit to make that P/E ratio lower between $15-$35.

This tells me any little news that shows forward momentum of improvement will make investors get excited, but any bad news on the macro-economy or about their suppliers, consumers, or the company can cause larger drops in the price.

&#x200B;

An example of a growing retail company that is a more stable investment is TSCO, Tractor Supply Company. They have a growing consumer market on the exurban edge of large and mid-size cities. One of the fewer places brick and mortar retailers have room for growth.

This is an example of a company that has made it, has room for growth, and the stock is paying out.

They have had several years of sustained profits. In 2020 They have a revenue of $10.6B and a net profit of $749m. 

The stock is paying a divided to shareholders just over 1% annually.  The P/E ratio is 26.87. This means for each $26.87 in the cost of the stock the company is making $1 after expenses.

What to expect is there is room for growth and room for the stock to go down, like any company. But it will be less volatile than CHWY. If there is a small hiccup in the macro-economy investors won't be as nervous. It's a stable company turning a profit that can justify its price without as much future growth. Whereas, CHWY depends on that future growth that is in jeopardy.

This exercise isn't about saying TSCO is better than CHWY or the opposite. That is not the point and I'd be interested in buying both.

But this is an exercise in understanding and managing risk. I was some riskier companies with real potential, but I choose carefully what % of my portfolio are those types of companies. I have other parts of my portfolio that are growth companies that have already achieved success and have lower P/E ratios, but are less risky during small downturns.

Then I have another portion of my portfolio that are value companies. These are stable companies that I don't expect much growth (beyond growth from inflation), in fact some are slowly in decline, but they're stable, common to consumers and produce dividends. Sometimes just 2-3%, but sometimes 7%. That is annual income from the stocks, not tied to changes in the share price at all.

&#x200B;

There are two important sides to investing, 1) finding companies that will grow and 2) managing the overall risk you're taking in finding that growth.

It is easy to find growing companies during a long Bull Market, but these popular companies with these large potential upsides in stock price are the riskiest during a bear market or even a small downturn. You're not paying for the profits they are making now, you're paying a huge premium for profits you believe they will be making in 5-6 years vs. a company that is making the profits now.

So don't just look at the performance of a stock by share price over the last few years, rather look at it on a broader level of how much that company is making for that share price and how down it will probably go in a downturn.

&#x200B;

I might buy some CHWY myself for my riskier portfolio allotments, but I know their profits haven't come close to justifying that price. It is priced at profit potential 2-3 years out and any sign of a potential downturn or problem will cause some volatile dips that aren't always guaranteed to recover.

(Side note: I'm long on TSCO. I needed a good comparison to examine risk. At it's current price, I believe it to be slightly overvalued. It has been a good long-term investment.)"

2021-05-05 01:28:04,stocks,">""you have not lost any money if you have not sold any stock.""

No offense to your father, but I think this type of thinking (which I see often here), is a bit flawed. Stocks are a liquid assets, they are not ""imaginary money"" and any drop in value is very much real.

>That's called ""time in the market"".

GE is not ""the market"", it is just one stock. You have no guarantee that this one stock will ever recover to the value you bought it at. If you continue to hold, you should consider why you're doing that. If you had never invested in that stock in the first place, would you honestly invest in it today? This isn't specific to GE, the same can be said about any stock.

Another thing you have to consider is opportunity cost. It might seem that continuing to hold on to a stock doesn't cost you anything, but you have to consider whether you can get a better ROI somewhere else. Let's use GE as an example (again this is just an example, I'm not very familiar with the actual stock and don't care to speculate about what it could realistically do). Let's assume that it eventually does recover, but it takes a decade. It would have to rise about 60% of its current price to get back to $20.82. So in this hypothetical scenario, you didn't lose any money right? But what if you shifted your investment to something else? If we look at the 5 year performance we can see that SPY doubled itself in those 5 years. If for the sake of argument we assume this bull run continues, obviously SPY would still be a better investment than GE (in this completely hypothetical scenario). Obviously it could also be the other way around, but the point is you have to consider *why* you're holding on to this stock, what reasons you have to believe it would outperform other stocks and the broader market."

Based on his post, it is clear that he thinks he have invested in the market, which he clearly haven’t if he is down since February. I continue on to explain what people mean by “the market”.

He also says that he was under the impression that more time in the market is better, but that doesn’t mean that you can be down for a few months. It just means that for most people, staying invested over the decades is more profitable than moving in and out of the market based on most recent returns.

He also says that he came to Reddit after what I assume was the GME hype. It is fairly obvious that OP is under the impression that he should be investing in the things Reddit was talking about at that time. Which was clean energy, Arkk and tech. It also seems that he thinks this is what everyone is doing. My argument is that this is a form of market timing, since investing in a specific sector or industry is a statement that the sector will outperform its benchmark, on a desired metric, in the period to come.

Hope that makes sense?"
2021-05-05 12:27:56,stocks,"Agree, a bad investment is a bad investment, and $1,000 lost is $1,000 lost.  But, bad investments can be of value if we learn something from them.  What I learned early on is that investing in individual stocks, including the Hertz, Luckin's, etc., of the world assumes more risk than investing in broad market funds.  It's not like bad investments are a recent thing.  As an example, the Enron implosion back in 2001.  

I choose to invest in solid companies (and the not so solid companies too) by purchasing and holding VTI.  During the sell-off in 2008-2009, I just kept investing in the market, while seeing my portfolio drop 40%.  Had this been one stock, the falling knife analogy would have well applied.  Didn't take too many years before my original (pre-2008) investment balance had tripled.    

WSB is investment gambling, but a very entertaining read.  Always good to know what's happening on Tuesday nights behind the local Wendy's.   Jim Cramer's Mad Money TV show is similar.  Cramer says straight out that his stock recommendations are not intended for retirement purposes, but rather for investing with money that people can afford to lose.         

P.S. It was troubling to see people buying Hertz after it declared for bankruptcy.  Not sure how many understood that the last people to receive any funds if a company dissolves are the shareholders (assuming there are any funds left)."

And then they have to make sure you know it, because that's where they derive their self worth. It's a pretty lame tactic lol"
2021-05-05 09:04:44,stocks,"You make a very good argument. No, GE is not ""the market"", it is one example. I chose GE as my example because it is lower than any of my others. It may not recover. I am holding out of a belief in the market as a whole. I have faith that as the market as a whole soars, GE will follow. And because I was taught that the main trait a person needs to be successful in the stock market is patience. 

Would I buy it today? Good question. My life is completely different today than it was when I bought-- GE is completely different as well. It still pays a dividend, but not enough to attract me through that alone. I no longer live in Boston and have not kept up with my friends there, so unlikely it would be on my radar today.

I could have chosen AT&T as my example, which I first bought around $35. Would I buy it today? Yes, been buying it and very good dividend on that one. Still in it for the long haul, too.

Currently, I still believe if I don't sell anything I don't lose any money. I have enough in other stocks that have done super well (like Berkshire Hathaway, which I bought at $51) to offset these ... shall we call them ""long term dips"" ...in other areas.

Stocks fell on Tuesday following a mixed session yesterday, as the selloff in technology stocks accelerated following remarks from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Market participants wait for the next set of corporate earnings reports and economic data, particularly the April Jobs report due to be released May 7.

Stocks fell after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested she thought interest rates in the US might need to rise in the near term in order to prevent an economic overheating as recovery continues. Rising rates would weigh on the valuations of growth companies and could slow down the recent rally to fresh highs. Janet Yellen said, “It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them."" This somewhat contradicts recent commentary from members of the Federal Reserve, will have to see how this story unfolds.

Earnings season continues to exceed even the most optimistic expectations, with more than 85% of the companies that have reported exceeding expectations by an average of 22.1%, according to data from FactSet. These strong earnings beat, however, many companies did not see their stocks pop up. Analysts largely chalk this up to the already elevated expectation Wall Street had coming into this earnings season. Hilary Kramer (no relation) said, “The numbers were good but Wall Street's response was neutral at best. When the best earnings growth since 2010 spawns a yawn it's pretty clear that perfection is priced in. While there's no seasonal sell signal flashing, there's no immediate reason to buy either. This is a great opportunity to review your positions, make any adjustments, and then retreat to the sidelines for the next few months.”

The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March’s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.

Everyone seems to be thinking about inflationary risk and how to position themselves, and it sounded like this ETF is a good way to do that without having to try and pick individual stocks myself. What do you guys think?

His strategy seemed to be targeting resource companies that make money not directly from extraction, but through from some complicated financing of their operations that I didn’t really understand. The other large group of companies were financial exchanges like Chicago Mercantile and some data companies than benefit from volume and have relative freedom to adjust to price changes. These justifications seemed sound to me, but again I’m very aware of my ignorance.

2021-05-05 00:00:00,stocks,"Short selling against the box I recently learned about short selling against the box and since most people don't know what this means I thought some of you might benefit from my mistake.  


**What is Short selling against the box?**   
This happens when you have a long position and you short it while keeping your long. For example, if you own 10 shares of TSLA and you short 3 and don't sell your long - you create a boxed short. *This means your broker can close out you out of your short position at any time if they need to cover the shorts they have from other accounts for X reasons.* Not only that but my broker not just covered my short but also sold the equal amount of longs to cover my short even though I had cash to cover it. At the end of the day this means I was left with 7 shares without ever have any control of it how it was executed. Lastly, you could hold that short for months and months without anything ever happening but as soon as the broker needs to cover other shorts they will close your boxed position. I held mine for almost 9 months without anyone saying anything or any alert being shown communicating it would be closed out at any time.

**Why is this prohibited?**   
From a broker standpoint they use this rule to have liquidity to cover their shorts at any time needed including if you actually own those shares. From a tax standpoint, before 1997 you could have used a box short as a way to avoid paying taxes on your gains for a period of time.

**How to circumvent this rule?**  
Create a separate account and hold the short there. If you only have a short position it's not considered a box position.

2021-05-05 10:23:27,stocks,I agree he's overpaid. but if he's working a 40 hour week he should be fired. I'd bet closer to 70-90.
2021-05-05 00:57:46,stocks,">There are people who will tell you we shouldn't pay people a livable wage, such as $15/hr or more. Yet this one CEO is making around $35,000/hr (based on 40 hour work week). 

Nobody is saying it should be illegal to pay people $15 an hour. People say it shouldn't be illegal to pay them $14 an hour. Let the market decide what a person's labor is worth. Also, I doubt he only works 40 hours a week lol. 

>Think about that for a minute when you hear arguments that your fast food will go up in price. It's not the low wage worker getting paid more that is the problem, it's the CEO and everyone else making insanely unjust amount of money. 

GE has ~175,000 employees. If you divided his pay amongst the workers that would be $400 a year or about 20 cents extra per hour assuming everyone is paid hourly and works 40 hours a week. I assure you, GE spends way more on employees that aren't executives than they do on executives. 

> No way is any one person worth this much money.

What is someone's labor worth? It's worth what they're willing to accept and what others are willing to pay. If GE is willing to pay him $73m a year and he's willing to accept it, then he's worth that much. I would argue hamburger flippers don't deserve $15 an hour, but I don't own McDonald's or burger king so it's not my call. I don't know why you're so concerned about what other people do with their money."
2021-05-05 11:27:55,stocks,">	So this fucking guy thinks the company can afford money for himself and the executives, but not more for the shareholders?

How many shares does ge have outstanding? If 100% of his pay was revoked and put towards dividends they probably couldn’t even fund increasing it by 1 cent per share. 

People forget how small these big numbers are in the grand scheme of things when talking about these massive companies. 

Thats not to say the money couldn’t be put to better use internally investing in the company, but his salary and the lack of a dividend increase is unrelated."
2021-05-05 01:16:56,stocks,"I mean it probably wasn't 74 mil in cash, it was probably mostly vesting stock options."

In the view of the board, he brings in more than $72m per year in incremental value over letting some guy who would do if for $1m run the company.

That's basically it.  You can hate on high CEO pay all you want, but if the CEO brings in incremental value (or the board perceives him or her to be able to bring in that much incremental value), then the  pay is worth it.   And if the board starts thinking that a new CEO can do better, they can and do make a change.  That's how it works."

2021-05-05 10:33:08,stocks,"Modern corporate bureaucracy is reaching peak inefficiency. Most people don’t actually produce any output, many aren’t capable of doing it either because they’ve been marginalized by cumbersome processes and their responsibilities have become so niche, as to limit the impact (negative or positive) that an individual can have on the business. The result is a bunch of people talking about what should be done, but nobody doing anything, no output. Or you have people reporting out on work that someone else did. They become project management organizations. It’s not a fulfilling environment to work in if you enjoy creative output."

2021-05-05 07:46:16,stocks,"Oh yes definitely I agree, this is due to atrocious performance by the board of directors/compensation committee.

I know back in Immelt’s time it was basically mostly his lifelong buddies/professional acquaintances on the board, meaning he had very little actual performance oversight or checks/restraint on his compensation. Not sure if things have changed much since then - if this non-binding shareholder vote just now gets disregarded by the board, then I guess the answer is not much/nothing has changed since Immelt’s day."
2021-05-05 09:46:47,stocks,"Well done for making a shrewd investment and making such great returns - but looking at the GE price chart, I’m guessing you invested right at the bottom in March 2020? 

The current stock price is basically back to where it was at the start of 2020 - ie it collapsed due to Covid, then bounced back quickly (along with the rest of the market) due to the rapid recovery + Powell’s supportive measures.

What part of that was driven by Culp though? I mean it would’ve been unfair to blame the CEO for the share price halving due to Covid in March 2020 (along with the wider of the market) so how can you give him credit for the equivalent recovery?

If GE was up 200% and substantially above its pre Covid level, then I’d agree with you - but it isn’t. Also more importantly, long term shareholders (ie who didn’t buy at the bottom in March 2020) are at best break even from early 2020 - so why does the CEO warrant a huge bonus?"
2021-05-05 07:51:18,stocks,"Yeah but GE is a particularly egregious case - its CEOs since and including Immelt have been presiding over a consistent destruction in shareholder value/declining stock price, whilst awarding themselves enormous pay packets (even by most F500 standards).

I mean if GE’s stock price had kept up with the S&P500 over the last 10yrs, I would still say that’s quite mediocre and you could still very much make the argument the CEOs were overpaid. But they haven’t even managed to achieve that - in fact shareholders have been losing money year after year. And this with a company that was an absolute industrial and corporate powerhouse back in its day.

Also as others have said here, the fact that the GE board of directors have such awful oversight of a CEO’s performance and compensation is an indicator itself of the state of company management."

No they don't. Nobody is entitled to any amount of money, goods, or services. You have to earn it. Nobody is entitled to the product of someone else's labor. 

&#x200B;

\>  we as a society can agree that we want everybody working full time to have a livable wage.  

&#x200B;

I would disagree. Why should people only have to work 40 hours a week? That's arbitrary. Why not 80 hours a week? Why not 100? Why not how every many hours it takes for them to make enough money to live the life they want to live?

&#x200B;

\>   Like almost all other western countries have as well.

First off, there are OECD countries without minimum wages. Second, I don't care what other countries do. That's not my business or concern. 

&#x200B;

\>  I dont want to live in a country with loads of poor uneducated and unhappy people and ugly ghetto's everywhere. 

&#x200B;

There are poor people in every country. Luckily, America has the richest poor people in the world. Poor people are so well off they have TVs, smart phones, and are often times fat. Also, money doesn't make people happy. If you think someone who's wife left them with the kids would be happy because they got a raise you're insane. 

&#x200B;

\>  I want to live in a country with nice, happy and educated people. 

&#x200B;

What, you think a $15 an hour minimum wage will make people nicer? That seems farfetched. Leave your city and you'll find that people in America are very nice. People that live in cities tend to be jerks. I don't think this is an American phenomenon, I think it's a city phenomenon. Also, Americans are educated. The overwhelming majority finish high school and many go to college despite college being pointless for most people. This coming from someone with a master's degree. You go to college to get a job where you will learn how to do the job while working the job. 

&#x200B;

\>  Who are able to take care of themselves, eachother and surroundings.

Not everyone can take care of themselves. It is unfortunate, but I should not be coerced with the threat government violence to take care of those people. I help people voluntarily, but it pisses me off that people want to steal from me to give to unproductive people.

Like you say he hasn’t really had much time - but then why award himself such a huge comp package in advance of actually achieving his objectives/delivering shareholder value?

We can agree to disagree I guess. Just in my personal view all the recent GE CEOs have a habit of “putting the cart before the horse” in terms of paying themselves huge compensation before they actually start achieving much - and in the case of previous recent CEOs it hasn’t worked out too well.

My original post was contrasting that to guys like Bezos/Musk or Nadella and Pichai. All of those guys are extremely well paid of course - but the difference is they have been awarded huge pay packets after they started delivering significant value of shareholders, not before (as seems to be GE management’s approach).

Edit: just seen your edit. Ok I guess we really don’t differ that much in our views - hopefully this guy does have what it takes to turn GE around, and like I said in my original post I think GE has the potential to be a great company once again. Just that this pay award seems all too familiar to previous recent CEOs."

I think many CEOs run the business reasonably well, but that they could be replaced by someone else who is also equally competent. Also, in many cases (GE being the example cited here), they get paid huge amounts even when they fail and are incompetent.

I think in general boards overvalue what CEOs add and that the money spent on CEOs would be better redistributed to shareholders or reinvested back into the company. I think for many boards there can be a kind of confirmation bias going on as well. We picked this guy cause he's the best, let's pay him like he's the best."

Well you already do that. The roads you drive on the police and military and fire departments that keep you safe, the schools and libraries that educate you are all the product of the entire society taking care of themselves. Leading to in the end a better life for everybody. 

> Why should people only have to work 40 hours a week? That's arbitrary. 

Well its not arbitrary. Its what we as a society agreed to is a good value with a good enough work life balance. Its also not coincidentally close to the average value where working more hours gives diminishing returns for the average person.

> there are OECD countries without minimum wages 

Yes, but that's because they don't need one as everybody can get by on the market rate. Something that's definitely not the case in the USA.

> Second, I don't care what other countries do 

You should, some great lessons can be learned from looking at your peers. Both good and bad.

>America has the richest poor people in the world. Poor people are so well off they have TVs, smart phones, and are often times fat. 

Poor people in all western countries have smart phones and TV's. But in other western countries they also have free access to means to help them stop being poor. Like free education, healthcare, livable minimum wage etc. They are not stuck in an endless cycle of overworked and underpaid poorness like can happen in the USA.

>Also, money doesn't make people happy. If you think someone who's wife left them with the kids would be happy because they got a raise you're insane. 

? I did not say any of this. 

> What, you think a $15 an hour minimum wage will make people nicer? 

Of course the stress that comes with being poor is a great burden on your mental state and general outlook on the world. And being poor is the number one indicator for crime.

> Leave your city and you'll find that people in America are very nice. People that live in cities tend to be jerks. 

I have lived in small towns, cities and in between across 3 countries. Not in the USA, but have visited both smaller towns and cities there. Let me tell you, people are nice everywhere. Its just that people tend to actually know each other in smaller communities which leads to people being able to act on their niceness more. 

> Americans are educated. The overwhelming majority finish high school 

Yes this is the standard across the western world. But what I mean is that a poor families cannot pay for tertiary education or even need their kids to work during high school. And has a higher chance to remain poor due to that fact.

> You go to college to get a job where you will learn how to do the job while working the job. 

Oh yes I agree. I'm in engineering, the first thing we tell fresh hires is that they dont know anything and we expect to lose money on them for at least a year. Not to discourage them, but to stop them from getting imposter syndrome. 

> Not everyone can take care of themselves. It is unfortunate, but I should not be coerced with the threat government violence to take care of those people.  

Maybe even you cant if you get hit by a car tomorrow. And for cases like that we agreed as a society to pay for the minimal care for those people in the form of tax.

> people want to steal from me to give to unproductive people. 

No, my point is to let the rich people pay for it. You are not rich.  If you are, call me. My company builds super yachts that you might be interested in. They start at 300.000.000$

> Also related, the American people are the most generous people in the world. 

Yeah and thats great that you guys want to help other people lead better lives as well. But it baffles me that the easiest and cheapest ways to help the people around you are not being utilized. Mainly a worthy minimum wage and socialized healthcare.

> The United States government spent over six trillion dollars last year. Is that enough money to fix all our problems? 

I kinda get why you would not want to give the US government more money. They dont have a great track record and cant even be trusted with the friggin roads. 2 parties cannot even come close to envelop the entirety of human political opinions and views. And secondly everything is so partisan that nothing can get build without the others trying to sabotage or demolish it. Then you have blatant corruption which for some reason gets called lobbying there. This even caused the US to be classified as a flawed democracy.

But there are effective ways to fight poverty. Just look at other countries and steal their best ideas. (Like increasing minimum wage and tax on rich people)."

Totally agree, but again that's pretty much all name brand vs store brands things right?

Like I love Costco, I get the Kirkland Costco brand of products over name brand and save 20-40%. Laundry detergent alone saves me $100s a year just because I don't buy Tide.

Executives are determined by the board of directors who often promote/recruit amongst each other. So there’s just no incentive for them to not compensate extravagantly when they need to continue maintaining cordial relationships with each other to govern other corporations they serve on the board for.

And because economy is booming, to cut down overheating, they must increase interest rates. This means that all tech stocks, Nvidia, Amazon, Netflix etc become even more overvalued. And having overvalued stock is very risky play.

And of cause second thing is summer season and Covid-19. Covid-19 is about to end , people start traveling, shopping etc. This means that we don't need to use Netflix so much. And amazon. People are going to spend their money on other things. Tech becomes even more overvalued then.

All over the world there are segments of non-transparent, powerful, legitimate, and unincorporated groups of people who operate to their own ends.

To what ends? That’s actually the least important. People come up with all sorts of things to attribute to “the deep state”.  Typically though it’s just assholes being assholes. 

The main thing that should concern you is when something comically horrific happens and the “deep state” covers it up AND so does everyone else.

So you have things like the CIA distributing crack in African American cities, or the head of the FBI paranoid about Fred Hampton.

The deep state is meant to crush the individual. Within the context of the government, or someone that hides under the cover of the government.

What Trump’s party has done is scapegoat the State, as in the collective government it’s laws, it’s regulations and villified anyone opposed to him in any fashion as a Deep State actor.

As if these are performative actions, not backed by the rule of law, and a couple hundred years of procedure and precedence.

Ignorance of the law isn’t protection from the law, or so the saying goes. But Trump and Republicans don’t care.

Their ignorance allows them to believe in boogeymen.

“In other words, for the Trump administration and its supporters, the deep state is any part of the apparatus of government itself that doesn't do their absolute bidding.”

https://www.businessinsider.com/what-deep-state-is-and-why-trump-gets-it-wrong-2020-1

For a typical Trump supporter: Midwestern or Southern, poor, white, rural, and underemployed or underpaid… what’s the deep state doing to crush individuals?

How about preventing any restitutions for victims of Purdue Pharmaceutical or having them being absolutely dismantled over getting a massive chunk of the entire United States addicted to pain medication. 

A shady group of individuals planted in various seats of power or acting as a plant due to bribes has allowed little reaction or even blame and anger against Purdue. 

This is like the Crack Epidemic but far far worse.

Anyways, I hope that makes sense. Bottom line, it’s not boogeymen making it impossible for a wannabe dictator to nuke a hurricane….

2021-05-05 10:23:12,stocks,Someone gets it. Covid is the “scapegoat” but was not the primary or even secondary factor. It’s a long list of issues and covid is but 1 of them....when the dust settles and prices don’t revert what will be people’s excuse then?
2021-05-05 09:50:21,stocks,"Money printing was substantial - like 30%.  Can the economy eventually grow into it? Sure, but even assuming years of accelerated 4-5% GDP growth we're looking at 5 years to get there.

Is there some plan to soak that money back out of the economy? I haven't seen it. 

So why would you expect the effects to be short lived?"
2021-05-05 00:06:36,stocks,"All time highs were a small percentage above it.  If anything it was flat.  We are in a correction testing ATH sideways, another 10% drop and thats a crash"
2021-05-04 20:58:56,stocks,"I'm down about 15% from the time I bought on a mostly tech portfolio so it doesn't look like ATH at least from where I'm sitting. I felt like it's been a long and gradual correction taking place since Jan or Feb already and hoping for it to bounce back considering the avalanche of stellar outlooks. Or at least start going back up. Last few weeks we've been in the red, even on amazingly growing companies like AMD and Nvidia with some peaks here and there that went back down to below previous normal."
2021-05-05 11:10:05,stocks,Remindme! Three years
2021-05-04 21:44:07,stocks,">Computer

Don't let the hardware subs people see this, they will rip your head off. Computer parts prices have been way above their MSRP since before the pandemic even started, the pandemic only worsen the silicon shortage problems. The global chip shortage has gotten to the point where even automobile makers have to suspend production and shutter their factories because they aren't making anything. I don't know what rock you live under but you definitely do not trade tech stocks if you think computer prices are trending down. F took a free fall when they announced production suspension because of chip shortage caused by silicon shortage.

>Airplane

Still not enough people travelling so every flight is a net loss, the price don't matter.

>Music

Music streaming subscription prices are going up, video streaming services are too.

>Solar panels

Solar panels has been in ""new tech"" prices phase for decades. It's hard to come down when they keep R&Ding way better panels without lowering costs much, even though they always market it as ""hey look better panels with cheaper and more durable panels!"" but yeah what about the price cunt. It will get lower eventually but we have decades to go. Silicon shortage has also caused solar panel prices to trend back up as well."
2021-05-04 21:56:11,stocks,"Those aren't everyday items. You can do without buying most of those you listed.  But housing, good, everyday goods are going up in price.  Restaurant prices are kind of insane right now, if it isn't coming down people are going to eat out less.  Once they get the cabin fever thing out of the way and things get relatively back to normal.  Inflation has been pretty bad this year."
2021-05-05 09:47:38,stocks,Weakness in the housing market? What planet are you from..?
2021-05-04 20:12:23,stocks,"“Yes, good, let the transitory narratives flow through you.”

- Darth Powell"
2021-05-05 10:36:18,stocks,"Because, money isn't like a solution where adding more water dilutes the mix, it's all about the *flow* (velocity) *of money.* The flow effectively got shut off a year ago and is only now picking up in certain areas of the economy. It seems like housing is the place where money velocity is running the fastest which has spilled over into lumber. But again, it's a supply chain issue, should Weyerhaeuser and the like begin to produce more lumber, the price will drop whether the money supply changes or not.

The source of long-lived inflation will come from all of the unemployment benefits if they continue. I keep hearing how business can't pay laborers enough right now. If they raise wages and then raise prices, *that* will lead to the CPI inflation the Fed is looking for. The point is that a sector or two running hot is not the same as across the board inflation.

Lastly, for the American household with a job, student debt and a mortgage, is inflation really a bad thing?"
2021-05-04 21:04:24,stocks,"You bought in way too high while the market was going crazy in January/February. I would say begin to average down if you have high convictions about some of the hyper growth tech stocks. We are definitely not in a correction... for now, just more of a valuation reset."
2021-05-04 22:59:16,stocks,"Computer hardware is unimportant to software licenses cost which seem lower and more competition

Airplane tickets, Although some rebound of prices to normal there are still a ton of planes parked so this is more managing supply story,  imagine the price if all the planes flew next month.

I think subscription services on music or video games are deflationary as more people are saving cash and consuming more than the increase in nominal price,  generally these services have gone up over time and I'm not see a curve shifting.

Cellphones- Ton of super cheap secondary resale of the primary carriers in the USA, most folks can cut there bill in half if you do the legwork,  this is a different world than the post/pre market of the past.  Phones are also super cheap,  look at what 250 dollars pays you now compared to 5 years ago.

Solar, no idea, my rooflines don't face south and my state doesn't subsidize and we have an HOA every 12 feet."
2021-05-05 10:54:17,stocks,"The housing market was weak from 2010-2019 in terms of builds started, as the previous comment noted. The supply of raw material had adjusted to this, and supply dipped again in early 2020 with a reduction in demand and COVID closures.

The large uptick in demand first from remodelling and then from new build starting has led to the spike.

The housing market is rebounding, but the last decade was weak, historically."
2021-05-04 20:00:18,stocks,"Okay, I completely agree with your point about production being ramped down before the start of 2020, but COVID kicked what support was left out from under the market in early 2020. For instance, housing starts tanked in early 2020:

[https://www.forest2market.com/blog/lumber-market-2020-year-in-review-whats-next](https://www.forest2market.com/blog/lumber-market-2020-year-in-review-whats-next)

Production moved to accommodate that (and was also impacted by closures and transport issues). But as you noted the market bounced back more strongly than anticipated and then on top of that a whole pile of people stuck at home (ish) for 6 months thought ""y'know what, I need to remodel"". So supply dropped right before a large unexpected spike in demand.

This is playing out all over both the US and Europe. Trades are booming and building supplies are scarce. It's situational rather than structural but there is a supply/demand imbalance that will take a while to reach equilibrium - and longer because international shipping prices *also* spiked.

I think we're agreeing on what happened, but disagree as to whether the impact is structural or situational. Frankly I hope I'm right, or that I get a large pay raise soon!"
2021-05-04 22:11:08,stocks,It's not a story the Jedi would tell you!
2021-05-05 11:17:54,stocks,"Right so.. velocity collapsed last year, and they had to print a lot of money to keep supply x velocity about equal to the previous level..

Now velocity will bounce back to normal levels if not higher due to pent up demand. What's the plan to suck out the supply to counteract that?

Seems like it'll be 1.3x previous money supply X 1.1x previous velocity = ~ 1.4x previous price levels."
2021-05-04 22:53:14,stocks,"This is quickly getting into semantics though, there's is a very small and gray difference between ""reset"" and ""correction."""
2021-05-05 11:22:21,stocks,"Putting aside 2020, 2010 - 2019 Case Shiller went from 145 to 212.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CSUSHPINSA

Maybe that's not the pace of the ~2006 bubble or 2020, but I'd hardly call that weak. It's about 2-3x inflation during that time.

But yes, housing construction during that time was woefully inadequate."
2021-05-04 22:45:13,stocks,"thats because despite the pandemic, most people aren't actually broke or even struggling."
2021-05-05 12:48:25,stocks,"> But yes, housing construction during that time was woefully inadequate. 

I should have been clearer because I was using ""housing market"" but actually meaning ""Demand for construction materials for housing"" and they're not the same thing."
2021-05-05 00:00:00,stocks,"Sell ICLN and QCLN? Sell ICLN and QCLN?

I bought QCLN @79.22 and ICLN @29.60 and honestly, it’s just been months of headaches. The two just keep sinking and sinking and honestly, I’m thinking about taking a big loss and put it towards something that will make up for that loss. Personally, I don’t want to wait 2 years for it them both to reach the price i bought them for. Though if i do sell them, It’ll be at a 26% and 24% loss. So any thoughts?"
2021-05-04 23:22:10,stocks,"Ouch,  at this point I’d sell coved calls if you can."
2021-05-05 07:31:48,stocks,"Sold QCLN about a month ago. Holding ICLN, averaging down. It's annoying but not worth selling for such a big loss when fundamentally it should do well next few years... we'll see."
2021-05-05 02:23:34,stocks,"Totes this. Plus it’s so close to a bottom, you might as well stick around for a bit and see how things shake out.

EDIT: I don’t hold QCLN but follow it and I think that may have more room to drop so if I were to pick one of these to sell off, it would probably be QCLN. ICLN’s a nice tight balance of companies across wind, solar and hydrogen. QCLN is a bigger collection of companies some of which are stinkers imo. Either way I would wait to do anything until volatility calms a bit. You may get a bounce in the next few days."
2021-05-05 07:09:38,stocks,Why does inflation affect particularly these companies badly? Don't stocks go up because people are afraid to hold cash?
2021-05-05 11:34:14,stocks,"Yes, this is ""technically"" correct, but is still a pretty misleading way of thinking about things for (at least) three reasons:

1. It implies to an extent that if a stock you're in goes down a certain amount, then it will take twice as much time/effort for it to go back up, but this is definitely not true generally speaking. Keeping all other factors constant, a stock goes up or down all the same. 

2. If you have a steady source of money to put into the market, buying when things are low will serve to strongly increase your gains if things rebound.

3. It's pretty meaningless to think of things in terms of the percent it will take one to profit, because that doesn't reflect anything about how price movement works."

2021-05-05 02:47:34,stocks,"I know, it’s probably not worth it to keep it for x amount of years to break even. I just don’t want to sell at a $100 loss"
2021-05-05 07:33:37,stocks,"Oh boi. A lot of the companies in ICLN And QCLN are start ups with high debt ratios. They have to service that debt. So if rates go up a little bit, that makes their lives harder."
2021-05-05 09:15:42,stocks,"it sounds like OP is reluctant to sell, they just want a solution. best solution is to lower cost basis, sell for whatever premium you can get to recover losses and wait"

2021-05-05 09:18:38,stocks,"Because Michael Burry and Warren Buffett were right.

The same exact crap that caused the 2008 Housing Market Crash is happening now, but this time also with Treasury Bonds (I.e. the value of the entire US Economy).

What happened, in short, was that banks would keep lending out bonds to each other in a circular fashion as collateral for instant cash-on-hand which they would then use to make huge plays. With this they would also use the fractional reserve system to essentially create synthetic bonds out of thin air and use them as collateral even though they were not real.

Some even conspired to use this instant money to tank other companies by shorting them, and then buy back the treasury bonds later after they became cheaper by shorting the economy they were tied to.

But now as other investments are failing miserably (Archegos blowing up, GME rocketing despite ridiculous short interest, etc.), suddenly all the big guys need money to pay off their positions...

But the collateral they gave out was actually worthless.

Now under the new SEC head, Gary Bensler, they’re now enforcing new rules with the DTCC like there’s no tomorrow to not only stop synthetic shares/bonds, but also force everyone to cough up their synthetic shares/bonds and replace them with legitimate collateral instead.

And now, huge banks and financial players are being forced to liquidate their assets to get the necessary liquidity they need to cover their asses.

Why else would banks and hedge funds report record profits then hand out billions worth of BBB bonds?

Why are all bank CEOs being called to testify this month to Congress for “unspecified reasons”?

Why would the MSM lie last Wednesday that the DOW JONES tanked because of Biden’s tax plans when the Biden Administration actually has said nothing about the tax plans since 2019?

Sometimes the market is up on bad news, while other times its down on bad news.

2021-05-04 21:34:00,stocks,Crsr and peri killed it for earnings and both dropped.  Janet yellen blabbered something about raising interest rates and made it seem like it's going to happen a whole lot sooner than people were thinking. Got it in people's head that this year end of this year was a possibility. A lot of people are banking on going through even 2022 with no rate hikes. But throw an interest rate hike on at the end of this year with possible capital gains tax hike. In a frothy tippy top market that's just looking for excuses to sell off...

Yep.  Technically it was brokerage software at the time.  It was the first time brokers started offering a stop loss option to people.  It became the big thing at the time.  This lead to a lot of people's accounts auto selling, not even realizing their account was dumping.  Since then people realized if you're an investor buy and hold is better than using a stop loss.  Those people who got stopped out lost more than the people who held through it all."

2021-05-05 07:24:18,stocks,"Yeah I wanna add to this. I’ve been hedging against tech with a big play on PAVE which is an infrastructure ETF with a bunch of no nonsense companies that make money, stand to benefit from the Biden administration, and have P/E’s that are at or below the average rate. 

My PAVE call did very well yesterday and actually left me in the green on the reddest day I think we’ve seen in a month or two at least. 

Why did I do this? Well I looked at QQQ and it is up 2% in 3 months against SPY which is up 10% in that time. I attribute most of QQQ’s gain last quarter to an aggressive “March madness” ad campaign (you can see the growth from it there in late March). When that happened I felt that tech must be overextended, the ad was literally aired hundreds of times to the point it felt like begging. Then last week my right wing cousin messaged me FREAKING OUT about biden and concerns about his agenda sparking runaway inflation. My cousin is extremely overweight in tech, has an excessive risk tolerance, and described this as “a trash, pump and dumpy” market. I made 10% last quarter being light in tech, so I knew there was something going on there between all the data and experiences I was seeing. I knew there was anxiety in the market from conservatives and that a correction was basically inevitable. I looked at my own portfolio on Monday afternoon and sold off underperformers, it was all tech and Reddit populist stock.

I think tech will underperform all year and therefore will always be the target of sell offs due to “high risk low return” in 2021. It will be a feedback loop that drags down the entire SPY index from an otherwise solid year in non tech sectors. People who got in last year are just gonna keep pulling their money out as they made a huge profit, are not seeing any more upside over a prolonged period of time, and want to spend their earnings enjoying reopening or investing in something else with more reasonable value."

you should see regression to that price over time. STDEV(E) would mean standard deviation of earnings (for a reasonable length of time) and MEAN(E) is average earnings over that same time period.

Like, look at 2010 to 2013 market was flat. So no growth. But then you have growth periods like now, and when you average those two, you get to the long run average.

So 24 months it took of paying myself consistently (very hard to do in an inconsistent business) and took me a few years to learn that. Id love to have found your firm, bc thats jjst so unhesrd of from what MULTIPLE brokers, banks, soooo many ppl told us. We couldn't get shit ANYWHERE.

And nope have a cpa, I don't do ANY of my own tax stuff, too risky. And she was high 5s so her credit was bad. Granted she was still only 24 when we first started looking so had all her student debt but mainly ccs and stuff when she was in school to get bye..all that stays for years. Her credit was poor.

2021-05-05 10:02:23,stocks,"I like the attitude but I don't think it's realistic. And I know there's other options... Trades, tech, healthcare, financial / business services and others. Even if you fucked up early in life. Apparently what defines success is how fast you get up not avoiding mistakes. So ""mistakes"" early on is fine.

You're in a very small group of people who can ""open their own business"" or who gambled and won. I don't think the ROI is worth it not just because there's other ways but because there's low risk high potential stocks (if you want to do stocks) like Microsoft, Amazon and so on. TSLA was weeks away from running out of cash. Now compare the risk of TSLA with Microsoft and how much you would make going ""all in"" Microsoft. Quite a lot in the past two or three years. You would have made more with TSLA but is the additional risk worth what you would have made? Probably not. That's how to think of it.

So no, high stakes gambling is still not worth it. Not all gambles are the same not all risk is the same if it's an extra $1 dollar and you risk losing it all maybe it's not worth it. Maybe it's not worth it if you risk losing it all and you get 10x or 100x or even 5x when 2x has 0 risk. Now for someone who can afford to lose it all and make it all back maybe TSLA  is fine but for someone who can't afford to lose anything you don't gamble like that."

That makes a lot more sense now though. They give seasonal workers a LOT harder of a time than anyone else. Combine seasonal worker with no cpa to write a letter/verify your taxes and you have a big uphill battle.

AMZN is still growing every year by double digits.  They dominate the online retail space and yet only 15% or so of retail shopping is done online so there is even more room to grow in this space.  Cloud computing is estimated to have more than double growth in the next 10 years and Amazon is the leader in this space as well, along with increasing their margins every quarter on their cloud service.  They are also heavily expanding their ad revenue stream which saw a 77% increase during the last quarter. 

Add all this in with the fact that they are heavily expanding internationally as well, making big pushes in India and the Middle East.

And if you are a numbers guy, look at their past 4 quarters.  Absolute blowouts, beating expectations in every single metric yet the stock has barely budged over the past 10 months.

It's old-fashioned.  It involves Wall Street, and f*** Wall Street, right?  Nobody really understands it.  It's just the place where boomers and Wall Street go to get rich.  

But crypto?  Nobody really understands it, either. But it's new.  It's flashy.  It's modern.  It's ""the future"".  You don't really need to understand it because A. the case for it being the future is appealing in its own right (even though it's not true), and B. the returns speak for themselves.  Why would amateurs get into stocks, then?  Crypto is the place to be.

Obviously a very, very dangerous situation going on here.  Stocks are tethered to fundamentals, crypto is not.  Even if one coin like Bitcoin or Ethereum is here to stay (I have my doubts), Doge is absolutely pointless and a casino and/or ponzi scheme.  The whole thing might be a casino and/or ponzi scheme. 

I truly don't see this ending well.  Stocks will have bad days like yesterday, and we will most certainly have crashes that could go down 30% or even lower.  But at least stocks are tied to fundamentals.  At least the stock exchanges have circuit breakers.  On the worst day there is still always the silver lining that, yes, good companies are going to remain profitable and growing. 

But the day crypto tanks?  That is going to be a bloodbath.  An absolute bloodbath.  I ain't touching it with a 10 foot pole.

I understand there's money to be made there: there certainly is.  But it's a gamble. People are gambling on it.  I also understand that I can take this position because, financially, though I am not rich I am quite well off.  I don't need to get rich with investing.  I can just put it in index funds and enjoy the slow gains.  But a lot of people are fed up with being down and out, and they see crypto as a way out.  The same with GME and all the other meme stocks.

What's really unfortunate is that, when the music does stop, these are the people who can least afford to lose what they're putting in. 

I don't know if crypto will have a true future, maybe it will, I hope I get proven wrong.  But the way it's going right now is quite concerning, and even if things work out in the end, it's going to be a bumpy and unfortunate ride for a lot of people.  And that's best case scenario."

2021-05-05 06:03:26,stocks,Because it moved up 75% last year.  After giant runs like that you usually have a consolidation period before the next massive runup.  The billion dollar question is when will the next huge runup occur.

2021-05-05 06:48:00,stocks,"If you ignore everything that I said in my original response, then sure.

The fact of the matter is that AMZN averages around 30% returns a year and double digit growth and considering they are still achieving as well as projecting double digit growth, theres nothing to indicate they wont have another amazing year.

But if you happen to think that this year will be the year that breaks the past 10 years of stock returns then theres nothing I can say to convince you otherwise"
2021-05-05 07:23:25,stocks,"I’m not trying to be argumentative! I just am truly trying to understand the relationship between  the outstanding company performance that we all know about and you outlined above, and the movement of the actual stock. The stock has been flat for over a year. I understand everything you said about the run up during Covid. And so my thought is that it is overvalued. But I honestly don’t know. I agree with you that it is a world-class company and I hold shares in Amazon."
2021-05-05 07:35:40,stocks,"The current flatness of the stock is simply a biproduct of having an earlier large run.  Thats just how stocks tend to act after big moves.

You can see the same type of movement in Apple. Had a big run last year, been flat for 9 months.  Same thing with AMD.  Same thing with Microsoft.  Same thing with Netflix.  Same with Facebook.

Most of the companies that had huge increases in stock price last year have traded mostly flat for 7-10 months because they need a recovery period afterwards.  Doesnt mean they are overvalued, just means they are consolidating.

Now when do they stop this extended period of flatness?  I have no idea.  It could be in a month, it could be in another year.  You will find multiple opinions on the subject"
2021-05-05 07:44:20,stocks,"First, it's not true that the stock is flat for over a year. It had a great run until around July.

I think what's happening is that investors were worried the earnings boost Amazon had due to covid would fade away once things open up. See for example the reaction to ebay's earnings and guidance. SHOP is very similar to Amazon, the stock is going sideways for a long time, even though it also had fantastic earnings. I think now that investors realize that the covid boost is not temporary, both AMZN and SHOP will go to the next level, assuming the market is not going towards a major correction this year. For Amazon that would be breaking $3500. For SHOP $1400.

For me the most bullish signal is Amazon's Q2 guidance of around 30% increase in sales yoy. Q2 last year was insane, everything was sold out, they couldn't even keep up with shipping."
2021-05-04 22:49:04,stocks,ARCB is also another good one. They blew out their earnings.

2021-05-05 06:14:27,stocks,"Yes but the thing is, no one should have the power to dump shares they do not own, in the market and dropping the price, therefore, manipulating the price as you want. If you think a company will fail, you can short it, but the price would stay invariable, and fail on its own, IF it's actually doomed to fail. The way they do it is actually pushing the company to bankruptcy earlier that it's supposed to. In our actual case, they bankrupt a company just because they don't like it, which is not fair. No one should have that kind of power"
2021-05-04 20:50:20,stocks,"Sorry but it's never ""evident the market will crash"", this is at best recency bias and honestly pure luck. If not you'd beat all investors in the world by being able to time the market better then Wallstreets best managers...



Selling also creates a taxable event which most hope to avoid, and stop losses might trigger by slight corrections rather then crashes. Timing the market is a fools errand, diversifying is an investors best friend. Buy assets that inverse the market and see your money double, or quadruple, when the market crashes and buy in at a real discount with more money then you dreamed of. But that might be overkill for most..."

2021-05-05 05:35:48,stocks,"Evident may be the wrong word, but in a situation like last February I think it was pretty clear that we were in for a massive correction. More often than not, it is not so clear as it was then. From personal experience, I remember quite well what the implications of the previous Coronavirus pandemic, then known as SARS, were in Asia in the early 2000s. Unlike back then, by February 2020, it was clear that we had failed to contain it.

As for taxable events, I live in a country where this does not apply because we don't have capital gains tax, so I didn't have to worry about that.

But yeah, timing the market is generally a terrible idea."

2021-05-05 12:26:23,stocks,"Singapore is too small of a market for a serious international play, so it would be worth the effort only to establish a foothold in SE Asia. I just don't see Korean companies being very successful in SE Asia in general due to cultural reasons. That is particularly relevant for e-commerce when you have to compete with the likes of SEA (which already managed to beat giants like Alibaba there, despite the presence of a large population of overseas Chinese).

In general SK companies tend to have difficulty abroad for that reason (with notable exceptions such as Samsung). SE Asia has a very different culture from SK, so it requires the sort of flexibility that's rare in SK companies. Asia is full of cultural and perception traps due to complex ethnic, religious and historical factors and due to economic nationalism and SK often fares badly in that kind of perception game, for example in Indonesia and Indo-China (part of it is due to mutual prejudice and another is due the attitude of the SK government for example toward places such as Thailand and Vietnam). They have a better perception in Central Asia and in the West (and a pretty bad perception in the ME, Africa and Central/South America). They also have a pretty bad perception in China (which of course is mutual).

That doesn't mean that Coupang couldn't overcome all this. It simply means that they face more difficulties than meet the eye and which they may not be prepared for or even expect -- because cultural awareness isn't generally part of the thinking of SK companies (again with exceptions such as Samsung and a few others).

However I do think that Coupang is a well run company, so their continued success in SK is virtually guranteed."
2021-05-05 12:48:16,stocks,"I hear what you are saying, but at the end of it all isn't Singapore better then? There are very diverse cohorts there. There are 5 million people there and you can walk across the entire country in a day. I understand you though. It is just like saying Facebook will be hurt by Apple and by less ads. It just won't matter. Again I think you could be right with Japan. They are very exclusive and like their stuff and the other things you mentioned, but eh."
2021-05-05 12:51:44,stocks,"Indeed Singapore is a test ground for all of SE Asia. If they can beat SEA there then they are set, but this would be quite a feat.

There is a reason why Singapore is such an excellent place to call home for companies that want to expand in SE Asia. It has everything you need to succeed.

Japan is notorious for being pretty much a closed market, but if anyone can understand it then it is South Koreans. There the problems are more of politics (the use of historical issues by certain SK politicians for internal political gain in SK), but unfortunately all SK companies have to suffer the impact of that when dealing with the Japanese market. Then you also have Japanese nationalists on the other side of the coin.

All of Asia is pretty much a minefield of perceptions like that, so it is nothing like North America or Europe (where such considerations are marginal) in that regard.

Look at perceptions in Indochina if you want to get an image of just how complicated Asia can be.

In general SK companies have been learning fast, but imo they still have some way to go before learning how to negotiate such minefields successfully."

Gamestop has indicated a commitment to growth that I haven't seen from a company, maybe ever. Strategic move after move has positioned the company for agility, with no debt or onerous restrictions, they can pivot on a dime.

It's also quite arguable that without expansionary monetary policy, the problem wouldn't be steady (and low) inflation, it'd be massive unemployment (ie: Great Depression, and 2008 had it been let alone).
