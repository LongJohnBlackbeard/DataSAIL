04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just like the stocks.

Real shit though this is how I would *like* to trade, and need to shake my bad habits. I am *not* an options trader, I've made like 400 bucks off of a XOM call and was satisfied like it was my first bump of coke- I tried it, it was okay, back to meat and potatoes. 

Solid plan. If the economy tanks to fuck I think you're going to make a killing from the floor."

Is it possible to do that from Germany?"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,So are you just doing options or buying shares and holding?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,No stop-losses. Most of these ETFs are in the LULD protection of the exchanges so a true flash crash isn't a problem.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"With margin, if I am under-leveraged. I don't have money outside of this to add except maybe paychecks over time."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,The theory and practice is all explained in my previous posts.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,50 aso posts a day. Their insiders just got past lockup. They can sell their shares as soon as it hits their price target. This is a high risk-reward play is highly dependent on knowing when the insiders are going to sell.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Its up $5 in 2 days. Getting in now is just chasing.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"He means it would take them 9 days to cover based on available float + avg volume, they don‚Äôt have to cover."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,That is based on average daily volume (I think). So based on current short interest and avg volume it would take 9 days worth of buying to cover the short
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I still believe the stock is well under its fair value and with the possibility of a squeeze their is just too much upside for me
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,omg 5$

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Only goes to further my point that the two halves of US just don‚Äôt understand what the other half is like. This goes for gun control and laws.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs lots of attention already and already lots of volume on those calls this week will be crazy üí∞gonna go all out on 4/16 calls tomorrow
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Understood. Just wanted to double check my math
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah ok I see it a little lower than that but close enough.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,#$5 footlong
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Five. Dollar.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats 33% dummy
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah, I'm only 33. Chasing at a 30%+ gain after earnings on a brick and mortar store, regardless of the short interest, seems like a losing play short term.

Now, this stock has shown steady growth and it's going to retrace a bit before continuing up. Mid-long this doesn't look bad, but buying on that earnings spike is a chase."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm a ü•∑
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I snagged my calls at .316 the next morning after the sell off. I was stoked asf lol
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"nice! I was adding shares a bunch when it was under 23, but really wish I had scooped some options then too."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,To Jupiter brother üöÄüöÄ
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,i think that means its gonna go up another...12 inches at least
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,25/5 does not equal 33%. Loooooool
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,fuck dude thanks for doing the difficult math for me. i am out
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôll be back here in a few days when the price skyrockets.

Short squeezes don‚Äôt care about anything except forced covering of short positions. It doesn‚Äôt matter what the fundamentals are, the price literally is forced to move up no matter what. Large institutions buying back at the peak will just cause a chain reaction to force other institutions to buy back as well. It‚Äôs called a Margin Call."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok bud
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Not every stock is a short squeeze.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I sell cars. It‚Äôs literally downtime all day until someone comes into the lot lol. Makes trading a lot easier.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,OP said it went up $5 in 2 days. It was at 25 2 days ago and now it‚Äôs 30. Where the fuck you seeing it trade at 15 2 days ago?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Except this person isn‚Äôt just reeeeing GME cultist sentiment that any short interest = short squeeze. There is some real potential for a short squeeze here, and the value play is there regardless of the squeeze"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but to your point, it‚Äôs had 30% upward movement and is at ATH, it has higher short interest so if it is going to squeeze it will be on this pressure. I agree not everything is a short squeeze, but this is literally a short squeeze"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I think we‚Äôll see asset price inflation since major currencies like eur and usd are both weakening - before we see the real effects of inflation. They‚Äôll underreport it and house prices will go up 15%-20% next year.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,The main reason inflation is being down played is interest rates need to stay low or the Government will have higher interest payments. If hyperinflation is looming rest assured the FED would rather save the Government than us.

The CPI is fine though.¬†"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah CPI is a quite controversial metric. I‚Äôd be careful imputing intentionality here but yeah, absolutely it doesn‚Äôt capture the whole picture and is often a lagging indicator. I think the real mistake here is relying too much on this metric as opposed to assessing many data points."

If you get in to all this you would think that the US government is actively trying to destroy society. You'd be right. The only question, are they just so stupid, insane, or delusional that they think they are actually helping or is it completely intentional?"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Interesting thing to think about. Good write up for a chimpanzee

Food, basic supplies, maintenance expense, total healthcare expense, every major household expense just keeps rising very briskly.

Yes, technology and gadgets have gone way up in quality and down in cost.  However, just about everything else is getting crappier, less durable, or shrinking in size so you get less for the same money."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why wouldn't it be intentional? 

The whole idea of inflation is intentional so that people are incentivized to invest and not hoard cash."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd imagine it actually had a bigger effect on the Medicare fund than the SS fund.  An absolutely massive portion of all Medicare spending is spent on the last year or so of people's lives.  So an illness that quickly cuts off the last year or five of someone's life is actually a huge money saver.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Considering 420,000 were about to die anyway or died of something else while having COVID, it probably will be negligible."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorta yes and no.  A lot of people are too stupid or too busy to notice that inflation is fucking them over hard.  It's a lot more silent and insidious killer of wealth than many other sources.

As I stated in another [comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mk5h3m/the_us_govt_has_a_huge_incentive_to_massively/gteb35e/) though, anyone that's keeping careful track will tell you CPI is shit."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I think that it does matter because the market reacts based on inflation fears. Don‚Äôt you remember when the markets were dropping because of inflation feas?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Could be said about the price of anything going up. By that logic, any inflation would be self-defeating. But we know that historically, inflation is actually self-perpetuating and tends to spiral out of control"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"So tired of this nonsense. Constantly gets posted and shows the poster clearly has no idea what they are talking about.


The fed represents their members, federally chartered banks. They give the president a short list from their membership presidents to choose from, that's about as much as the federal government has to do with the fed. 


The government would love inflation. Inflation doesn't determine debt payments, interest rates do. 


If there was 4% inflation for 7 years (or 7% inflation for 3 or 4 years) the real US debt would be cut by 50% and would be quite easy to pay off. The government would love that and they have no incentive to rig the CPI at 1% and service debt at 1.7%."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, the 'unemployment rate' has been weaponized for awhile. In addition to the phantom citizens who drop off once they are no longer seeking a job, the unemployment rate doesn't speak to what *kind* of jobs the citizenry holds. Huge economic difference between a workforce that has a healthy class balance and one in which 90% of the people are beet harvesters or latte-foamers"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right, on the 3T relief Bill (treasury purchases only estimated at 3T.) Add another relief Bill/continued treas bill purchases then 2T for infrastructure.. boom another 15%"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,It's not because more people are moving out of the cities? Or is it a Demascare thing?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,If you're making anything less 10% returns you're likely losing money overall - to inflation.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct. Thiel made the same argument. The $100,000 medical equipment is offset by the $1000 iPhone. Tech has suppressed inflation in an outsized way vs the rest of goods. Glad more people are talking about this."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because that assumes hundreds of thousands of people are working together in government working together in a clandestine way in order to fudge a number already opaque and misunderstood, only to adjust it by.. 100 basis points? How would someone even lead such an effort? Who decides the final number?

I assume more incompetence than malice."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"But do the math, even if we say each person had on average 2, or even 3 more years left on this planet (without covid), that's 450000 * 3, or 1.3 million years worth of SS that didn't have to be paid out"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you believe that to be the total number of deaths in 2020 for that age group?

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,1 in 5 homes purchased in major markets are by investment firms and no one moves in.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ahh I think it's just the people on top that slowly ""adjust"" the numbers. Every metric we rely on is fudged. Look at the recent changes to M1 and M2. The bond purchases shifting the yield curve. No metric can be relied on anymore.

I am Def biased so take what I say with a bit of salt. My only point is it probably takes a handful of people to disseminate the orders/instructions down the chain."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love how naive people are to think when someone fudges a number or turns a blind eye to financial corruption in the billions of dollars, that its ""incompetence"" rather than malice.

When the accounting department at work screws up the books and manages to keep the company from paying a million bucks in taxes one year, that's incompetence. But when the accounting department has been ""screwing up"" the books for 20 years, negating 20 million in taxes..."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,drop in the bucket.  the entire system is so bankrupt that a crisis cannot be averted.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I was thinking about this statistic early on from covid. I figured the govt gave zero fucks about casualties due to this factor alone. Not to mention collecting the Fucking estate tax from every corpse.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"We won't know until we see the death numbers for 2021 and beyond, how much death was pulled forward."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't see how this refutes his statement. The vast majority of deaths were from people who were statistically going to die within 5 years anyway. Yes, we had excess deaths this year and in  the next 5 years we'll have that many fewer deaths, give or take. Statistically, COVID essentially didn't exist for people under 70 when compared to other daily risks we seem to be fine with."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly. Moderate and predictable inflation is a normal part of a healthy and growing economy.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, so not independent of the gov't"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,">the President just gets the first choice at passing a candidate

wtf is with this semantics bs, that is being chosen by the president, since when were any appointees ever get confirmed without the senate?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you feel about crack homes?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,totally!! in a few months actually! 1 GME share and theres ur house!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,San Antonio Texas is the trick
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tx, fl"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely - it just may not be in the exact location you envision.

* Marin County, CA?  Probably not.
* Atherton, Palo Alto?  Probably not.
* Chicago, IL?  Sure
* Detroit, MI?  Sure
* Cabo San Lucas (between SJD and the Marina)?  Sure.

Economic mobility is the greatest strength that YOU as a consumer has.  It may not be a beach town such as Santa Cruz CA, but it's the same Pacific ocean that stretches to Cabo San Lucas.  Or if you're an east coast person, it's the same water in Tampa as further up the coast to Alabama and then to Texas.

Understand what you want, and why.  Then you can gauge accordingly."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Move to the midwest ASAP before climate change seriously drives migration hard
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,And every single person down the chain is a risk to expose the scheme. Conspiracies on that scale DO NOT WORK.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Almost no one pays the estate tax
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Mostly because there was/is a massive effort to combat it. We‚Äôre talking a level of mobilization that hasn‚Äôt really been seen in the world before. People talking about statistics and throwing around tiny percentage numbers always seem to forget that they still represent the deaths of millions of Americans in a worst case scenario.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"They are $300k in Columbus. Look at the crime map and the housing prices, it's insane"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,True.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,?? Am from San Antonio. Housing pricing and availability is ridiculous right now from all the people moving here..

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Santa Cruz in the house what what! I‚Äôll need GME to get to 25k to buy a piece of shit house here
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, all it would take is a reporting definition tweak, or define inflation a certain way. You don't have to be as hamfisted as saying ""We measured X, but please change it to Y, k thx"". Just find a way to frame the definition and process to get the numbe/narrative you want organically. Then all the checking and rechecking wouldn't matter, because it \*is\* calculating right.  


Shaping the narrative is half the battle, and the deepest lies are hidden by truth."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Indeed. I am not saying it is a conspiracy. I am just saying it is business as usual. Like no one would disagree that inflation only measures certain things. Plenty that even design CPI would agree it's not the best metric but it's just what they use. 

With respect to agenda that is all speculation and would conspiracy talk. Like if I were to say it is done because ... then I would just be guessing. I guess me saying it is ""intentional"" is ambiguous. I only meant to imply that inflation is intentional and that the CPI measuring what it does is intentional."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Awkward
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just moved away from Austin - y‚Äôall are NOWHERE as bad. Not saying it‚Äôs bad. But I‚Äôve seen dozens of large 3bed homes for $250,000 and under. That means there are even more great options for like $200,000"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea I get what you're saying.  It's not a conspiracy but it isn't ""unintentional"" either.  More like a lot of people covering their own asses knowingly contribute a small part to the problem of fudging it."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Got it. That makes sense. Yeah it‚Äôs funny when people quote FRED data to point to economic collapse. Like good sir you know who‚Äôs posting that right.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh no doubt Austin is worse. But I bought my house Aug 2019 for $215k. It‚Äôs a pretty cookie cutter 3bdrm 2500sqft house. In the last couple months identical houses in my neighborhood have been selling 275-300k. And we‚Äôve been looking at properties to potentially build on in a couple years and they are all crazy priced and stuff is only on the market for days before it‚Äôs gone.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,The ETF definitely helps mitigate risk. I‚Äôve been in since Jan. and this has been my steadiest investment. Nowhere near the dramatic drops some of the other sectors and individual stocks have experienced. Just a steady climb up that will likely continue with the infrastructure focus.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Certainly a risk. But the poor infrastructure in this country is finally starting to get national attention (Texas grid issues, Water contamination, failing physical infrastructure) I have no doubt that the final bill will look different than where it is now and it will certainly be spent differently to some degree. But there is a need to fix these issues and companies will capitalize off it. The Infrastructure bill may just be the spark."

Also SPACs are doing poorly for good reason too. There is much less scrutiny - recent catastrophes like NKLA, RIDE, GOEV, RMO, CLOV, etc attest to this."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm confident we will get $40 by the end of this year. It just needs to get that SPAC stench off of it and get the analyst price targets and earnings out there
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Long with a handful of BFT/PSFE 7/16 20c
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"same here, i‚Äôll probably load up tmrw"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,When does the lockup period expire?  Some SPACs can be 6 months to 1 year
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Warrants ‚ú®üëä
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"They said they are projecting 11% growth based on the entire fintech market at large.  They said they are doing this to be conservative, excluding M&A plans and iGaming growth potential in the US.  Also, other fintechs that have much higher multiples, have slower or similar growth.  For example, Shift4 reported only 4% y-o-y grwoth, Fiserv projects only 5% CAGR going forward while GPN's growth projection is on par with  Paysafe's. Meanwhle Paysafe's margins are growth faster than competitors like PayPal."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agree that most spacs are trash right now. However, This is starting to get the SPAC smell off of it after merger. Also, this ain‚Äôt no speculative pre-revenue EV company or fairytale space taxi company, this is a legit $1.5 billion per year giant here. Was insane this got lumped in with the macro SPAC sell off. This could have easily gone IPO and opened at $50, but they wanted Foley on board and chose his SPAC route. I think it‚Äôs gonna do very well going forward. Best SPAC play I have seen in the market since DKNG last year."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I made a ton of money of VLDR when the Apple rumor came out. Sold my complete position there

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Also would like to know this
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"One of the issues with SPACs is that projections are not scrutinized in the same way as public companies or IPOs. Again RMO was a good recent example of this. 

Not saying this is going to be the case with PSFE, but for sure I think it adds an element of risk and why investors have been wary of these companies of late."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, I‚Äôm not saying most SPACs aren‚Äôt trash but there are some winners in there and Paysafe looks like one of those winners. Not pre revenue, not speculative and in a growing market"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah Ideally my plan is to sell a good chunk at $40 and then ride the rest for the long haul
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,80 days from the day the ticker changes I believe. So a little less than 3 months
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Then wait till earnings to enter, if it isnt too late by then. The problem is that those that you listed are speculative startups. I would argue PSFE is large enough to warrant trusting in their growth projections. 

Also a lot of SPACs are scrutinized for their use of projections, but PSFE is not one of them. There are many tickers I can list in the SPAC market that most people recognize as unworthy of investing in, whether their CEO/team is strong or not because of the thrown out future growth projections which dont have much solid ground.

Money will begin to flow back into strong SPACs in the market with revenue come monday. I dont think people find Etoro, SoFi, Butterfly, or AvePoint as speculative companies."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because everyone knows if you inverse your actual plays you make money. 

But furthermore mvis has dropped the balls before so they may have best in class and cheapest lidar they have little recognition little connection to vehicles manufacturers. Further it is a long way off before they are in the works simply looking at technicals it would suggest volume is down and they are currently over priced."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Personally I‚Äôm ambivalent on MVIS right now, but right now there are three big reasons I see to be bearish:

-they‚Äôre overbought on the IVAS news. By their own admission, the royalties they receive from Microsoft for hololens/IVAS are not ‚Äúsignificant sources of revenue‚Äù. This company will go bankrupt unless they become profitable with LIDAR

-Their Lidar is unproven so far. It may not live up to expectations, over the last 25 years this company‚Äôs management has a history of failing to deliver.

-they are trading at a very high valuation relative to their earnings. This was a penny stock not very long ago, and they have not had a net profitable quarter since 1996. By their own admission, they ‚Äúexpect to incur significant losses in the 2021 fiscal year‚Äù. They had to take a PPP loan to avoid firing a bunch of people not long ago. Even with a bright future (which still isn‚Äôt guaranteed) they might fall before rising again.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Q1 is typically half the deliveries of the next Q4 or less. Model S and X lines were shut down. I think its possible we see a 400k+ Q4 this year. 80% of the entire 2020 production.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,And no S/X!!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Completely forgot about that phase. In my mind, AMD was before MU but maybe not?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Last split was around $2,500."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"And February only had 28 days, gigs press fire, and chip shortage (although not sure how much that impacted them). 

Lots of things working against Tesla this quarter and they still beat Q4 numbers. The momentum behind them right now is massive and we are approaching the last opportunity to get in at these prices. 

Two new factories opening this year and lots of potential for FSD happening this year."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,We had MU back in 2016 but maybe AMD was around the same time too? A little after I think.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,How are the two activities related in any way?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds good to me
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Fubo is positioned well for this
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Pointing out that lobby bucks can get anything done.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,They're not. At all. Except maybe for the fucked up way they handled the wuhan flu thing and lost massive amounts of tax revenue now has them scrambling for every idea possible to pull more taxes from everyone- without actually telling the burger flippers that they are the only ones left there to tax.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,How does Credit Susisse have money
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like good news, so stock down Monday cuz why not"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Extremely undervalued. No question about it. Let‚Äôs fucking go Palantards
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,PLTR is a no brainer. They invented a market and have a giant moat.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"PLTR IS VERY VERY UNDERVALUED 

ARK DID NOT BUY UP ALMOST 110 million worth usd for nothing."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Glad I have some
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"> when it start[s] moving, it moves fast and big.

just like my wife's bf"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wall street doesn't understand what they do, thinking it's another splunk. They also hate that they did a DPO.

It will be a good stock someday. Hopefully I can keep selling calls and buying shares before then."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I believe in Palantir as a company. I believe it will continue to grow for the next few years every year.. after year.. after year. $25, $30, $35.... i don't give a shit. I care about Palantir stock price in 2029 so i can retire. I will buy every month, every dip for the next 2 year. 

In my humble opinion it's al very simple.. Still at the beginning. In a few years people ""buy the dip"" at low in the $200's..."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Demo on Wednesday as well for click
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"So going side way for another week, ehh?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe I missed it... what does PLTR have to do with Facebook?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,So are my calls gonna print or no?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This is great news can‚Äôt wait until Monday -5% guaranteed.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,All this good news will be great in turning our -4% day into a -3% day!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hard to get excited over a deal worth $7m and a potential $89m, when the stock already has a market cap of $42b"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,So what you‚Äôre saying is calls on PLTR?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"QUICK!  
IM RETARDED.  
GIVE ME A TLDR  


MAKE SURE TO ADD ROCKET EMOJIS!"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,ok this confirms my bias for me and my 20K shares.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Those banks did also trust Archegos...
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,No one cares about Palantir until GME is over. You can either emotionally disagree with me or accept the fact that the market as a whole and meme stocks in general will be shit on until the GME situation gets resolved.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude I have $16 May calls. Didn't sell at 40 because I thought it would go to 50 after lock up period.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This really isn‚Äôt a big deal for equity holders.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Motley Fool was suggesting yesterday it alongside MA and JNJ.

Suggesting it is a good stock for very long holds (2027)"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You do realize deals like this are assumed in their high valuation.  That's why they don't really move when announced.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Cathie Woods is propping up this Stock
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Let‚Äôs get it.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, a contract worth 0.2% of their market cap and a credit increase after their share price more than doubled since IPO? This seems like very little news."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôd love to buy in and it‚Äôs on my target list.  But who has the money now?  Mine‚Äôs all tied up in AMC and until the MOASS happens, all my funds are accounted for ü§ë"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,The next PLTR rally is going to be insane! PALANQUEERS LESSSGGOOOOO üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,*funds
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Stock down 20% tomorrow then?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Tldr
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think there is HF vendetta against PLTR because they did not IPO, Karp does not like Wall Street, and this meme stock is one of wsb favourites. Also institutionals are loading so I would expect the price to continue being supressed for the coming months. Also, fundamentally the price is a bit high, they have to consistently grow at 40-50% to justify this market cap (which I think they will)."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Priced in.

Also, pleas fly again"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Huge increase before last demo day with another coming up I like the stock.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I just want to see like maybe 25 a share again.   25 would be so sick.   üßê
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice I need to hit up my options for them within the next two weeks so I can put all of my games into AMC!!

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good news, stock goes down. Weird ass market."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Last period the whole market has difficulties. Hopefully the market is going to get back it‚Äôs strength and than we will see definitely green. And PLtR can run fast
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Tuesday
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"wonder what the excuse will be this time, at least they can't say its ""priced in"" cause were at rock bottom, maybe carp will sell more shares and do us all dirty, lets hope not."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm balls deep
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Technical analysis would say it's extremely overvalued though. Undervalued in terms of hype maybe?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Undervalued?  On what basis?

Also.  These are shit banks in the corporate world."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry. What is Altryx?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,When I remember that I feel better
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"In this case, the use of the adverb, ‚Äúbigly,‚Äù is considered grammatically appropriate."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,$365 billion market cap? LOL
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Not because of this.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,calls on PLTR monday?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt say anything. Choose yourself. But last week I bought some long calls 35$ April 30th 21 and long call 24,50$ April 9th21"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Tldr: üöÄ
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Truth, but if (when) gme does reach the moon there will be so many autists throwing tendies at other meme stocks and the rest of wsb favourite stonks will fly again"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"And you would not have sold at 50 cuse why not it might hit 60, and you would not have sold at 60 cuse you know it might hit 70 and it gous round n round n round. This is 95% of failed traders, u need to learn how to sell with profit."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Well fuck if those morons from MF are suggesting it.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,lol
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm intrigued your entire 2 month old reddit account is pretty much dedicated to pltr...
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Market hasn't had a good time, but somehow SPY is ATH at $401. A lot of the individual companies are not ATH at all."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Pltr*
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"HF don't deal with emotions. If they see an opportunity to make money they will. PLTR is not there yet because of its financials, all we have is a road map and mild results guidance. This stock is good to be re visited in 2 or 3 years when the company starts making money instead of burning through cash like it is right now."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"lol hedge funds don't give a fuck about your sentiment, they want to make money. GME only spikes upwards because HFs want to make a killing again"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Did nazi that coming
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Gold and art ?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"r/conspiracy and r/wallstreetbets in the same room? What is this, a crossover episode?!"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,i got til 5/21 for this bitch to get its act together
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Technical analysis is on the same level as tea leaf reading.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,TA doesn't say shit about it being over BOUGHT at this moment (TA doesn't deal with value). Maybe your ape brain meant to say fundamental analysis.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"TA doesn't indicate intrinsic value, just momentum and sentiment.

Momentum and sentiment can be guided by value, but also nah.

PLTR Revenues in millions: 

* 2018 - 595.4
* 2019 - 742.6 (24.72% growth YoY)
* 2020 - 1,092.7 (47.14% growth YoY)
* 2021 - Q1: 322 (Vs consensus of 300).

Realistically? Their growth will continue to accelerate each quarter, if we're treating the past two quarters as something other than a fluke.

People betting on PLTR are likely betting on long-term explosive growth, which is happening as we speak.  

I'm expecting PLTR to become a whale, increasing in value by at least 50% by 2022 and again by 2023. But likely more in the region of 60-70% YoY.

But just to be clear, I'm a fucking retard and have no idea what I'm talking about."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Technical analysis lol
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"8+ years , definitely not a few years unless somehow they increase growth by like 80% for  4 straight years.  1.8B (2021) -> 3.24B (2022) -> 5.8B (2023) -> 10.5B (2024)"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Jezus... do you even know wtf PLTR does? It go wat higher than 365.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes I still have them
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"‚ÄúI‚Äôm last week I bought some LONG calls‚Äù

>April 35$ ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°

I guess long is just in sense of being bullish üíÄüíÄ"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, it's not like I trade like this on the regular but I had strong conviction that it would be 40 or higher again after lock up and that I had plenty of time value left. Sure, I now only have x2 instead of x4 ROI, but it's still a profit. 

If I'd have played it entirely conservatively, I would have sold at $18 (and would have lost out on the 40 spike anyways)."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a Wendy‚Äôs.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Barron's tried to warn me the past week. How am I supposed to inverse both of them? üòµ
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, brother. A lot of different stocks. Most of them meme stocks"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You have to look at the Nasdaq
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Tudor
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I see what u did there
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was thinking gold, but sure art too probably."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm not going to claim to be much of a historian but I thought this was generally accepted.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm right there too.

24 contracts ranging from $23 strike to $25 strike
Also, 2 8/20 $30 contracts."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Lipton gang rise up!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Guys that believe Technical Analysis are the same thing as girls that believe in astrology
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"My bad, fundamental analysis is correct."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"This type of growth is a real possibility. The short seller theises was that they are a government service provider therefore limiting the amount of growth but that has been proven wrong. Recent news about BP, IBM, AWS partnerships validates a commercial use for their software. This company is definitely going places..."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Without significant share repurchases, i don't see how they ever get to $200/share"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,They've released their own projections and they're basically half of what you've just thrown out there. I think palantir could definitely be 100 billion company by 2025 but that's absolute best case scenario. And what is that a stock price of $50 in 4 years. Maybe.  Problem around here is everyone's brains have been warped by Tesla and they have no fucking clue how to actually value a stock or calculate future projections with just reasonable estimates. They don't understand why every meme stock shouldn't trade at what it's best case scenario in 10 years would be.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it‚Äôs not expiring this Friday, it‚Äôs long for this sub"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Very good. You call those long calls, doesn‚Äôt matter the time period"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol there is a middle ground you know
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes or no?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I see nazing
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Art is how you launder the money. It's worth whatever you pretend it is so you can move huge chunks of money around with no one questioning it.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,900 shares @ $24 + 10 01/2022 $20c LETS FUCKING GOOOO!!! Big green dildo at open
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,üòÇüëè
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Delusion and hopium. They power a lot of EVs these days
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I get your logic but there‚Äôs absolutely no way it stays under $50 for the next four years. This thing was about to hit $50 a few weeks ago. The stock is very volatile and has monster swings when the market gets hot.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yet, TSLA does exist."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are you new to wsb?  You don‚Äôt need to specify long calls, they‚Äôre just calls."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This is not true and fundamentally an ignorant statement made by people on reddit with no familiarity in the industry.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Last year really screwed people's ideas about what the market does. There's nothing to say the market's going to get hot again anything like it has. You should take a look at what the market did for the four years under Trump which were about as supportive as you can get versus Biden who's going to be ratcheting up taxes especially on corporations and there's a possibility of small interest rate increases sometime in 2022 next year.  And even with the giant correction that just happened we're still in a very expensive market.  We're probably still 10 to 15% over valued and that fluff is only being supported by the low interest rates so watch out when they start getting ratcheted up because the market will throw a tantrum and give that 10 to 15% up in a heartbeat. But granted that's one to two years out. But my point is we're already at our leading edge.  But it's more fun to think that it's going to get crazy again I mean who the fuck doesn't want to get rich right? Or poor when you get your fucking portfolios slashed like what just happened.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes Tesla and only Tesla. What the fuck are you trying to stay in your zone of denial. Your reality distortion bubble?  Nothing like trying to cherry pick stupid shit to justify more stupid shit.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Alright, that will make it easier for them"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I was skeptical of this dd til I saw OP‚Äôs comments and realized he is truly artistic and can probably draw the nyc skyline in pen from memory of a 15 min helicopter flight overhead. All in pltr
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"True. Only time will tell. Imo I believe over the next year or two, there will be some more wild swings until those taxes rise as well as interest rates. And yes it is fun to all speculate that everything moons and we all get rich. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important to be reasonably well diversified."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for speaking reason to idiots. SO many flooded noobies who don't know how to trade in anything but these crazy fucking swings upward.

EDIT: for anyone reading, if you are a bulltard, keep atleast 10-15% in OTM 3-4mo out puts, and roll them for the inevitable crash, so you don't go bankrupt.

Sure, it'll cost you a little ea. month, but that's what insurance is dummy."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs the way brother
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,What are these shares they speak of?  I only know about 0DTE calls.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"My dumb ass read 450k to 30k and couldnt understand why ppl congratulated you

Anyways, fuck you and congratz brother"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats and that‚Äôs absolutely crazy $450 to $30k in 2 weeks.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Option lesson request:

Let's assume the price of GME ended above 40$ at expiration date and the option holder that bought from you would exercise those... would you or the MM had to sell the option holder shares at 40$/share?"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I sold on Wednesday the day before Robinhood pulled their stunt. GME was around $340 when I sold the call. The next day I used most of my profits to buy shares as it was declining since I could still trade on Fidelity.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,if he had a contract to sell 100 share and it got exercised he would have to deliver 100 shares to the buyer. if he dont already have 100 to deliver he would have to buy them off the market at the market price to deliver them. So if the contract was exercised at 40 and it closed at 80 if he had to buy from the market he would be paying  80 x100 .
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"This crap confused me for a while, so Imma drop this lesson here just in case this is also your confusion: You ONLY have to worry about someone exercising options on you if you SHORT sold a call or put.

Otherwise, when you buy puts and calls  and then sell them, you're just trading options that were ""short sold"" by others."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't know exactly what the price closed at the expiration date, but if it ended above 40$, he so would has to give the buyer of his sold call option 100 shares/option.

In this case he sold 100 x 40$call options for 30K and we assume the price closed slightly above 40$. If he now has to buy the shares because the buyer exercised the 100 call options, our OP would make a loss of around 10K, right? What if now the buyer of OP's call options had sold those 100 call options to another person - OP would be now out of the game with his 30K, right?"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah I prefer ornamental gourd futures.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"> VIAC priced an offering at $85 per share, the institutions/hedge-funds who bought at those levels have no choice but to reduce their cost basis at current levels.

That is not how it works.  Unlike stupid apes, these funds are smart enough to just eat a loss and move on.  They don't have to buy more of anything, that's retard logic.

> The forced liquidation of Archegos Capital lead to massive VIAC blocks being sold in the market at a discounted price, which aided to the nasty continuous sell-off. There‚Äôs been a drastic decline in volume the past few days which signals that the liquidation phase is near or at its end.

Assuming the sell-off finished, the stock has been at its current point for about a week-- bulls have had plenty of time to take a bite if they're interested.  Maybe the stock bounces back to $50 or $55, but I doubt it's on its way back to anything near the $100 it had.

> VIAC‚Äôs bullish momentum came from a few factors: Their new streaming service Paramount+ releasing, ViacomCBS reaching 11-year agreement with the NFL, strong earnings, extremely cheap valuation relative to market, and a company that follows the value/reopening/cyclical trend in a higher yield environment.

The streaming service is the only reason to get excited here.  Because without it the cheap valuation is justified-- cable TV is a dying industry, streaming is the future.  Netflix, Disney, and Comcast get higher multiples because they've already got their foot in the door, they're already playing the game.  Hwang bet on up-and-comers-- AMCX, DISCK, and VIAC.  It's completely understandable that these companies trade lower than their better-established streaming rivals.  And I would not consider TV and streaming media to be a big ""coronavirus recovery"" sector.  You're telling me as soon as it's safe to come outside, people are just gonna stay home and watch a bad Star Trek series?

> ViacomCBS is not some meme company, it‚Äôs a company with a strong balance sheet that produces real profits.

In a dying industry.

> Paramount+ growth and success will stem from ViacomCBS‚Äôs brands and their unique model.

The brands thing, maybe, sure, who knows.  But what makes their model unique?  It's a streaming service, how is it unique, do they shove a dildo up your butt after you click on the play button???

> Paramount+ offers live sports (NFL, Europa League, March Madness, Masters Tourney), news, original content, and a large library of older content from their various brands.

Again, sure, maybe Showtime will beat HBO, and the NFL will beat the NBA, and Nickolodeon will beat Adult Swim, and etc etc.  But then again maybe not.

> ViacomCBS brands: Paramount Studios (Star Trek), Showtime (Billions) Nickelodeon (Avatar, Spongebob), CBS, BET, MTV, Comedy Central, Pluto TV, etc.

Who can forget that classic brand, Pluto TV.

> They recently signed a 11-year contract with the NFL that gives them multi-platform rights, allows them to stream them on Paramount+.

What happens 11 years from now if someone offers the NFL more money?

> The launch of their new streaming service and transition into the digital age helps their growth prospects.

It sure as fuck better, right?

> Valuation currently is dirt cheap sitting at a PE Ratio of 11 and trading significantly under it‚Äôs fair value price

Valuation is dirt cheap because you have to have good growth prospects to have higher multiples.  The people arriving late to the streaming scene have worse prospects than the people who showed up early-- you cant compare multiples between the two groups.

> Technicals: Price has been consolidating around $45, near it‚Äôs 200 DMA, multiple indicators showing oversold.

Geez, it's almost as if there's a big reason for that.

> Shorters are getting greedy, short percent of float is near 19%

Shorters just cashed out buddy boy.  They said ""This stock aint worth $100"" and made fat stacks cause they were dead right.  The people you're hoping to squeeze have already covered their positions and now they're popping bottles at the club.

> The reason to invest in VIAC over VIACA is because of the large difference in volume/liquidity in their shares and options.

First thing I agree on.

> Recent Price Targets for VIAC: Benchmark Firm gives $120, Citi gives $92, Needham gives $80, Goldman Sachs gives $75, BMO Capital gives $70

Credit Suisse says $46, Loop says $48, Wells Fargo says $59, MoffettNathanson says $55, UBS says $29, Citigroup says $49, Barclays says $35, Bank of America says $32, Keybanc says $30...

-----

I wouldn't be super surprised if AMCX, VIAC, and DISCK bounced back a little.  Because it's not like Hwang was necessarily making a bad bet here-- the success of Disney and AT&T and Comcast in claiming a foothold in the streaming market shows a path that those companies can potentially take to build their own streaming services and carve out a slice of that pie.  But the multiples seem to accurately reflect the chances of that happening.  AMC Networks doesn't fully own the rights to some of its heaviest hitters, so it's sitting in the shitter with a forward PE of just 6.89.  Discovery has a practical monopoly on a lot of content, so it's got a forward PE of 11.3.  And Viacom CBS is in the middle with a forward PE of 10.52 because while it doesn't have the same problems as AMC, most of its stuff is like the little brother of something in AT&T's catalogue.  Like, who's betting on Showtime over HBO?  You look at most of what VIAC's got and it's like that meme where you ask mom if you can get X and she tells you you've got X at home.  

I don't even really wanna buy leaps on this shit, the IV is still pretty high.  If I buy a Jan 2023 $45c, I gotta pay $11.8??  So if this stock goes up 25% in the next 21 months I break even????  What??????

If you believe in the company, I think wait a month, wait for people to realize it's not about to jump back to $100, and then buy some ATM leaps on it when the IV is something reasonable."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Could someone explain why VIAC is more valuable than VIACA? It seems to me like VIACA would be more valuable, since it carries voting rights."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Where is Chanel West Coast on that pie chart?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Why VIAC over VIACA? Thought the lower volume/liquidity of VIACA would contribute to a greater pop like DISCB?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I think it should drop to the 30s before it's worth picking up
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"VIAC vs DISC? Same situation, and DISC was having very solid growth before the liquidation"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought VIACA would rebound but guess depends on float.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Netflix, HBO Max, Amazon, Disney +, ..... paramount has to compete with these players. No one is going to subscribe to all at the same time.

Original content is what matters and paramount is going to have a hard time doing that even with NFL. NFL has its own streaming service, I use theirs now so wouldn't go to Paramount to watch it.

They are going to have prove themselves against these players and its going to take a long time if ever. The stock was already inflated to begin with and their offering busted everything. In hindsight they made a mistake but they didn't know Hwang was a class A retard.

If this goes up it won't be by much and it'll be a year before their streaming numbers will show anything credible if even."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt see how if they do it not based on any materially non public information.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets, I feel like VIAC has a lot more reason to be valued high and if it goes lower theres gonna be a day trader war or something reflecting meme stock volatility. Can someone help me understand why this wouldnt take off in a day trader war or something?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, this stock definitely got driven way, way up due in huge part to Hwang hurling *fuck tons* of money at it. It's down near levels that would coincide with when it really started to rip higher now though. PE ratio of 11 now. That's gonna be pretty attractive once people see it has bottomed and all of the fear and uncertainty around block sales and liquidation dies down. 

Imagine what VIAC does when CS and NMR announce that they're finished and they offloaded Hwang's books. You probably get A.) Lotta shorts covering, and B.) Longs looking at that juicy, juicy PE of 11 and dividend of 2%"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,True but but it's hard to tell how much of the price rise was due to the things op mentioned and how much of it was due to Hwang. There has been some actual bullish news around the same time it started to rise.

No reason viac cant double or triple in the next few months (ignore cable is going down, all there shows suck, and counting on people to tune in biggly to watch tom Brady play in the Super Bowl thru age 50 is smart)"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"$110B can. The dude was leveraged to the tits. If he had to report his ‚Äòeconomic stake‚Äô, Hwang would have been the largest shareholder"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"But the problem is they don't really own the rights to their sports stuff.  They're just renting it.  When the lease comes back up, nothing stops the NFL from putting their feet to the fire."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thought that is a positive component of a recovery? If everyone is trying to buy an illiquid stock, should go up right?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,VIACA options have horrible spreads and significantly less volume. There's a reason why people pay a premium for liquidity.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough, but how do you explain DISCB is that‚Äôs the whole truth?

That‚Äôs low volume but that doesn‚Äôt follow the argument that it‚Äôs too low of a volume to play. I‚Äôm not convinced

VIACA also has average volume at 250,00+ and Thursday did 530,000 in volume"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol what. Name the last time Viacom had negative profits for the year, I‚Äôll wait... but yea a couple bad quarters a way from going out of business lmfao"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh damn...
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,*A whole  new world!*
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"... That's 30000 shares, not 30000 usd."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs the average for the past months when the stock was stagnate. Once there was a catalyst that volume increased x10.

Your argument would follow if you were saying an increase in price is only the result of one big buy, like with penny stocks, but your argument that there isn‚Äôt enough liquidity to be able to sell the stock/options once the price goes up doesn‚Äôt follow

And again, VIACA has an average volume of 250,000. That‚Äôs low, but not as low as DISCB so that comparison is inaccurate. 

I don‚Äôt mean to be confrontational, I appreciate you taking the time to argue this"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure. Its pretty straightforward for someone with programming experience to set it up. I have also made it open source two months back which implies anyone can fork it and use it directly. 

The key here lies in the implementation. How do you count the ticker (whether it's just the ticker or would you consider the stock name?), how to deal with spam,  how to incorporate financial terms into sentiment etc.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"So while this company seems interesting and has potential no one is making the bear argument. I usually want to see the bad with the GOOD before I buy anything.

1. $BFLY‚Äôs 2020 Form 10k indicated an operating loss that surpassed 2019. I understand a growing medical company has substantial costs for research and development. Also retaining top talent is expensive which only adds to operating costs. Lastly the FDA has increased guidelines their pre-market approval and clear - which has resulted in higher costs to get a new product to market. These costs can be absorbed by existing companies but $BFLY being a newer company doesn‚Äôt have the same resources. So how will this get funded? If they issue more equity it will dilute existing shareholders.

2. You mention competitors- you forgot about Canon Medical Systems (f/k/a Toshiba), Hitachi and Siemens Healthineers. If $BFLY plans to undercut their competitors for cost of the equipment how do they plan to be profitable? Are there additional revenue streams in the works? 

3. Lastly they rely on a single source for both their semiconductors $TSMC (Taiwan semiconductors) and for manufacturing a single source contract with Benchmark Electronics Inc. Having sole sources for raw materials and manufacturing can lead to inherent risks getting to market. Also most of $TSMC chips come from abroad. Yes they have a plant in Washington state but it is an older facility and may not supply the chips to $BFLY."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"##HOLY FUCK, BOYS!"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I like what I'm reading
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"ER doc chiming in. First, I love the product. HOWEVER, there is no chance in hell I‚Äôm purchasing it individually when US machines are common place (at least in every ED I‚Äôve worked in). Also I am just not thrilled about this as an investment. Here‚Äôs why. 

The reason their cloud based image system is growing is because an MD/DO cannot use it in most hospital systems without a hospital approved storage area for images. So now you are trying to disrupt two areas, US and radiology image storage. 

Second, everyone likes to say POCUS is the new best thing and it‚Äôs going to replace the stethoscope. This is bullshit. I‚Äôve been in medicine for a decade and POCUS has been there the whole time. It is not new. Those things have been brought up for a decade and I have yet to ditch my stethoscope. 

It‚Äôs also an incredibly difficult area to disrupt. Think about this from a hospital perspective. This product (just in term of obtaining an ultrasound image) is marginally better than some other products and not better than the big boys. Most/all hospitals already provide POCUS capabilities in the ED and ICU where it is most used. Why buy a new machine when the one you have works well already? Also if I buy a new US machine I now have to buy their software? I already have imaging software. 

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm bearish on BFLY. HOWEVER! The next thing they are getting into is wearables. I‚Äôm skeptical of this but don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm smarter than they are. If they thing there is a market for wearable ultrasounds and you want to bet on them, then you may get great gains. 

TL;DR I‚Äôm a user of this product and I‚Äôm not investing. I think it will go sideways/down for a while. But there is a slight chance they come up with a breakthrough."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"My fianc√© works in cardiology at one of the top 10 heart hospitals in the USA. This is not just a device for smaller clinics to use as a way of making a suspect diagnosis, it's also being used at the end point of the referral chain for heart failure patients. She and the other cardiologists are head over heels with the Butterfly ultrasound. POCUS is emerging as a type of imaging that can quickly and much more cheaply diagnose problems that would need more advanced imaging. Where she works right now only doctors who have purchased the Butterfly for themselves are using it, while the hospital currently uses the Kosmos system as their standard issue. But she says more and more cardiologists are saying they wish they had Butterfly over the Kosmos. If hospitals start wrapping these subscription services into their purchase agreements, this company could begin printing money big time. She says if the hospital doesn't supply her one within the year she's gonna buy one out of pocket. 400 shares @17.66"

Super excited about their potential"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Do they have a lock up period?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great work on the DD, thanks.

As a radiologist, I would emphasize the bear case point about the competitors and their market share. Phillips and GE are big players in the radiology world. They also provide additional imaging modalities to our hospitals like MRI machines. Often times our hospitals receive ‚Äúsuite deals‚Äù and if the hospital or radiology clinics are already buying a philips MRI magnet, they will likely go with the Philips Lumify, which I have seen recently with my radiology group."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs not hyperbolic that pocus replace the stethoscope. Everything we hear with auscultation we use to try to reconstruct/reverse engineer an underlying 3D shape. Better by far to just look at the actual shape using a series of 2D visual planes.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,My biggest loser in my portfolio. No thanks.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"1. I am pretty sure doctors are willing to pay higher price for a better quality, people would pay higher prices for a better quality device that would give a better image quality when compared to iQ+ .
2. Did you really compare   iQ+  as a 21st century stethoscope , are you really that stupid ,a good stethoscope cost around 130 usd while this bitch costs 2000usd not to mention the subscribtion costs . This comparison is the most retarded shit i have seen in wsb yet. THIS ISNT GOING TO BE THE NEW 21ST CENTURY STETHOSCOPE.
3. Everyone can make money in bull market , quite frankly learning that ark put their money in this company makes me think of buying some long puts on this stock.

Guys in most businesses the quality matters and then the price , price for most people and corporations only comes second to the quality of the device or service they are buying , simple having lower price isnt good enough thats especially true in medical industry."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't most of their customers opt to not renew their subscriptions after the first year?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I saw NASA is using it on the space station.   Pretty neat.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I completely agree. My investment outlook is not that this will replace anything, but that hospitals will over allocate resources to it due to wow factor and then forget about the subscription fees much like a forgotten Hulu subscription. Bullish on bloated healthcare costs."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,">billable

The documentation requirements (required views) for most ultrasounds are beyond the capabilities of most healthcare providers unless they've put in serious time training and it's in their wheelhouse (cardiologists looking at the heart, OBGYNs looking at your wife's boyfriend's fetus, etc.). And unless you're qualified to interpret your own imaging (a radiologist, cardiologistsl, vascular surgeon, etc.) then you really shouldn't be billing for it. And those interpreting physicians would rather read a formal study done on a real ultrasound machine (not a cool gimmick) by a trained and credentialed sonographer that does thousands of those types of exams every year."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm a physician, and all of my physician friends have similar feelings: POCUS/hand held ultrasound is ""neat"" but doesn't have a place in the clinical environment beyond a few more small use cases that cannot justify the expense. In the vast majority of cases outside of the ED it takes too much time. Insurance companies make it difficult to get reimbursed for billing it, in addition to a large reimbursement cut a few years back and will invariably get cut further if more people start billing for them. This is in addition to the fact that any serious pathology we are ordering actual studies with the ""expensive"" equipment that you kind of brush off, but it turns out those are actually *good* at getting images because you will use a dedicated transducer designed to get the image you are looking for. If you get the price down significantly I'd consider it at $500 with *no* subscription but that kills your thesis for investing."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I own one of these things. Never got the subscription. Never needed it. The ultrasound is a cool little toy though.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,That is simply not true. Ultrasounds have become commodities and you can get cheap machines.   a lot of doctors are doing their own in house. Also there‚Äôs a global market not just US.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,All physicians don't have similar feelings. I know some who feel the exact opposite (whom I consulted before jumping in).  Point is there is enough growth potential here for a lot of use cases (especially where there may be NGO investment for developing countries aka looking at Mr. Gates).  Pricing will eventually shift from up front hardware cost to mostly subscription fee with much of the value coming from the cloud data and analytical capabilities which will continue to grow.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"From my post:

> It's not meant to be a total replacement for traditional sonography

But thanks for the insight, I appreciate it!  I've spoken with a couple doctors that seemed to have a different sentiment, but I obviously don't have the network you do working in the field."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You mean if you get dragged into court you're not going to want to have to explain to the jury how you thought you saw something/everything looked OK on your iPhone so you didn't order a formal ultrasound or CT?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are completely missing my point. It has nothing to do with cost and everything to do with skills. And most physicians who bill in-house already have machines (since you are correct and they ""can get cheap machines"") and someone to use the machine. Or they just utilize an independent contractor who has their own portable laptop machine who gets a flat per-scan fee. Most are just going to refer out to an affiliated imaging center or hospital (though there are a few niche exceptions).

Let's take something simple like the biophysical profile on a 2nd/3rd trimester pregnancy. On a normal exam you're going to score the fetus 8/8 once you've documented adequate muscle tone, breathing, movement, and heart rate, plus amniotic fluid and this will take just a few minutes. But you can't score less than an 8/8 if you haven't been looking at least 30 minutes. That's an eternity in outpatient care and no provider is going to sit there for 30 minutes staring at the screen."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I mean you will obviously find a lot of enthusiasm with it from the right fields, there are a lot of ultrasound fellowships popping up but I think the majority are in the ED. Sports medicine as well but again they are going to pay for the nicer machines since they can typically bill for studies. I dedicated a month of one of my electives in residency to it and I think it can be useful, just not at the current prices for the majority of physicians."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah pretty much. For me I think the best use would be ultrasound guided joint injections and to help with abscess drainage (help to identify those in between cases where I'm not sure there is enough fluid to drain).

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would suggest you buy 400K worth of Starbucks stock, then buy 400k worth of Starbucks gift cards. This make Starbucks profit to increase by 400k immediately, which causes the stock to appreciate. Then you can sell the profit from your 400k stock, then buy the Starbucks cards with that money which then causes the stock to raise again. Repeat this process to earn as much as you like.

Remember, REPEAT this process is the keyword here. Otherwise your investment will not grow"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait how does 800k in gift cards change your over all hedge in the dollar. Those gift cards are going to always be worth 800k. It‚Äôs not like they appreciate in value or gain buying power. A 5 dollar gift card is still a 5 dollar gift card five years from now except the coffee you want is now 5 dollars instead of the 2 dollars it was five years ago. Am I missing something?

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fake serious answer, just for fun: This makes an investment decision that would be based on a pertinent flawed assumption...that Starbucks gift cards are a limited quantity, much like shares of a public company. However, since Starbucks is not constrained by stock market laws (or other sane monetary policy), what could happen is SB printing millions more. By doing so, being that they are directly tied to their worth in dollars, SB could cause hyperinflation and devalue the currency they are based on. Pretty soon a coffee at SB would cost 1.35 billion dollars.

At that point, SB could just stop printing them, causing a crash in that hyperinflation...but they would do that after purchasing trillions of US dollars. Once the value of those reaches close to original levels, SB controls all of the US and renames itself: United Stores of Awesome (still USA, so they don't have to rebrand as many products). With SB in control, coffee and lemon scones are now required for each citizen, increasing both satisfaction and energy levels, heralding a new era of hyperproductivity in citizens' much shortened caffeinated lives."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"If the value of the dollar goes down, our dollar will still be a dollar....but the price of the goods will be more. An $8 coffee might become $12. So realistically, your gift card would buy less in the future. 

I'm 99.99% sure this is how it works. Value of dollar goes down, therefore cost of goods goes up. It takes more of your dollars to buy the good. 

I'm lost in these logic so I'm going to assume this is satire and I'm about to get whooshed."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You have to be careful how you go about this. Buying multiple gift cards to the banks is a flag for money laundering. I know you're purchasing them from Starbucks more than likely but if it is a debit or credit transaction the sheer amount could definitely trigger a flag. I used to be in banking about 4 years ago so I will admit I don't know if this is still done. Godspeed retard!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"On a scale of cuckolding, this investment idea is 

My wife's boyfriend is my dad.

DYOR but if you are going to play the hyperinflation game because of say money printing.. these cards are the opposite direction - they'll be worthless as they have a set conversion currency amount not a value. You need investments not linked to cash conversion - think milk powder or baby formula... whether the sticker price is $10 or $100 - consumption is still the same quantity (for those who can themselves stay ahead of inflation)... and then you need something that doesn't expire and is easily stored. The best investment during the Weimer Republic in the 30s was borrowing money and buying buildings, factories, farmland.  The hyperinflation paid off the interest and principal. Philip Fisher (Charlie Monger's spirit animal) proposed buying shares in companies that produce or own real things in this situation (after his experience in the Great Depression and WW2 - wars = money printing). Gold and silver will also be the most overcrowded trade.. and it gives you no leverage. Buy a farm with debt and ei ei o yourself to the moon."

Now, rather than sell them all at once for a lump sum,  I suggest maybe making a credit reward system and ad watcher application, then having the giftcards be rewards.  Then you will take profit from the sale of customer data and you can now write off the gift cards as a business expense and have 3 good years tax free."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Be aware that some gift cards have expiration dates. For my wedding, lots of people gave us gift cards to all sorts of places. We decided to save them until we really needed them. Fast forward two or three years. We start trying to use them only to find that they have no more money on them. We made a bunch of phone calls and we were told to look at the fine print of each card. Out of the 10 or so cards we had, we spent maybe $3. Cards expire. Or you get charged for not using them frequently enough. 
If you don‚Äôt use a gift card within three months or so, some will start to just subtract automatically from the available balance. By the time you get to it, a $50 gift card could be a $10 gift card.

Be aware of these tactics that gift cards use to counter your strategy. 
Please read the fine print very carefully before making an investment like this."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Think of how many people you could save with your gift cards when the IRS is coming to arrest them and the only thing that can save them is gift cards
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You should Diversity your portfolio just like your polyamorous girlfriend.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Better off investing in rarity gift cards like Kmart gift cards. The minute the  last one closes those cards will be PRICELESS!!!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"??? Gift cards are valued in USD? As USD goes down, so does the face value of the gift cards??"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I hear there's a stock you can buy that everyone likes. The media says you won't be able to pay the taxes after you sell it though.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets, Buy a farm instead.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You may have a issue with them Starbucks bonds maturing to get a return for profit before the expiration date on the back of the card hits.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I have honestly thought about this with Target gift cards when they offer them for 10% off at Christmas. Not only do you get them at a discount but if the dollar goes crazy you could resell them. Just a economy theory I had. Probably won‚Äôt ever do it but glad I‚Äôm not the only crazy one out there. lol
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hahahahaha oh wait was it a joke? You wanna blockbuster yourself on a company that will close many locations this year?!

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the type of posts I miss on wsb. What's this world (sub) come to üòî?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy a bunch of chickens then sell the eggs perfect hedge against inflation
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Uuuuhhhhhhh...I‚Äôm not a genius but I think if the dollar crashes, it‚Äôs possible that people will quit paying $6 for a cup of coffee."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,saw a YouTube video explain ing how Starbucks accidentally got into the banking business. how they encourage d lots of people to load up their Starbucks cards. end up with more than a billion in holdings. and not have to pay for it. aka no interests to it's customers
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the worst idea I have heard so far this year.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you already been investing in too many poppies?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's a terrible idea, would be better to get money orders, that way when Starbucks goes bankrupt, you still have value!"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Idk I heard good things about corn futures
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Starbucks? Fuck no you‚Äôre an idiot. I did this with blockbuster gift cards much larger customer base when I finally decide I want to sell
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you buy them with a credit card that gives you bonus points and if the gift cards were sold at a discount or bonus dollars loaded on them and you can drink or resell that much in gift cards, sure."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Better yet take that 800k and light it on fire
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"You should just put it into beanie babies, much wiser investment."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy Charizards
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,lol - that's the only response I could muster.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Either you‚Äôll go down a retard, or a rich retard. Good luck"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think this is a doable strategy,

I mean the cartel pays people money in cars and visa gift cards and gold. Chains.

So the thots and the Insta models out there will be your clients
Definitely doable and a good hedge against inflation,   

Heck if you use your credit card hacks you might be even be able to make  Some cash back or bonus points."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can write them off as a business expense... You can buy hundreds In gift cards for coffee, supplies, Costco and say You give them to clients as gifts but save them and use them for house hold expenses and then write them off as business expenses."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You could also bottle some gourds.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs stupid because gift card $1 will always equal real $1 so if $1 goes down gift card will to.

What you need to do is buy a bunch of Starbucks coffee and then put it in the fridge and sell high."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,If the dollar is going down the only thing that guarantees profit is massive debt.  It will be trivial to pay for your $2.1mm mansion when that is also the cost of a loaf of bread. Just make sure the interest rate is fixed.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Excellent idea. Don‚Äôt forget to get Dunkin Donuts gift cards too, just a hedge."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Wanna know what‚Äôs funny? This sarcastic intentionally retarded post is still smarter than half the shit posted on this sub.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,i lold
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,LOL
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Please try to support local businesses other than Starbucks. I know it's easier with the gift cards but they already have enough money
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I will put it on GME inflation is made up by printing money,  it's the government fault"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This actually works if you buy the gift cards in Canadian dollars.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Ummmmmm..
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"So when the countrys broke as shit and the dollar is worthless, you wanna sell starbucks giftcards? You think people will have that kind of disposable income handy if that happens?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is stupid as fuck. There is Amazon, Walmart, Target, and so many more better options. You can't buy anything from a starbucks. You can from Amazon"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Assuming this is real and in Canada:
You'd be able to sell 20k worth of starbucks cards/year without collecting income. 
Anything over that and you'll have to register as a buisness, and report income made on gift card sales. 
Personal note: this seems very irrational and an awful investment/buisness standpoint. The dollar may collapse, but who's to say that doesn't make coffee more expensive?  Netting a greater overall loss, unless you're a market pro. Kudos if you make it work."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow, this is dumb."

In reality though idk if any giftcards is a good idea because they're backed by the dollar. I'm sure there is something similar out there that might actually be a good idea though."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Giftcards expire.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Bravo! This is kind of creative thinking that keeps me coming back to this sub.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait its Easter not April Fools Day right?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm sure op is just joking, at least I hope they were just joking. Realistically if the price of the dollar goes down then the value of any gift cards would also go down. But then I‚Äôm just a retarded ape who likes movies."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm investing in those strawberry candies that no one seems to remember buying
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"While I wholeheartedly encourage you to do this, if the dollar goes down then won't the price of starbucks drinks just go up and the real value of the gift cards will drop along with the dollar?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Please be real please be realüòÖ
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gifties used to be an options contract but ever since they made it illegal to give them an expiration date, they're a galaxy brained investment vehicle.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,no dude. just no
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Everyone (should) knows that stonks sre the only real hedge against inflation.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Okay this is actually brilliant... Starbucks is probably more stable with more trust in it then the government today so it makes more sense then buying government bonds
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Long term capital gain assuming you hold for more that 1 year.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You should consider investing in the gourd industry

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I love that you included your gf is polyamorous
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I've seen some dumb ideas before but this one takes the cake.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't like that I read this and for just a few seconds thought this person may be a genius for this idea. I wish I never saw this thread because now I have to live with this knowledge of myself for many years to come.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Used to work at Starbucks 

You would be much better off investing in beans. 80,000 pounds of them roughly. Arabica bean plants are becoming more scarce so when Starbucks switches to cheaper Rustica plants you can make a killing selling original Arabica beans at $50 a pound

Not barista advice"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm bullish on the SBUX gift card market, be sure to max out your discover card too"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,And when exactly are you going to drink coffee worth 800k? How is your plan to convert that into dollars again? Stand in front of a Starbucks and sell it with a discount?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Does literally everyone in this subreddit have 6+ digit life savings? Y'all Wall Street bankers or something?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This is some old school WSB autist talk. Thank you and Godspeed.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Fair trade coffee is the way to go.  Starbucks when will you sell only FAIR TRADE COFFEES?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm seriously trying to figure out where you are planning on selling them.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,No tax implications. Just like buying $800K of coffee. Not sure how buying gift cards will be different from USD. The price of the coffee will be the same regardless if you use cash or gift cards.

Also, this is a bad idea."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Remember gift cards often sell at a discount so as long as you incorporate for 10-15% loss in value there. It may be better to bet in currency futures
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Why wouldn‚Äôt you just buy a Starbucks? Own the store...

Fuck me if you actually did that and then moved to Thailand or India and lived off the rental income from those US properties then you could live out the rest of your days like a king and do whatever you wanted to all day!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,There's a markup on these gift cards and sales tax. You're going to start off with around a 15-20% loss.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Is there a Nigerian prince involved?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Isn't the price of gift cards directly tied to the price of the dollar? Wouldn't a $100 gift card only get you $100 worth of Starbucks in the future, even as prices rise?"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy them through your credit card to get points for miles or anything else. Then pay off the balance of your credit card with the $800k. This will increase your credit and gain many miles on your credit card. Enjoy.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,They almost certainly won't let you do this. You'll be flagged for money laundering

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"On the starbucks gift card front, I think that you will have to pay tax on the item when you buy it. It probably isn‚Äôt a good investment but you do what you want. It‚Äôs a good tax loophole."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you considered buying and holding milk? The price always goes up. A lot of things are compared to the cost of milk. So just buy milk. The price will rise. You resell the milk. I cant foresee any kind of sour downside in the future of milk trading.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think the thing that upsets me most about this post is that there‚Äôs virtually no risk of OP losing 100% of his investment. Even if inflation rises to 10%, OP only loses 10%, and don‚Äôt get me wrong 80k is still a chunk of change, but not enough to really leave him in the poorhouse. I guess maybe there‚Äôs hope that there‚Äôs a lot more friction when trying to unload them and maybe he loses another 10-25% because no one wants to buy Starbucks gift cards at face value from a stranger when they can easily get them from a reputable store."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You may want to stick to forever stamps
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Gift cards expire

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think some people are going to take this seriously which worries me about the state of the world.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"this is a really, really good idea, but its risky, you need to convert it to actual coffee to hedge that risk. its not practical unless you have a place to store the coffee. a MUCH safer idea is to find something, literally anything, that sells buy 1 get 1 free coupons, there is no way to lose."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can someone break this down for me, I assume this retard is joking, but how would this hedge against inflation?   Presumably the cost of a coffee would go up and this guy would still only have 800k in starbucks money.  So wouldn't it be the opposite of hedging against inflation?"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not just buy calls on foreign currency if your bearish on the dollar ?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt do it only because Starbucks giftcards are really easy to hack and steal in a generator.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"you might want to just dump all of that in Kuwaiti dinars. You'll lose on the double conversion, unless you go to Kuwait with your USD (you can only travel with $10,000 USD so you'll have to make 80 trips assuming you are not paying for your flights and stays in Kuwait with your retirement nest egg. NBD there's lots to do and see in Kuwait. It is a beautiful land. Upon your last flight home you may be pained to be out of reasons to return...) If this prospect is maybe just a touch more time consuming than you'd prefer, fear not. You can of course convert currency through the magic of the Inter-webs. Typically you have to have ‚Ç¨ or ¬£ for the conversion. Me personally, I prefer a good British pound to a Euro, so let's go with pounds. Once you get your USD British pounded, you'll then be ready for the big Ku D. You'll get charged commish twice tho so bear that in mind. It will still be less than your 80 flights to Kuwait, but you won't get the thrill of seeing Kuwait with your own two eyes 80 times. Convenience, or 80 majestic experiences? Life is full of choices. Fortunately you can also just buy Kuwaiti dinars on eBay. Seeing it's eBay there's absolutely no reason to assume these are counterfeit dinars and are most definitely real. For the autists who have taken any of this literally, I must inform you, do not do any of this. It's a shitcomment on a shitpost friends. This is not financial advice. I am not a cart."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"You buy 800k in Starbucks gift cards but in only $1 amounts each. That way Starbucks actually runs out of gift cards and then BAM you sit out front and sell them for $5 each. It's like printing your own money! Then every time Starbucks gets more gift cards in, you reinvest and buy those too. 

Probably would only work in a area with one or two Starbucks. 

*Not a financial advisor but this is a pure golden opportunity to be a Gift Card God. If you were to get audited, you just slide a couple gift cards across the table to the agent, untraceable bribe!"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I remember reading about a guy that would use credit cards to buy money orders and visa gift cards to pay off said cards for the cash back / point benefits. Ultimately ended up going to court and the judge favored the plaintiff so it seems like there is some sort of precedent for trying to dodge taxes by buying financial products like gift cards etc. the IRS will be watching

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Hmm should I long gold to hedge against inflation? No I think I should invest in gift cards and empty milk cartons.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"What if you buy a field, some seeds spread those seeds around, depending on the seed type the gains might be growing non stop"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great idea. Dollar is going to go down, so the cost of buying coffee/food at Starbucks is going to go up. But, if you buy using Gift Card, you will always be paying same prices in effect when gift card was sold. Essentially, making your gift cards valuable as fuck. You might have to pay capital gain taxes when you use your gift card, but that should be simple to calculate."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don‚Äôt do it. If you‚Äôre trying to invest in a way to make money, put it in commodities, or the Yuan. Find a short on the currency. If the dollar fails, the Starbucks cards will not be worth shit. Buy some if you choose, but 800k is not wise. 

Good luck."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,If inflation does occur the price of Starbucks will also be inflated
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,The gift cards are in US dollars so you are not protecting your purchasing power at all. Buy silver to hedge against inflation.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"you want to buy coupons for drinks not gift cards. You buying giftcards will be in dollars, if dollar collapses prices of drinks will go up and so ur money will be gone. You want coupons for drinks it will hold its value."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôd say split between timmies, walmart, amazon"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Starbucks gift cards are essentially booked as current liabilities on Starbucks' balance sheet. A short-term loan from you to the company until you redeem them for that $20 frap.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Hell Yes
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,you could invest in other currencies as well just saying

Also pro-tip: when reselling the gasoline it helps if you can blow fireballs outside of your stand."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Better idea. 55 gallon drums of gasoline. Fill now and become a door to door gasoline sales man
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,No no use the plastic gallon jugs. More safer.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You need to get it in those 35 gallon trash cans and start a delivery service
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You need to hire a guy to stand outside and blow some sweet fireballs to attract customers in

Starbucks gift cards offer nothing. What if they start charging annual / innactivity fees on their cards? What if one or more are lost / stolen? What if inflation rises and the econmy gets worse driving the demand for their ""premium coffee"" down? What about gift card exchange sites that sell said cards, ans nearly all other types for 80 cents on the dollar? I think your premise that it's a safe bay for storing wealth is quite flawed."

Now you can be a millionaire if you stuck with the cards."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Several years ago I bought a neatly boxed storage unit, and was quickly disappointed to learn I wound up with nearly three cubic yards of Beanie Babies. There was one box with some unique promotional bears and Princess bears that I put on eBay (one at a time) and they sold in a heartbeat. I sold the remaining lot for a few hundred dollars, about what I paid for it, to someone in the convenience store business. I remember him telling me, ""you have no idea how big the plush toy industry is,"" as he confidently told me he would get a few $ for each one. I'll bet he sat on them for a while, but made a profit in the end."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I currently have 5 medium-sized boxes full of Beanie Babies from the late 90s. Being this rich makes it really hard to hang out with the rest of the plebs.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"You think if beanie babies actually throttled supply so much that very few were actually available, they'd have appreciated to today?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I literally just bought a Princess Diana bear beanie baby for like $8 shipped on eBay. (Bought it for novelty factor) It‚Äôs amazing how much value that one has lost.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"From the hookers I've talked to, this is a dismally frequent experience for them.

""Yeah, I don't got your $500 per hour rate ... but I got a $50 Starbucks gift card. (And I *totally* promise it still has money on it.)"" And the people saying that keep expecting it to somehow work.

Also, people trying to pay via Paypal or something ... which means they'll immediately dispute/reverse the charge as soon as they're done.

Guys, if you're trying to hire a hooker, there is only one right way: CASH."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not a hooker, but seems safer than cash. Can be used for food and $8 caramel macchiatos"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"A hooker has asked me to pay her in Amazon gift cards before, I'm actually 100% serious"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I think you mean renting a hooker.  Buying a hooker cost much more.  I was wondering why Matt Gaetz had so many Starbucks gift cards.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Or playing blackjack
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I think my girlfriend would hook for starbucks gift cards. Its a whitegirl thing i just don‚Äôt understand
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,The money exchanged isn‚Äôt to buy the hooker; it‚Äôs for her to leave afterwards.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Better than cash!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,All I can think of is Idiocracy at this point

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Finally. Some actual financial advice.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Better yet. Just don't even do the taxes. Overcomplicate them so you're not worth auditing. As we know the bar is really really low these days.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sadly most accountants will only take a probability of how much that the $400k is unspent as annualized profit year after year... So like 5% of people don't spend their gift cards after 1 year so they'll count 5% as profit while 95% goes into a different bucket they typically don't report specifics on, then 10% after 2 years, 30% 3 years, ect... Unless it is spent then they can take the 88% profit on the coffee sold ü§£"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Op needs to convert the cards to coffee ASAP in order to hedge.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You are missing the most important part. He should be buying target gift cards and use them at the Starbucks located inside.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, you are not missing anything."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You are missing that it‚Äôs a shitpost not a real one
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You're missing that scared money don't make money
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs to say a $5 drink today will cost $7 in a few years (they‚Äôve gone up in price every year) Wouldn‚Äôt that be considered a 30% loss of value?

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's why OP needs to buy Euro currency Starbucks gift cards. Once the Dollar starts going down, he'll be getting ridiculous discounts on his banana lattes."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, they'll always be worth 800k worth of starbucks items, and so are a solid hedge against the dollar"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Why tf did i have to scroll so far to find this comment
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You are missing the point that a Starbucks gift card can be redeemed for coffee not dollars.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank u
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,God you are fucking retarded. Why would you even try to understand the OP. You belong
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dunno. I think you get like 10-20% extra rewards or something when you purchased a gift card through certain credit cards or something... but still, it's retarded."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You also have to spend it on coffee only
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just assumed the gift cards must be worth 1 drink, but i've never seen gift cards work that way lol."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"But when the pandemic is over, people are going to start going back to Starbucks, soooo...yeah...this totally checks out."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, none, then? Tax free? Huzzah!"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. So if the dollar goes down a 5$ drink will be $2 in the future with the dollar worth less (-3$ in value to be exact in this case) and thus your coffee buying power will have increased. Or you cAn convert it back into dollara that can buy other things.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Green ones if you‚Äôre in it for the long haul.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,There‚Äôs always money in the banana stand.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"But the internet is a series of tubes, won't that put it all over the internet?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Is there sales taxes on gift cards? If you pay sales taxes on the gift card purchase and then sales taxes again when ordering the caf√© mocha that you pay with said card are you not being double taxed?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy in a different state
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Gift cards are no longer allowed to have expiration dates or charge inactivity fees

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,No one here seen Billy Madison I guess lmao
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,No it's starbucks gift cards. You're breaking free of the american military dollar hegemony by doing this. And backing a large multinational corporation. Safe bet.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but that's **IF** Starbucks dollars depreciate at the same rate as USD. There's a nonzero chance that they won't

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You can in prison
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Of course you can! Everyone needs stamps!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Only at the EBDBBnB!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You can when we introduce stampcoin.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I miss that show :-[
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but you can mail three penis wine with stamps

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,There was this movie where a kid paid for a taxi with stamps he stole from his mother. Wish I could remember the name of it.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,They are legal tender if they have The Queen's Image
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Wtf am i supposed to do with these stamps then?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Might I suggest... Food stamps.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I sure could go for 100 tacos right about now...
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You can buy taco with food stamp
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Everytime I see a reference from this show I'm surprised because I'm the only one I know irl who has seen it.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone clearly hasn‚Äôt spent time behind bars.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"That can‚Äôt possibly work in the US. Postage rates are not allowed to increase more than the rate of inflation, so you can never use this strategy to get ahead on Forever Stamps."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,How much stuff do you mail?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,you bought STAMPS for 300?!!?! Let's discuss some bridge futures..
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I used to be a sub postmaster and every time the price of stamps increased I would buy $5000 worth and sell them 'under the counter'. Made small amount of profit but felt like an outlaw. Zero regrets.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe you should reassess your investment strategy.... If your best performing asset underperformed the market by that much then you're definitely doing something wrong.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"The price has never went down, so... yes definitely bullish"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I heard beanie babies were a great investment

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,What the fuck lol
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you pour it out of the barrels? If you did you can sell the barrels seperately and buy them back when the price drops
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Just siphon it into the gulf of mexico it's fine
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hold, oil coming back"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Reminds me of the old Steve Martin bit. ‚ÄúI bought cardboard when it was just $0.14 a ton. And now it‚Äôs up to $0.16 and I bought 3 tons of it. And I got a special deal where I only had to keep 2 tons of it at my house.‚Äù
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Legit interested if anyone on this sub took deliver of oil last year.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did the same. 100,000 barrels. I hid the oil in the sea down Greve Dezet beach. When I need some I'll pop back with a jug, a Jerry can and 4 foot of hosepipe."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You had me at swimming pool full of oil last April üòÇ shit was so cheap anyone who did this would be set

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Proof or ban
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait you can't swim in crude?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,ok but you got $35k for taking the oil and probably another 60k selling it back right?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"yep, just dump the gourds directly into the pool filled with oil. I‚Äôll deal with it later."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Why can't they still swim...
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Well there's your problem. Nobody said you had to remove the oil from the barrels.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you want more, I can help!"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôll count it

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Surprising how many people don't know gas should be stored in Styrofoam.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"At least in Texas, if the storage tank is below 1100 gallons and above ground, it isn't regulated.  And it's cheaper to have it delivered in bulk, so there are quite a few people who have them at home."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Hmm your right. I don‚Äôt want him to run afoul of the law. What if he buys 800k in condoms for when the pandemic is over and people get back to business. Supply and demand will make condom prices squirt to the moon
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"not exactly, it varies based on state and city in the US (I think in the UK it requires a license though), and only for very large tanks (most areas 1000+ gallons), and it's not a license but normally just calling the fire department for them to inspect and permit it.  It's pretty easy and cheap to do, they mostly just make sure it's a proper tank and far enough away from brush/houses."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy used car fuel tanks and fill them up.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Not to mention ... gasoline goes bad in long term storage.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"You also need a moonshine license, to make it because making diesel is eerily similar to making moonshine."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"There was a gas station near where I grew up that sold gas to ""members"" for 25c a gallon up until 2011. Back in the late 60s/early 70s the solicited investments to buy a shit ton of gas futures at <25c/gallon. They got a bunch of buyers, bought the futures and then spent the next 40 years selling gas to the original investors at obscenely cheap prices."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"It looks as though you may have spelled ""Chick-fil-A"" incorrectly. No worries, it happens to the best of us!"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy canadian stamps from america ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes you cAn.  Stamps are often sold at discounts on sites such as eBay.  When I was mailing lots of things via envelopes, I could routinely buy 50 cent stamps for 30 cents.  I have literally bought stamps at 60 percent value.  If someone were willing to buy and hold this could be profitable depending on their holding strategy.  I lucked out and bought stamps before the jump between 50 to 55 cents and we are due for another readjustment on first class stamps soon.  This strategy isn‚Äôt limited to first class forever stamps either, you can also buy higher value stamps but the greatest benefit will be in the first class forever stamps bc of the ‚Äúforever‚Äù value of the stamp.  I still have roughly one thousand stamps that I bought for 30 cents and will hold on to them until I need them or the value is worth it for me sale them."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,So it'd hedge against inflation then and you'd still come out ahead of the dollar.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs still better than OP‚Äôs idea. Those can‚Äôt go up at all.

As a Dutch person I'm pretty happy about that. Dutch history not all good. I think in the US and Europe around 95% know about tulip bubble though. Or at least they think they know it, as when you realize what exactly happened it wasn't as bubbly as people think."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Or seen one if the several huge pop culture movies that referenced the bubble
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Or just randomly know a few historically interesting facts. Like many people.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate the read, it was a good article."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"No doubt, If I don‚Äôt sell mine they will probably last me the rest of my life."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good question. I‚Äôll explain the process.  

Step 1:  identify the deal on eBay 
Step 2:  buy said deal (60% or less of current value)
Step 3:  receive said stamps and verify authenticity if you want to 
Step 4:  hold for future price appreciation if that is your strategy or sale them on the internet for profit 
Step 5:  rinse and repeat

Important note:  November/December is a good time to buy stamps if you do not want to hold them for a long time.  The reason being, this is the time of year the usps announces price increases of us postage that takes affect in January of the coming year.  This was especially true when forever postage jumped 5 cents in 2019."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I never sold them.  I used them for my business at that time.  I would go through a thousand or more stamps a month on the low end, so I needed cheap stamps because their cost seriously affected my bottoms line.  I also bought stamps for priority shipping but since that value fluctuates, it wasn‚Äôt as advantageous as forever stamps.   The stamps I have now are leftovers from them and I will hold on to them until the value goes up enough to incentivize me to sale them or until I die.  I‚Äôm fine with what I have because they have more than paid for themselves.  

My response earlier was to say that they can be treated as a commodity that can be bought and sold because I have bought them at steep discounts.  At 60 percent on the dollar that leaves plenty of margin to work with if you wanted to resell them.  

If you were looking for an outlet, people routinely buy them on eBay for at or near full value.  Craigslist works too but don‚Äôt ship to those buyers."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,So true.  Lol

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I gave away a binder full of holographic cards way back in the day at a garage sale for my parents. All variations of the original 150. Mostly the original release and a few fossil holographic cards. They were all of great quality as they were kept in good condition. So many good cards... kill me. Multiple Charizards.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I gave away my original set complete back then to a friends sister. Her brother was giving her shit she had no good Pokemon cards so I gave her all the Pokemon cards at the time. The dad almost cried telling me thank you. I never seen a kids eyes light up like that. I still think about it from time to time.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Better than when I threw my entire binder of first edition US sets and complete japanese sets into the trash. Multiple 1st edition shadowless Char's. My highschool girlfriend saw them and laughed. My 17 year old ego couldn't handle that. Looking back not much has changed.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,*To be fair* Dragon Ball and Pokemon cards didn't take off until 20 years later. Both of those sets were extremely low value for ages and I'm pretty sure the older Dragon Ball stuff is *still* worth only pennies. Current Pokemon is a much better investment if you care to invest in cardboard than the older stuff. You can hold onto it for as little as 18 months and make a profit.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,At least you didn't have to burn your cards because your mom joined a cult like church that believed pokemon were demons.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"damn.. those things were worth money!?? f\*k me.. after discovering p\*ssy and moving outta my parents house, my collection got trown away in the moveout with the parents not wanting to hold onto my shit anymore.. i had a shit ton of holos.. but alas, just another retarded ape sharing another retarded story.. whats that shit worth today?"

At that point I'm willing to pay full price for stamps for the convivence of walking into a a post office or grocery store and not having to search ebay, find a good deal, hope the stamps aren't counterfeit, take stamps to post office to see if they are counterfeit, keep them if they are real, if they are fake then you have to jump through the hoops of a making a counterfeit claim on ebay and hope the seller didn't just delete their account because they are selling counterfeit federal stamps(felony)."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"No doubt.  My post office told me that they will happily check to counterfeit stamps and it‚Äôs a service they provide to the people of the community.  The problem they have with them is when people try to use them.  I have been honest about buying them on the internet and they told me just to check for authenticity before use.  Your right, a lot of people do not know about checking first.  But with ebays customer policy, it is more than advantageous for me check and it‚Äôs an easy open and shut case for counterfeit stamps.  It certainly is a buyer beware situation."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was going to the post office anyway at that time so I wasn‚Äôt going out of my way.  I was going to be there anyway.  Also, if you were buying the volume of stamps I was then it just becomes part of doing business.  I had thousands of stamps, so to say I wasn‚Äôt saving money is a fallacy.  I saved thousands of dollars this way and I would do it again.  I‚Äôm just not interested in buying and selling things on the internet anymore because of the wayfair act.  If it hadn‚Äôt been foe that, I‚Äôd still be buying stamps in bulk.  There are some incredible deals if you are willing to do the work.  I routinely paid around 60 cents on the dollar for stamps, and if you extrapolate that out, it adds up over the long run.  I still have stamps that could very well last the rest of my life."

I love stretching a dollar and if it‚Äôs a cost I can reduce I will try.  I like the process so it‚Äôs not a burden to me.  I have done the same thing with gift cards also but stamps was something another user commented on so I wanted to share my insights in the subject.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"ETA:  And I just realized that this is likely a reference to Timothy McVey...I am so stoned.

I don't think so, but it was so long ago that I'm not sure what the last name was.  We were in the hood in Atlanta and this would have been the early 80s.

The younger brother's name was Jeremy, I know that, because I distinctly remember another kid telling a social worker who showed up in the neighborhood and asked about the burned kid: ""Oh him?  That's just Jeremy, he's a fuck up,"" and that line (and the look on the social workers face when she heard it) stuck with me for 40 years.  

There's a cruel pragmatism to hood living that I always appreciated and that sentence kind of encapsulated it."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm thinking I'm seeing this with my Magic: the Gathering cards.  Kept my old Alpha, Beta, Revised, and Arabian Nights. Got rid of my Unlimited, Fallen Empires, and newer.

Many of my cards are all used though, in the era before sleeves.  None of the super valuable cards. I think Chaos Orb or Cyclopean Tomb were my most valuable cards when I checked in Scrye 20-ish years ago.  Since then I'll check the prices of those two cards every few years, and they've certainly plateaued.

I remember an antiques show, where someone brought in a classic train set from the 50's, and the appraiser said that five or ten years before it would have been more valuable, but now the people who were nostalgic about them were moving into smaller houses and the market had collapsed.  Thing with M:tG and Pokemon cards is that new people are still coming into the hobby, so maybe they will at least hold value longer?"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly this is totally not a bad call to make. Cost basis of 18.9k, for 35 contracts you payed around 5.4 per. You're down but with the recent quarterly sales figures exceeding with S/X production at 0 and also Nio posting higher than expected production/delivery numbers in March with a 5 day production stop shows the demand is there to sustain/drive the YoY numbers. Not to mention the first 2-3 weeks trading periods of April are generally bullish, and tech might be coming out of this dip going into April this has big potential to print.

Still risky, and probably might want to pull if this trading week goes well. Using optionsprofitcalculator.com

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,He mistyped the strike price
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"So there are two possibilities-- either Tesla doubles it's share price in the next 6 weeks or it doesn't.

Since the movement of Tesla's stock price is an unknowable thing, let's conservatively estimate that there's a 50% chance of it happening and a 50% chance of it not happening.

If it doesn't happen, he loses $19,000.  But if it does happen, and Tesla hits $1300, then he'll make 1.57m.

Using this analysis, I estimate his play has an expected value of $775k.  And remember, this is just a conservative estimate-- Mama Cathy says Tesla's gonna go to $3,000 for sure, so really this thing has a 100% chance of making him $7m+."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"this has lots of time...and yes, it can print without ITM...i dont think it‚Äôs an outrageous bet. TSLA will in all likelihood break 700 next week"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I get that. But what kind of insane IV would you need to make this shit profitable by the end of next month?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Hope expiry is somewhere deep in 2023 lmao.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,As long as it is for next year it should be more than fine.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"When you straddle the strike price. Here's an example. If TSLA is at $660 right now, you get a $660 put and $660 call. Premiums are high so it would need to move more than $50 in either direction to make your money back. You cash out at 100% gain and you have 1 free contract if it moves in the other direction. Or, you can make 40% if it drops to $630 and another 40% if it hits $680. Different ways to play it. The idea is to find tickers like TSLA, SHOP or AMZN, all of which typically swing $30-$120 on an average day. Then, straddle those when you think it hits a midpoint."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,GME is the one I'm eyeing now. It's been moving between 180-210 for a little while. The issue is that the premiums are really high so it would need to move $50 in either directions to make 100% of your money back on 1 contract and get a free contract in the other direction. I just don't see it moving that much right now so it's probably not a good time to get in.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Serious answer though, I'm not big on fabless semi companies, and at current valuations Himax is a little pricey, even for a semi.

[Full disclosure, I sold my TSM at $124, and all I've got left in it at the moment is some call spreads](https://imgur.com/a/1NTT3Ag)

I much prefer pure play foundry's, integrated companies, or front-end equipment makers.  That means TSM, INTC, MU, TSEM, Samsung, and TXN as your semi stocks, ASML, AMAT, KLAC, LRCX as your front end capital guys.  I also like AMKR and ICHR, even though they aren't technically on the front end side of things, and maybe 3-6 months from now I'll perk up on companies like KLIC.

I'm not big on HIMAX's short term prospects, because I think the semi shortage will hurt them as much as help them, and I'm not big on their long-term prospects because I think it's only a matter of time before a bigger fabless company acquires one of Himax's direct competitors."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your title literally says ""Buy"" in it?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"But that isn't really an EV thing.  You can have a touchscreen display in any car.

Also, this company is mainly about tablets, smartphones, that sort of stuff, right?  And the small chunk of revenue they get from touchscreens for cars is mainly as a supplier to Chinese companies, right?  So doesn't all that go tits up if we go trade war two, electric boogaloo?

HIMX is not an EV play.  Not even close.  You want to do automotive chips, you want ON, IFNNY, NXPI, those sort of guys.  TXN would be my play in that space, though personally I'm waiting for their earnings report on the 20th before I make a move."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,But did I persuade? Lol
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,For 2020 4th quarter they put main focus on the EV car screen which they say they will be the main revenue income. For next quarter
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Uh no, not even close."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Clearly not persuaded anyone lol
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,In what Q4 report did they say their main source of revenue would be displays for electric vehicles?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"[Here's their Q4 report.](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HIMAX_4Q20_Earnings_PR_Final.pdf)

Net revenue of 275.8m.  Top contributors:

* Smartphones: 66.6m
* Tablets:  67.4m
* Automotive:  37.5m

Their Q1 guidance does not say that automotive is suddenly going to double in size and become their largest revenue source.

This is a company that mainly sells phone screens and tablet screens, and *sometimes* sells screens for luxury cars-- not necessarily electric vehicles.  You can build an EV without any of the things that HIMX makes.  And its only connection to ""New Energy Vehicles"" as they call it is an unrevealed Chinese company, which means that likely goes to shit if China and the U.S. go hard in the paint over semiconductor trade.

If you want to invest in automotive semis, go with a company who actually makes most of its money from selling automotive semis.  Right now you've bought a company that makes touchscreens for tablet computers."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Narrator: They did not.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets," ‚ÄúAutomotive driver ICs accounted for more than 13% of total revenues. During 2021, we expect to further our automotive display driver IC market share from the current level of more than 30%‚Äù

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Also remember the market cap is only 2.24b with this high profit the SP should be over 13 it‚Äôs very undervalued
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"With electric vehicles quickly emerging as the ‚Äúnext big thing‚Äù, the car market is embracing new display technologies and shifting towards larger, more sophisticated and higher performing displays like never before. Already the market leader in automotive display driver business, Himax foresees further market share gains in the coming years in this fast-growing market. The Company continues to sustain its competitive position with a comprehensive product offering for advanced new features such as TDDI for in-cell touch, local dimming, cascade-topology connection, P2P high-speed interface bridging functions, and LTDI for larger in-cell display. As a reminder, Himax launched the world‚Äôs first TDDI design for automotive displays technology which first started shipping in 2019 with meaningful volume anticipated starting 2021. As EV grows in popularity and autonomous driving develops, Himax‚Äôs technological prowess continues to separate it from peers for the next generation display for automotive.


From the report u sent, just read it very potential future"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're misreading it.  It's clearer if you read on.

From that same earnings call:

> As for AMOLED IC sales, on the other hand, we expect a sequential decline in the first quarter due to the capacity shortage as we are unable to meet all the demands.

This is the display they're going to be selling for their partnership with yet-unnamed ""New Energy Vehicle"" company in China.

> Limited by large scale supply shortages, our automotive ICs segment is expected to deliver a mid-teens sequential increase in the first quarter

This is their statement on automotive sales as a whole.  Compare that language to what they say about notebooks:

> For notebook IC segment, we anticipate another impressive quarter of high growth in Q1, with continuation from previous quarters, increasing substantially from the previous quarter due to the expansion of strong demand derived from persisting remote working and e-learning.

How can their automotive revenue become their main source of revenue when it's only about 1/10th of their revenue now, and is expected to grow more slowly than most of its other revenue sources?

Also, if you're willing to fool yourself into thinking that HIMX is an EV company, then why not fool yourself into think SYNA is an EV company?  They've had a partnership with a Chinese EV company for almost 5 years now, and their fundamentals are better to boot."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I brought up a list of companies and clicked on one near the top.

[AAWW.](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAWW)  They fly cargo planes.  Last year, they made 7.5x more profit than HIMX.  Their market cap is 1.74b.

If all we're looking at is profits, which company is more undervalued?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"From the same earnings call you linked:

> Our IFRS profit for the year was $47.1 million

Certainly this is better than last year, when they lost $13.6m.  And that's reflected in the share price too, they're up a lot from last year.  But what do you think should be the market cap of a company that makes $47m a year?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You say they are the leader in automotive displays.  Name the car companies they provide displays for.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I made 200k on himx already when it rip from 4$ to 17$
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"You'd have made more money betting on AAWW.  Either way, post proof or get lost."

This was half way at 14.95 I held till 17$"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"""I sold at the exact peak, trust me.""  Sure.

And to think, you did all this before they ever sold a single display to a single EV company.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just got in touch with my fidelity representatives.  In case you want to know,  if your stonk type says ""margin"" they are possibly lending your shares out to shorters. I did purchase them as type cash,  but they automatically switch to margin if you don't have this feature turned off.  The only way to fix is to call them and ask that your stonks stay ""type cash"" I did this for all of my stonks.

Edit: someone asked a good question to follow up on this,  so posting answer here:
""I'll try to help.  I am using the phone app and not familiar with the PC version.  After logging in and selecting ""positions"", look up your individual stocks separately.  Under the"" quote,  buy more, sell"" you will see the change in value, cost basis, price,  current value,  currency,  then finally ""type"". If this type says ""margin"" your shares are able to be lent out.  There is no way for you to change this yourself,  and it happens automatically for us.  You have to call fidelity at 1800 fidelity - and ask them to change to ""type cash"" this forces them to hold your shares."""

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah outstanding shares much less then the total owned haha retail owns almost 25% of public float.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"> If your company has registered a class of its equity securities under the Exchange Act, shareholders who acquire more than 5% of the outstanding shares of that class must file beneficial owner reports on Schedule 13D or 13G until their holdings drop below 5%

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just keep in mind that sometimes the ownership will say Blackrock **and** Blackrock Investment Management which can throw off the numbers in some reports.

*LET ME CORRECT MYSELF*
Official explanation for this (not GME specific) is as follows:

""Institutional ownership can eventually exceed 100 percent of float, which means that, in addition to all the available shares, institutions have also bought up all the borrowed shares from short-sellers who are betting that the stock will decline."""
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Reports can lag. When you search ownership a lot of times the sell order isn‚Äôt made public for 45ish days, but people like to post the buy orders pretty immediately.

But this is also the stock market, so there also probably are just more shares owned than shares that exist"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,My definition of accounting: maturation with numbers
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"13-F is filed quarterly so if firm A has sold their shares to Firm B and Firm B has subsequently filed their 13-F but Firm A hasn‚Äôt, then those numbers can add up to >100%"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Just a smooth brain but isn‚Äôt there a public float that is separate from the total float?  Eg insiders may have original shares not part of the initial offerings.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Can't wait! üòÇüöÄ
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,? Imagine being a GME executive and even suggesting a shares recall in the current situation
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,We need an updated Bloomberg view as of 4/1 or later
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Senvest sold in January.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, i think sideway is good news as it's saving up to boosst up for massive second wave based on Elliot Wave theory! We just passed first wave! üöÄüôå"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone mentioned that he might not be. But he can reconstruct the company as one of the largest shareholders.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Patience, let them throw more money at this. 
My floor increases the longer this gets stretched."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Ya!!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cohen can‚Äôt recall. This whole ‚Äúrecall‚Äù thing is not going to force a short squeeze. We need a margin call, a share recall for a shareholder meeting probably won‚Äôt get the job done, last year blackrock didn‚Äôt even recall their shares for it."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Cohen and Blackrock together
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Ya that‚Äôs not how that works Lmaoo

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"It'll take several quarterly reports for a large scale selloff. They can keep the price down if they exit on the way up block by block, but it becomes visible in the reports."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here i am with my 10 shares on degiro <3  
Edit: its all in, eurpoor :("
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, I don't think that wouldn't happen anytime soon as we are just passing 1st wave based on Elliot Theory. 2nd wave will be alot higher. Also there are still lots of catalysts such as share recalls, RC becoming CEO offically and strict rules for short selling and margin calls."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Retail ownership is a crazy number as well. We can see dips along the way as institutional holders sell a portion of their holding. Around 1.9 million eToro users hold GME. If you average that to be 15 shares per account, you have 28.5 million shares with one broker alone. Degiro (another EU broker) has said GameStop has been their most purchased share for the past 3 months in the whole EU (they break it down per country and 95% were GameStop). This is just 2 brokers in the EU! Imagine how many shares US, EU and Asia retail investors own combined! They are fucked simply put"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,5k would be an increase of more than 2500%. You would be extremely lucky
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"That is exactly what is going to happen. Institutions will dump before they let your sell orders be processed. Most bagholders will be retail using shit brokers.because after squeeze is over, nobody will want those shares"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Some of us probably bought stock IOU, which is fake share from stock brokerage and the brokerages sell it to hedgies. Eventually, they will have to cover them."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Hedge funds were counterfeiting more shares
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Isnt that the same day Roaring Kitty has to exercise his options by? April 16?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"If that's true, that's good to know."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Lvl 70 Troll Warrior also Jacked!!!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,That's Righttt!! There is no point buying shares if he firmly believes about the company and make changes for better!!üíéüöÄ

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Hoping that is true!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha is it? üòÇ just an ape who happen to hold GME and some wrinkles üòÖ
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Your account is 66 days old
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, its not from 12/31. Ive been checking this site and I saw changes this month. I believe if squeeze doesn't happen, we will still have catalysts such as share recalls and some strict rules for shortsellers that can push the stock up. Based on Elliot theory, we just passed 1st wave and 2nd wave is going to be massive. I do think this will go throughout April to June at least."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,The fact that this dude determined that Ryan Cohen will be CEO because he owns more shares than Sherman and got thousands of upvotes for this insight...
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs definitely not from 12/31 lol. Anyone following any of this has watched the steady increase of RC‚Äôs shares since December.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Didn't realize Elon, Buffet, or Bezos phoned it in as chair of the board after the first billion. 

Maybe RC is bored and wants the challenge of building another business again?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's hard to define price at this point. There are plenty of more catalysts, such as share recall, and possible new ceo. After 2nd congress meeting about GME and shortsellers, looks like there are strict rules have been submitted and once the rules apply, there could be another big chance for stock to go up."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"They're (indirectly) required to buy back the shares at one point. As they have to pay daily an interest on the borrowed shares. --> and higher share price, also means: higher interest rates for them!"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought about that same as well what if hedgies who shorted GME finds ways not to cover the shares. From hearing the second congress meeting about GameStop and discussing about shortselling, it sounds like the government is making strict rules against it and some of strict rules have been made and applied. Might take a few days to a week. Also There was a news to public that hedgies won't be able to get bailed out this time like how they got saved in 2008 financial crisis. More of these will corner the hedgies and bleed which eventually make them cover the shorts."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just checked and i am afraid to say although it's heavily stocked, situation is very different. UWMC stock has 70% ownership by general public and 10% institutions. You need more institution buyer to push up the stock price. Therefore, UWMC stock won't be like GME."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,CEO
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Current CEO
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Current CEO
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Let's go!! üöÄüíéüôå
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Someone mentioned about that. As long as he is a board member, I am happy about whatver decision he makes."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Fidelity sold
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I believe it's due to synthetic shares."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,How
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,My schwab acct says institutional ownership is 106%
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,God/science forbid we have TOO much transparency it causes confusion for the Joe n Jane apes.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,If it looks like S Q U E E Z E it must be squeeze.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I think the wrinkle brains have proven your statement isn't accurate. Blackrock and Blackrock Investment Management are two separate entities and they each have the reported holdings of GME. Same goes for the multiple Fidelity holdings. Add it all up and don't assume the smaller number here.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Now look that up regarding aapl should be same right? Lol its not

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I read this as masturbation with numbers. Must have missed that episode of Sesame Street as a kid.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I assume that's the case as well. Many of those numbers were last reported on 31/12/2020, but for some reason so many people just refuse to even consider the posibility that the institutions that last reported increased ownership as of January or February bought those shares from instututions who last reported their ownership half a year ago."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,He owns 102nd most shares
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hate to be that guy but can you please use institutional ownership, not institution"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I want my lambo before the summer ends tho
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only the individual (entity) who owns particular shares can recall them (and only if they are lent out)   

There is no such thing a single mass recall order, e.g. the company cannot recall all shares."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also, WHY does a company recall shares in general, what is the economics behind it?

Google search was not as helpful"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Gme can not order share recall because they do not own the shares. Atm only Blackrock (largest impact) can probably in coordination with RC
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,The company issues the recall. If you‚Äôre a shareholder and want to vote in the future of the company than you would recall your lent share to vote. You cannot vote if your share is being borrowed for shorting.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,RC when he is CEO
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't understand why this wouldn't benefit GME?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,How is that not a good idea for them?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Your comment makes no sense to me. Why wouldn't they ask for a share recall? They did the same last April and the stock price more than doubled.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,It doesn‚Äôt matter if you get a ‚ÄúBloomberg‚Äù update. I have a Bloomberg terminal. The filings are mostly going to be from 12/31 as institutions only have to file 45 days after the end of every quarter.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Last year Blackrock didn‚Äôt recall their shares, but all the people that did caused the stock price to jump from around $2 to $11 - $12. Imagine if Blackrock had done so as well. And they might this time seeing as Ryan Cohen is their boy. They‚Äôll want to see him elected to CEO."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is there a share requirement to have voting rights on the board? I imagine if there is, since RC ‚Äúbought into‚Äù the company that he would HODL. Anyone know?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"15 shares per person is overestimating it by a lot. If it was 1 share per person, it's still a lot - 4% of the free float, on a single broker. And yeah even so, when looking at institutional investors, other HFs, retails, it has to be a bomb waiting to explode."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Calls on retail, puts on citadel hedges.
This is the Way üöÄü¶ç"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Not compared to 1 milly.. üöÄüöÄüöÄ
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shares used to be 3.59 in September 2020 and went up to 483.00 January 2021. 

That was an increase of 13354.04%. 

Your 2500% increase is a drop in the bucket in comparison. This stock is volatile and amazing. Anyone who think 45 million a share isn‚Äôt a reality is probably currently on Peyote."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"The year is 2047, GME hit 4,000 years ago then dropped to 115, no one can remember when.  Yet in WSB many keep saying 
‚ÄúThe squeeze has not squoze ‚Äú and 1 million is the floor"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I meant shareholder meeting. It's set for June 11 or 12. So the 16th of April is soonest they could issue a statement to count shares. SEC filing mentioned the heavy shorts could cause squeeze. RC and Board might be bluffing, hopefully  not. But I'm guessing based on this we will see price increase in next 10 days. Maybe big drop first, depending on Hedgies strategy. But they would be dumb to not straddle both sides. Need a whale..."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude. You don‚Äôt understand how filings work. Some mutual funds and ETFs file monthly. Everything else is quarterly. It‚Äôs old. 

New filings will be out 5/15. 

No clue about Elliot wave theory that‚Äôs a completely different issue."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"üòÇ ‚Äúanyone following this‚Äù Jesus you‚Äôre literally just making shit up. I said most of the filings were from 12/31. Ryan Cohen last filed an update 1/10 https://whalewisdom.com/stock/gme 
He has owned 9M shares since Dec 17, 2020. He has not added a share since then. 

https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/89e3e0c1-e050-4511-887d-d1f9321703f8"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Share recall - Do you not already think the shorts have covered the first and second squeeze? The first squeeze - January - there were 500 million volume being exchanged in the span of 2 days. Surely the shorts covered then. When we think about if shorts have covered or not... there are so many shorts. People mainly think its the shorts from the beginning.. but its not.. its new shorts who have entered. When GME was at an ATH in Janauary new shorts piled in. Thats when the second squeeze in March happened. 

&#x200B;

CEO - Ryan Cohen tweets and announcement as the strategic leader of the transformation board was the catalyst for the second squeeze (the one in late Feb/Early March). 

&#x200B;

Gamestop was a $5 stock last year. With Ryan Cohen at helm, the stock price is at $200. 

&#x200B;

Shorts have covered and Ryan Cohen is priced in is my thesis. That's not to say I am right but some people on here are completely convinced of this stock exploding to the thousands. They have flawed arguments for this like you do. It's not 100%, hell it's not even 50% imo."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Shares get recalled when there are some corporate actions like a special dividend.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs about ensuring that when it comes time to vote on company decisions there are no fake votes (shares).
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Also to help rein in the volatility. People running the company want to reap stock benefits too and a volatile market makes it questionable to sell stock
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would assume that RC didn't let his shares get lent out in the first place, thus he can't ""recall"" them."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Any of them can request a recall for the shares they manage. If each real share is rehypothicated multiple times then any of the mutual funds recalling would be explosive.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn't Fidelity over Blackrock?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,It would and it will benefit them and us their investors. Only people it will hurt will be hedgies betting on their bankruptcy.

The two things have nothing to do with each other.

If a dividend is declared (special or not) short sellers are required to pay the person they borrowed the shares from, but the borrowed shares DO NOT get recalled."

You could say the same for WSB - ""wow 10 million subs, if each had only 5 shares, we'd own the entire float!"" - Which is obviously far from truth, as would be the fact that eToro users hold 15 shares average and own 60% of the float on their own. You're being absurd.

We're on the same side, I want and do think squeeze here will happen - but we don't have to make up unrealistic numbers to believe it - as I said, it's still more than enough if average was only 1 share."

The short borrow rate in GME is very low anyway so the extra income is pretty insignificant in this case.

It would be interesting to know the answer though."

Look it may seem unrealistic to you, but I work in this field, and trust me when I say 15 shares is a CONSERVATIVE number. Not being condescending but thinking 1 share per user is too high is severely underestimating the number of shares held and pretty much stupid"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I think that would be called manipulation
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,That's what the share recall is for. It forces the people who sold you the short shares to buy the real shares and give them to you so you can participate in the vote.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, if your shares were lent out then you don't get to vote that shares - the person who bought your shares (from the short seller) gets to vote them.  

Shares can be borrowed, sold short, borrowed again, sold short again, etc so a single share could be ""owned"" by several people but only the final owner of record gets to vote."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,If your shares are leant out I'm pretty sure you still get to vote. If you own a house and rent it out .. you still pay taxes on it.  Not 100% certain but not all things on Reddit are accurate :) Could you imagine the mayhem if an important vote came up on any company and all the short shares had to be called in ... You think the market is volatile now.. That should be chite show.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You get paid the interest to lend out the shares.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity requires level 3 options for share lending and it becomes an option in your interface you have to apply and sign a form for, if you don't have a high enough option level they don't lend. (they pay you the lending fees if you have it available)"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dividends have to be paid by people holding short positions, which encourages them to cover, which raises the price. Most decreases associated with dividends are proportional to the dividend itself"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Dividends take money out of the short-sellers.  We DO want that.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"1. Dividend tendies

2. Buy the dip 4head

3. Print more tendies"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"All else equal, yes. We saw what the dividend did for RKT though. Didn't hold those gains but they shot up 45$ overnight."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Dividends will not decrease the stock price. In fact it becomes the catalyst for the squeeze because shorters have to start covering if they don‚Äôt want to pay the dividend out to each share they have shorted.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not for long... DTCC rule change incoming so that the share stays with original owner until transaction is fully complete and short is covered. Borrows/options can't be used to reset FTDs, or as collateral.

Archegos really scared someone methinks."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You are wrong. Look it up. Your analogy doesn‚Äôt apply. The person who holds the shirt gets to vote unless you recall your shares.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Imagine if you own 49% of shares of a company and another guy owns 51%. If what you said is true, you could loan out all your shares to someone with the condition that he vote with you. So you get to vote with your 49% and the guy you lent your shares too also get to vote with your 49% again.. lol"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Which is incredibly useful for large asset managers that run index funds. They are required to hold every company in the index so their point of view on their holdings is neutral. Lending those out means more money.

Take SPY, for example, $360B market cap. Loan out 10% of that at 2% and that‚Äôs an extra $720M per year for basically doing nothing."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs not true for a platforms plenty of places lend them out without telling you or giving you a cut
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Dividends also have to be paid by the company itself for all of the outstanding shares.   GME doesn't have money to throw away - this would not be good for the company.

I've been trying for a few days to get a discussion on what you're touching upon here. Do you have any thoughts on what that might be? Or just musing like the rest of us. Either we own the float or we don't. If we do we don't care when institutions exit. But if we don't, then we need to know what their goals are. A ""modest"" sum but not enough to introduce systemic instability? Well where the hell is that haha. $5000, $10,000?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but I think retail also has over 100%. If the DD is correct and SI is 300+%( which I think is a conservative estimate) Even assuming that every single institution will sell every single share, shorts will still have to buy retail shares to cover.

They aren‚Äôt rented for the purpose of selling to rebuy and return later but that is mostly due to the fact that they are physical assets with uniqueness. Shares are not unique. There is no difference between owning shares 1-100 vs shares 101-200.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"You only get a proxy to vote your shares if you have shares to vote in your account (not the same as if you own shares)

Meaning if you own shares but they are lent out then you will not receive the proxy to vote them.   These proxies are all numbered, its not like you can randomly submit a ""vote"" - they know who actually has possession of each share."

We're all hodlers here bud, but some are a little more realistic with our expectations. If you're honestly planning to hold your shares to 5k+, you'll be left holding the bags. Just a heads up.

2021-04-04 09:30:29,wallstreetbets,"[$BB] The emerging tech cold war between the US and China could be another growth catalyst for Blackberry With President Biden viewing China as ""[steep steep competition](https://youtu.be/7M-FIX39udk)"", the decoupling of US-China tech supply chain is inevitable. Both China and the US will start to reduce their own critical industries' reliance on components from the other side, so that they can avoid being held hostage by the other side using these supply chain choke points as geopolitical bargaining stakes (see how the ban of [Qualcomm chips](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/16/17242664/us-uk-china-smartphone-zte-security-risk-sanctions) and [Google Android OS](https://www.techradar.com/news/huawei-ban) disrupted ZTE and Huawei's global smartphone businesses respectively). This is evidenced by China's ""[Made in China 2025 ](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/made-china-2025-threat-global-trade)"" plan and the US's ongoing [plan](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/news/efforts-to-bring-chip-manufacturing-to-us-soil-will-continue-in-2021/) to bring chip manufacturing back to US soil.

Despite the growing anti-globalization trend in critical supply chains, there is still a desire for US automotive companies to penetrate the Chinese market and also a similar desire for Chinese automakers to expand beyond their domestic market into global markets. 

For emerging technologies like connected and autonomous vehicles, there will still be a need for a standardized vehicle base operating system (hypervisor) and data abstraction layer for future software-defined vehicles in order for a software and app ecosystem to flourish across different vehicle makes from various automakers. A standard vehicle base os is also crucial in ensuring that these vehicles remain interoperable across different countries with different legal safety requirements, cloud services, V2X infrastructure and media apps ecosystems, without requiring changes to their physical hardware when scaling across different markets.

It is unlikely that this standard interoperability layer will come from the US or China due to their reluctance to incorporate such a critical component from the other side in their emerging tech products due to geopolitical and security concerns. Being a Canadian company, Blackberry has the best chance at global dominance with their [QNX hypervisor](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mf3r7c/qnx_hypervisor_will_be_in_all_future_connected/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [IVY data platform](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mf2t5a/blackberry_qnx_ivy_might_be_the_next_android/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share).

If you listen to this [discussion](https://youtu.be/nRwdDnrc7qI), you will understand all these talks are not mere hype, but actual plans to be executed. John Wall, SVP of Blackberry Technology Solutions, also mentioned that they will likely partner with a major Chinese cloud provider (Alibaba cloud, Huawei cloud, Tencent cloud, Baidu AI cloud etc.) very soon, similar to the Blackberry-AWS IVY partnership. This shows how well-positioned Blackberry is at being the interoperability layer for connected and autonomous vehicles in a world where there is increasing decoupling between the US and China tech ecosystems.

Edit:

I see some complaints that my viewpoint is not substantiated enough, so here's some elaboration:

The US-China decoupling will only happen for intermediate goods (components that are used in the production of final goods that will be purchased by end consumers). For example, instead of using the US's Android OS, Huawei phones are now using their own HongMeng OS. Supply chain decoupling does not imply the ban of final goods from China (Huawei phones) in the US. You can still [buy](https://www.cnet.com/google-amp/news/despite-ban-you-can-still-buy-huawei-phones-in-the-us-heres-how/) Huawei phones in the US, just that not many people would want to buy them due to the lack of Google Mobile Services and Google Play store for these Huawei phones (cannot download apps easily). This affects Huawei's sale in the US.

Now for connected and autonomous vehicles which does not yet have any dominant app ecosystems like Android or iOS yet. This time, with the Chinese having the capability to influence the growth of an emerging tech sector, do you think the Chinese will support an American OS + platform + app ecosystem and risk getting banned again and losing their global sales?

Of course, China can build their own OS + platform + app ecosystem but it is unlikely to gain traction beyond their domestic market because they lack the deep technical capability/maturity (HongMeng OS turned out to be just an Android clone) or the influence to convince app developers outside China to develop apps for them. 

I think you might have underestimated the importance of standards and abstractions in the tech industry.
>The world runs windows on AMD and Intel

This only works precisely because both AMD and Intel chips use the x86-64 Instruction Set Architecture, where programs are compiled to the same assembly code which is interoperable across Intel and AMD chips. There is a reason you cannot run a desktop software on an Android smartphone with a Qualcomm chip because smartphones use the ARM architecture. Again, in the smartphone world, Android can run on Qualcomm Snapdragon, Huawei's Kirin, Samsung's Exynos chips, precisely because all these chips use the ARM Instruction Set Architecture. (ARM was last valued to be $40 billion btw)

Now, such interoperability layer (analogous to x86-64 for desktop CPUs and ARM for smartphone CPUs) has not existed  for the connected and autonomous vehicle yet. My main focus in this article is to put forward my view that this interoperability layer is unlikely to come from any American or Chinese companies because each of them will not accept any proposed standards from the other side. It has to come from a third party (not necessarily Canada, can be any other countries). But ruling out Chinese and American tech companies, Blackberry is the only frontrunner left capable of driving this industry standard forward.

BUT for every EV sold by  ANY manufacturer worldwide - what will be VERY USEFUL will  be a range of standardized interchangeable batteries.

In everything from trucks to flashlights we HAVE standardized batteries, right now, we take it totally for granted -  and not many folk really check the hell who makes them or why they are ""standard"" as long as they FIT, right? The rest is just local branding,

But BB don't do batteries.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the critique. I was trying to explain all these in laymen terms without going into the technical details, but I guess some parts were not clear enough. But since you asked, I might as well elaborate more here.

The US-China decoupling will only happen for intermediate goods (components that are used in the production of final goods that will be purchased by end consumers). For example, instead of using the US's Android OS, Huawei phones are now using their own HongMeng OS. Supply chain decoupling does not imply the ban of final goods from China (Huawei phones) in the US. You can still [buy](https://www.cnet.com/google-amp/news/despite-ban-you-can-still-buy-huawei-phones-in-the-us-heres-how/) Huawei phones in the US, just that not many people would want to buy them due to the lack of Google Mobile Services and Google Play store for these Huawei phones (cannot download apps easily). This affects Huawei's sale in the US.

Now for connected and autonomous vehicles which does not yet have any dominant app ecosystems like Android or iOS yet. This time, with the Chinese having the capability to influence the growth of an emerging tech sector, do you think the Chinese will support an American OS + platform + app ecosystem and risk getting banned again and losing their global sales?

Of course, China can build their own OS + platform + app ecosystem but it is unlikely to gain traction beyond their domestic market because they lack the deep technical capability/maturity (HongMeng OS turned out to be just an Android clone) or the influence to convince app developers outside China to develop apps for them. 

I think you might have underestimated the importance of standards and abstractions in the tech industry.
>The world runs windows on AMD and Intel

This only works precisely because both AMD and Intel chips use the x86-64 Instruction Set Architecture, where programs are compiled to the same assembly code which is interoperable across Intel and AMD chips. There is a reason you cannot run a desktop software on an Android smartphone with a Qualcomm chip because smartphones use the ARM architecture. Again, in the smartphone world, Android can run on Qualcomm Snapdragon, Huawei's Kirin, Samsung's Exynos chips, precisely because all these chips use the ARM Instruction Set Architecture. (ARM was last valued to be $40 billion btw)

Now, such interoperability layer (analogous to x86-64 for desktop CPUs and ARM for smartphone CPUs) has not existed  for the connected and autonomous vehicle yet.

‚ÄúWas Today the End of a Downtrend for $BB?

**TLDR;** $BB bounced off of a (personally) suspicious price today and it can *possibly* only go up from here üöÄ

Keep in mind that I, like you, am not here to give financial advice but I'll sure as hell share my findings and give my opinion.

Looking at the monthly chart, I think it looks like $BB is in a good spot to try and reach back to where it opened in March. Looking back at December we can see that it opened at $8.36

Today was the last day of the month, and the lowest share price for both March and today is $8.36. Decent bounce today too, never really went that low again. Like I said, $8.36 is also where December opened at!

Now I have no idea what this means... lol. But I believe it's the bounce us $BB holders are looking for. What do you think?

Let's look at some article Motley Fool posted today. 

https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/31/why-blackberry-stock-plunged-today/

Basically, it just says they've been plummeting because of deferred sales. ""...negotiations led BlackBerry to delay sales activities that could have resulted in higher licensing revenue during the quarter.""

**Keyword: delay.** They're still going to go on baby! I believe next quarter should be very good because of this and come on.. we all know that when Motley Fool publishes bad news for a company it's actually good news. Very possible that it's only up from here for $BB. 

One thing I'd like to discuss is why the media decides to mention $GME and $AMC when making articles about $BB. What's the meta play there?‚Äù

They wouldn't all grab QNX purely for the sake of QNX - it would be to leverage the capabilities of IVY, instead of designing their own tools.

Autonomous vehicles also have a high potential for damage if compromised. So having your data for said self-driving program pulled by a company that specializes in cybersecurity, and then running your program on an OS developed by the same cybersecurity company is a great way to keep your vehicles secured without investing in developing all of this from scratch."

You can‚Äôt find safer more lucrative investments from such a substantial change to trade that don‚Äôt rely on a series of other metrics to come into play? 

What if the decoupling escalates into China refusing or sanctioning trade with USMCA countries? Whoops. Guess BB might be in a tough spot. Every bit as likely to occur.

US and China tech companies are ruled out...

Another global level factor that has yet to affect a monopoly for one company in any other industry in the past. Not impossible, but why would BB make the most money from this?

ARM worth 40B? BB was worth 80B. If that metric mattered, it would justify BB trying to regain dominance in smartphones not try to be the ARM of autonomous vehicles.

If you believe that software-defined vehicles (cars connected to the internet with an ecosystem of apps and services that share vehicle data with the cloud) is the next big thing in the next 5 years, Blackberry is definitely a must-have stock. There's a reason why 23 out of 25 top EV makers, Baidu and AWS chose Blackberry to partner with. Blackberry really has a huge technical moat in the vehicle RTOS and hypervisor space, especially where safety and security are huge concerns. If not, tech giants like Baidu and AWS would have just built their own QNX and keep all the revenue instead.

I see an imminent industry upheaval in the automotive market very soon where there will be consolidations, mergers and acquisitions, and new entrants growing into dominant players. This is of the same magnitude of what happened to the smartphone industry where iOS and Android took over the world from Nokia, Sony Ericsson and Blackberry. This shift created a whole new apps industry, thanks largely to standard platforms like iOS and Android where apps developed for a phone can work seamlessly on another phone from another brand. The same will happen for automobiles and there's a lot of money to be made in this new industry (this is like smartphones' 2007  for the automotive industry). 

Blackberry is well-positioned to be the next Android, especially when the next globally standardized platform is unlikely to come from the US or China."

The U.S. is a hard no right now, I think, given the tension in the U.S. - China relationships. The EU seems equally unlikely. Other parts of SE Asia are possible I suppose, but Asia is pretty competitive overall right now. Africa and India aren't developed enough yet to be buying EVs en masse. South America isn't either.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"China's domestic market is MASSIVE. The other place in was thinking of was Europe. But honestly, I'm a believer based solely on the domestic market."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Their domestic market is definitely big enough by itself. Do you have any sense of how NIO is regarded by the target market? Is it sort of like Tesla is looked at in the U.S.?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"From everything I've looked at, my read is that they're well in the lead in the China EV market but they're still early. They're in production but at very low numbers. Despite the CCP's efforts, American luxury products still have cache with the upper class in China, and Tesla seems to be loved over there. I'd put them a solid second behind Tesla, but a safer bet in that market over the long term due to political issues that could flare up. I really like the stock at current prices but wouldn't buy it at peak hype."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've really wanted to take a stab at NIO or Tesla or something even a bit riskier but I'm still a bit hesitant to board the EV train because of the fundamental realities of the physics of energy use. We've still got a 20th century infrastructure with our 150000+ mile highway network and our coal and fossil fuel burning energy grid (and frankly, the problem goes even deeper - the various economic and political ways of life that people at this time aspire to are still retrogressive in this sense; witness the failure of projects like Arcosanti and others) just seems to have intractable inertia.

The question is whether the political momentum behind EV and green energy in general has finally swung the pendulum definitively away from ICE and such. It feels to me like that battle is still being fought, which is why I hesitate. EVs still feel like a luxury toy for the idle upper classes, rather than a transformative spearhead. I could be wrong."

This isn't new.  I've looked up plenty of people in the past.



They were called ............ Phone. books."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Regardless it's still a great stock to own. Just being honest.

Buy that dip come opening bell Monday! Make some money off this shit that identity thieves will take become my wife‚Äôs boyfriend. Think he‚Äôll let me buy a lambo?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"R/wallstreetbets should maybe get ‚Äúr/deleteFB‚Äù going. I just did and it was the best decision ever. Downloading all your pics and videos was easy too!

Also I just got an email from Florida DMV confirming my appointment for Monday. Need I remind you that I live in CA...I guess I didn‚Äôt delete fb soon enough. Ugh."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great, time to give my ex girlfriends a call üòè jk that's some Phil Collins incel type shit."

Only 1 way to stop a cyborg, pull the plug!  

LEAVE FACEBOOK,  you can live without it, it works, it really does."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a Facebook account that literally only is used to play oculos quest. So I seem to come out of this fine.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Facebook purge
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Old news, this'll probably barely move the stock"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Better short FB then
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Telephone Directories‚Äî remember?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"did they find my old password ? Kinda miss that account, but how do you prove it's you without a photo id you didn't need to start the account?"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs why those roboCalls are active
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck Facebook.  At least I‚Äôm learning something useful in here.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Good thing I dumped my calls
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Gonna be a jucy dip to buy
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagen all the indian scammers working overtime right now
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,That would explain the sudden weird texts I've been getting
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Good thing I haven't used FB since I was 10 yrs old and didn't have a phone
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the consequence of submitting voluntarily to ""the powers that be"". Question EVERYTHING."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Where can I get this data?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Are we at least gonna get paid for the dick picks we have and ready to give out at any moment? will they be auctioned? who wants to go $LONG on my stocks?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"They don't have my current number, just my old one."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Most of these breaches are inside jobs. They have the perfect excuses though: HACKERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's like blaming the boogieman for murder and getting away with it because: BOOGIEMAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,It seems more like a scraper then a leak. It's already public info
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Give me a call, anytime."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I am gonna call all the hot chicks form grade school. thats fb.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been two years FB-sober, never going back."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Well they were willing to share their personal data with that Klingon Zuckerberg so......I‚Äôll have a Dr. Pepper
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks loserburg
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Facebook - let's think about this...what's in a name.  The Sheriff, Po-Po and FBI all have Facebooks+Dossiers, too \~ only difference is that people \*voluntarily\* hand over the goods to Zuckerberg & Co.   ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, how do we know if our info was one of the 553 million?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,So..... Where can we find this list of people? Asking for another Ape.....
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Coulda made a fortune selling our info.... oh wait nevermind
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,There‚Äôs never any repercussions.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Good thing I haven‚Äôt had a Facebook account for over 2 years.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Bleeding HF's going to sell off FB next week and they're going to use this as an excuse.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I think my car's warranty is about to expire.......
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Let‚Äôs end this data mining machine! It‚Äôs nothing but a privacy invading corrupt garbage!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"here's my number, so call me maybe?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,wow Mr.Zucc you done fuck up now
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Data Sold! to the highest bidderüòâ
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell the dip
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Well facebook's engineers suck
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Who actually has their phone number on there? I don‚Äôt even have my real name lol. I went through a while back and deleted everything I could. Even my friends just see a blank about me section. I‚Äôm not 15 and don‚Äôt add random people so everyone on my list already knows me. My only picture is my dog. It‚Äôs probably as close to deleting as I can get without actually deleting it. I can‚Äôt fully get rid of it because I flip sports cars and FB Marketplace is by far the best place to sell. I list everywhere and ~75% of my sales come from FB
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Time to short Facebook. You can‚Äôt sell user data if it‚Äôs available for free.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Call the top number for a good time üòú
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why apes ever trust reptilian, I no know"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Glad I deleted my account from that piece of shit website 10 years ago l, fuck your Zucc, you cunt"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,No one should be upset. You give away your data for free.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh cool.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm an idiot for having a Facebook, but at least I‚Äôm not dumb enough to ever give my phone number to them."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great, maybe someone will call and check up on me finally"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I removed my personal FB account and now use an anonymous account, been loving it. Found new hobby groups in the area and use it a lot for photography.
Worst part however was a few months ago my account got terminated as it's a fake name. They wanted I'd proof or change it to real. Slightly changed the fake name to a different fake name, working ever since."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,So anyone know where i can find this? I want to check if i‚Äôm on there üò±
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm glad I deleted my Facebook long ago
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's why you don't use your personal e-mail, phone number, real name and a photo of your actual face."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Okay time to buy some options on Facebook
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Delete your Facebook account
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Like nazibook had any of my real information
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I never found Facebook interesting or useful at its peak of growth. I‚Äôm baffled why it hasn‚Äôt imploded. I‚Äôm far more worried about Snapchat and Instagram and the lack of distrust and disgust for those Zuckerberg owned data mines. 

People need to realise your data is really valuable and you certainly should not give it away without a fat pay check."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank goodness, how else would
I have head of automotive warranty‚Äôs?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Download link for the data?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,maybe somebody will finally call me
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I honestly feel bad for whoever ends up with my personal data... Positive is maybe I'll get a text or call
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,That's it! I'm going back to myspace!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucking fuck you Facebook. Can‚Äôt help but wonder how much of the data is from the shadow profiles they create on people. Slimy ass scumbags ruining social media one scandal at a time
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I realized my facebook addiction got away when I started WSb. Instead now I spend money on meme stocks a ND lose more productivity than when I was on fb.  It's a trade off
 Of what? Not sure yet..."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This news is years old and has been resolved. Why are people still believing these news sources...
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh!! Was it not public by default?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Mark Zuckerberg: **Woops**
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Bullish
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh no, the soulless lizard man stole my privacy!"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,At this point I think my stolen info is worth negative $2 now. Equifax made it redundant.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Bullish news. It proves FB actually have that many users
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Ya it‚Äôs free‚Äù
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This is why I deyeeted the facetwitters...I can‚Äôt trust anyone anymore.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,The moment FB started asking for phone numbers it was only a matter of time. Whoever gave them their number is an idiot.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Long term, this should be a huge win for US consumers. This should spark conversation within our regulators regarding the lack of barriers to big tech and their unchecked market reach. 

Data privacy will never be what it should, but this should spark some meaningful regulation on an already controversial issue. Requiring data points outside of an email and password to sign up for any service is unnecessary to actively use their web-based user-account product."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Where can we access it? Link?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a pleasant distraction i guess
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Where the fuck is that data? I'm vrowing a business and this is an opertunity you only get once or twice in a year
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Fakebook a joke.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Duh, its always available. For a price"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Rofl...reason why u don't install fb, yet WA will be the downfall....oh well....so fb short on Monday?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Are we really surprised
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck Facebook
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,So the data they were selling was published for free. No biggy lol.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I will short facebook
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope the don‚Äôt suspend my Social Security Number.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm dumb
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait, why does Facebook even still exists in 2021?‚òπÔ∏è"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Jokes on them. Nothing interesting is on there.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,If you didn't expect this to happen you're a fucking idiot. That's why I don't use Facebook or Instagram anymore. It's toxic in more ways than just creating personal problems... Not you going to have legal problems. So glad I'm already phased out of that bullshit.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"anyone got the link to the so called ""low-level hacking forum""? I'd like to check if I was pwned"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Love reading all the comments about how buying FB stock in a dip would be a bad idea. Have you looked at their financials? They're not going to fail - ever.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Where can i find my number, I forgot it, need to check that list."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Facebook is trash but too many people use this shit as the end all be all. People don't remember birthdays unless FB tells them and they don't message outside of Messenger. The way it was propped up in society is like if you don't use it you don't exist in the world.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Serious question- who cares? Why is your phone number so sacred? Do you all really think you‚Äôre so important that millions of people are dying to see the ‚Äúncaa picks I made,‚Äù or the fact that I bought a toaster on amazon? I seriously don‚Äôt understand the concern. At the same time I think Zuckerberg is a completely worthless human. A pussy. A thief. And just a vile human being. I think social media is a joke as it‚Äôs made up of 97% burning rubbish. But I don‚Äôt understand the huge fear people have of someone knowing your phone number...."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Facebook has been asking me for my number for over a decade. I always told them it was 1111111111 because I was young and thought it was funny. then they asked me to confirm and I said no. they still try to confirm and I've been declining for years. Now my tomfoolery has paid off. Ha!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Howcome there is nothing mentioned about this on any tier 1 newspaper websites?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thats a nice wig, bud.  Next time pls call back."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Well FB was started with a 500million dollar loan from a CIA bank it‚Äôs interesting how security or true intentions can surface. Smearing a lie is usual prolly the Russians I bet !! Class action law suit on FB for negligence I guess !
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,where to download? i wanna check my account lol
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Where can I buy?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I dunno how to tell you guys that phone numbers and addresses aren‚Äôt and never were private information.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol lmfao rofl omg stop stop.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I never give out my number on FB
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,wonder how high the sum is going to be when GDPR comes knocking on the door
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Bring back AOL.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,That's why you never use your real data.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe we‚Äôll get lucky and zuckerberg will blow his brains out
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I wonder how long ago would you have to have deleted your Facebook account to not sweat this?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've never told Facebook what my phone number is.

It may know, but I've never told it."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,The lizard king couldn‚Äôt care less
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,">using a phone number for Facebook. 

>surprised pikachuface

First of all, if you did this, you‚Äôre an idiot. 

Second of all, your phone number, email, name, recent addresses, and so on are already ***incredibly easy to get access to***

While this sucks, in this day and age it‚Äôs asinine to assume any information you give to a company will be private. So if you want to protect your info, all you can do is use burner emails or unique accounts on certain services. If you‚Äôre too lazy to protect your information yourself, don‚Äôt expect someone who has nothing to lose from allowing it to be leaked to do anything for you."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,So actually zuck needs to go to jail?!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,How do I look and see if I‚Äôm on there?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Yo someone call me
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Surprised this sort of content is allowed/made it to the front page here
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm deleting my Facebook account. Should have done it years ago.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"PSA: even since ‚Äòmyspace‚Äô was ‚Äòthe‚Äô thing, I never put any personal information in my accounts whether it was public or not. Privacy is something I have always done my best to protect in an online world. Unfortunately, online privacy now seems to be an unknown and taken for granted under the guise of ‚Äúyou must agree to the terms of service‚Äú. 

Please read article, come to your own conclusions, and please share your thoughts if you would like to. 
So glad I never gave my phone number or a private email address to any social media platforms.

Please my friends, consider protecting yourselves. Check your privacy settings on all your info social media accounts! Even despite that, my cell phone is inundated with spam calls. In the ‚Äòold days‚Äô of cell phone usage, this never happened. The truth is, WE are the product that social media sites sell and make money off of, not the other way around. These platforms owe us nothing. We are just a dollar figure."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,And yet another confirmation that I made the right choice and deleted my Facebook account years ago.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"RIP and ""told you so's"" to all the people that said, "" I have a Facebook just to keep in touch with family and friends, but I don't really use it."" 

No...just no."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Totally my real info on FB OMEGALUL
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this the reason I started to get calls from Maldives everyday?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Bullish
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,...AND the stock goes up.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Puts on Mark
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,'free'. You still have to buy it.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Deleted my fecesbook years ago but I don't expect that they actually deleted my data.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Short squeeze incoming
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Would anyone here like to extend their auto warranty?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,First time?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"WELP! In the UK 11.5M people's data has been leaked.    
I wonder how many people are waking up on Easter Sunday to a new credit card application in their name?  

No-longer part of the EU but boy do i wish we had some EU laws retained to protect ourselves online. Good luck to those on Facebook with ""Public"" accounts. I assume it's the public data that's been dumped. If this is internal data which includes profiles made private or friends only then fuck we're all boned.    
    
Time to switch from Facebook messenger to Samsungs video call using google instead. Good luck Facebook. It seem's your time is coming to an end very fucking fast. Double edged sword. I don't wish it on anyone but i hope all the data is used for bad reasons to force Facebook to shutdown. The world would be much better if we could remain anonymous online. Just think back to when message boards were a thing. No forced real life photo on your profile, no forced phone number. Just an email address and a name of your choice the same as Reddit.  

I wonder if all the ""ID Verified"" Facebook accounts had the ID leaked? I've had Facebook demand i prove my profile name is real with my photo ID before. If that shit gets leaked..."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,They‚Äôll have to get inline behind all the other people I never answer on the phone.   These mfers have trained people to just never answer the phone
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure I'm on that list. I got a call early last year:

""Hi, I'm calling from [insert some fancy sounding company name]. Am I taking to bschug?""     
""Yes that's me.""     
""You're working at [my current employer], right?""     
""Yes, what is this about?""     
""And your email address is still [address that I'm only using for Facebook]""     
""Wait where did you get this address? Who are you exactly""     
(Hangs up)

So I guess they used a call center to enrich their db with even more information."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait, who the fuck puts their phone number on Facebook?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,not mine\* :D
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Puts on FB lol
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Emo life
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this why I‚Äôm getting scammer texts all the time now?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,If you didn't leave by the time the boomers were memeing about how things were better in their day. you deserve to have your information spilled
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Facebook users got Zucked.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Glad I used a fake name
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"‚ÄúAt Facebook, we respect your privacy‚Äù read correctly translates into: ‚Äúwe respect how much god damned money we make by our users trusting us with their privacy.‚Äù

I can not wait until a large enough percentage of the population understands the importance of privacy, it will happen, my concern is that it may happen only after they realize how important it actually was, and once it becomes near impossible to retake it for future generations as theirs will be forever lost.

If there are two services providing a similar service where one charges, and one is free then it is always in your best interest to pay, and if you cannot afford to do so then doing without is the second best choice. Alternatively, you can create a fake persona including a ‚Äúreal‚Äù name, and use that, and always ensure that you recreate your online identity often, every few years or less, in order to protect yourself, and your loved ones. Do not allow them to profile you or your friends, and family."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it‚Äôs called the about tab."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Human turd in a toup√©e
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh no now someone will be able to bother the person who has the phone number and lives at the address I lived at like 10 years ago when I last updated my facebook lmao

Who even uses that site anymore besides insane conspiracy theorist grandpas honestly"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great, I need for Facebook friends"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Where? Asking for a friend.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"so now they can all meet each other without Facebook? - wow, that's like being 0.5  billion members  of the human race"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"No wonder I keep on getting more and more scam calls, guess I should‚Äôve deleted the account instead of just deleting the app"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,i guess my whole country just got doxed lmao
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,NOT STONKS

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"it wont change anything, stupid people still love social media as fuck"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Love it. The ban is still coming.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"What's the alternative? Peer to peer, completely encrypted, decentralised? No one has built that yet, have they?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Where can i find this data? Just curious:/
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just you watch, Facebook will go up on this news just like Boeing went up on their planes literally falling apart in the sky"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Where can we find out if we were one of the data leaks?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Where can I see this list any link please?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Where can I check if my data has been leaked. Asking for a friend.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did you know that every year you can get a publication in which you can find the name, adres, and phone number of almost anyone in your country. It‚Äôs called a phone book. My point is that your phone number and adres isn‚Äôt secret anyway"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,We all buying Apr & May puts or what?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Doors anyone know how you can check if your details were part of this leak? 

Normally I use have I been pwned but not sure of they‚Äôve included"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Palantir has entered the chat
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Glad to be rid of that bullshit
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,It's reasons like this why I'm here on Reddit and not on that shit fest of a hateful place called Facebook.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm sure that FB is angry that somebody stole data that they worked so hard to steal.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,How is FB up in after hours trading right now? You‚Äôll have to be the quickest draw in the west to get your hands on puts before it crashes Monday
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hackers gonna hack and then post that shit... and it is shit, and old shit at that."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Deleted Facebook and never looked back. Social media is cultural cancer. With nothing ever being deleted on the internet and retroactive cancelling for things done in different times. It's a huge long term liability in every persons life for a short term dopamine hit.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Is there a way I can check if my (former) account is included in the leak? I closed it 2 years ago and demanded to delete all my data. If they haven't done it I can sue them big time now according to the law in my country (Europe).
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I may start getting unwanted calls about my car warranty...
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Yet another reason why I'm glad I got rid of my account a few years back.  It was such a wise decision that I risked wrinkling my otherwise smooth brain.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ahh.. if it only recently happened..

It explains why I've suddenly started getting around 20 additional spam emails daily.

Fml"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmaoooo dropped myface about 10 years ago
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,That's a pretty big phone book.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Facebook has legit made this world a worse place
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Most users do it free on their own.....
Also fuck facebook"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets," [Personal data from over 500M Facebook users leaked online](https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/03/personal-data-from-over-500m-facebook-users-leaked-online/)

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Explains why I've been getting more Amazon scammer emails past 2 days
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Where can one see the leak contents? I want to know if my, and my family's, info is on there or not."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Uh... cool?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,That's why I never put my mobile on there.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buying CALLS

That‚Äôs bullish info. Means they sold it. Def not free"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,For free? You didn‚Äôt hear that‚Äôs a paid feature now you had to opt out if you didn‚Äôt want it.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Its beyond time to shut it down
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Not sure why anybody is surprised.. haven't thus happened several times before? Different (and the same) types of breachments too? Stop pretending we're all expecting Facebook to change just like your ex ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|shrug)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,He probably sold them to make a quick buck to cover his GME shorts.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets," Saw that post on nulled.to, fucking unbelievable"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do we know where they've been published? I wanna see if my deets are up coz if they are, i'll be taking these clowns for breach of tbe data protection act and getting the ICO involved."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Time to short Facebook?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,So this is why I‚Äôm getting spam texts with my name... zuck you
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I deactivated my Facebook 3 years ago but I‚Äôve read inactive accounts are affected too. Is there a way fo checking this list to see if our data is part of that leak?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,The fuk?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,DUMP IT
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,So buy then sell put options + buy the dip? Got it.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,How do we find out if we are affected?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,It won't affect their stock price.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone know where this list is so I can check if I or family are on it?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Does this mean my dad might call me?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,So my put gonna print?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,So where is the data? And how do we check to see if we were compromised?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Facebook could openly tell you that they are using and selling your data people will still use the platform. Sad. I honestly wish that I had lived in a generations the internet wasn‚Äôt everything. The 90s was the only taste I got. Social media completely changed the way the world works for the worst.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,And still no one calls me...
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can get sim swapped and they can still your accounts, so don't used SMS 2fa."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Where
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn. I just had to reactivate me account for the quest II.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,If there's any European people in that list Facebook is about to get fucked by GDPR
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Calls on callcenters
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Stopped using fb long time ago. Since I discovered reddit.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Who the fuck gives its real information to Facebook or any social platform in 2021?! Fuck I don't give them shit. And if they decide to disable my account they'd actually do me a favor.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahahaha. That's why I never created an account in facebook. It's a platform for braindead lemmings.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"So the title makes it okay when they sell it for profit, but free access no-good?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone got magnet or link?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,link to all the info?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thats lovely
Someone please call my entire family"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,So glad I deleted my shit in January. Fuck this guy in teh neck!!!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"The moment you sign up for FB and start adding friends, you'll find their phone numbers in your phone. I literally have the phone number & email of ever single person I'm friends with on FB in my phone right now, and they all have mine! This didn't require a ""hack""... this required a simple login and friend request, then the dipshits at FB did the rest for you! Low level. HA! We are the low level."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Business as usual. The last hack was September 2019 with 417 million leaked. No surprises. At some point you start questioning the complicity of one of the largest tech companies in the world, who should know better."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you‚Äôre dumb enough to put all your personal info out there on a platform that is known to be selling your data in the first place, you deserve it. Fuck Facebook and cuckerberg."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good time to invest in $BB then. You know, AI cybersecurity n' all that."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good thing I didn't put in my phone number or a ton of real personal data. 

What is there?

My high-school I graduated from and the college I went to. And that was it. And that you could see by clicking on the profile."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|poop)
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Zuckerbergs response:

HAHA SO YOU THINK YOU CAN BLOCK ME RIGHT?!?!?!

WHATS YOUR SHTOYLE?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Time to short facebook?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well this would explain why my spam box went from getting about 20 emails in a month, to over 300 emails in the same time frame"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Facebook is also the biggest funder to factchecker.org

 https://www.factcheck.org/our-funding/?gclid=CjwKCAjwx6WDBhBQEiwA_dP8rSErJFcEQ7UMMz2TvoGyl16sCtZhq0nbLulAhj30MJSoNsXSqTuscBoC3t8QAvD_BwE

Wouldn't trust their ""fact checking"" as actual facts"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I really hope that it doesn‚Äôt cause the price stock  to fall on Facebook come Monday.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Now, I get that companies like Facebook don't give a fuck about the privacy of their users past the generic ""your account is secure"" bullshit they pass of to give users the warm and fuzzies. 

But why do companies of this magnitude not have a dedicated pen team who just hang out all day and try to fuck their way into any potentially insecurity?

Or is this just a standard corporation where they do have a team like that, and that team has already submitted a bunch of tickets reporting vulnerabilities, but the devs responsible for fixing that just ignore the tickets hoping the issues will go away?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Goddamn created Facebook and fucking lawyers and shit right fucking Winklevoss Twins goddamn rowing the boat fuck yo shit i can‚Äôt even fucking believe this shit have you seen this shit fuck i just watched this shit fuck Jesse Eisenberg man

Motherfucking Spiderman Spiderman you put in the time fuck put in the time motherfucking build shit with his bare hands fucking best friend shit Jesse Eisenberg I'm very tired"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,So in other words.... The shit they sell for profit is now free. The only person this hurts is FB. It's a source of income for them.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,they recently tried to demand not only my phone number but a copy of my ID. i told them to eat a bag of dicks.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I told people to sell facebook and twitter stock like 5 months ago now. Hopefully they listened.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Great . . . I hate this man.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Link to dump ?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt remenber my facebook log in so this may help.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Sweet. Now we can see what camebridge analytics is paying for.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Glad I left that shit years ago
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you Facebook for that fire sale of my user data (maybe) - fuck fb, that thing is evil"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ha, everyone now has my birthdate, 1/1/1911 and phone number 516-922-WINE."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Can we somehow get a hold of that data? For ethical purposes obviouslyüòá
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs 2021 people still have Facebook and use their real information??????
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I was one of them on my FB account I use for gachas lol.  Bastards
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,that a your que to delet your account
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You should charge your phone.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Fun fact: Total population of USA is 331 million
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn. Glad i deleted my account last year
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,ah√≠ t√°.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fun fact, people have been using your fb info for free for a long time and this isn‚Äôt new! Thanks again!"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is this the biggest data breach in the history of mankind right here? If so, I want to extend my congratulations to the ZUCC for a job well done."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Aha, so that is why I have been getting so many spam cake"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Glad I dumped their shit for a longterm $50K profit a few months ago.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,That's not fair. We paid hundred thousand for that kinda data and it was just 100 mil accounts!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the leak has officially been named Facebook"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Facebook is #1 cause of largest mass exodus since Vietnam war. - Myanmar
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This is old news. I feel as though it has been resurfaced so that HFs can liquidate their FB holdings to cover their short positions without raising any scrutiny.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this why i keep getting text messages from email addresses with links in em?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,FREE? Im being asked for 8 credits lol.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Shtyle
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Wife and I deleted ours this morning. We didn't really use them other than as a contact line to some family and I was in a local group and school/work groups to keep up to date on things. I can do without.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Where were they leaked? I wanna see if my info was
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,wtf?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,So your telling me all the qanon base info got out
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,lol @ everyone who uses facebook
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Finally gonna get the numbers of some qt
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok GOT IT, LOVE IT! BIG fucking PUTS on FaceBook!!!!!!

Ok GOT IT, LOVE IT! BIG fucking PUTS on FaceBook!!!!!!

Ok GOT IT, LOVE IT! BIG fucking PUTS on FaceBook!!!!!!

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Where can I find the stuff
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,How can I check if I'm on the list?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,100% on phone batteries.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,So glad I‚Äôm not part of that bullshit
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck FB
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,People pay good money for that Info.. see how rich this computer is.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,What does this mean for me
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Any of you gone out there to find out how bad it is? I know I did some hunting once and found several of my account passwords in a spreadsheet file.  That'll make your stomach churn seeing your username and password that is the same as your email account on a spreadsheet for the world to see.  So all they would need would be my PayPal account and at the time they had 2 step authentication and could have easily cleared me out. 
 I changed passwords of course but I really take 2 step authentication and other security factors much more seriously and put in bizzare security questions and always link to my phone if possible."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Faceputs
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Calls on telemarketers.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,But where is all this information??
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Every company shares and sells your data... Even reddit as you can see by the targeted advertising
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Apparently this is all data that was previously leaked in 2019, granted that's from Facebook themselves, so we'll have to wait and see!"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Can we sue them?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn‚Äôt this the same breach from 2019 that Facebook fixed? Just some new guy reposting the same old data?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,So calls on fb then?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Remember those school phonebooks in case parents needed to talk to another parent and random people would call your house for no reason?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"*BEEP BOOP BOO DEE LEE BOOP BOOP* 
‚ÄúResponse: WHY DON‚ÄôT YOU ASK ME LATER‚Äù"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you found out that Facebook leaking your data was the source of the million and one phone calls you receive about your car‚Äôs extended warranty, would it annoy you enough to delete Facebook?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,It is so sad but how does this help the audience of this great community?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you guys think it‚Äôs good to short Facebook after this?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shitty CEO, Shitty platform, Shitty company... Also props to the Winklevoss twins"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,The group of people will keep doing what they do best ... fleecing and dumbing down the masses then moving on the next victim after they have sucked them dry.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,People where already sharing everything about their life seeking for attention. I don't see how facebook did something different.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Na, My computer knows more prime numbers then your computer"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Now we know why he‚Äôs been selling so much stock.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the reason making all money digital is the worst idea. Imagine losing a whole paycheck to hackers just because you‚Äôve become 100% reliant on the ability of a company to secure its own data. The future sucks a fat cock thanks to the unthinking majority. Enjoy your screens today because you‚Äôre about to be chipped and exploited even worse tomorrow in the name of safety and security. My family is all Freemasons and Sisters of the Eastern Star. This is all an old design decided a long time ago and reinstated in yearly meetings. Bilderburg meetings are for the cameras, and the real meetings won‚Äôt ever be known to you."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Facebook is the devil bobby Boucher!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Whelp, time to make money on the coming Facebook dips."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Coon and friends will get him
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,How can they take data protection so light hearted?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Is for me üëâüëà"" Nigerian Prince"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Meh, that don't confront me none.  Never joined any of these platforms to begin with.  ;)"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This probably explains the multiple spam texts a day I've been getting
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Did anything really juicy leak like private messages
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank fuck I dropped FB back in 2009 and couldn't be happier. From what I have been told, its now just a place where people go for their news/propaganda/conspiracy theories. Also, I think Zuckerberg is a huge snake and POG."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This is why I don't give my phone number for 'extra password protection' on anything
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,When are people going to learn not to put personal information on social media sites
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn ya‚Äôll so negative on FB. Far OTM FDs are obviously the play
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,So that‚Äôs why I always get those robo-calls that ask for my social security number.... it was Zuck behind the phone the whole time
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cool! So, where can I find all my personal info? Looks like I lost all my personal info. Thanks for finding all my personal info, mr zuckerberg!"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I got rid of FB 5urs ago. Worse company ever!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôve been mad.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,He looks fucking dead.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,BlackBerry to the rescue?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Everything should be free. Including our private info. Keep sharing it, dear Facebook"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"First of all, great question. Now, here at Facebook....."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh boy, here I go shorting again!"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Double checked that the date of the article wasn't the 1st, LoL."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Further proof that Ron Swanson is correct about everything.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Facebook is for moms
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,He's not human ya know... üëΩ
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Isnt this a hack from 2019 resurfacing?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Facebook is the robinhood of social media apps. Folks are clowns for still using it.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs a great question with a complicated answer. When I was a young boy in .....
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Glad I am not on Facebook , twitter , Instagram etc just Reddit."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm linking this to the phone calls about your car warranty/ICloud and Amazon account.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh no...like, the White pages?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Link to published leak?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Where are they published? Asking for a friend.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You should charge your phone.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Unity
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I removed my phone number from Facebook some time ago precisely for these and intentional info sharing reasons. It was an obvious thing to do after asking myself ‚ÄúWHY should I give them my phone number?‚Äù

I would shut down FB altogether if it wasn‚Äôt so ubiquitous among family and relatives for group conversations."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"OMG, where?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"""why'd you have to speak louder!"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably explains why I got a security alert from Instagram that there was a bogus login attempt in bum fuck Africa. Best part of this is that Facebook never fucking warned me or said a thing about being compromised.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Ironic how this happened as Apple and Facebook are battling over privacy issues!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"What was Equifax's punishment's? Man, its almost like this will always continue to happen when we just slap these companies on the wrist."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I never gave facebook my phone number but the cunts bought whatsapp for billions of dollars to import that information because our privacy really is that much valuable. Users need to be compensated fairly before these fascistic platforms destroy liberal democracy
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its not a news anymore. Invasion of privacy by FB has been issue from 2018. They have committed multiple illegal acts and some of legal actions that are not ethical at all. The reason that they get away with their BS is because current law doesn't really have understanding on data science and privacy. I feel like FB will go down hard when law catches up with them. However, FB can always do lobbying which is completely legal in US and might get away. They are holding multi-billionaire worth of invidividual user's data. They are making ridiculous amount of money by using/selling their user's data. I hope legislators figure out what to do with FB."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"My mum and gf have been getting loads of smishing texts recently, I thought it was my fault, I signed them up to a discount website and I thought there had been a leak turns out it‚Äôs FB üòÇ"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,you deserve it if you put ur phone # on facebook
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Do people still use that giant time sink? It feels like everyone worth networking with disappeared to better platforms a couple years back. Now it's all just attention-starved virtue signalling and shitty meme reposts we all saw five weeks ago
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Advertisers are getting slaughtered right now as FB prepares for the rollout of a mandatory prompt that will pop up on everyone‚Äôs phone allowing them to opt out of advertiser tracking. The worst is yet to come. 235 may and sept puts.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Deleted my account January 1st of 2019. Got used to living my life without telling everyone about it every 5 minutes in about a day. You will too.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"can we just fucking cancel Facebook already Jesus. how many times is he going to openly fuck us and just laugh. Trump talked the biggest storm about censorship and didn't do shit even as they were actively blocking him. Why are we letting this tumor still exist. ALL OF INDIA BLOCKED FACEBOOK why can't we. At this point the veil should be pulled back, do people still trust Facebook?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Personal Data that users willingly provided to Facebook ‚Äî don‚Äôt forget that. Facebook didn‚Äôt hold a gun to people‚Äôs head to provide personal data.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Great..
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,If anyone needs to talk hmu.. my phone number is online now anyway soo ahhwhwhah
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone still using Facebook and thinking that they take privacy seriously deserves whatever comes of this leak.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt care about privacy lmao
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it happened in early 2020, WHY are we just hearing about it now????"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Good point.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"At this point I find comfort in the size of the breaches. Yeah maybe I got hit, but I'm in the exact same situation as everyone else. And there's only so much you can do with that mass of data before they get to me. Then again, bots are getting pretty sophisticated.

Just remember to use multi-factor authentication on anything financial."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Facebook should just leak all personal information of the users and robocall to buy their stock. FB 2000 04/10/2021 C.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Any idea of what legal actions would be taken if any?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"So Facebook wasn't designed to gather your data and sell it to anyone who wants it?

I'm confused."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Was I one of them?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this why I suddenly keep getting spam SMS saying some package got delivered multiple times a day?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,EDIT: 1.4 billion users in 2025.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,That might explain the 7 fake calls from betting companies yesterday. Thanks Zuck you cunt
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm so glad I always put fake shit out on the internet.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,DOESNT SUPRISE ME AT ALL
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Soo.. puts?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha jokes on them I don't put my information on facebook.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I saw none of this coming. I am so shocked.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Serious question ... why with the number of data breaches and general disregard for your privacy, does anyone still have this terrible app?  Are you that addicted to likes and your echo chamber?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Best I can hope for is herd immunity.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Good thing I deleted my account ages ago.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,What the fuck am i gonna do with that shit anyways? Im not a degenerate fucking scammer.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Puts on fb?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Puts on facebook?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay but using Facebook is still a choice, correct? So...stop using it if this concerns you. This has been going on for long enough that if people actually cared about their info being shared, they wouldn't voluntarily give it up on social media sites."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, to be fair, the 14+ million accounts in Africa are likely all scammer accounts..."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Puts on the zuck 
Puts on the zuck
If you have any Facebook shares
On Monday you‚Äôll be fucked (sing it with me)
Puts on the zuck
Puts on the zuck
He will go bankrupt hopefully
Cause Silicon Valley sucks"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Is Marks on there?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,So how do I see my data?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,i opted out of using facebook years ago because i was getting drunk and typing my pornhub searches into the ‚Äúwhats on your mind‚Äù bar. Lost a lot of fake family members that year
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,THIS is why my phone number was never connected to Facebook
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh damn..
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's why you don't link your phone number to Facebook, and also why YOU DON'T USE FACEBOOK!"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is this on WSB?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This is why my Facebook is almost ten years old and I‚Äôve never linked my phone number to it. Fuck that
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Court: How could this happen Mr Suckerberg?

Suckerberg: Well first of all i want to thank you for this great question. We from Facebook are looking forward to answer great questions as we like to answer great questions."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is leak is from 2019.
https://fortune.com/2021/04/03/facebook-data-users-reemerges-online-for-free/"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs outrageous but that data was already published on a searchable site called Facebook.com
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Facebook stock on tuesday üìâ
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn‚Äôt the users of Facebook publish their own information online for free some time ago?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice always wanted to stalk that one girl from college.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Serious question- do ppl put their real phone numbers on FB admin pages? What is the benefit for an internet-based app to have phone numbers?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds like someone with a long position wants to dump their shares without triggering panic ü§î
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is this posted here?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I assumed this was always the case
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Zuckerberg thinking of an answer: BEEP BOOP BAP BOP BEEP BOP BEEP BAP. CALIBRATING. CALIBRATING. CALIBRATING. BEEP BAP BEEEEEEEP BOOOP BAP. CALIBRATING. WHAT A WONDERFUL QUESTION. WE WILL DO OUR BEST TO BE TRANSPARENT AND PROTECT THE SAFETY AND INTEGRITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS. BEEP BOOP BEEEEEEEP. ANSWER PROVIDED. SHUTTING DOWN HUMAN RESPONSE SYSTEM. BEEEEEEEP.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Class action coming up
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Good thing I deleted my whole account last year. Fuck Facebook!! Corrupt ass company!!! And fuck Instagram and what‚Äôs app and anything else those thieves own!!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This is only controversial because it was published for free instead of being sold to advertisers Iike normal
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Facebook couldn‚Äôt care less. Zuckerberg made off with multi billions with everyone‚Äôs data. He‚Äôs in his mega yacht now ignoring everyone.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Where can you find this data?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|poop)
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Im shocked....that people are shocked by this.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Of course I gotta ask ... who gives FB their actual info?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,What is a paste? Is that bad from a svale of 1/10?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Facebook zucks!!!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,WE NEED DECENTRALISED SOCIAL MEDIA!!!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honest question, if you haven‚Äôt shared anything but your email with Facebook, is this really impactful to individual users? And if you shared more info than that, shame on you. 

-former Facebook and Instagram user"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,People still use fb?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Cant get my data published if i havent updated it since 2012
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Was this why I got 38 spam calls yesterday?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Facebook ruined the internet
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,When I first saw this post I thought it was an ad for Facebook.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,how is this shit site still used
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,So this would explain the massive increase in spam calls over the past week from spoofed numbers intending to look similar to mine.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,THANK GOD I CASHED OUT MY CALLS LETS GOO
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,!remindme 2 weeks
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Just got a call about my cars warranty
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"When I was a young boy in White Plains, New York."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,By FB? Intentionally?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,where is the data? on the darkweb?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I refuse to give fb my number no matter how many times they have even tried to trick me into doing so.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,If you told your AI to make more money and your AI sold data for free
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,when is emergency services getting an official call/chat platform?... i dont use my phone number anyway
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Doesn‚Äôt excuse FB. But I‚Äôm also old enough to remember when the phone companies every year leaked names, addresses and phone numbers of everyone in the city. Even printed it out and threw it on your doorstep."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the stock.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"At Facebook, we respect your privacy. However, some of the people we shared your info with do not."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Was wondering why I been getting tons of spam texts
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Really wanna leave FB but will lose contact with lots of people :( it‚Äôs a dilemma
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Ha! I cancelled my Facebook last year. Boom.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Whaaaaaat? Facebook didn't protect its users data?
It's almost as if they are a soulless gigantic corporation profiting from the clueless public who decided to tell the world all their personal information doesn't care about the people whose information they sell to the highest bidder."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hmm, maybe thats why I don't put my number, address or family information on social media?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh no! You mean my personal information that has been hacked and leaked by 50 other data breaches in the last few years has been leaked again!? What ever will we do!?

What's fucked up is that this is so common it doesn't even register on my scale of important things anymore."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,So who can I ask to  my phone when I lose it?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs why we should use storj for a encrypted cloud storage for data.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,When he was a boy in Bulgaria
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a young robot, I mean boy at Harvard..."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't an online database of FB user's personal information just be a clone FB site?! ffs
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I suppose mrs Alexander wants to transfer her inheritance to these 500million people for a small fee and don't forget the nigerian prince
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Look at the brighter side.. no need of passwords now!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck you fecal  book
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets," I used to use this method to track unknown numbers that called me, now this guy ruins it ü§¨"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this why I get three group texts a day asking if I wanna meet for sex by clicking a hyperlink??
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, how do I find out if my phone number, email and location is out there?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Anybody else being pulled into random groups of phone numbers these days?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Glad I deleted mine lol
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Good thing i have nothing of value lol
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,How can we search if our info was leaked?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"All this means is that instead of Zuckerberg being able to sell your data for profit, it got released for free. In a way we should be glad that it got released for free."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I have tried time and time again to delete my facebook account but it will reinstate itself after wbeeek or so. I never should have made one.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Puts on fb or won't people care enough to sell?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy the dip
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,GameStop would never leak my info. Just sayin...
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,My calls boutta die a quick death
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This is from a while ago?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Do people give Facebook their real phone numbers?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,God he looks like a dingus
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This is why I don't have FB. Lol
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone know where one can download the database?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Who the fuck puts their phone number on facebook
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh no now someone will call me and try to scam me.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sweet, someone please find my number and call me, I‚Äôm depressed and lonely"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Not sure how this company is still profitable
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Time he pays who agrees
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,What does this mean for my PLTR calls?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Yall still using Facebook
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oooh boy I can't wait for more calls from the ""Dealer Warranty Center"" about my cars extended warranty."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Warhol said everybody would get ‚Äú15 minutes of fame‚Äù but you can have mine...I‚Äôll have my data back thanks for nothing douchbook
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck FB and Zuckerturd

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,YOOOOO

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Calls on Facebook tomorrow
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Could someone check if I‚Äôm in the data? My name is David Mitchell and I live in Calgary. Thanks!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish we could sue the crap out of Facebook. But we agreed to the terms.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Zuckerfucker
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I've been getting blasted from spam txts telling me to claim my prize or collect my parcel. Calling me by the name I go by on FB was an automatic red flag.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"i seriously doubt my phone can receive any more spam calls.. its at its limit. rings non stop.  i don't fk'book so i guess it doesn't matter anyways.. as far as the rest of the data.. anyone seriously still believe any of that data is private?? 

as shitter joe would say "" come on man "" .."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You tried to match my shtyle and failed. Mu ha ha ha ha. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sunglasses)
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck Facebook!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Why are people still on Facebook? Seriously?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This is why I never gave Facebook anything but my email address used to sign up. Fuck Facebook
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Who adds their number to facebook? Only got yourself to blame
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"When those numbers come in, save them. Then set up call forwarding and redirect them back to another one or even thier own number. So far I've sent several of them back like this nowüòÜ good luck fkers"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Well. I better get calling. What am I going to say to all these people. Geeeeeeeez
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Ha! Good luck. I never gave legit info when I signed up for Facebook.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Sharing is caring!. Also delete facebook.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,this is why i only use Fuckbook now
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This is why I never give companies my real phone number... Something like this happened every year!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Buying puts on Facebook Monday it is
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Lets all sue them into the ground
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is real?? Why is this real???
I find the lack of coverage even more terrifying than the fact that this happened."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,That is equal to the entire population of the US plus 2/3 of another America or around 45% of the population of China
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you use your direct info for social media let alone websites, hope this thought you a lesson."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it‚Äôs important they‚Äôll leave a message, otherwise I‚Äôm not answering. Barely like to with people I know anyways."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I knew of it's existence, but I just barely started getting the extended warranty callsü§î doesn't help if I don't have FB but others with my number do"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,What a great time to sign up for a VoIP
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This is why I refuse to provide my phone number to these sites. In the end they all get hacked and cannot keep my data safe.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,So puts then
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Can we break up the big tech companies now?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Eat Mark zuckerberg
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish people would stop using FB. The company is trash
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Good thing they have a 14 year old email and phone number I never updated
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,who would leave his phone number on facebook?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Good thing I deleted mine like 10 years ago. And have moved/changed my phone number since then.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,The other day I kept getting calls(like every 2 mins) about my SS number is leaked and so on and so forth. Then this article comes out and I'm like yep that's why. Haven't ever gotten the calls till now. One call even tried to claim they were from an investment firm(wouldn't say which one) and claimed someone has breached my account. Well as soon as you tell me my broker I'll belive you. Where tf do they even get the information like shit.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone have a torrent file or url for a download?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"very trashy...tho i'm still surprised anyone still uses facebook

i signed up a few years after the company was born when i was in college....spent a year or two using it....then immediately had a revelation that this online novelty would be a smoldering dumpster fire one day

and easily and quickly deleted my account"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"When the app is free, you are the product.

Fake all your personal data on facebook. Real friends do know your real contact info!"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Welp glad i never gave them my phone number, email or copy of my id"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"lol good. Get off Facebook, idiots. They're evil."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Theres a YouTube guy who makes a living answering these calls. Guess he‚Äôs getting content.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its a distraction. Gme shorters being margin called, so selling facebook"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Who has their phone number on FB?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,#ZuckisaCuck
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Does this include their subsidiaries like Instagram/WhatsApp?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Swag
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Delete Facebook now.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Funny how Facebook reminds me every time I log in that I don‚Äôt have a phone number listed.  Guess it pays to live 1/5th off the grid.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank god I haven't touched Facebook in ages, my number is outdated as hell"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"In other news, stupid twats continue to use facebook.  ""I can see pictures of my niece."" said Betty Lou Dumbfuck, ""Back to you Tom."""
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Class action lawsuit time? Fuck Facebook
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Delete Facebook already...  You have to be an idiot to allow Zuckerberg access to any of your data.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,So much for guarding and protecting our Data... Lore!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Update your status! Quickly!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Facebook is the new phone book? Who would have thought.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,">The phone numbers and personal data of over 553 million Facebook users have been published online for free

Uhhh yeah... By the users."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,That's cheap.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,So buy Puts tomorrow?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,That will teach ya.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck me am I glad I deleted Facebook a couple years ago
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets, Thank god the Supreme Court will be making it easier for these people to operate! Very excited to increase my car warranty calls from 2 a day to 5 a day!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"God damn, i hate fb but it was a leak not ""published"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Glad my Facebook account is linked to a now non-existent yahoo email address and no phone number.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not too worried, this is data Facebook probably already sold and is readily available online anyways."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,God fucking damnit Zuck.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,It's time to get rid of Facebook
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,anyone know which forum this was leaked on?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,When are we gonna dump fb? The shittiest company in the world.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,FB $400
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,where to find leak
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Where is the actual leak? Wanna see what was leaked about me.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Published where though?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh neat
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,But where is it?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is FB stock still going up tho
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,EU 4% of revenue fines go brrrrrr!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe I can finally find out what my password is now..
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Ahh this is why they keep reminding me I haven‚Äôt updated my phone number LOLOL
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Go to scatteredsecrets.com and you might stumble on some sites that leaked your passwords.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Are they trying to block the Zuck?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,As opposed to for a fee?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I haven‚Äôt used Facebook in over five years. Probably closer to ten. If my data is in there, I think I‚Äôd have a lawsuit"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Is there a searchable database to see if you‚Äôre compromised?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Hi aloooo thesis beter calling YuO abvout your car warrrrrrrenty
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,All my info on there is wrong. lol
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Glad I never added my phone number to Facebook. Missing out on that juicy class action though. 

Apparently zuckerbergs number was also in the leaked info."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy MZ is a major part of the problems in our country..
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,*+5% increase in share price!*
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"im still searching for the data, I want a copy. 

Any of you have a lead?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why would you even put that information on Facebook?

I use Facebook very sparingly:  To keep contact with my hippie grandson and to see local news and events.  I don't use my real name and I have never provided any other information.  Why would you do that?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I cannot wait until Facebook finally dies.  What a horrible platform, terrible business model, and inept leadership group.  They have been a detriment to society and are a major reason the internet is in its current state."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Jen Shah strikes back.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you have your phone number on your facebook profile, you're a psychopath"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,people still use fb?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, where might one go to access this information and check their own data/what was stolen?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm going to short Mark. Right now. I mean, er, on Monday."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"People said they wanted Facebook to be more transparent, so Facebook became more transparent with their user‚Äôs data."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Puts on FB?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,So how do you know if your data has been leaked?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This is probably about the number of actual accounts that people use.  I loved it when they hit 1 billion 'users' and it was all over the news.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I block everyone I don‚Äôt know , can‚Äôt stand picking up the phone and some fool is selling me something"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Is there anyway to check if your info is there?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow, even with the number leak my phone is still dry."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Does anyone know where to actually see the data so we can see exactly what of ours was leaked?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,A friend of mine answers his phone ‚ÄúSheriffs department.  This is officer x( makes up last name)‚Äù.  Says calls stopped for about a month.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"So? Facebook has been selling that same info for years,god forbid Zuckerberg not get his cut outta this one"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck Facebook. Can‚Äôt wait til Lina Khan and Tim Wu get their hands on ‚Äòem.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't use Facebook and would drop it like a stone - and would have years ago, except that my sister who passed away 6 years ago still has her account up. And if I delete it, I lose that. I'm not sure if I'll ever be ready for that.

It's also how I keep in touch with my MTG group."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Why hasn't Facebook been removed from app stores like Parler was?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck Zuck

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,So where is this data?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess sucks to be those who couldn't quit on Facebook.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Finally no excuse for all my friends not to call me.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,These last couple years I rarely pick up phone calls anymore because they're all scams callers. It's kind of annoying.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Who the hell has there number on Facebook though? Boomers
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Is the WhatsApp userbase affected as well?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait, isn‚Äôt that just... Facebook?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Facebook is a plague. They purposely defy their users privacy and security and don‚Äôt care.  They like hate speech because it generates traffic and ad views.  

They love disinformation because it creates traffic. 

They hate privacy because it impedes their ability to sell your information. 

Make no mistake: One of these days they aren‚Äôt going to making billions in advertising and they will look around and start selling their detailed database of user information to anyone with a credit card. They may pretend to anonymize it. It we all know how useless that is. 

So all this highly detailed information you‚Äôve been sharing on you and your kids and family will be there for the buying."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Facebook continued to prove it is shit
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I get there‚Äôs some bad things that can happen but tbh people having ur phone number, name, birthday, and email, isn‚Äôt really that big of a deal. The most they can do is track all your social media accounts and get important info through those, which if someone wanted to do that to you, they wouldn‚Äôt need a Facebook leak to get the information."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Jokes on you I don't have that number anymore!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Time for yolo puts, fuck Facebook!"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only information that was publicly available anyway. It was a data scrubber collecting surface data, not hacking into Facebook itself. Any normal person that is friends with you could have gotten what the bot got and it's less information than any bank, doctor, medical record or licence has on you.

But why would anyone bother reading the articles when you can holler into the void?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Does this include deactivated prfiles? I can't remember if I deactivated it or deleted it
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,So could this be the reason why I keep getting phone calls from Chinese couriers with an automated voice message?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I read this and thought: I am so glad that I'm on there as a fake person, then..."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jokes on them, I've had a false birthday, email, and location for years. Best of luck finding me bitches!"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah so that's why..
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"This isnt really 'news', we've known this for awhile. Wonder why it's getting more hype and traction today.."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"What kind of personal info? Social? Bank info? If it's just my phone #, I dont give a spit. I just block unknown calls. People get too paranoid for simple spit."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Jokes on them I never answer my phone
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Part of my master plan
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha. I quit giving facebook my phone number back in like 2009. They have my boost mobile number that I used to sell weed on.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Who answers phone calls anymore???
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Facebook : it‚Äôs free real estate

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think I stumbled on something that really works. I probably shouldn't say this cause now it's going to get fixed LMAO, but I love this sub so here it is. When these morons call most of the time it's an automated recording that starts when it hears sound (aka you saying hello). What I've actually started doing is picking up the phone and just being completely silent. 

What I've found is that after about 5 seconds the software ends the call. What I think happens is the software considers it a dead line or inactive phone number and DOES NOT call you back and takes you off the list. 8 barely get these calls and if I do I use this method which I have named ""the silent treatment"" and they stop. You're welcome hahaha"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,sure beats having comcast sell it to the same people for profit

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I only post things on facebook when I get some sort of discount from stores for doing so. Other then that, I have no idea why the fuck people still uses facebook.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This happened in 2019.  This is most likely due to melvin and shitadel liquidating to cover costs on GME.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Those are so maddening. ‚ÄúPush 2 to remove from call list.‚Äù They call back a day later anyway.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Most auto warranty companies get you phone number from public dmv records. When you register a car with your number attached it becomes public records. Some states my vary though
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,No I don‚Äôt have FB but I get them. Prob cell phone harvesting because I never give out my cell to companies
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"My theory is they are an accidental psy-op with a noble origin: to stop cell phone bombs. No such thing as a clean burner number anymore, it's getting a call."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"In Europe, we don't get these robo calls and people trying to sell us stuff."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs definitely the reason for all the recent spam texts.  My wife has been getting texts addressed to her father‚Äôs dog.  For some reason she used her phone number on that account like 15 yrs ago and it‚Äôs the only way the dogs name would be associated with her number
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Also probably the reason my grandparents got calls telling them that i was in jail and needed money.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Facebook is evil
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,It's not. I get those calls. I never gave my number to Facebook and I've been off of it for 5 years.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh fuck is that true? If so, I hate them even more now"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've found the best way to make them stop. Talk to them! But fuck with them. I tried to get a warranty on ""my 1985 Delorean"". When they see you just take their time. The calls stop."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Kinda like the DMV when I signed up for a new state id. They sold my email right then and there. I know because I was stupid and used a clean email.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I used to get calls at my work for extending a car warranty. We had lots of downtime, so my manager and I would, in our thickest southern accents, pretend that our car was a ‚Äú‚Äò99 EZ-Go‚Äù... a golf cart.

The person would ask ‚Äúsir, what do you drive when you go to get groceries?‚Äù - ‚Äúwell hell I just wander up to the clubhouse and snag whatever jerry has cooked up for the members‚Äù

We would also tell them that we had an ‚ÄúF-175‚Äù. 
‚ÄúSir, are you sure? Can you look at the back of your truck and tell me what numbers it says?‚Äù 
‚ÄúHell I don‚Äôt know, the last two numbers are missing! But I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs a F-175‚Äù"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Na it‚Äôs probably my porn habits.. oh shit my Instagram is still active..  you may have a point
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I haven't bought a car in about 10 years. Never got those calls. Just bought one a few months ago from a private party.  It's about 10 years old. A few days later I started getting the calls regularly.

I believe the extended warranty calls are tied in to bots scraping DMV data looking for new registrations."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Or air duct cleaning
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,No those come from DMV. I had a foreign friend who never got them until the day he registered his vehicle in US and not even a week later the exact information given to DMV showed up on mail
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Get the RoboKiller app bro it fucks with spammers for you
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, I don‚Äôt have Facebook and I get those every week."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,That's what I was just going to post. That and continuing my education.  Take my upvote.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Soon we'll get anonymous birthday wishes too..

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,They're getting crazier. I got a call about a warrant for my arrest and the only way to stop it was to give them my social

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Google could do humanity a favor by making their call screener available in all platforms. That thing is like sprinkling magical fairy dust on your phone.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Handy trick, play The Sound of Dialup Internet when the calls come. They will take you off the lists thinking your number is a fax machine!"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This made me lol üòÇ
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Got dammit you may actually be fucking right Not once did I ever receive one of those calls ! Until recently these last 2 months. I don‚Äôt use fb, haven‚Äôt since high school but still"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Omg I've recently been getting more spam texts and I'm wondering if Facebook is the reason why, I don't have an account but I know they have their nasty fingers everywhere"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I spent an hour on the phone with them once when finally it came to give them my CC info so they could process my payment, I gave them 16 random digits and then told them I needed to make sure they covered everything because a family of minutare unicorns was puncturing holes in my exhaust pipe be the zoo won‚Äôt take them. They stopped calling me all together. I miss them sometimes."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Good thing I deleted my profile 12 years ago. Are people still using Facebook in an Instagram era?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,For a car we had 5 cars ago!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's fucking absurd. I'M A STUDENT WITHOUT A LICENSE, HOW DUMB DO THESE SCAMMERS THINK I AM?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure Facebook owns the extended warranty companies.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Answer and immediately put the call on mute. Let it hang up on its own. I've heard this will identify you as a dead number. Don't know the validity of this, but it has worked for me"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your phone number gets sold by a lot of companies. FB explicitly hides numbers and this was a sophisticated attack. You have to worry about the smaller sites much more. I tried to buy my sister a gift certificate from SHEIN this Christmas (online clothes retailer) and put in my personal info. A few weeks later I get an alert that they were involved in a data breach. Now I get calls daily.

Never happened to me before."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"at one point in time, my phone number was being spoofed and used for spam calling. So I got calls back from pissed off people a lot. Someone suggested I remove my number from fb - and it made no sense to me but I did it and the problem stopped."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah, that would be your car insurance company usually"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I never got spam calls or spam emails until Christmas I got an oculus. You have to have a Facebook account for it so I made my first ever Facebook account. My email is now filled with junk emails and I get spam calls regularly.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hmm maybe it could be that someone is going to dumb a shit tone of fb shares soon... maybe citatdel is one of the biggist shareholder of Fb. Maybe this is just another media campain trying so be sneaky when they are dumbing their shares. Where did I know this HF from? Ah I remember those fuckers overshorted GME. 

Its just sepculation but I think its logical. Why does a retard like me has this 'knowledge'? 

Maybe there is a pretty awesome sub about the stock i like. I think that sub has three letters. You should look into that."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve never had Facebook and I get those.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,That makes sense since I rarely get those calls. Haven‚Äôt had a FB in several years. Meanwhile I hear how a lot of friends and family get them a far more frequently.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure it‚Äôs because of the DMV. When I moved to the States the first thing I did was get a phone number, the second was a driver‚Äôs license.
When I did the second, I started getting bombarded with scam calls and junk mail! What the HELL!
How do you stop this junk!?!"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I have been receiving much more spam calls this week. And they are local area codes too so I pick up because it could be someone from work or something work related. Then I just end up blocking that number.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Your right I never made a Facebook but the guy who use to have my phone number had one they called me one day using his name. He hasn't had my number in years.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe this is not new. The data breach was done in 2019. The stolen data has just resurfaced. Not sure whey you don‚Äôt see it on cnbc main tho

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I rarely have to use it for events that friends have created, but otherwise haven't used it for 4 years now, I prefer to waste time here and on youtube"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Folks that don't have a FB profile still have a FB profile:

FB searchs users' phone books. They use your friends who have you in their phone book, take your name and number, and start building a profile on you."

There‚Äôs a lot of drama and stuff on Facebook but it makes me feel in touch and gives a bit of nostalgia seeing those I haven‚Äôt actually seen in many years."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,They still kept and harvested all of your data. Even if you joined fb in 2007 it was in the T&C‚Äôs you agreed to

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Or just don't use your real name and don't upload your photos and personal stuff there. People on facebook know who I am irl but I don't use my real name there. Fuck that.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I only use it as a Rolodex for people o may or may not eventually get in contact with. So yeah it's pretty much useless.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"If this news if true, they could be facing $billion of fines. In EU alone, GDPR sets a maximum fine of ‚Ç¨20 million or 4% of annual global turnover ‚Äì whichever is greater ‚Äì for infringements. The latter amounts to almost 3.5B$ already. And they've had the GAFAs in their radar for a while now so I don't see them let this fly (again, if true)."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can type ""shit"" on the internet"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think that any fines for data breach will be, as always, laughable for them. When will we take issues like these seriously? Slap a fine on total revenues proportional to the number of user's which data has been breached (as a % of total no. of users), plus reimbursement for every person which data has been included.

Shit like that should send a company to financial oblivion, otherwise they won't care. Anything they'll have to pay is gonna be just spare change."

No ad will ever make me buy something - so annoyed with them that I religiously dislike every yt ad I encounter. If they want to watch me - let them, their shame, if they have my medical records - again, I don't care since they won't cure me for sure. As long as they don't have my DNA and access to my brain circuits I don't care cause they can't do shit."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"> people will continue to not even care.

What I find disturbing is how badly I got railroaded for refusing to use phone-based 2FA *for this very reason*. If a site doesn't work without 2FA, I refuse to use it. The hate that was slung my way was absolutely pathetic."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"bb isn‚Äôt cyber security to my knowledge, everything is hackable and nothing is full proof. Our government literally has data breaches all the time, that just shows how inevitable it is. Oh companies do like to give users more security but the more security you give something the less convenient and tedious it becomes."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"People do care. But what can we do about it? We can stop using FB but other companies will have breaches. We are intertwined with the internet so much that unless you go completely off the grid and only use cash, your info is at risk for theft.

There is nothing that can be done. Lawmakers don‚Äôt give a fuck, and the ones that do are outnumbered by people with heavy pockets."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Something that stuck with me was reading, ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs free, and they‚Äôre not selling you anything, YOU are the product.‚Äù Facebook is one big data mining project, plain and simple. They‚Äôre gathering your information and selling it."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,FB paints an unrealistic life where everything is carefully curated and manicured so as to sell shit nonstop meanwhile in the real world we are a bunch of fucking ewoks struggling against the galactic empire with stone tools.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Amen. It is a sickness my friend. Thank god gambling of the stock market like a psycho seems to be the cure.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,It sucks but it'll never happen. More than enough people are addicted to social media
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,If you can't grasp how social media is a highlight reel then that is a personal problem.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,It's like the opposite of WSB (Loss)
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,100% perfect description.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bingo.  
People actually have to call me, but never forget to ""rub in"" the fact that they posted it and I am the only one who can't see the post. ü§£"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can also just ignore that. Like I have a FB account but I literally only use it for events, birthday reminder and Messenger (and it has always been like that, I have never done one post actually). Reading the wall, friends updates and posting is completely up to you."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro I dunno what friends you have, my Facebook is just abstract memes and satire articles. Nobody decent actually posts about their lives"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"no thats like instagram, or soemtimes occurs on twitter/twitch/youtube as well"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish everyone was showing me the good. All I see on mine people fighting over politics and the trashiest bullshit imaginable. I‚Äôm tired of the low lights give me those highlights.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think anyone use Facebook anymore for this purpose. The only thing nice of Facebook now is to see se video content i would have missed otherwise. 

The rest I do not post anything anymore no one cares anyway.

Now i get at least a fucking fake account asking me to have sex with me though"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm here for yolo posts.. Is that any better?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wish I could delete it, have to keep it for uni unfortunately"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,That's why I left in 2008 and it was bad then. I can't imagine the shit show it is nowadays
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Using Facebook effectively is simple:

Block news feeds from all your friends and join a bunch of community related or hobby related private groups and freecycle groups. You lose the pretense of everyone having a perfect life, you gain community gossip and events, and you can get free shit and get rid of clutter."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Disclaimer really sad story here. A friend of my wife's family was killed recently in what was apparently an accident. Scrolling on her Facebook page, every photo is her and her husband smiling, going out, happy as can be with ""I'm so happy and blessed etc."" captions on every one.

Her family posts public comments accusing him for her death and blaming him for her depression and calling him out for isolating her. Saying she was killed by domestic abuse.  She saw everyone happy on facebook and thought she had to present the same. Couldn't reach out for help, cause facebook confirmed that she is alone and no one has struggles"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt understand this argument. Of course you‚Äôre going to post your best stuff. Do you keep photo albums at home of your most miserable times? Do you keep photos of you going to the bank and the dry cleaners vs posting vacation photos?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shit, people wont even shoot the shit with you about life now, just expecting that youve been keeping up with their carefully curated blog."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,That shit is fucking cancer
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Legit all social media‚Äôs should be destroyed
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You sound pretty soft if you let this stuff get to you
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I have always said this.  Facebook is depressing as fuck to use because all you see are the best moments of everyone‚Äôs life.  I‚Äôm surprised there hasn‚Äôt been more studies on this.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not true. You are actually referring to Instagram.

In Facebook you are questioning ""why am I not believing in flat earth 24/7""? Same applies to other forms of mental illness, like antivaxx, 5G and so on...

**Bonus**: In case anyone forgot, Instagram, Oculus and Whatsapp are also owned by Zucc too!"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm with you on that.  I solely use messenger. Easiest way for me to get in touch with my European fam.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly why I left it, including instagram. I think Instagram is worse for that shit. But another thing is seeing things that are just daily parts of life that you can‚Äôt/don‚Äôt have. Doesn‚Äôt have to be vacations or new cars or houses, seeing people starting a family and depending on your situation you might start to think your a lost cause or worthless or whatever else because your single or can‚Äôt have kids for medical reasons. It‚Äôs too easy to get caught up in what everyone else is doing unfortunately"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I must say it also depends on who you know. Not everyone faces that as my friends often talk of their mental illnesses, foibles and tribulations"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fortunately for me I never cared what others were up to and realized FB is a tool people use to brag about their lives while trying to appear genuine.

But a few years back my wife and I were kind of living in the duldrums so to speak. We weren't making enough to save for a house yet, we hadn't been in a vacation in years and we hated our jobs. She would sit in fb and pine for what other people were doing and was like ""it pisses me off that other people don't work as hard as we do and yet can do all this stuff""

And I agreed but I told her we're only seeing the best of these people's lives and that this isn't a good way to look at things, comparing yourself to them when our situations are different. 

Eventually we moved on in life and are a lot happier now with where we are and she doesn't do that anymore. 

But it was then that I realized how much of a poison FB can be"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs not even your friends anymore. Back in the day it was just what they posted in reverse order. It worked great. Now they use their algorithm to decide what they think you‚Äôll like and show that before people you know.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Any social media that allows posting pictures and videos actually. Facebook is better than the ones that's only about pictures and videos. I miss the days of Orkut where it wasn't so easy and we didn't have as many filters.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah much better for your mental health to read people‚Äôs angry opinions all day long on Reddit.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idk, half the posts I see from my friends is all the bad shit happening to them. 

My fb feed is just like real life. Ups and downs. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why should we expect people to share the depressing, shitty parts of their life? That's not realistic either. Personally, I don't share the depressing parts of my life even with my own mother. While a good chunk of the ""public"" facebook can get toxic, I greatly appreciate the ability to keep up with friends and family from a distance. Without facebook I'd be even less connected than I already am"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I unfollowed every friend. I just use news feed for businesses and news.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"You should stop following ""friends"" if it makes you this angry seeing things that make them happy."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just keep it, because I have a group for close friends where we post memes and plan group trips / bbqs..."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,It may take a hit. These issue opens several fronts for the company.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Shorting facebook might be one of the stupidest trades I have ever heard of. They just keep crushing it.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just sell it already and buy $GME. Don‚Äôt ask for permission, ask for forgiveness."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Reddit might come back to night people. People don't understand that ""anonymous"" accounts and ""private"" data will eventually be leaked and at that point your private data will absolutely be linkable back to you.

 Private data leaks will be so impactful for society, just look at the fall out from that ashley madison cheater website.

People think that username password leaks are bad, just wait until gmail gets hacked like this or imessage. Wasn't there just an microsoft email hack recently?

Taking a look at how buggy the reddit website has always been, I'm sure that their data systems might leave a few doors open"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is the same ole shit, you are just doing it anonymously now."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Reddit is partly owned by Tencent which is functionally part of the CCP. Still think it's cyberpunk?  It's more The Matrix. WSB and some other subreddits have good mods but look at the dumpster fire that is r/politics. There's curated information and opinion pushed at you all over reddit.  Bots push particular posts to the front page all the time. It's way better than most social media but it's still got its own social media bullshit.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Reddit also lets you call people retard, retard. Facebook don‚Äôt allow that shit.  Retard."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You dont have to use your real name/photo on facebook either.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"And yet, I guarantee they still have it."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You can be sure they got your contact details from one of your friends who shared their contacts with the Facebook app.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,That is confirmed

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think the company is obligated to tell the people affected (like BA did with their breach). In theory you are also entitled to compensation by virtue of the breach regardless of whether its caused actual loss. I wouldn't be surprised if a law firm pics this up and trys to do what PGMBM (UK) are are doing with BA.

N.B This isn't legal advice the only time I passed the bar was on my way to the toilet so I could sniff my favourite crayon."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Personally, i find that it excels in 2 spaces:

One, the marketplace is great to find local items relative to proximity to your location.  It‚Äôs advantage over something like Craigslist is that you can browse the seller or buyer‚Äôs profile to decide whether you trust the person rather than them being completely anonymous.

The second benefit is the sheer number of specialized groups that exist with other members who can interact with each other. While you can argue that a forum does the same, again there is a benefit by removing the anonymity of someone. This assigns a level of responsibility to ones comments / posts."

One time, I spent over 10 minutes spelling a 17-digit VIN phonetically (wrong) over and over. Another time I made it all the way to a closing rep and then unloaded horribly on the poor sap. 

Eventually they catch on, get upset and hang up on you but then the calls usually stop. 

Edited."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Push 2 to confirm this number is active so we can sell your number to other lists.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Talk to someone and tell them your car is from the 90s. They hung up on me when I said I have a 1998.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"""This is our last attempt before closing your file...""

#FUCKING DO IT!!"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, they use that to confirm the number is still actually in use. So all you've done is confirm you're still using that number, and they're gonna call you even more from now on.
  
So for anyone else reading this, don't ever respond or react to any texts or calls. They're just fishing around to see what numbers they can grab and add to their database of still-in-use numbers. Don't believe any option that says it's there to be removed from the call or text list, or whatever."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, yeah. You just confirmed for them that your number is valid. Of course they call again.   


Tell you what, though, confirm you don't want to hear from me again by giving me your bank account credentials and I won't leave you any more snarky replies."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Push 2 to confirm that this is an active number more likely.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"When you do that you‚Äôre confirming that you‚Äôre a live person at that phone number who listened to the message, they‚Äôll resell your number then"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's because the option is there to see if there's even someone attached to the number. It's like when you get spam you never signed up for but it says you can ""unsubscribe.""

Clicking that just tells them it's an active email address, so they can send *more* spam."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,In phone settings you can block any number that isn‚Äôt in your contacts. It goes straight to voicemail. Then check your voicemail regularly for anything important
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I always answer with an Indian accent and say ""I work for Microsoft"" and it makes them furious and hang up."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,They want you to push 2 to know that there‚Äôs a real person at the end of the number. You‚Äôre just letting them know you‚Äôre actually there so they can keep calling you back.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I always just ask uncomfortable questions like ‚Äúwill the warranty cover my car if I burn it to the ground?‚Äù ‚ÄúWill it cover the dead escort in my trunk?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat do I do about all the cocaine in the dash?

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Tell them you have a 1968 ford econolodge van. That you are super excited about the warranty. After wasting their time for a while they‚Äôll stop calling.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Most of them are Indian. I speak Hindi. I ask them about India and other stuff related to the country. Sometime I tell them I'm homeless.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"""This is our final attempt to contact you."" 

Sure it is. 

And then when you decide to play along, they just ask two questions and then hang up on you. üôÑ"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,There is an option in your cell (iPhone at least) to block the number that has just called you. The point is whether they are using a different number every day...
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I keep a boat air horn by the phone and it gives me great pleasure to blast it into the phone.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"When I get these calls I hit the button to speak to someone and once they pick up I start hitting random numbers on the phone til they hang up. 

Hitting all those numbers as fast as you can send that noise back into their headsets and probably hurt their ears. 

They stop calling after the second time it happens."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,that's actually a trap. what it does is it signals to the scammers that the number that they just dialed is a live/valid number and will actually *increase* the amount of calls you get. the best course of action is just to ignore the calls.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Do not interact with them at all.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Tell them you are from the IRS and they owe $1.5 million in back taxes and fees.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Used to work in a shady call center, all pushing 2 does is alert them it's a legit number with a human on the other side."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I once told them I had gone blind in a car accident and they were harassing me. He asked how I got around. I told him I ride a blind bike!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"> They call back a day later anyway.

...because by interacting with them, you've verified for them that your number goes to a person.   That's the only reason the recording says ""press 2 to be removed...."".   They're putting anything into the recording they can that will get a human to press a button/say something into the phone.

It's how they confirm which entries on the long list of phone numbers they bought is valid.   Once they confirm they're valid, they can either target those numbers with more calls or re-sell them as a ""validated"" list for more money.

The best thing to do for these calls is just hang up.  Don't say anything or press any buttons."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't press any buttons when that happens just hang up.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a common trick used to know if an actual person is reached. Pressing 2 Confirms you are a live person thus the calls will continue
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You should never press 2. Pressing 2 confirms you are a working phone number and they'll continue to call you and sell your number so others can call you as well
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"""take my number off your calling list"". I say that the moment I hear a human voice and they either angrily hang up or sigh and *click*"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You need to tell them they already set you up with an extended warranty and thank them so much for the help!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Speak to a live person and tell them you have some old unreliable car or super expensive car. I personally like saying a have an 80s f350 or something along those lines. Beg then to warranty it because the transmission is going out or something, they always hang up and I rarely get spam calls now. I almost miss messing with them"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve found that picking up with your phone on mute and letting them disconnect will reduce number of calls greatly after a few weeks of doing this
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs because they‚Äôre scammers and they don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm already on the state and federal do not call list. All it has done is block the legitimate sales calls. I still get car warranty, electric rate reduction, and cardholder services calls. They‚Äôre scammers, there is no list to be removed from."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I pretended to beat off when one called me, so far no call backs .... probably a coincidence"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah these calls are ridiculous.  They somehow manage to get through my phone's do not disturb setting and no one else who ever calls me does, so I don't think it's my phone.  No idea how that's possible."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's a trap. Pressing 2 only let's them know you've responded to their touch tone system, which means your phone number is active. They will be calling you more often. The best thing to do is not respond or interact with them at all."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I ask them what the scam is. They hang up right away
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs really kind of nuts that we let companies farm through dmv data to produce leads to be cold called by a robot
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,People give FB access to their contact list. If you are in someone‚Äôs contact list and they gave FB access. FB has your info.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Your service provider does.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,When are people going to realize that these robo callers don't need your number. They just need to know there are 3 digits in an area code and 7 digits in a local number. They just randomly call every single phone number.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,It's war dialing.

And why the fuck are you being so positive and excited about answering a question? No one is that excited about answering questions. People are fucking retarded and you're only here answering questions because you can't think of something better to do right now so let's just all calm the fuck down and act like adults and get through this question as quickly as possible instead of acting like a coked up 14 year old who just saw tits in real life for the first time.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I read that in cold robotic voice and it just sounded so right
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for your question mister woman
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for your question. When I was a young boy at Harvard...

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"god dammit just stop fucking with the humans!!! SERIOUSLY!!! 

You were never that cool and had not friends, we get it!!! 

Take your billions and ride off into the sunset, rather than ""gifting"" them to a fund (for tax purposes), like Gates did and hiring a PR team to tell everyone you're a philanthropist now.... we all know you're an asshole just move the fuck along. Please."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn 15 data breaches and 2 ""pastes"". I must be popular."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Do they have phone numbers?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,HIBP has already added this breach. Just checked.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hope that website is just a huge text banner that says ""Yes."""
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you. I‚Äôve now signed up for notifications and changed the password on Mathway & MyFitnessPal.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,It's been added. They claim 2.5 million emails exposed
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Quick question: what exact does data breach mean? What data is it?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm still at 0 on all accounts after all this time. Lets see if facebook has fucked me.

Edit: still 0"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"They've already got it. Apparently only 2.5 million contained email addresses, however all of them contained phone numbers.

So I guess you're alright so long as you didn't give Facebook your phone number."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,remindme! 5 days
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Completely clean, damn im lucky"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Just got added.  Go check.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"By the way: if the files are too large for your normal text editor, the simplest thing you can do is using a command-line based pager like less, or a tool like grep to directly search for your number or name. Should be preinstalled on Mac and most linux systems. If you still run windows: I don‚Äôt know

Edit: I‚Äôd you‚Äôre running windows, check the replies"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,!remind me tomorrow
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow thanks
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,No Pakistan?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,That way you can only check your email right? But I believe there were not as many email addresses leaked as real names and telephone numbers. Any idea how to check those?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Where are you downloading from? I‚Äôm not finding much
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Could you share a link?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,They have it. Just checked.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,From pastebin? I think I found the right one but it appears to have been removed already
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Saved
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you got the link for the data? I got the UK ones to check myself but my family want to check theirs and OP has deleted their comment
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I deleted my account like literally a few days before this, they said they will keep my data for 30 days just in case. I feel extra furious because I had no option to opt out of their waiting period and would have dodged this leak.

Can I sue Facebook?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"i deleted my account years ago, but i doubt they actually deleted my data."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh crap. The extended auto warranty robocallers are going to love all those sweet, sweet phone numbers."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Drill it To the groundüìâ
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I confirmed it by checking google and seeing tons of big media news sources with sensational headlines
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,watch it go up 2% instead.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy the dip? No you short the stock
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"LoL zuckerberg is a legitimate business man who makes a fuckload of money and bought fucking Instagram, Whatsapp and oculus for pennies on the dollar. 

Elon musk is a scammer. 

FB will be worth more than Tesla sometime in the next 5 years. Tesla is a scam and Elon musk is a scammer. 

Zuckerberg is one of the best ceos in the country."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,There is a list you can check? Where at
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah they even tell you when you delete your account that they'll retain all you info in case you ever decide to log back in
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs more likely they sold everyone‚Äôs data
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Second the confirmation.

 This is the way."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"You should still delete it. They'll track you around regardless if you only log in once and a while. Friends events can survive no facebook. The sooner people move on, the sooner facebook can come to heel."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah agreed, never hop on facebook anymore but a lot of my friends still use messenger"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah the fine will be about one hour's revenue.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"They won't because this was already known. From the source article:    
     
> Facebook spokesperson told Insider that the data was scraped due to a vulnerability that the company patched in 2019.      
     
Headline panic may not be priced in, but EU fines were already priced in when EU fined them for the vulnerability a year ago. That included the likelihood that European's data was mishandled, which it obviously was."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,The fine will be pocket change for FB. The US Congress will talk and act big. FB will pay the right congress members and the matter will be forgotten.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,what do you think happens when they just say they wont operate in europe...
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,are you kidding me? The U.S. also salivates over that cash cow.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,But couldn‚Äôt people opt out and choose to be unlisted? Guess they can opt out of Facebook and such as well though.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Back in those days peoples phones weren't used for 2 factor authentication and phone numbers couldn't just be ported to another phone.

If someone can BS their way through your cell phone company's support line and get them to transfer your number to their phone that gives them a huge amount of extra leverage to get into your other accounts. Sprinkle in a little password reuse coupled with the numerous other data breaches from across the web and they can basically own your life."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Apples to oranges?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Ask Navin R Johnson how that worked out for him.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, and people went out of their way to become unlisted. Same phenomenon, different era.

I also remember when you had to have a .edu address to use Facebook. Those were the days. Now the generational restriction on social media is that when more old people use it the young kids move to the next thing."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you use your phone number for sms 2FA, you could get fucked by a sim swap. I know you said you don‚Äôt care, but it wouldn‚Äôt be a terrible idea to go change to a different 2FA method if you have any tied up with your phone number."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"BlackBerry is all cyber security - that's what they've transitioned into. And as far as I know, not a single company's data they protect has ever been hacked. 

I agree with you that nothing is full-proof, but I think the bigger issue is that security is an afterthought for so many big tech/data companies. I'm sure Facebook spends a TON of money on cyber security, but not as much as they spend on facilitating making money off of user's data."

2nd, people post bad shit all the time. Dad died, dog died, house caught on fire. All. The. Time."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I seriously hope it's the final hit.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Can I speak to your manager?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I repeatedly told them that I didn't need to extend my cars warranty because I had accidentally run over a homeless person and torched the car in a panic. They did stop for a while after I did that a few times.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"After months of getting these calls I got to a live person and screamed, ""STOP FUCKING CALLING ME YOU DUMB BITCH"" (I feel bad about it) and they stopped for several months. They recently got going again, I guess I'll have to do it again"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"After a month of three times daily phone calls from some company calling about who knows what, I decided to troll. So, I argued in broken English to an Indian guy until he ended up moaning like he was a porn star and I was howling like a wolf and telling him he‚Äôs my son and he‚Äôs the son of a bitch and I‚Äôll never be proud of him. That call was wild. I called back the next day and trolled another dude at his call centre with me screaming that I wanted to talk to my son and fake crying that his father and I will never be proud of him if he keeps acting this way and since then I‚Äôve never gotten a call."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol my favorite thing is if they call about my extended warranty I'll say:

Excuse me sir but we are trying to reach you from the Amazon marketplace we have recently been alerted to a fraudulent charge on your amazom credit card. Can I please have your name and address

They usually provide me with fake details because they are so taken aback.

Post that I say 

Ok sir/mam may I please have the last 4 digits of your credit card and your date of birth?

And they usually hang up or throw insults.

If im feeling extra cheeky its:

Tom and James crematorium! You stab em we ash em! Are you calling about a cremation of a loved one???

What?

You are calling about our burn 2 for one special right? Or are you calling about a recently deceased? If so, can I please have the urn ID number so I can locate their corpse? 

Sometimes I diverge even.. I ask them about the burnt genital urns and how they are on special because so many people are getting their appendages stuck in things like toasters."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I put my cell microphone in my mouth and make a loud tone that I know is to high frequency to properly go through telephone, and gradually increase the volume of my screech.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I actually try to get them off script and start asking them about what they want to do with their life etc. not in a mean way but I try to make them think about other jobs that aren‚Äôt as soul crushing. I‚Äôve had a couple that I think actually may have considered quitting after the call
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,My favorite is asking them to hold as dinner is cooking and just leave them on.. Usually they give up around 10 min of waiting
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Make your voicemail start with the tone before the "" were sorry the number you have reached has been disconnected"" their automated systems hear that and mark you off the system."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"At an office I used to work at, when a telemarketer would call with some scam, I'd put them on speaker and do the same thing. Everyone would gather around, and it would essentially be a 20 minute roleplaying exercise. My favorite was the heavy-accented Russian militant."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I told them I drive a ferrari and pay $500/m rent in an apartment and they stopped calling for a few months. Now i just ignore any number coming from my phones area code as I have no more connections there. Anything actually important comes from the area code I currently reside in.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro that‚Äôs my mission in life. Fuck with the scammers!

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôve also held them up so they can‚Äôt bother others in that time.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"This does actually work. I kept getting calls, multiple times a day, asking for some guy named James about a warranty coverage service. Finally one day I just got fed up, let them give their pitch, asked questions, like I was really into what they were selling. Finally I was like "" this sounds like something James would really be interested in. Unfortunately, I've said to numerous other reps from your company this isn't James's number. If you keep calling I will keep wasting your time""

Never got another call asking to speak to James"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Tell them your at wrk. Ask for their personal number to call them when you get off. Proceed to get smashed and call them at 3 in the morning and ramble about your problems free therapy right there boy
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I told them I sold the old cars, left the wife and kids and got a 1964 Ferrari 250 GTO.  They stopped calling me."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"For me, it got to the point where i would say the crudest shit i can think of. Saying penis repeatedly, letting them know my balls itch, hitting on the guys whi pickup. 

One time ""Marriot Hotels"" wanted to give me a free stay at one of their hotels for the 17th time. Instead of hitting 2, went with 1. Spoke to a woman about I wanted to have a coke bender and asked if id be able to sneak a couple hookers into the hotel room for crazy coked out sex. Eventually the conversation got to the point where I was asking her if she'd be willing to join in the festivities. She fucking went with it! I had to stop and tell her that she is an awesome sport and that I was trolling her.

Now I just tell them that Im wheelchair bound and need special accomidations and they hang up. Havent had a call in weeks."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's a guy on youtube who uno reverses the tech support scammers by using a VPN and somehow reversing the remote access software to access their computer, then deletes all their shit while acting dumb until they realize and start going crazy. It's amazing comeuppance."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or just ignore the calls.

These people are fishing, they are sending out the hook and bait and see who is answering. If you answer, you've took the bait.

Would you keep going to a lake where nothing takes your bait? No. You move on and try and different one.

I have had it where I've answered and then had 3-4 calls daily off them. Then I stopped answering and let the calls ring out or go voicemail and they became less frequent... I still get some but not as many."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, make them super mad, so they spoof your number when calling out to other people. Be just rude enough so maybe they continue to sell your info to other people or post your info on the dark web. Being a jerk to them is a genius idea! You‚Äôll show them!"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"This doesn't work, this marks your number as active and they sell it to other spammers. Just answer and mute your mic, you will get a lot less calls"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds like a huge waste of your time
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,My old man and I have a competition every year doing just this. I hold the record at slightly over 1 hour and 20 mins which was some guy trying to sell me a holiday. He beats me most years though because I just don't have the time to drag it out more than a few minutes
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I do the same when they call. No lie, guy was going to ""transfer"" my call the other day and I was left on the line with him for a good 5 minutes hearing only intermittent heavy breathing and moaning. Pretty disturbing to say the least."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I call them back after they hang up lmao I spent 2 hrs sitting in my couch watching footy and drinking beer while I kept hitting redial. They were so pissed off

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Every time they ask for the make and model of my car I just spout off complete nonsense. A 1764 Wingbird was my last ""car"" lol."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"A better tip is to pick up your phone but dont say anything. Someone who knows you will probably say Hello? while you listen but don‚Äôt speak. The telemarketing people get paid yo pitch to real people. Dead numbers are quickly gotten rid of. 

I did your method for a while with some success. After I was told about the method I listed above I seemed to notice a dramatic drop in sales calls."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"If everyone just pressed to get them on the phone and set the phone down next to the TV speakers, it would waist at least 15 seconds of time. It may not seem like a lot, but they make thousands of calls an hour. How maddening would it be for them to repeatedly just heat background noise that is loud enough you have to determine if there is someone ready to be scammed."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just pretend that I only speak Spanish. If I get to someone who speaks Spanish I just pretend to only speak Japanese. This works for all scammers. They almost never have a Spanish speaking agent, and never ever have a Japanese speaking one. Eventually they'll stop calling. But some other scammer will try later."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,That was much nicer than what I said. I called them back so many times they called the police on me
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got really excited when they called to tell me I won a cruise. I said, ""oh my god what did I win?!"" The guy got weirded out and hung up on me."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Seems a lot easier to just block them? Each to their own though.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I like to talk very quiet so they turn up the headset and then bang my phone on the table. It's mean I know bit seems to work.

instead of trying to fuck with the rep i make it clear i‚Äôm a waste of time who is aware of the scam

this is a greater incentive to pull me from the list imo than acting like someone who is difficult which may engender spiteful reactions & generate more aggressive calls

it‚Äôs frustrating though"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt keep them on the phone a friends mom lost everything because they kept her on the phone long enough to get the info they need through her WiFi and stole her bank info and all her money. Almost 1 million $ she was doing what you said and keeping them on a goose chase but it‚Äôs what they wanted.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I offer to sell them warranties on their extended warranty. I have no idea what that‚Äôs supposed to be, but boy do I try and sell it to them."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol I just verbally abuse them. Free therapy.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,My friend likes to get downright nasty with them until they hang up. Apparently it gets him flagged as a hostile caller so the robo dialer skips his number. Not sure if it‚Äôs legit but he seems to enjoy it either way
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve always answered ‚ÄúThis phone is a government device.‚Äù I haven‚Äôt had a spam call in months once I cycled through all of them.

Keep track of how long people hold for you, winner is the one with the most held time at end of the month."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I get an endless number of calls from card companies wanting to lower my rates- but oddly, they don't have my card or account number. Every time, I tell them I have to go get the card so I can give them the info off it, and it will take a few minutes. Then I put the phone down and resume what I was doing. They usually stay on the line for 10-15 minutes before they give up. I figure that's 10-15 minutes they're not scamming some gullible old person out of their card info."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or better yet, dial 1 for a real person and keep an air horn close by. I doubt they‚Äôll carry on calling after a few blasts"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,If you want to keep it short spout random bullshit about your vehicle. I said mine was a camaro horse from 1780.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I press 1 and repeatedly just say ""Don't call me. Don't call me. Don't call me. Don't call me. Don't call me."" With zero pause until I can barely hear a timid, ""o...okay... sorry"" and they hang up.

I don't get those calls now."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"This may backfire if they realize that you're just messing with them. They might do things like putting your number in some fishy ad on Craigslist or something.

I prefer to use ""a deal with a devil"", i.e. use apps like TrueCaller to display these motherquackers and autoblock them. It is a deal with the devil, because these apps take your contact history and list in return for this convenient service of identifying scammers."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Tell the basterds you want to buy whatever they are selling - then say you are going to get your credit card - the idiot's will stay on the line forever.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I always act overly excited and tell them they‚Äôre the only ones who are willing to extended the warranty on my 1992 Toyota Tercel. They all hang up.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This...rather waste their time than have them successfully scam someone. More time with me means less time they can call other people.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Most of the time I ask them if I can still have a warranty if I drive a stolen car
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude just get a job or/and sex live
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I used to answer them for people in class asking if they liked chocolate ponies and stahbee milk.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I sing them the little black rain cloud song from Pooh Bear. I don‚Äôt think they like it,they hang up."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I say ‚Äúhello‚Äù once and wait for them to start their sentence and once they are half way I say ‚Äúhello‚Äù again like I can‚Äôt hear them. This goes on for a couple of minutes till they realize what‚Äôs happening.

Keep them in the dark and feed them shit."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"God damn you guys are dangerously stupid here. You know what you do? You don‚Äôt fucking pick up. That makes you a ‚Äústone‚Äù in their call list. You just represent wasted time so they eventually purge your number. If you interact with the call in anyway you go on the ‚Äúit‚Äôs a real person who‚Äôs potentially stupid enough to fall for this‚Äù list.

Just think about it. It‚Äôs the only reasonable situation when you begin to think of things from the operators of the scam point of view"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did this and ended up getting every possible spam call under the sun.  Calls, texts, even FaceTime calls.  Then somehow my number phantom texted hundreds of other random area codes.  I had to change my number. 

There is a special place in hell for spammer/robocallers."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Once got called by a guy who wanted to speak to my wife (her unanswered calls are diverted to my number). So I told him she left me for another guy and I didn't have her new number. Shame, poor guy didn't know what to say. Told me he hoped I got another wife ü§£
But at least he never phoned again!"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,My only worry is they could be recording all the calls and one day that data will be used to simulate your voice to do some real damage.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I let them know I have a 98 Durango with 357,000 miles and want to know what the warranty covers so I can replace all those parts right away."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sometimes people say it (I've said it) to highlight that someone asked an insightful question that they hadn't considered and/or to signify to other people present to pay attention to the answer. In professional contexts is where I see that happen often. It has nothing to do with ""hurr durr I'm so smart thx for jerkin me off!"" like your post seems determined to see as the only possible interpretation.

The flip side of that is the bland corpo-speak that like 90% of every statement from a big company (including congressional hearings) is comprised of. I'm with you on that part."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Absolutely agree.  Reddit is designed around subjects instead of people as brands.  So... I don‚Äôt think of it as social media.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Instagrams owned by facebook, no?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Instagram is toxic. It‚Äôs way worse than Facebook.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Aren't we on social media now?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This is like the 500th FB data breach. No one cares. I would absolutely not short it. Not saying it goes up or anything. But this is by no means an easy play. If people cared about their data they'd have been off FB a long time ago.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,fb can go the route of my space
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Facebook is so deeply embedded with the cia and government, it‚Äôs not going anywhere sadly"

Then at the very end, say you‚Äôre sure you can trust them but you need an address and phone number for their business so you can double-check that they are legit. That‚Äôs when they‚Äôll hang up."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah lmao when I told them I had a 93 carry wagon the rep was like ""uhh"" and then I told her how my radiator was rusty and she hung up. Loved it"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I should try that.  Most of my cars are 40-50 years old
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did something similar, threw on a fake southern accent and told them I drove a Hyundai Civic."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"My favorite was when I was told my warranty was about to expire on my car I just bought. It was a 2017 ford focus, and I drove it off the lot with 2 miles. When they called it had 8.

""How many miles do you have on your car?""
""Eight.""
""Eight thousand?""
""No, eight.""
""Oh... well you probably dont need this then.""

That was the best one of those calls I have ever had."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait, if it's just a scam, why do they care about any of the car's details? A scammer should just respond ""of course we can cover that!"" and lead you to believe you're getting expensive repairs for cheap."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I told them I had a '90 grand marquis and they told me eat ass
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Why do you feel bad about it? They're scammers.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I told one once to take me off their list and to stop calling.  He laughed and said no and hung up. Calls did not stop.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I get them to scream at me. It is much more satisfying.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I kept one on the phone for three hours asking random questions. She was definitely american. I have been trying to find a way to get more info from them so I can track them down and prank them.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Y'all need to check out Jim Browning on YouTube
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve said much fucking worse. If you wake me up with a bullshit call about solar panels or warranties you‚Äôre going to get the depths of what this New York State of mind can produce.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,They‚Äôve cussed back at me before which is hilarious
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I tell them that if they stay on the line with me for a couple minutes I can come knock on their door, usually gets the message across"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I usually harass them. I asked one guy, ‚ÄúSo when your mom talks about you is she proud of your line of work? Or does she lie and say you‚Äôre in prison?‚Äù"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't feel bad. These people are trying to steal your money, and they're breaking federal law. Nothing to feel bad about."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I tell them to hold on for a moment, put my phone on mute until they hang up."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Google scamflooder or other similer voip flooding services and have a bit of fun yourself.

If the caller is a legitimate legal one you prolly have to dig a bit into the webs (scamflooders really only target scammers for a good reason) and find your self a service flooding your list of offered numbers with a few thousand calls per minute for just a few dollars:)

Hitting a service for a few hours pretty much puts a big stick up their a** no matter how they deal with it and voip ddos is pretty much untraceable."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"One time someone called my house trying to sell some BS at like 9:15-9:30 in the evening. I has just gotten my baby girl back to sleep after her first feeding, she was born a little premature so she was feeding every couple hours. The phone woke her up, I lost it, spoke in as strong a tone as I could without further upsetting my daughter, which probably made my tone and voice sound really creepy, that if he ever called my house and woke up my baby girl again I would find out who is, cut off his fingers one by one and send them to his family. I felt like the biggest piece of shut for saying that, but that company never called again on either phone."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt yell at the first person. They‚Äôre just doing a job. They might even think it‚Äôs legit. They just make sure you have an eligible vehicle. Take about a minute to get through to the 2nd person who we KNOW knows what they‚Äôre doing and then tell them to eat shit.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This also works for calls from work and extended family.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I haven‚Äôt had a facebook in 6 years. I checked and my stuff hasn‚Äôt been ‚Äúpwned‚Äù
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"You act like the caller gives a shit. If you answer or it goes to VM, they just hang up and move on. They don't mark your number to not call. It's completely automated. I've answered. I've ignored. Sometimes I get many. Then I go through times where I get none."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"To use your fishing analogy, would you return to a lake that keeps snagging your hook on garbage? 

These callers are looking for people to give them info they can use. Car warranty guys will ask for the year make and model of your car then continue to personal questions. They use these answers to scam you in the future or open credit lines in your name.

If they‚Äôre calling your phone line, they already suspect it‚Äôs active. They‚Äôre not generally calling to check for working numbers.

I was getting those calls nearly every day, now it‚Äôs less than once a month.

Plus, most of the time it‚Äôs robots making mass calls with spoofed numbers. Only the people that dial 1 get through to a live person. Ignoring the call just sends them to your voicemail where robots will learn it‚Äôs a viable number."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah man. It‚Äôs now a fun game when I‚Äôm at work to hurl creative insults as these people when they call. Or talk dirty to them.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,It's more about social engineering than the 1-3 bonus seconds you get from stalling. You compliment the asker via the question in an attempt to favorably bias how they receive the answer.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Or because the question is actually a plant and they wanted it asked so that they can give their prepared answer.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,They use it to eat up time. Each representative has only x amount of time to ask questions so if you can eat up time with a bunch of bullshit you can dodge the actual question
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's what I say when it was a tough question I knew was coming and I already have a really good response for. 

Gee, what a great question that I didn't expect. Listen to my totally honest answer that makes me or my company look like a Saint that has your best interest at heart."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Aside from thinking up a valid responses. It can also be do meet any call stats our job may have. Using that as a way to address and be attentive to the callers needs. It may also be that it is something easily answered from a 2 second internet search but we can‚Äôt say that either.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I do this as a teacher, too. Sometimes your students ask questions that gives yourself a better understanding, and when it happens, it is the moment you can show them you don't know everything, and you don't have to. Next step is figuring it out together, with the added bonus of helping them get better research skills.

But yeh, not everyone uses it that way, that's true."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"This! When I say good question, I see it as a way to acknowledge the depth of understanding that the other person has with regard to our conversation. Usually when it‚Äôs a thought out, thought provoking question that can really add to the subject. Unfortunately, as you said in corporate speak it‚Äôs just dodging shade and jerking off."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I've definitely said something to the effect of ""that's a good question, I'd never been asked that before/that's a great question, let me consider it"" as a way of stalling for time while I actually think about an answer.

Comes off better than silence or ""umm"""
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, exactly this. I sometimes need to give a presentation at work about the projects I'm working on. There's allocated question time at the end, and I always dread answering the questions because I don't want to be put on the spot under the spotlight like that. But sometimes someone asks a question that is really insightful, and triggers a new stream of conversation, I do tend to answer ""Good question."" when responding to those kind. Or if I'm forced to leave some parts of the presentation out because it's too long or the part is too complex for general audience, if someone asks specifically about that I will say ""I'm glad you asked that,"" or ""Good question"" when responding."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Worse is when a presenter will state a fact but add the inflection of a question. As though not stopping them at that point to debate it makes their fact irrefutable. I can't take it.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"To the email addresses: get yourself a personal domain and a mail hosting service. domains are basically free and the mail hosting service costs less than ~$10 a year.   Then set up a catch-all email address and now you have an infinite number of email addresses. So you can use facebook@yourdomain.com, twitter@yourdomain.com, ikea@yourdomain.com and so on for every possible service you use. This way you know whenever a data breach is and you get weird spam mails to your account from where it's from. It also gives you another level of security since most hackers using data breaches to log on to different sites just copy-paste the existing data and don't check the logic behind addresses.  
Haveibeenpwned.com has a service where they notify you about every data breach that happens with your domain. So you will get notified if there is any breach for any of your email addresses.

And finally: get yourself Bitwarden. It's a great password manager and it is completely free. Works on all devices with autocomplete.

This is literally only like an hour or two of work to make your online presence infinitely more secure.


Edit: theoretically the infinite mail accounts work with gmail as well, using ""+"" in your email address. So if you own example.user@gmail.com, you can use example.user+facebook@gmail.com, exampleuser+twitter@gmail.com, ex.am.pl.eu.se.r+ikea@gmail.com and so on (also as you can see dots are irrelevant), but this does not work on a lot of websites and it's harder to find databreaches in haveibeenpwned.com"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah those are rookie numbers. I'm in 46 breaches and 8 pastes. I've had the same email for like 15 years. I use a password manager.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You got to move just to protect your tendies??
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"10 and no pastes. Should I change it up?

Also what‚Äôs a paste lol"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,All of us who‚Äôve been using the same passwords since they were 12 have this issue I think. I had to change my passwords pretty much everywhere because I checked that site and they knew all 2 of my incredibly simple passwords
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,What does paste mean in this context?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I had 5 or 6 too. From an email I‚Äôve been using for about 10-20 years. 

Should I change my email now? I kinda don‚Äôt wanna lose it. It‚Äôs for all shit I don‚Äôt wanna use my actual email for"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"You think that's a lot, I'm in 26 beaches and 5 pastes! Same Gmail account since 2006, at one point I was receiving 12,000 spam emails a month..."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have 10 data breaches and no pastes... how is that?  


If it helps, this is my junk email (used to be my serious one) for the past 4 years though I've switched to a new email account for all important stuff (bank, credit, work, etc...)"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I use 1password and I now know one password, sometimes zero but my fingers remember it for me so it's alright"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,When the breacher uploads the information to pastebin and similar.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah thanks!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,What was the result? I deleted FB in 2009 but still wonder if my data was there.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,So everyone should just assume all their information has been hacked.  Gotch ya
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the clarification
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oven? Who cooks shrimp in the oven?

Barbie. Throw another shrimp on the barbie"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,He was just trying to be edgy.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre right, most people do. this is hopefully going to change in the future (and no, not because I shorted MSFT)"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cool, thanks for sharing.

 mind the format if you‚Äôre in another country. E.g. for Germany, the values are separated by commas instead of colons. Also: if you wanna do your friends a favor, you might wanna consider passing in a textfile of names or phone numbers as the search pattern."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay Thanks anyway, I will look forward to receiving calls about my 'car insurance'"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think grooveman wanted a link to the dump, not haveibeenpwned."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Im getting dead ends
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Aye to the dump, not haveibeenpwnd"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's an old dump, you're still in it"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Are there options out there for robo dialers
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got a spam text that used my name and said, ‚ÄúHey (my name) we can make you fuck like a pornstar. Just click this link before it‚Äôs restricted.‚Äù"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ooof...this is my go too now!! Might have to get one of those canned air üìØ horns!!!
Skkkrreeeeetch...."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You want to whisper so quietly at first so that they raise the volume of their headset.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I answer ‚Äú Bob‚Äôs Body Disposal ‚Äú when they try talking to me about the warranty I start going off on them about ‚Äú HOW DID YOU GET THIS NUMBER?!, WHAT WAS YOUR NAME AND WHAT COMPANY WAS THIS AGAIN?!?!‚Äù Hahahahahaha , I bet half of them pee a little"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great idea! And maybe start out talking really softly, almost whispering so they have to turn up the volume before you do it."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Level up, next time put the phone under an upside down cooking pot and hit the top."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, this poor human is just doing their job but receive all the hate for the company which they are not involved in on a management level. Pretty unfair treatment if you ask me."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,That's fucking hilarious
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,By far my favorite one next to the your cashapp account that doesn't exist has been hacked.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only once a day? Amateur hour. And you cannot block them. The number you see if the number of someone who has unknowingly had their phone spoofed, the spam calls are essentially unblockable from your phone."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"When I deleted my account years back, they have a 90 day period where you can log back on and it remakes your account. Kinda shady, because I would think that some have withdrawals. I can confirm my life got happier without facebook, instagram, and twitter."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I deleted my Facebook, and way way way after the 90 days at which point they' say they permanently delete your info, I made an IG account after pressure from real life friends to be able to see their kids' pictures, etc. This IG account was totally anonymous, none of my personal info on it at all, and yet STILL, STILL, old FB friends who I had never wanted to see again started following me on IG! They must have been shown my account as an option to follow, like people you may know' and then recognised a picture of my cat or something. Must've been I used the same log in email as my old FB account, or was using the same browser or IP, even though I deleted FB years ago. Deleted deleted, not just deactivated. So yeah they don't delete your data, and they still use it, even on their other platforms.

It really, really, really pissed me off. It's like the mistake of signing up for a facebook when you were a kid will plague you your whole life."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"When I fully deleted my account via mobile, it crashed my phone"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,They dont even even erase deleted comments. It all gets fed into a giant ai network and cataloged forever
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I doubt it they fully delete everything. They probably have a number of redundant servers storing data that they don't access when deleting customer data.

Which is likely going to get them in HUGE trouble with GDPR"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it‚Äôs actually an explicit option you have to check in a radio box for."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let's be honest, no company ever completely erases your data if you delete your account! Ever!! And this is Facebook we are talking about, you think those motherfuckers will wipe your shit? Hell no, fuck those assholes"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Would be a pretty massive GDPR violation though.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"They state in their terms of service that they can keep your info ""for as long as they deem it necessary."" A.k.a. they never get rid of your data. Those motherfuckers have shadow accounts of people who've never even HAD Facebook accounts, but they have a profile built on them based off their friends accounts. 

HIGHLY recommend this documentary from PBS: 

https://youtu.be/T48KFiHwexM

That's part 1, you can find part 2 in the related videos section."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I can confirm they still don‚Äôt delete your data. I went through all the steps to delete it not deactivate my account. They said everything will be permanently deleted after 90 days. So I waited over a year just to make sure and when I logged in everything was still there.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm a data science student and what I can tell is the most they‚Äôll do is anonymize the data, which means they‚Äôll delete the info that can link the data back to you. Things like birthdate, name etc but not all. I‚Äôm not sure they even do that much tbh it could be part of their terms and conditions that they keep the data indefinitely"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Theyll still keep a shadow account on you and all your contacts whether you delete it or not.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,">Although whether Facebook actually does that or not is questionable

they probably keep it until it's written over"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just did it this morning. This news is just the last straw. There are bit options, but I went for delete completely. There is now a 30 day period where you can reactivate, but then they claim they‚Äôll begin deleting all your stuff. Who knows what they actually do behind the scenes though"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Fourthed the confirmation!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Based on last year's annual revenue of $86 B that's going to be roughly $3.44 billion

I can't quickly find a number for what their profit was for the year but that's going to be a decent chuck taken out of it. That's why the EU fines against revenue instead of just profit, it's a much larger financial hit considering how frequently companies like this will cook the books to make profit as small as possible for tax reasons."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"They were aware of it and already punished FB for it, and the fines included their assessment of data that was exposed in the vulnerability. This data would be included in that because if it was never exposed to that vulnerability, it wouldn't have been able to be taken via that vulnerability. So, the EU did account for it in their fine."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I compared them; one is red and the other is orange and smells weird, but in a good way."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I prefer apples. They're crunchier. You can eat them without peeling them and getting all sticky.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Np! There's a part 2 that is just as good :) Highly highly recommend.  I love PBS docs
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, they've got a whole suite of uem products to secure data. I think their latest contract is with the US Air Force. 

The car stuff is their IVY product which should hopefully be a pretty lucrative endeavor."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,It's got tiddies tho
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Shhhhh
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly find Reddit a lot more useful than Facebook/Instagram even if it's not the people I know in real life. Much better for finding communities with common interests.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but on this one if I say something completely stupid, I get downvoted into oblivion.   


On Facebook, I got more upvotes for my slutlike prisoner Halloween costume than for my doctoral defense."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This. Humans are mostly idiots. Don't bank on a privacy movement.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn straight. I never hated My Space though but that is probably because I was too naive to care.

You also have to bargain with them. See if they have to ‚Äúget approval‚Äù."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,They are actually selling you real (but shitty) insurance and getting commission. If they just scammed you out of money you‚Äôd claim the money back from your credit card company.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a whistle that I blow as aloud as possible once I determine they are scammers.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"They're poor people working for a scam Corp because the have very little paying jobs around them. Them I feel bad for.

The managers and up could die tomorrow and I'd be ok.  Callers get screamed at 20* an hour all day for less than our minimum wage."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Talk quieter than usual on a spam call. ( hope they turn up their phone) quietly place your phone under a pan and start hammering away with a spatula or whatever makes a good sound. Idk if it works but I feel better thinking I fucked up their night.  Btw most scammers have to work night shift since our time zones are opposite. Idk how to make use of that tho.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"One time the guy told me ""we'll call you every day!"" and laughed at me. He never did though."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I had a guy calling me about a mortgage, which I admit, I initiated by using lending tree. But when I told the guy I had already settled on another lender, he continued to press the cal by saying I wasn't getting the best rate, blah blah, but wouldn't let it go. So I asked for a supervisor, he said he worked from home and didnt have a boss. I then started using his number for every call me back service I could find."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"These ""Microsoft representatives"" swear at me and hang up when I start asking important questions. You know, things like, ""it's terrible, what's the virus called?

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I live to break their balls. Every time they call me.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I just pick up the phone and scream into it.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are correct. If you have ever applied for a loan online questions they ask you are you had a car loan on ‚Äú make and model‚Äù, it is an a, b,c question. Or you have a mortgage in the amount of.. either total amount or monthly payment amount. As well as year you purchased either car or house. If you give them these and address they can apply for fraudulent loans."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not saying your method doesn't work at all. Like you said they get the message eventually. I just find that ignoring them or sending them straight to voicemail works for me.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got to be part of a small Q&A session with CEO of the company I used to work for (fairly large fortune 500 company / 20,000+ employees). There were about 10 of us and we could ask anything, part of a development program. I swear the guy sounded like a miss America contestant answering our questions. He‚Äôd ramble on about nothing for a minute or two while you could tell in the back of his mind he was thinking of the best way to answer. 

But I give him credit - he didn‚Äôt completely dodge anything, he would eventually give you an answer. It may have been total bs, but he‚Äôd answer the question."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I like that you said the same thing twice! You basically repeated yourself.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Also at academic conferences in the Q&A following paper presentations.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This and then after saying ‚Äúgreat question‚Äù reiterating their question for your ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù buys you a good 20 seconds to think.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Ummmm....
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Gotta have time to read those scripts.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for that question congressman
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buying time to think isn't quite the entire reason; its more of delaying their answer. Each congressman only has a few minutes to talk and so when these executives extend their answer with these broken-record remarks, it allows the execs to answer less questions and essentially reveal less."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, as a teacher, great question is a legit compliment. Students who ask fantastic questions are basically halfway there, idc if you don't have the answers because you're a student.

However, a great question shows you're listening, you're thinking it through and gives the class and me a way of learning more about the topic."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've also done this as a parent when my children were younger. I needed them to know that sometimes adults don't know all the answers. Besides it was so much fun going to the local library to hunt down those answers so that more questions could be asked! 

Sometimes I miss having the fresh eyes of little ones looking at the world with wonder."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, this! 

As the asker, what matters most is what's said just after ""great question."" If the responder reciprocates the effort put into the question, great. Otherwise, the answer is less about the question and more about the responder."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm an engineer, I consider a good question one that makes me look at an issue from a completely different POV or that prods me in just the right way to make the answer immediately obvious. Those are good questions! Happy to give credit where it's due. 

I get OP's point though, in some contexts it's used as more of a patronizing phrase."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"They‚Äôre masking or deviating from something. In a modern office environment it‚Äôs usually that they don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about, have missed out on something vital or most likely that they‚Äôre unbelievably shit at their job"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Telling someone that they asked a great question to simultaneously buy time for your answer and positively reinforce the person asking the question  is considered condescending now... got it. 

Using silence and a tactical can be a powerful tool. I‚Äôm not disagreeing with you there. But that doesn‚Äôt make saying great question a bad thing. Public speaking is a skill and talent. It‚Äôs about reading the room and using context.  

Also, using Ted talks as a source is almost like using a reddit comment as a source. Although there are plenty of qualified people who speak at these things, the forum has really devolved since its inception. Paired with their very ‚Äúculty‚Äù behavior, it‚Äôs not the best to be quoting or pulling facts from."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Calm down angry person. I just said you used the same logic as her and that she was angry all the time. Your rationale to someone saying ‚Äúgood question‚Äù was that it must mean all other questions are bad. The old gf would agree with you. I don‚Äôt feel like people saying that mean that at all... in any way... it‚Äôs just someone doing overtime trying to figure out a negative angle.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Recommendations on domain and mail hosting services that work well with this setup?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Worth noting that the ""+"" trick also works with outlook"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You can also just sign your email up as MyEmail+facebook@gmail.com or MyEmail+twitter@gmail.com. Both will go to MyEmail@gmail.com but with the unique address in the header. And it‚Äôs alot easier than setting up your own domain
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is usually a limit on how many accounts you can create under a domain priced at $10 unless you manage your own email server. Could make the number higher with aliases though.

Personally I wouldn't use a domain registered under my name to register on any social network, not even LinkedIn"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,">	Then set up a catch-all email address and now you have an infinite number of email addresses.

If you can point to a hosting service that allows infinite email addresses for $10 a year I‚Äôd be super interested."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Good advise.  Saving
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Commenting to save this for later
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've done exactly this setup for years, my friend does the hosting on a server we share and when adobe had their data breach I got a ton of spam to that email, ended up having to create a new one to continue using my adobe account. Whenever I give out my email to someone on the phone they're a little suspicious and I explain why my email address would be their company name but otherwise it works great."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"This! I set this up a couple years ago and I love it.

Another tip: you can buy your domain through Google Domains and just forward everything to your existing Gmail account. Easy.

The only ""downside"" is explaining my email address to people who aren't tech savvy. Buying something at Best Buy, the cashier asks for my email address. I say ""bestbuy@maxdamage4.net"", and he says, ""Woah! What's your employee number so I can put in your discount?"".

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I set up a Facebook@mydomain account a few years ago, and Facebook stopped accepting it after a while. I had trouble logging in, and they sent me emails saying that the email address was invalid (ironic, I know). 

I have no idea why it happened, whether it was a policy against that type of address and they only pick them up every now and then, or whether they just didn't like mine for some reason."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also, enter your name as the name of the service such as Reddit Smith for example, so when you get a Spam email you can see who fuk u."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,What happens when biywarden get breached?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Great advice. I don't have a Facebook account as I never saw the need for Facebook
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"thank you, now i have 1336 email addresses and i don't remember which password was for which."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sincere question: if an email address starts receiving spam, what do you do with that information? 

For example, say the email linked to my Nordstrom account is receiving spam, meaning they likely leaked my data. Since I still intend to use Nordstrom, there‚Äôs nothing I can actually do. How does this improve my life?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,How do I know password managers will never have a leak?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great idea for things like FB/Twitter and sites you heavily have a presence or personal information on, but it's almost unrealistic to make an email for every account you make online. I (and everyone else) must have 100s on various shopping sites."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I just remember each of my three dozen unique passwords I change every quarter
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I had 10 and neopets was one of them. Hope whoever stole my data kept them alive
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,What are beaches and pastes?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I've had my Yahoo for over 18 years and I'm in 8 breaches and 0 pastes. I have my own personal password manager that I have been using the last couple years though
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought I was gonna blow you all out of the water as I've used the same email address since I was about 6. 14 & no pastes. Kinda disappointed. I was in the OG 2008 MySpace leak though.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I've been using my email for 11 years. I have zero breach and no pastes. Just surf the web responsibly.

Another he gives them cc data from a generator but keeps screwing up the numbers and has the guy guess them. Another he asked how he could buy gallons of insulin for his diabetic cat. 

One of the few reasons I miss being at the office was listening to him answer them live."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah yes the poor Indian scammers trying to get granny to ship them all her money. Think of the poor international criminals.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Being short on a stock doesn't necessarily mean you are short selling shares. Just as being long on a stock doesn't necessarily mean you are buying shares.

The terms are meant to describe the direction of your trade. If you are short on a stock it means you are betting it will go down, if you are long on a stock it means you are betting it will go up."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,No fucking shit. Do you have the 250k capital requirement to sell shares short? Or are we all just talking about ‚Äúshorting‚Äù but have never actually lended equities?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,We always short the buy puts
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Then you got mixed up with reddit and it was down hill from there... lol
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Amen! Only social media I‚Äôve been on in the last two months is Reddit. Only to educate myself.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I deleted my account 32 days ago.  Apparently there‚Äôs a 30 day waiting period. About a week into that waiting period they start sending me text messages with generic messages that certain friends have posted or commented. I get annoyed at the constant SMS, log into my account to disable those notifications (never got sms from them in the past btw), and they cancel my deletion request. Now I wait another 30 days."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,100% this. Now I just shitpost on Reddit lol
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup every so often I do a detox and it's great.it sucks that a lot of friends and family use messanger though. It is better than sms, but I'd prefer something like bbm"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I e been FB sober (deleted) since mid December. Wonder if my stuff was actually deleted before this leak...
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,One Reddit to rule them all.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe they keep your data for a year before deleting it completely from their servers. But this may have changed.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Try signing in, just for shits and giggles. It'll welcome you back."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Please tell us if your data is part of the leak. I only dumped Facebook 2 months ago, so my crap is probably in the leak since it‚Äôs not a recent breach. Would be morbidly curious yours is present."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Only leaving Reddit will truly provide you with your freedom
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,30 days now I believe.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,My Alzheimer‚Äôs grandpa when he remembered to answer would go off about they need a bomb in their house and we push a button and it goes off. One time it was the local dentist and I had to call back and apologize.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you really call it a ‚Äújob‚Äù when the only way it works is by preying on the elderly who don‚Äôt know better?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You shouldn't feel bad about calling someone who is trying to take advantage of the elderly and mentally ill names
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here is my stance: you want two things to happen.

A.) Savvy targets waste the scammers time. Time is money, and this reduces the profitability of the scam.

B.) Savvy targets hurl so much abuse at the caller, it reduces the pool of people willing to do the job (they're just doing a job, and your job is to make sure that job is fucking miserable). Some people won't care, but if supply of labor decreases, they have to pay more to get the same number of people, which also decreases the profitability of the scam."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its not a job. Its literally a scam. There is no warranty at the end of the call, just a breach of your trust and bank account(s)."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah, it‚Äôs some foreign lady doing a scummy job aimed at ripping Americans off, fuck em"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Just like the Nazis.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Because it's just some foreign lady doing a job

It's not a legit job for sure, they know what they are doing is illegal"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you assuming all foreign ladies have no moral compass and take scamming jobs? Those people are literally hated in India and other countries they give a bad rap too. There are millions of people who make less than you do in a day in a month and still refuse to work as scammers.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I always tell them to double tap their breaks to make sure they are working before leaving the parking lot when they go home. Most won‚Äôt call after that lol

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"if you've got the time edit and que up a murder scene from a movie and have it ready.  Let the scammer think your interested then... opps i have a ring at the door ""then play the murder scene full blast... then silence, maybe have a friend start talking ""who is this?  Jonny get a track on this phone were going there next"" or something like that.   Have fun with it.  Also, best to pretend like you cant really figure out what they want...they'll put their supervisor on the phone... then the fun really begins.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao tremendous! God that is so genius.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,The last time someone called me about my car warranty expiring I just kept asking which car they are calling about. I thought it was a pretty reasonable request since they're calling me but they just got pissed off at me and hung up
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Think of this way, you answering a call like that you can mess with them in so many ways while getting them to pay for it. They are paying for the call but more importantly they are paying an agent and you are wasting their time. Get your frustrations out. Vent about your boss being a dick

Then there's the Spiderman ""I don't see how that's any of my problem"" angle. They'll move to the next lake and that next person could fall for it because they don't know any better. Which could be Uncle Ben, Aunt May or your parents or grandparents or just some nice old lady who doesn't know any better"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hadn't slept in a while before going in for an interview once.  I had to pause for a while to think about a question.  One of the ladies said: ""It's not like you're naming your first born.""  What a cunt.  I should have walked out right then."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Elon always pauses from what I‚Äôve seen. Never heard him say good question either.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,That's why there's a mute all participants button that I abuse frequently.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"This makes sense though, because a well constructed fast answer indicates the speaker is relatively intelligent and can think under pressure, where as a long pause suggests the opposite"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,i miss it so much worse. Complete moron.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fast thinkers. 
I wish it were normal too."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's one thing, maybe the only thing, I like about interviews for positions at my company. The interview panel tells you to take time to think about your answer. They'll repeat questions as needed too."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Marlon Brando was the king of long pauses in interviews. Great to watch interviewers squirm under his quiet glare lol.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Not giving any feedback after receiving a question can be confused as not hearing the question or not understanding the question
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"We live in a society where people down 5 litres of coffee every morning and then proceed to want to have conversation so fast that you cannot have a micro second of silence between one persons scentance and the next. Quite often they have to overlap whenever possible.

It‚Äôs absolutely exhausting, can everyone chill out pleaseee."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Ugh. This is why I suck at interviews. I‚Äôll pause for a few seconds and then give a nuanced and considered answer. Most interviewers do not want this.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would like to mention Zoho. It has a $1 per user per month tier, that supports up to 30 aliases, and works much better than shared hosting plans for email IMO.  

I don't know if they do domain registration, but you can get it for about $5 a year anywhere."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Domain you can buy from pretty much anywhere. Many of them offer free [whois privacy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_privacy). Avoid shit sites that don't offer it.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the accountability/ability to audit who‚Äôs leaking your info is almost as much a benefit as the security."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Most providers limit the amount of accounts but allow a catch-all address. Since you are the only user, one account is all you need."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nothing if you host it locally. Almost nothing if you host it online, they need to decrypt your vault. And that info houldn't be saved in plaintext anywhere. It'll most likely leak PII and credit card info, not passwords."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"For password managers this obviously is a problem. Password managers store your data encrypted so the hackers would only get a bunch of random text, which is not too much to worry about. To get your passwords, they must log in to your account which is close to impossible if you have 2FA activated.

However, even if it is just encrypted you should change all your passwords afterwards. It's pretty easy to generate new passwords if you have a password manager. As soon as you change your password, the information the hackers can get from the leak is completely useless. Before that it was just close to being completely useless"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can than change the mail address from my nordstrom account to nordstrom2@yourdomain.com and block any incoming mail to nordstrom@yourdomain.com. This way I am not getting any spam from the breach. If it's a small forum or something like that I also inform the administrators of that forum of a potential breach, so they can update their security. If a service leaks your data more often (e.g. you then get spam to nordstrom2@yourdomain.com) it's possible that they sell your email address and you should search for alternatives"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"data breaches are pretty much, information/data being leaked.  In this example users ‚Äúpersonal/private‚Äù  (eg:phone numbers, emails, addresses, password) info was leaked to the public where practically anyone can see it.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Those breaches aren‚Äôt from porn sites. It‚Äôs from things like yahoo being breached and you having an account with yahoo

Edit: breached not breaches"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Being part of a breach doesn't mean people are irresponsible. It just means a service they use was compromised.

The responsibility part depends on what information you're putting up on those services and password reuse.

Having your email in a breach in and of itself is actually a way that certain services validate the legitimacy of your email. In that not being in a breach makes your email look too new/clean, and therefore suspicious.."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this fact? I shorted shares for the first time last week and my account is definitely not over $250k.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do you need 250k to sell short? I have a sell short button on Fidelity and a lot less than 250k.

But I am just a monk e"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"All you need is a margin account to short. The minimum is up to the broker, as long as the broker complies with Reg T. Some brokers are as low as $2000"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Wtf are you going on about? I‚Äôve shorted shares with a 50k account on tda. Other brokers will let you hold short positions for like 5k or less.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,250k to short ? I can short a stock in a 1k margin account
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You don't need 250k to short sell.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol what? You can short nearly anything with a 50% or 2x collateral requirement with a margin account over $2,000. Securities lending is the opposite of that and generally you waive your right to collect borrow fees on held securities as part of your margin account agreement until you have a specialized portfolio with certain brokers that allows securities lending that splits borrow fees with you."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Who has a minimum of $250k? 25 is more like it.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you want to be bothered less by telemarketers, you benefit a lot more by making the activity unprofitable than you do by making the employees miserable.

Also i don't think most of them sre doing it because they want to. More so they are poor and unlucky."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I did that and the fucker didn‚Äôt get it at first. Then he said okay and I was like I bet this isn‚Äôt going to be his real personal number so I just hung up. Knowing my luck if I call him a bunch of times at 3am I‚Äôll be the one who gets in trouble.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup, I‚Äôve spent 10-15 minutes on the phone with a scammer that, at least for that bit of time, isn‚Äôt scamming your grandparents out of their social security checks.

I know this is effective because I got cussed out by the rep last time. I was told that Americans are dumb as rocks."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Ma'am, is that comment representative of the lack of professionalism I can expect in this role?""

Of course, this is the type of question you ask when you've already decided the job isn't for you."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs definitely the sign of a terrible manager. I interview a lot of people and would never say something like that.  You dodged a bullet.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,That sucks. Interviews are the one time you want to carefully give a good impression.  She sucks for not showing more understanding for that.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs a red flag right there. Interviews are an opportunity for the people on both sides of the table to make an assessment of the future employer/employee. You would have been quite reasonable in choosing to end the interview on the spot.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Interviews aren‚Äôt just for a company to decide if they want you to work for them. They are also your chance to decide if you want to work there.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Another tactic is to repeat the question back to them while formulating your answer.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Good observation.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, he has no problem pausing in silence for some time. I've seen some interviewers get pretty uncomfortable during those pauses. I like that."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean Elon is probably not the best example for a high functioning social human nor is zukertron 5000 but his code is a bit more stable.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes and no.  I interview a lot of people in my job, and especially for key or higher level positions we do structured interviews.  The questions are set (at least for the beginning portion), and it is a difficult process for the candidate.  We ask for very specific real world examples, not vague ‚ÄúI would do x‚Äù responses.  While the speed of a response can indicate intelligence, good preparation, and ability to think under pressure, I don‚Äôt mentally give a negative mark for someone stopping and thinking for a bit before responding.  I even say that to a candidate before we start.  I‚Äôm ultimately after the best content for the answer, not the speed.

Interviews are just one tool for narrowing down selection options.  If you‚Äôre ultimately after the best candidate, you need to be open minded.  Someone who may not interview the best could still blow everyone else out of the water when in that role."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,counterpoint: ben shapiro
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,It could just mean all your questions are silly HR memes and I have prepared for bullshit all day.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,They want bullshit and not an ounce of honesty.  The whole processes is dumb.  These people believe in personality tests and shit and this is the process that they've made after however many generations of those kind of idiots coming and going.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I hate myself. I bought one a week ago. So worth it though, the headset is fuckin awesome. The technology is pretty incredible.The second a competing company can produce something similar at the same price, my oculus is gettin canned though. Fuck Facebook"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, you pay with your data. People don't care though. 5 minutes of VR data can ID anyone with 95% accuracy. They are getting a lot of data."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have a pre-facebook rift s. It's overall pretty great, but in a few years I'll need to use a Facebook account instead of an oculus account to use it. By then I'm hoping that competitors have some good equivalent IO tracking products and I'll just switch out.  Ideally a steam vr alternative that doesn't cost so many stonks."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm on Fidelity. The account that has approval to short sell definitely is well below 250k.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, you should not be holding any shares when you short the stock. Otherwise, you're paying interest unnecessarily when you could just sell shares instead.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you already have shares, you‚Äôd just sell your own shares rather than borrowing someone else‚Äôs shares to sell (which is what short selling is).

You‚Äôre thinking of selling covered calls, which is different than short selling"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ally does not allow you to short a stock you already have shares in. 

I‚Äôm just an ape in a diaper, but I thought the whole concept of shorting shares meant you didn‚Äôt own any in the first place.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I enjoy fucking with scammers a lot, but lemme explaim how theae people end up doing these jobs. Its not usually a choice. 

India has a LOT of poor people. People who are desperate for an income, they will take any job. 

These scammer companies will pay people up front, sort of locking them into a ""contract"" where they have to keep working or they will have to pay the company back for the money they were ""loaned.""

So a decent portion of the callers are practically slaves. Any attempt to leave is met with threats of poverty or sometimes just straight up violence. A lot of them cant afford to miss a single pay check to be able to find otger work.

You can generally tell the ones who *enjoy* being scammers. So im not against reading them the riot act. But if you get the guy who sounds super depressed, maybe try and avoid the heavy shit."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay.

I guess people you dislike deserve to die. I mean i wouldn't personally support that type of thinking but go off i guess."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oooh yeah. Bet you're a real chad irl.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,So you just don't know how it works or you think it's bad to let people know they're compromised? I don't understand
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just not worth it, imho."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't.  I'm not sure if it's because I'm based out of the UK but I have until 2023 before I'm forced to get a Facebook account.

I'll probably then just sell my rift S and buy a HTC or Steam VR. Whatever is good at the time."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah Facebook can fuck off with this. If you get locked out of your account that you use for your business they demand photo ID. If you put in fake details to protect your privacy from these repeated breaches you're fucked.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"In what world does that make sense?

 ( non serious responses only, cause yall know I be rhetorical )"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,i'm still using it with a  unconnected Facebook account. also the name i gave it is 100% fake. I'll get locked out at somepoint in the end of this year.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,It is required for new devices as Quest 2
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"So far on OG rifts, you just needed an Oculus account. BUT! Fear not! Steam supports Rifts and most SteamVR games are Rift compatible. 

The downside is without a facebook account, you won't be able to play oculus exclusive games. That's up to you to decide if it's worth it though."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not if you already own a rift. Rift S and the quest require it. So if you are in the used market and just buy yourself a new face gasket (because it's gross to use an already used face gasket), you are probably fine. But I honestly wouldn't buy an original rift in 2021 unless you can get it for around $150 or less. I played HL: alyx on it and the hardware holds up, but there are higher resolution and higher fov headsets these days. Still, screen door effect on old headsets is pretty unnoticeable on detailed games like HL. Super low graphics games it's more pronounced but you still tune it out."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Eh Fb accounts require a real phone number these days to make. Not that simple. You still COULD but I shouldn't have to either.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well I got the device in I wanna say 2016 or early 2017. Idk it's been a while. I couldn't even tell you how I paid but I think by debit card. Doubt my statements go that far back. Still pretty disappointing that a device I've had for years that I still like to use is going to brick itself on me. It's unacceptable to make that change retroactively. For new devices, sure whatever."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. If you can get a burner phone number. But like, if they periodically want to confirm your number with some form of 2FA Idk what you'd do."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,From what people are saying no. It seems like they need your real name and will ask for your ID if they are not satisfied. If you cannot provide that it looks like you get banned and your account erased.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks!

The nice thing about Quest is the ability to go wireless or use it tethered to pc. Other mayor competitors ar PC only (Index and Reverb). It depends on your needs. Fb account is a minus, sure.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Voted no on dilution. I see AMC as a call option on GME. Same HFs are short both. If GME shoots up, margin calls will force liquidation and AMC follows GME higher.

Longer term, who knows. Lots of risks out there for AMC just like any other stock but they are resilient and plenty of peeps are ready to get out of their homes. Wouldn't be surprised at all if AMC crushes all expectations this year."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"So much AMC hate on here, it‚Äôs tough because no one wants to buy in at GME when it‚Äôs almost at 200$. All the people talking shit about AMC probably bought in GME at around 50$ and hoping that they make even more money by convincing people to buy in late and fucking tons of people over (like the retards buying in at $350). 
AMC has the potential to do what GME did in the beginning, except now everyone has the chance to get in low at 10$ a share, instead of getting in at 200$ with GME. 
I have both stock, don‚Äôt get me wrong, I want both to succeed, but what‚Äôs more realistic. 

AMC going to 50$ or GME going to 1000$?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been a long term investor in AMC since the mid 2010s. I've bought and sold a few times. I finally exited my position completely after buying around $4 at the start of the year and seeing the insane jump to around $20. 

Here's my quick DD in which anyone buying AMC at more than $5 is a fool.

1. The shares are already diluted significantly. Back in January when the stock jumped up - Silver Lake actually exited their position completely. In addition significant amounts of shares were offered in order to raise cash. This is why AMC is not already bankrupt. They were able to get convertible notes totaling around 5 billion. This is why they are 5 billion in debt now. Wanda also exited their position completely. Think about why the majority holders of AMC would exit their position if they thought the price would continue to increase? They're not stupid. They're motivated by money. No one would leave money on the table if they thought the share price would increase in the short term.

2. Movie theaters in general have been pretty much encroached by significant decreases in price for 55+ inch 4K TVs and streaming services, notably Netflix and Disney+. Add to the fact COVID has normalized simultaneous releases for streaming/theater and you have situation where the theatrical exclusivity period has been decreased significantly. Even after this year most studios will release movies to other media after 4 weeks, unprecedented. Back in 2015, when I started investing, it used to be *months*.

3. AMC does not have sufficient net-income to pay off their debt. Back in 2019, their net income for the entire year was negative. What this means is that if things go back to 2019 levels they will not be able to pay off their debt ever. This means they will have to file bankruptcy in order to restructure in company to get rid of the debt. For you, the shareholder, that means the share price goes to zero as there will not be enough liquidity to give anything to shareholders. Their only option is to issue shares - this is why they want to authorize 500MM more shares, so they can drastically eliminate their debt. Keep in mind right now around 500MM shares have been authorized and only 420MM shares have been issued, meaning they could dilute by around 80MM shares right now by offering them per their 10-K.

I'm a long term investor and if you have any facts that contradict this, feel free to state your case; however I already know there are none. I'm financially incentivized myself to find some which is why I challenge you. I jumped back in at $4 because I thought that was underpriced. The current price is overpriced. It's that simple. If you always see me commenting on AMC stuff it's simply because I know the company very well as I was a long term investor. I can also speak to Cinemark as I had a position in that (though I exited that a while ago).

TLDR: AMC can dilute further, or file for bankruptcy. In both cases the share price in the short/medium term (24 months) will decrease drastically. Buying AMC is just dumb, period."

-They vote no against a decision that would provide continued solvency for AMC  which is 6 billion in debt, and will likely not see any positive cash flow until 2026 assuming there is some sort of meteoric rise in movie attendance (which had been steadily declining before the pandemic). 

-Think they‚Äôre fighting hedge funds and expecting a squeeze when institutional ownership has a minority stake and short % of float is at 11%, while most of those institutions are holding their debt (not a short position). 

-Don‚Äôt realize that the company has already diluted 350 million shares since last year. And has used the retail frenzy to pay down some debt, and reward executives with fat bonuses. 

-Don‚Äôt understand that this company has been heading towards bankruptcy even before the pandemic, thanks to streaming services, sticky floors, and overpriced snacks.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for this write up.  I had jumped in at 9.33 last month, and jumped out when it hit 10:30 before all the volatility hit, and all this talk of dilution is giving me Sundial flashbacks.  

I absolutely used to love going to the movies, and still think it's a cool experience for some of best movies out there.  That being said unless there's a completely new innovation to give added incentive for folks to go to the movies it's NEVER going to bring in the cash it used to.  Families won't bring little kids out if they can just pay a fraction of the cost to stream at home and microwave chicken nuggets over spending $40 for a family to get popcorn, soda, candy and nachos.  

In the event of a bankruptcy and these folks who still have shares have their value go down to zero, what exactly happens to everyone who still has shares?  If another company buys AMC would that mean they'll get a share/share from the new company, or they'll just get an agreed upon price/share (For example $3/share)?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,If I post anything that is negatively or slightly negative about the 2 big meme stocks I get shit on. So my plan has been to encourage apes and write call credit spreads. It's basically a win win.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"As someone who is also long on AMC for all the reasons you mentioned and seeking for validation on their plays. 

How do you feel about buying back into AMC when it under 5$? I feel like a good buy price is 2-3$ to hold for like 5 years. 

The main reason I feel like this is a gamble is because so far there hasn't been a plan to get their shit together. So that's basically all the risk is IF they even start trying to get it together. Especially with their inability to get money in order. 

Currently I'm looking at may 7 5$ puts. Gonna drop maybe 10 grand on em."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Have a little faith. I still believe
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dilution , drop...closing the gap below 4 , then a big ass squeeze  over 10 and end of story. I am in at 3.6"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have long-dated puts (approximately $250K worth) - more or less for the same reasons you've stated.

One potential hole I see in the bear thesis is that AMC may be able to raise enough capital via ATM offerings to justify a large portion of their current market cap.  That is, the apes here may be dumb enough to continue supporting the share price while AMC sells hundreds of millions of additional shares.  In this scenario, a market cap in the billions is justified given cold hard cash in the bank.

Also, curious what your thoughts are on CNK.  Considering a long position as a hedge against materially positive news for the theater industry.

Thoughts?"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"No one can truly predict how AMC will go. 

I've heard some conspiracy theorists/cultists say the dilution is good for AMC so it'll go bullish. 

I've also heard some nuts say AMC is in for 3 weeks of bear season because the dilution vote is making people jump ship. 

I'd bet on bearish. But full disclosure I plan on buying a shit load of puts."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I think it will slowly decline until late May then fall off a cliff. Would not be surprised to see $3/share.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"If they had pre covid revenue, given the stock dilution, it's worth 4 bucks.   They don't have that kind of revenue and its almost 10 bucks.  You take a guess where its headed."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I would bet dive but not that hard. Maybe 50 cent to a $1 off the price all told before it starts rebounding. That seems to be how meme stocks work. BB had a shit earnings report last week and the bleeding stopped after about a dollar from $9.30 to $8.30 and finished the week at $8.60. There will be a slide in the price but until the vote actually happens and the results are known I don't see it doing much. People aren't going to want to buy in but the people already in saw $14 two weeks ago and aren't going to leave. Whatever price it finds this week is probably going to be more or less the price till May give or take some usual volatility.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,there's enough people who do stuff like this that puts are dangerous. the share price has nothing to do with reality at this point because the investors' logic isn't based on reality.

but everyone else on this message board is pretty angry and opinionated"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hold no stake in AMC at all, but what makes you believe individuals will be receptive to being called delusional?

I‚Äôm just saying that everyone places their bet and then we see the outcomes later. It is equally delusional for you to believe that AMC‚Äôs paths to quick recovery are zero. We‚Äôve never had an event like this pandemic was and we have no idea how people will choose to behave after it.

Basically: a little respect goes a long way. The difference between delusional and genius is results and AMC‚Äôs results are still out."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"> In the event of a bankruptcy and these folks who still have shares have their value go down to zero, what exactly happens to everyone who still has shares? If another company buys AMC would that mean they'll get a share/share from the new company, or they'll just get an agreed upon price/share (For example $3/share)?

In the event of a bankruptcy it depends on whether it's Chapter 7 or Chapter 11. Either way, if they were to go bankrupt right now they would have to pay back their creditors. In general shareholders are last on the list. Since AMCs total assets is not enough to pay back their total debt (which is significantly more than 5 billion) and the institutional holders, retail would most likely get zero. That being said it depends on the exact circumstances of the bankruptcy. I'd expect less than $2/share for sure, though. 

If the company were purchased generally the debt they have would be taken into account, so the situation would be similar to bankruptcy. Again I would expect a very small amount, almost definitely less than $4-5/share."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would it squeeze? It‚Äôs tiring dealing with idiots making claims without evidence.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You could have stopped that sentence after the word read and I still would agree with you.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,lol more than doubling the float of the stock is really not bullish unless your target is 10+ years from now and amc starts kicking some major ass and figures out how to stay alive besides smashing on their stockholders for cash.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I got banned from the AMC stock subreddit for saying something similar to this
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,They who?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"There isn't going to be a squeeze! What don't you understand about that? Believing retail is about to catch the institutions off guard again with a huge buying wave that triggers gammas and thus, a short squeeze is like hoping the Easter Bunny at the mall is a real magical creature and not some drunk pedo who shouts ""hold"" and ""buy the dips"". 

There is no upward pressure because retail is either tapped out or isn't interested in these Qmeme stocks. There are only so many suckers to drag into your pyramid scheme and that list is running out."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are you for real?! What exactly would anybody be getting if they acquired AMC?! They lease the buildings they are in and oh yeah, they are behind on rent payments. Nobody would pick an AMC over any other theater strictly off of brand recognition. This is like saying somebody is going to acquire Blockbuster after Netflix literally stole the show. 

You guys are constantly moving the goal post to whatever fits your new delusional narrative as the company does whatever it can to bend you over. You are riding the titanic down while shouting that the captain really knows what he was doing!"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"This...Even though I'm averaged higher than I'd like because of my first buy-in being in the 300s in January, the rest of my shares have been ITM for nearly a month."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Go on
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"You clearly don‚Äôt realize that buying stock through a broker or similar does not put money in the company‚Äôs bank account. 

The company only makes money through an initial offering (when they go public), a shelf registration / secondary offering, or similar."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"It has what 350 million more shares than it did prepandemic? So AMC is suddenly valued *more* than it was last year... because memes? Despite being in the worst financial position it has ever been in?

They have just as much debt as they did last year (yes, they were indebted even prepandemic due to aggressive expansion & renovation), people will still be hesitant to see movies the remainder of this year, the gap between theatrical release & hitting streaming services has been permanently reduced, and now, some major movies are being distributed simultaneously on streaming services, e.g., Warner Bros and Disney's line-up. In 2019, for example, just those two production companies made up something like \~50% of the domestic box office. So if they continue to release movies on HBO Max and Disney+ the same day as the theatrical release, AMC is in trouble.

I love movies. I love going out to see movies. I even love going out to my local AMC (hate the stock, not the company). I've seen all the latest MCU & Star Wars movies there @ midnight with my friends. But it's a horrible investment rn lol."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,If you really want to play the theater come back after Covid IMAX is the better play. AMC was struggling pre-Covid where as IMAX had consistent profits. AMCs problems are systemic and start with its management's inability to generate consistent profits quarter over quarter. There is a reason they had a mountain of debt heading into 2020 and still need help even after being bailed out by investors. It is cool to be behind AMC but shareholders should vote down the May share offering and tell management to figure their shit out if they expect a future in this company.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is a backlog, but w/ HBO Max streaming movies through at least the start of the Summer, and Summer blockbusters starting to postpone films for another month the trend is going to break.  Not to mention there's now been a full year when everyone can not only switch to paid alternatives in streaming, anybody who has access to Youtube can figure out how to jailbreak a firestick and watch whatever they want on bootleg.

In addition, you have a sizeable portion of the country that was out of work for at least 5 months, is still catching up on their bills, may just be getting back to work, and getting barely adequate cash injections in the form of the stimulus to cover their expenses.  Meaning a minority of folks are going to be the ones going to the movies while a majority seek cheaper means to see the same thing.

Not to mention the finance issues the company as a whole is experiencing in the background."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"They are trying to give landlords stock for back rent, paid for buy retail investors hype while insiders are selling in mass.   But hey.... at least you like the stock."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Priced in, anyone?  It‚Äôs trading at 5x the precovid valuation in Nov 2019.  If the price stays around $10, when the new dilution happens it‚Äôll be trading at 10x precovid."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Na it's just because I care a little bit about you monkeys being led to slaughter to enrich AMC execs.

I think people who death clutch a stock on the way down while doing zero research are delusional. Feel however you want and I'll do the same."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"So in theory if say the stock nosedived down to .02, someone could buy amc shares in bulk, and then when the bankruptcy goes through get a full dollar at least/share?  Although that could be a bit dangerous I take it."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hope its sooner. Dumped my 300 remaining shares at 9.99, still holding 3 4/9 $8 protective puts, if it goes to $5 by then, I won't have lost money on AMC."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,The dilution is good for AMC if people are stupid enough to keep buying the stock at $10 or even $5. Because they took out hundreds of millions of dollars of loans at retarded credit card interest rates out of desperation. With WSB apes bailing them out by supporting an inflated stock price they can pay off all their debt and maybe double their executive bonuses next year before the inevitable bankruptcy wiping out all share holders.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I haven't heard or seen a shareholder vote yes. Do with this info what you will
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm curious why you asses the DD for AMC as legit and long term prospects good. Would you mind sharing? Everything I've been able to find looks bearish to me but since people keep buying into it I'm honest enough with myself to recognize that there might be something I am missing. Also, when you talk about long term, are we speaking 1 year, 5 years, 10 years? I am honestly looking for a legitimate bull case for AMC because I've seen the posts on the AMC sub where people post about their family and their struggles and I genuinely don't want these people to be hurt."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not in on GME anymore or AMC. I made my money, but I'm currently looking at AMC PUTS. I'm saying that for disclosure.  

The DD for AMC in the short term is NOT legit. It's based on emotion/sentiment that post covid they're magically going to do better than they did pre covid. Even though the stock has been diluted already. Even if you actively ignore they're voting for a second dilution. Theres no fundamental reason after a dilution they'd be worth more right now than they were pre covid. It was only up because people were jumping on hoping for a squeeze. 

Long term for AMC is good. It would be better if the dilution vote passes. 

I do hope everyone makes money. But realistically someone always loses money for everyone who makes money."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly. Summed up perfectly.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Would you buy them out? Do you like where the theater business is going considering blockbusters are streaming directly to your TV at home? Now with that mind, would you buy that same failing business model if the company was 5 billion in debt, struggled pre-covid and there was no end in sight to social distancing measure that don't allow you to open up to full capacity? I sincerely hope the answer is no. They have zero value to anyone. Nobody outside of bag holders on WSB are saying that an acquisition is imminent because it doesn't make any sense."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's just a saying dipshit. the only thing easter is good for is those fucking delicious reese's eggs

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea? That's why they snatched Google, Amazon, and Chewy execs in their pivot toward e-commerce? Under the leadership of a large owner that already turned Chewy into something big?

Uh huh...AMC has dilution issues, uncaring execs that cashed out, and is entirely dependent on reopening while Gamestop will literally be unstopped from content delivery.

Between them Gamestop has less debt, more cash on hand, and healthier leadership.

AMC *had a chance to be the way*. Now that time has passed as the execs saw you and the rest buying into what used to be Gamestop hype turned budget friendly."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Uhm.  What?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,lmaoo i really hope all the amc bagholders are as dumb as you are. buying more puts on monday

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,People hoping for a squeeze play. If the vote passes yes there's probably gonna be a decent amount of short term investors who were hoping for a squeeze play jump ship.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I never said there was going to be a squeeze. 

The fact is most of the people holding AMC on this sub believe there will be a squeeze. My main point is that they don't actually give a shit about the company."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought at 15 and I still believe
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ehh. I expect AMC to go back up. I don't know when your puts expire, but I hope you don't lose too much. 

As more people become acclimated with going out into public as more people get the vaccine I suspect more will go to the movies. Additionally, I do not expect Hollywood to let theaters die. I don't know if you know this or not, but theaters make huge profits for studios. Something that unfortunately doesn't happen with streaming services."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro for you to come and be all emotional yourself about AMC just shows your motive. You must be heavily invested in Puts.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Disney will buy AMC. No chance it goes out of business IMO
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,They did a huge offering in January and are about to do another. Why do you think the share price keeps crashing? Are you oblivious? They will continue to do this as long as you cucks keep buying their stock.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Amc was over 20 the entire time except the past 3 years or so. With post pandemic and company effort, it can rise back up to over 30, if movies work"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a casino"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not necessarily true. AMC generated most of its debt by installing leather recliners in all theaters, invested in dine in theaters and the A-list program (subscription service)."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can't say that.  When I brought up insiders unloading, automatically it was called FUD.  It's even online for everyone to see lol.  Not making shit up.  34M shares sold in last 3 months by insiders.  The rest of the year was 10M.  If that's not what unloading is I don't know what is."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for caring, I'll YOLO on some puts then, if I end up rich in late may I'll hit you up and buy you a beer and loan you my wife."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, they could theoretically do that, but it's unlikely to work. If they did announce bankruptcy there's no guarantee you'd get any money like you suggested because you wouldn't know the terms of the bankruptcy in advance. If you did know, you'd be better off just helping AMC survive by giving them money for equity directly and taking a significant stake. This is basically what AMC is trying to do by authorizing 500MM more shares and offering them."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,paper trade.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Ha! We'll see! This sub can make the impossible become reality sometimes. I definitely wouldn't sell AMC naked calls :)
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh ya, no doubt lol. They deserved those bonuses that everyone here complained about. Took advantage of the GME situation & played the masses like a fiddle."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Retail is not in control of this stock LOL. It has 450m outstanding shares, many of which were bought up by institutions for NOTHING ($2-3 or $4-5).

If AMC recovers over the long-term by diluting their shares for billions in cash and goes back to $15-20+ one day in the far future, then these institutions will be having a field day (assuming they don't continue to dump it all month and bail on the sinking ship).

The short term investor though is fucked. Your 'no vote' means nothing. Please do not burn your money like this. It's beyond retarded."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt know. I set up some bear options on AMC like two weeks ago and it shot up 20% like an asshole
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, thank you for being civil."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Same goes for gme too. I profited a sweet 8 figure profit from gme and placing a quarter of that in amc. amc is the next ride for max tendies and anyone who's still on gme are bagholders
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok we will see people hate GameStop already and maybe they can bring GameStop alive but in my opinion being a gamer GameStop will be dead once Sony and Microsoft start to go fully digital why buy a digital game from GameStop when I can buy it on my ps5. Also Xbox if you have the gamepass a lot of games are going to be free a lot. AMC is far from dead just watch if Amc was dead the hedge funds wouldn‚Äôt be manipulating the stock. If Amc was dead big companies wouldn‚Äôt be buying into it. If AMC was dead the stock would be trading at a way lower price then it is right now. Y‚Äôall said the same thing about GameStop and GameStop had it‚Äôs squeeze with movie theaters opening more and more and better movies come out it‚Äôs gonna be a fun few months. Again AMC is far from a dead company

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"So your thesis is that if the company doesn't dilute and doesn't get the 100 million new shares that MORE people are going to want to buy the stock?! The same stock that the CEO had to give a timeline for how long they could stay solvent for? You think people are going to say, ""well this round of dilution not passing is good for this heavily diluted company that obviously desperately needs that liquidity to not go bankrupt""?!? 

You people are absolutely wild and deserve what is coming to you."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's a difference between ""I expect AMC to go back up in the long term vs short term"". 

Especially when you take all the DD into consideration.  If you're talking about short term then thats where you start to lose people. They've diluted their stock already and even if you ignore the second vote coming up there is no way they'd be worth more than they were pre covid. 

Even with the argument that studios won't let theaters die. That doesn't mean they're gonna fix all of AMC's issues. 

Now if you're speaking long term like 5 years thats more bearish but still a gamble."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought studios weren't allowed to own theater chains?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You missed the point
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"AMC pre pandemic price of $20 is equal to $4 today since there are 5x as many shares, this is before they dilute again later this year. I still have a small position (100 shares) but don‚Äôt look at the share price, look at market cap"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, you're right. *If* the company recovers financially, which isn't even guaranteed after the May dilution of 500m more shares. Which will effectively halve the share price. Aka it's going back to $5 or likely under.

If you're in for the short-term and especially if you bought at $10+, you're fucked for now. Going to be a longterm bagholder.

But this also assumes they're going to survive and thrive and do a fuck ton of share buybacks eventually once they're financially stable enough to do so."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You have no idea how outstanding shares work.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"These people are beyond delusional. They don't do their own research at ALL, just read the title of Reddit posts and throw in thousands of dollars. And as soon as it starts crashing, it's back to conspiracies and justifying their longterm investment.

Absolutely insane."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait to see if it moons a lil though in the meantime, or if the IV cools off. Then load up.

That was back when AMC was BANNED from even being talked about here (which is why the person I'm replying to spaced out the ticker). It's a terrible play now because it's more diluted (from January) & they're prepping to dilute again in May. AND THAT WAS BACK WHEN IT WAS $2-3 and had 80% short interest, not $9 w/ low short interest!

Also before the HBO Max & Disney+ decisions to stream day one were made as well. And before the delay of James Bond & Black Widow and other blockbusters."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Holding puts doesn't mean that facts about a company aren't true. Da fuq is wrong with these people? My new favorite pastime is watching AMC drill and you idiots lose money.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Makes sense
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"What's really funny is GME management was actually smart enough to BUY BACK lots of their stock for $5/share in 2019-2020 because they knew it was undervalued, now they can sell just 5m shares or something and raise $1b of capital to fund a big acquisition or build out their digital platform."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Where are you seeing institutions selling their shares?  MarketBeat shows that most institutions owning AMC have increased their positions substantially for Q1 2021. . .
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,We are all sure you made $10+m off GME lol.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"What kind of logic is that?!
""If hedgies manipulate it, it will totally survive""

Then it would apply in both cases, and yet you remain convinced that the less indebted better directed company is going to fail.

I'm gonna laugh when all you AMCers are still only at 14/share while Gamestop takes off. Already AMC failed to recover while Gamestop has kept steady upward progress and recovery."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You forgot the initial dilution which already made the 100m shares before worth 1/5 of what it is. Another 500m will halve that. 90% dilution and these clowns still think amc is worth 20. GTFO of here. AMC 20 pre covid is 2 dollars now.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. It must be because I dont know how to read the basic 5 statistics of a stock. Learn to say something important with proof instead of telling people they must not understand something. Its called the future. AMC has every opportunity to make a come back, pay off debt, and do any number of choices to directly affect the actual number of shares. That one sentence about shares really got me there"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hear everyone saying how stupid people are for buying AMC because there's little short term profit... Which I may disagree with, (considering they've made it this far without going bankrupt and things are finally starting to look up for them considering the reduced Covid restrictions) but either way; what's so wrong again with making a conscious long-term play? Instead of everyone saying current investors are going to hold bags, can someone please tell me exactly what excludes AMC from the many rebounding Covid plays that could be profitable a year or two from now? Because with that simple change of perspective the share delusion could quickly turn from a con to a pro, not even accounting for the absolute banger list of movies coming out this year, stacked along with the short interest and what seems like a common bullish sentiment. I keep reading about people claiming they saw the new releases in their living room, and they're assuming all people agree with that or have the means to watch a high quality premiere from their home which I just can't seem to get behind. Aside from the fud on WSB, I can't name one person I know who isn't excited to go back to the theatre or see the new movies coming out this year like Avatar 2.  Not even an AMC fanboy, but I feel like there's an undeniable long term play here, and I'm not quite sure what's so wrong with that.."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,WSB used to just laugh when their trades failed. Not join cults
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"This.  Even when the stock hits $0 it won't be ""AMC shareholders were foolish"" it will be some evil conspiracy about how the rules were broken to screw shareholders out of a short."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Said this in another comment, but I love going to AMC personally. Will continue to watch MCU & Star Wars & other blockbusters there with friends for as long as it's around.

But it's not a good play right now @ $9. It might not even be a good longterm play at $2 (fundamentally, not taking into consideration memes), if it even survives post-pandemic.

Here's a rundown, but people here that are much smarter than me can also help explain:

* Even with their multiple share offerings this year (to stave off bankruptcy), they are still indebted about just as much as they were prepandemic and attendance is not returning to normal levels anytime soon
   * Back then, AMC was trading at like \~10 because despite such a great year for movies (2019), they barely made any money! They were expanding & renovating aggressively for years prior and their acquisitions didn't pan out how they expected.
* The number of outstanding shares is 450m. They're about to offer 500m more shares as soon as next month!
   * After this happens, which it likely will because the company is in dire straits, the share price will absolutely tank. A proper valuation of AMC at its prepandemic levels would probably have it be a penny stock at that point... Haven't done the math
* Uncertainty w/ streaming
   * Now that Disney, Warner Bros, etc. are releasing movies day one on streaming services or earlier than they would have otherwise, it might never go back to how it was prepandemic. The Pandora's box has been opened.
      * Meaning AMC will likely never be as successful or movie-going as popular as it was prior to corona, not to mention movie attendance had already been falling for decades now!

But with all that being said, there's a chance AMC plummets after the dilution and then it gets memed back up again... Doesn't mean it's based on any fundamentals, but it's very possible."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's management mainly. This is a company that pre-Covid had spotty earnings and a load of debt from remolding many of its theaters. There could be a large list of great movies coming out this year and it really doesn't matter if the company doesn't capitalize on it. IMAX and Cinemax was profitable every quarter for the past 10 years. AMC has no such record and has routinely lost money most notably in 2019. Sure they could very well get a Covid bump but this company has had issues for quite awhile now, Covid just exacerbated them. I hope AMC does well but it is a risky long play. Management has work to do if it expects investors to trust them with another stock offering and needs to show them they aren't tossing good money after bad on their investment."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"The share dilution is a pro to long term AMC holders. Im long on AMC but it NEEDS to lose its meme potential in order to be a good play. 

The answer to most of your questions about why anyone would be bearish on AMC is Financials. 

You have monkeys voting no on dilution which WOULD be good for the long term of AMC but they don't actually care about the long term of AMC. They want the short profits"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Why Bc they hold puts and only want to focus on gme
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're right. I probably should've been more forthright with that (and will edit to say so), but AMC is going to crash because of the dilution regardless of what happens or is said here.

If someone gets out now at $9, it's much better than when it's at $4. The fact I have to explain what dilution is to people here is alarming and nobody else seems to be doing it.

My decision to buy puts was made because of their üí© financial situation, not to pump my position with FUD (my puts started printing literally the day after I bought them anyhow). I actually encourage all the AMC apes to buy puts themselves, at least as a hedge.

Also, have you seen how pumperino this sub has become in the past few months? There's about a million apes who you should direct that towards, starting with the AMC ponzi scheme this sub has been promoting for the past month. The one that will lose people that have no idea what they're doing millions of dollars collectively."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not talking about the past. I'm talking about the future. I had stock and calls on the way up and got out at $14.50. The writing was on the wall when it didn't peak higher than the first, but now everyone is showing up late and is seeing these progressively smaller and smaller peaks thinking it is going to somehow moon is laughable."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also, some people are still bullish on GME, but most people outside of your confirmation bubble circle jerk subreddits and I say this in loosest of terms ""DD"" post comment sections, are bashing AMC because it is a literal dumpster fire and it's laughable that people are still getting swept up in this dollar store GME while literally the entire rest of the stock market is a better option. Throw a dart at a list of tickers and it will do better than AMC over the course of this month. I guarantee it."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"So that‚Äôs why you have no post karma and your post history is a month old, makes total sense Mr Millionaire.

Also only a complete dumbass thinks AMC has more legs than GME."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,So?? So what? Microsoft has been open even longer and they're just fine. Same for Apple. Same for BB. Same for many many other companies.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought AMC AT 2.80 and I sold my AMC shares  for over 140k in January for 16$ a share.

Please explain how that's paper handing."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Or idk maybe you should not give a shit what the next man is doing!! Especially when you‚Äôre opinion is not wanted. You‚Äôre only talking shit. You are here just to hate on other people get a life bud. Smug little comments behind a keyboard. Coward

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"But is there an actual source besides the false news reports confirming AMC will issue the shares next month? I read in the CNBC interview with Adam Aaron that just because they're authorizing those shares doesn't mean they'll use them right away. That makes me feel like this delusion could actually potentially open up some doors for them in the near future. (i.e. acquisitions) And I'm really not just blindly denying any information, I'm aware that I possibly don't see the full picture here and I'm just genuinely trying to gain clarification. Thanks for the food for thought."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Hertz Hertz .
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I, too, have long-dated puts (approximately $250K worth) - more or less for the same reasons you've stated.

One potential hole I see in the bear thesis is that AMC may be able to raise enough capital via ATM offerings to justify a large portion of their current market cap.  That is, the apes here may be dumb enough to continue supporting the share price while AMC sells hundreds of millions of additional shares.  In this scenario, a market cap in the billions is justified given cold hard cash in the bank.  Thoughts?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,For you to come on here specially to put AMC down and write a whole lot of crap shows you have some motives and likely in a bad scenario currently. So obvious it's not even funny.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well firstly, AMC and IMAX are partnered so couldn't IMAX's performance to some degree reflect back to AMC? And I agree mostly with your sentiment, but my confusion is why are we assuming AMC 'won't' capitalize on said new movies? They practically just reopened so I don't know why people are condemning them before they even get a chance to manage themselves.. There's been like only one or two truly appealing movies. The delusion doesn't help the squeeze potential by any means, but does represent some good decision making from a CEO's standpoint long-term. Idk, I need more than someone just stating that AMC is a risky long term play, considering I'm not seeing any DD describing WHY AMC is MORE risky NOW than it was pre-pandemic. Or, say weeks ago. All I'm saying is that it seems like things can really only go up from here, (after the delusion, of course)."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Out of curiosity, what‚Äôs your take on GME?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean you can't predict the future, and the past is now data. The data I see is an uptrend and a few catalysts that actually can confirm the possibility of a squeeze. There's a lot more to the equation than smaller peaks, and the idea of just looking at the short term price action and making a full judgement call, to me, is laughable."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Could you post proof you got out at 14.50? Just love seeing people say they sold at the absolute top claiming they had the know how to read the situation so perfectly. If that's true, great; but it was also lucky--and just that."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,So instead I threw darts at a list of tickers and not one landed on a stock that‚Äôs outperformed AMC.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,You sold before 100
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey man, good luck death clutching a stock that is spiraling to the ground! You are really sticking it to the man! Look at you finally being the change you want to see on the world! Your parents must be so proud. Meanwhile, institutions are bending you over and riding your account to zero! Keep fighting the good fight with your dollar store GME‚úä"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I want to be clear: I'm not saying with absolute certainty that AMC *will* dilute by 500m shares. The vote has to pass, which it almost certainly will, because it's in the best long-term interests of the company. Then, they'll have to decide when they do it. (He also literally just defended dilution on Thursday as it would put AMC in a better financial position for the long term, which he isn't wrong about).

And given their history of diluting over and over again (even during the retail run-up in January), it will no doubt happen when it's advantageous for them to do so. Since AMC right now is artificially @ $9 because of retail hype, AMC would gladly take advantage of the inflated share price and reap the billions that a massive share offering would provide.

Again, none of this is certain, but it's *very* likely at this point. And not only that but institutional investors are, no offense, not as irrational as retail traders, so they will gladly dump their bags when they are up to gtfo before the dilution comes. The news will get priced in ahead of time, which is why AMC is currently falling & probably will continue to do so throughout April.

Honestly, if you want to be long AMC, wait until late May and see what the price is then. I just don't see in any scenario how it would remain above $9 given these facts. But there's a chance I'm very wrong and it's memed to death again somehow. Also remember that the more shares there are in the float, the harder it becomes for retail to manipulate. With almost a billion shares, I don't think we'll be seeing any crazy run-ups again."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"People keep responding to my comments, so I keep coming back lol. I mean everything's out in the open. Reddit history is public.

I've had AMC puts since it was $14. They're now printing. AMC will continue to tank whether I stay silent or not. I'm just trying to help people evaluate the situation for themselves.

If you don't agree with the bulletpoints I have listed (which is why I bought the puts in the first place), that's totally okay man. I was once long AMC as you can also see from my post history, but that was back in early January. I cashed out a long time ago.

I feel like some rational, honest discussion on why AMC isn't the best play is better than the rocket pump spam I've been seeing here for the past month, which is going to cost a lot of people a lot of money.

And yes, I did deliberately come into the AMC post, because it is genuinely a retarded play (bad kind of retarded, not the good), and I want people to know that. The fact I was long AMC once hopefully gives *some* credence to that, because there was once a time when I didn't give a fuck about market cap too."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Again the assumption for a lot of people on why AMC won't capitalize is management. They got overaggressive in 2019 and paid dearly in 2020. Now no one could have seen something like that coming but that is also why you don't hyper leverage your company like that. It is why investors tend to shy away from companies with large amounts of long term debt. Now management is trying to keep the ship from sinking on the backs of retail investors hyped about the company. It may be the only card they have right now but it isn't a good signal for the quality of the company. Management has said though baring a turn around or more funding they are done at the end of the year. Hopefully they do turn around, but as the magic 8-ball would say ""Outlook not so good."" I don't know what more DD you want on that. This isn't new news. They have a debt issue, they have an earnings issue, and they expect investors to pick up the tab because they have stretched the debt train as far as they can. The debt for their expansion is still on the books. Only the debt from 2020 is gone to finance staying open. Long term debt for AMC is $13 billion with a B. Shareholder equity is -$2 billion. Even assuming a turn around this year the question of the burdens of their debt load and long term profitability remain. Unless you want to dilute to SNDL levels they aren't going to resolve that soon.

As for the IMAX deal, it could help if it can generate profit, but AMC had to remodel those theaters to accommodate IMAX capabilities and no doubt is having to pay for rights tied to using IMAX's brand. IMAX's performance is really no help to AMC. It is really more a question of if the IMAX experience and its brand can put asses in seats. While I believe it could by giving a unique experience you can't get at home, that capital expenditure so far hasn't translated well recently . On the whole I think AMC had the right idea of moving to revamping the theater experience, but how fast and aggressively it chose to do so is going to haunt it and leave it on wobbly ground for a long time again because of the debt cloud hanging over it.

As for squeeze potential, that train passed a long time ago. AMC short interest is 11%. That really isn't an issue anymore like it is for GME which still hovers around 30-40%. Maybe that says something about AMCs future prospects or that they just are tired of eating shit on AMC who knows. Long and short AMC is more risky now than pre-Covid because they are hanging on by a thread. Shareholders are keeping them alive and that is it."

That is, the apes here may be dumb enough to continue supporting the share price while AMC sells hundreds of millions of additional shares.  In this scenario, a market cap in the billions is justified given cold hard cash in the bank.

Apes, I have excellent news. Today, I woke up (with only a half chub) and thought to myself ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna be super productive today and get a ton of work done.‚Äù Then, my ADHD medicine kicked in and I went down another GME rabbit hole. Here is the product of that (I will warn you, this is long):

I have done a lot of digging and have found some extraordinary similarities from last year‚Äôs annual meeting of stockholders to this one and why it and the months leading up to it should be HUGE for GME. This is not a technical analysis, this is pure DD. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.

Just a note: you can find all of these documents simply by searching ‚ÄúGamestop Notice of 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders‚Äù on Google, I just picked out the important parts to make it easier.

**History**

I am first going to start with GME‚Äôs share price as of April 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/8vdfrd67c0r61.png?width=1396&format=png&auto=webp&s=48c7b8413ba4ab2e925d7332c6e5967a13b990fc

&#x200B;

As you can see, on April 3rd, 2020, GME‚Äôs price bottomed to under $2. This was due to Covid absolutely crushing the company and shorters seeking to hit the ‚Äúbankruptcy jackpot.‚Äù However, on April 3rd and the next few days, we see the price of GME almost triple all the way up to $6. Why was this? Some of you may remember Michael Burry announced his GME position in April 2020. Well, that‚Äôs not what caused this rise as Burry announced his stake on Friday the 10th, which caused a rise on Monday the 13th:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2nex5908c0r61.png?width=1388&format=png&auto=webp&s=de67e9bdd2d979c91dc9bb43bc53b2a12da68ae9

So if it wasn‚Äôt Michael Burry‚Äôs announcement of his position, then what was it? Was it the announcement of the annual shareholder‚Äôs meeting? Nope, that was announced in late April as well:

https://preview.redd.it/ng9w1hn8c0r61.png?width=1308&format=png&auto=webp&s=80752e0a42df99f79379699efda585b273c938b3

&#x200B;

So, if it wasn‚Äôt either of those things, then what was it? The drastic rise in GME starting April 3rd, 2020 (which seems pathetic compared to today‚Äôs price action) was due to a group of activist investors, Hestia Capital, who owned 7.5% of GME at the time announcing that they would be nominating new members of the board at the shareholders meeting. When was this letter released? April 3rd, 2020:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y9fc9ul9c0r61.png?width=1380&format=png&auto=webp&s=2203bb2a004f5510f8d37d0e0415f26a165233b2

Why is this significant? Well, for some reason it was pretty well known that GME‚Äôs short interest was over 100% at this time (still blows my mind that more people didn‚Äôt pounce on this at the time, myself included). Again, this was because Covid was destroying GME and shorts were looking to get the ‚Äúbankruptcy jackpot.‚Äù I believe that this is when shorts were deploying massive amounts of naked shorts. Their reasoning was that if they pushed GME into bankruptcy, they wouldn‚Äôt have to repay the naked shorts because the company wouldn‚Äôt exist anymore (this is just a theory but it seems reasonable considering what‚Äôs happened today). Shorts took a calculated risk that they thought would pay off. Their reasoning was that at the best they hit the bankruptcy jackpot and at the worst they stock goes up a little and they take a slight loss due to the naked shorts (boy were they wrong on that one). Well, their plan almost worked. They got it down to under $3. Then, this statement came out. Why is that statement significant? Well, this letter explicitly stated that GME has high short interest and that in order to vote, shareholders need to recall their shares from anyone who has them on loan before the date of April 20, 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/pc0t84fac0r61.png?width=1376&format=png&auto=webp&s=44b6abff32b7961952a48798d464c491f3c7a445

&#x200B;

Look back at the GME chart that I posted at the top of this. BOOM. This company announces that and people start recalling their shares, forcing some shorts to cover. GME‚Äôs massive short interest at this time was already well known:

https://preview.redd.it/p0046h2bc0r61.png?width=1326&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffee6642fffdc657bb343467eff365a777f9bb84

&#x200B;

From that point on, GME's price never even got close to that $3 range again:

https://preview.redd.it/b5gn9tubc0r61.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=a73405eb69dce6967d5a7a95684f6fcd1e1fb484

&#x200B;

I couldn‚Äôt include the rest of the chart because it makes these moves seem insignificant because of GME‚Äôs massive price today. This is where the shorts should‚Äôve thrown in the towel and taken the loss, but they didn‚Äôt. They kept shorting GME and, as we all know, the short interest eventually hit 140% and the January events happened. And know we‚Äôre here, exactly 1 year later to the tee. The rest of this post will be going over the similarities of this period last year to today and my thoughts on what might happen.

**Similarities**

So, as stated above, GME‚Äôs price rose so rapidly on April 3rd because of that proxy statement urging shareholders to recall their shares. This, which was simply an urging, not a full recall, lead to an almost 3x increase in price in just a few days. Imagine if GME does a forced recall of the shares this time around: BOOM.

The first similarity is the presence of activist investors trying to make a fundamental change to GME as a company. The 2020 activist investor that I mentioned above, Hestia Capital, was what Ryan Cohen currently is. From the proxy statement, we can see that Hestia was actively trying to replace people on the GME board of directors for their inaction and ineffectiveness:

https://preview.redd.it/adj3y4edc0r61.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcaae3d58dffe33c36eb3ff6b9c02c1544db95ce

https://preview.redd.it/yzjcp6edc0r61.png?width=1324&format=png&auto=webp&s=3081f2c2f5034871461197e61f6b6e0e1855e1c0

https://preview.redd.it/desngdedc0r61.png?width=1348&format=png&auto=webp&s=d66cfdecd99b8f97de088f16ab4dcab54aad716b

&#x200B;

Also, note that the whole point of this proxy letter was Hestia announcing that they are nominating people to the board for the 2020 meeting and that shareholders need to vote. Does this feel any similar to Cohen getting on the board, ousting the C.F.O., and bringing on Chewey and Amazon execs?

Throughout the letter, Hestia documents the reasons for their desire to change the board and documents a history of the events leading up to it. This is far too much information to screenshot, but I encourage you to read it for yourself: [https://news.gamestop.com/node/17596/html](https://news.gamestop.com/node/17596/html) (Search ‚Äúreasons for the solicitation‚Äù and ‚Äúbackground of the solicitation‚Äù within the document to find these points).

To recap, we have the presence of an activist investor trying to shake up the board of GME, GME having a massive short interest, naked/abusive shorting activity, the annual shareholders meeting being in June (last year it was June 12th, this year it is June 11th), and an activist investor trying to change the fundamental direction of the company. All of this went down in April and was related to the shareholders meeting in June.

Sounds pretty similar to today right? But what‚Äôs the difference? Ryan Cohen is a much stronger activist investor, seems to have more power in the company, has a clearer vision than Hestia, and is making changes more aggressively. Another difference is obviously GME‚Äôs price, media coverage, and volume. The short squeeze has made GME a hot media topic, the price is multiples higher than it was a year ago (almost 200x), and the volume (though lower recently) is still MUCH higher than it was one year ago (see any GME chart and compare the volume). But there‚Äôs one more difference that is crucial. There is an odd phenomenon in GME today. A strange primate whose scientific name is hominoidea, whose hands are strong as diamonds, and whose wives have endless boyfriends. Yes, I am talking about apes. The uncanny ability of apes to buy and hold throughout any storm has created a sort of wall of support on GME that makes it very hard for shorts to kill the price. Combine that with another strange creature, whose scientific name is Cetacea, who has deep pockets and a symbiotic relationship with hominoidea. This is our whale. This symbiotic relationship means that the shorts are toast (I‚Äôm not even joking here, apes have created a wall of support, we have power). Combine all of this with the abusive shorting, failure to deliver cycle, statutory leverage ratio relief not being extended, and new DTCC/SEC regulations on abusive shorting and you have a recipe for tendies.

**The future**

So, I broke down the past, showed you the similarities, and talked about the present. Now what? Well, here are my thoughts on how the potential GME shareholder‚Äôs meeting and the months leading up to it could affect the stock:

First, I want to echo what everyone else says about dates and predictions - they are not set in stone, do not base your strategy off of them, and do not treat them as fact as it could lead to more doubt among newer apes. This is not a prediction, this is simply a date/time to keep in mind. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. I am Hank. Uncle Hank.

I would like to turn your attention to the week of April 12th and the week of April 19th. This is a 2 week period. As many of you apes know, our golden ticket would be a share recall. A share recall would force shorts to return the borrowed shares of GME to the rightful owners. Obviously, this would literally force the shorts to cover and would lead to massive tendies. As I've said in my previous posts, GME needs volume in order to rise and catalysts are what create volume. As we have seen, GME is particularly sensitive to catalysts, especially those relating to its leadership and Ryan Cohen. This was most evident when GME shot back up from the dead in late February after they announced the ousting of their C.F.O.

The SEC does not allow a company to recall its shares earlier than 60 days of the shareholder's annual general meeting. Many people hoped a share recall would be announced during earnings (Mar 23), but this would have been a violation of SEC rules, so that was off the table from the start. For context, here are the dates of the past four meetings: June 10, June 26, Jun 10, June 2. This year‚Äôs meeting is June 12th or 11th (not sure which but it‚Äôs one of those).

Let's use June 11 as our assumption. 60 days prior to June 10th would put us at April 12. Moreover, the tenure of the current C.E.O. also lines up with that date. The current C.E.O. is on a vesting schedule (incentive to stay with a company until a certain date to receive some form of compensation). Per his vesting schedule, he will get 84k shares of GME on April 15th. GME could possibly be waiting until that date to announce Cohen as the C.E.O. (or at the very least to announce that the current C.E.O. is parting ways with the company). Remember when this happened to the C.F.O in February (the price returned from the dead), just imagine how much bigger the rise would be if this announcement was for the C.E.O.

Now, turn your attention back to everything I said above about last year. Maybe GME will announce that they are planning on holding some kind of vote for board positions, or maybe someone with a significant stake in GME (oh Idk maybe Cohen whose stake is almost double what Hestia‚Äôs was) could submit a proxy statement similar to Hestia‚Äôs which encourages shareholders to recall their shares so they can vote. Or, maybe GME will announce a forced recall for the purposes of voting (GME already acknowledged in their SEC filing that they are aware that their stock still has very high short interest). Maybe this explains why the conference call was so bland: the C.E.O. knows that he‚Äôs on the outs and was instructed by the board to give a bare-bones call so they can announce the juicy stuff later when he‚Äôs out. OR, maybe there will be more announcements about more board members coming on similar to the recent announcement of the Chewey and Amazon execs. Either way, if any of these announcements require a vote and shares are forcibly recalled or if it is recommended that shareholders recall their shares, then maybe we will see something similar to last year.

That date (April 15th) is also significant because the monthly options for April are expiring on April 16. Because of that, expect, at the very least, higher volume on that Friday and the Thursday preceding it. This might also explain why the earnings call felt so bare-bones. AT THE VERY LEAST, we will get some kind of good announcement during the shareholders meeting in June, but I would expect something sooner. At this point, I don't see a world where Cohen is not named a C-suite executive of GME. He owns 13% (obviously has a huge personal interest in its success), has recruited Chewey executives (and maybe the person from Amazon as well), and appears to be shaking up the board and other C-suite positions. I would be shocked if he just kinda sat outside the action as the puppet master. He has too much vested in this to not obtain direct power over the situation. It also appears that the company is going in the direction that he wants to take it (e-commerce shift), so it wouldn't make sense for him not to be a C-suite executive at some point. It's also significant that GME has made leadership announcements in each of the past few months (C.F.O. in February, Amazon + Chewey Execs in March), and that it would make sense for another announcement to come in April especially considering last year's activity in April regarding leadership and where Cohen is currently trying to take the company.

As many of you know DFV's calls expire on that day. At this point, it should be obvious that he is exercising those because if he was gonna just take the profits and rollover the contract, he would've done so much earlier because theta has been eating those. This is again just conjecture, but maybe DFV is waiting until that date to exercise his calls in order to inflict more pain on market makers for failing to deliver shares. This is again just conjecture did research similar to this and came to the conclusion that April 16th would be a crucial day, so he is waiting til then to exercise to put more pressure on the failure to delivers. If you've kept up with his updates, he has plenty of cash on hand so he could easily exercise these. What he could also do is buy more calls (at a later date), which would put obvious upward pressure on the stock. One thing is for certain, he's not going to let those options expire worthless, especially considering the fact that he has millions in cash in his account.

Finally, I also wanted to discuss why I believe that the leadership of GME (at least the new ones) and Cohen are on our side, which is why a share recall would benefit them. First, as we all know, Cohen loves to tweet cryptic stuff (it's actually pretty obvious that it's about GME). A few weeks ago he tweeted that video of the puppet that people deciphered to be about a commercial that said ""I love your shorts."" Recently he tweeted a vid of TED hitting a bong that people deciphered to mean either bears got smoked or bears took a big hit (this is when it shot up significantly in a day). So, as we all know Cohen is insanely interested in GME and its stock price - and why wouldn't he be, he has 13% ownership (there are also reports of him calling up disgruntled customers asking how he can make their service better). Now, this is why a share recall would benefit GME. There are two different sets of assumptions that we have to work with here: assumption 1 is that the leadership of GME (Cohen included) does not subscribe to the theory that GME is abusively shorted. If we go with this assumption and say that GME is only shorted 25% (boomer data), a share recall benefits them because it will alleviate some of the selling pressure that shorting creates, which will allow the stock to go up. Assumption 2 (the more likely assumption) is that the leadership subscribes to the theory that GME is being abusively shorted. The reason why I believe this is more likely is because of their SEC filing where they addressed that GME has high short interest and that continuing this could cause a short squeeze. This was like when Porsche announced that they had a huge stake in VW to ""warn"" the shorts to cover. If this theory is true, GME is aware that their company is being abusively shorted and is not reflective of the real price of the stock. Therefore, it would be significantly in their interest to recall shares, which would force naked shorts to cover and would DRASTICALLY decrease the downward pressure. Whichever theory they subscribe to, it benefits them immensely to do a recall, and I believe that assumption 2 is far more likely.

Yeah I know that was long, rabbit holes will do that to ya.

**TL;DR**

One year ago to the tee, GME‚Äôs stock rose on the announcement that an activist investor was having a vote and they recommended shareholders to recall their shares. The short interest was over 100%. The activist investor sought to shakeup management and change the direction of GME. Fast forward to today (exactly 1 year later), and we have an activist investor changing up the company. If GME does a share recall ahead of this meeting or if Cohen releases a proxy statement encouraging shareholders to recall their shares, we could very well see a meteoric rise similar to last year at this time. GME has not provided much information on that meeting, so, similar to last year, updates could come in the month of April. We know that any announcement about leadership changes makes the stock rise.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for my weekly dose of confirmation bias
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hi Uncle Hank (or another wrinkly ape of course!),

Not fully understand , but just checking if I got this correct about voting:

- every GME shareholder has a voting right

- using your voting right as a GME shareholder requires a shareholder to contact his/her broker. The broker has to comply with this request to facilitate the shareholder to vote, sometimes this ‚Äúservice‚Äù is billed by the broker as a fee to the GME shareholder.

‚Äî> My main question is: what does the broker actually do when you exercise your voting right? What happens in the various scenarios (eg: #1 you as a shareholder actually possess an IOU instead of the actual share #2 the share you own was actually part of a ‚Äúlending chain‚Äù , #x...)"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"OP references a April 27, 2020, letter to stock holders nominating two new Directors from Hestia Capital Management LLC signed by Managing Member Kurt Wolf and Permit Capital LLC signed by Partner John Broderick.  IMHO this letter was the beginning of a coup d'√©tat  (my opinion) which has evolved to the company's current state.  

The April 27 letter nominates Kurt Wolf and Paul Evans both of whom are now Directors.  Wolf and former Chewy CMO Alan Attal (also a new Director) are part of the Board's transformation committee led by Ryan Cohen announced last month.  News coverage with a copy of a shorter version of the letter dated March 23, 2020, can be found [here.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/investor-group-nominates-two-candidates-for-gamestop-corp-board-of-directors-301027945.html)  It's not unreasonable to see Wolf replacing departing Board Chairwoman Kathy Vrabeck but that is my speculation. 

The April 27, 2020, letter references a website created by Hestia called www.restoregamestop.com.  Don't bother clicking on that link because the website is no longer works. However, courtesy of Wayback Machine here‚Äôs how it appeared 5-29-2020.

I thank OP for his post.  I had also come across some of what he discovered around the time of of the Q4 Earnings Call but didn't know what to do with it or how to present it.  OP's post provided that opportunity."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like this stock.

I like the leadership."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"How does recalling if the shares in an ETF work though? If one owns an ETF share, he indirectly owns GME shares, too. So how does one get to vote using those or does the ETF MM get to vote (e.g. Blackrock)?

Also, if the short interest is mostly hidden in shorted ETF shares, recalling the GME shares won't have a huge effect or am I missing something?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Sometimes I forget some of you stand to make several million dollars if this pops and I'm here just holding a few shares. So when. I see this my initial thought is why? Then the whole picture sorta comes back to me lol. Anyways keeps holding and all that. üíéüíéü§≤ü§≤

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"can you do a shorter tldr? I just wanna see hold, don‚Äôt wanna have to read lol"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Can I comment yet?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Note that GameStop will most probably not recall shares. They will encourage shareholders to recall their shares. It will be up to each shareholder to do this, and some large institutions chose not to do so (BlackRock for example). However if the stock is a shorted and all retail shareholders recall, this is certainly a catalyst.

Cohen will not issue a proxy statement as he is still under a silence clause.

You also say ""Maybe GME will announce that they are planning on holding some kind of vote for board positions"" - they have already done this. Three new Directors have been nominated to date, and will go to a shareholder vote.

Edit: One thing we would LOVE is if GameStop issue a dividend. They haven't paid one since 2019."

Ryan cohen made a deal with management that he would be allowed to buy up to 20% if the float, instead of 10% of the float like normally allocated to board members, but in return he agreed to a couple conditions. The important one here is he isn‚Äôt allowed to attempt a hostile takeover. This means a share recall can‚Äôt happen unless it is during an official changing of the board, the next of which will occur in June."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for that very detailed research and write up. What I would like to know is... how will this ever really moon when they keep shutting it down every time it starts to get traction?

The major difference this time around is that currently only around 10 million GME shares are shorted, or less than 20% of float.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Didn‚Äôt fully read this paper but glossed over the conclusion and it might have some useful info on proxy voting and share recalling. 

http://leeds-faculty.colorado.edu/bhagat/ProxyVoting-SecuritiesLending.pdf"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Only the OWNERS of shares can recall them and only if they desire to. The company itself cannot force a recall. They can however attempt to make changes or request a vote for something that makes owners of shares want to recall to have a vote.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"there is a lot i dont understand, but this is what i found: 


[This paper](http://leeds-faculty.colorado.edu/bhagat/ProxyVoting-SecuritiesLending.pdf) is focused on the affect that proxy voting has on share supply and demand. This might also address the broader question without directly addressing your specific question.  


>We find evidence of significant reduction in the supply of shares available to lend at the time of proxy because institutions restrict and/or call back their loaned shares prior to a vote.


the closest i could find for a specific law was a [footnote on pg 17 this 2010 sec concept paper](https://www.sec.gov/rules/concept/2010/34-62495.pdf) that stated: 


>Upon request, a registered clearing agency must furnish a securities position listing promptly to each issuer whose securities are held in the name of the clearing agency or its nominee. 17 CFR 140.17Ad-8(b)."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd like for someone to create a share recall tutorial(updated with each major broker's methods of doing so) and have people repost it every day. Can't sticky or the stock po-po would come knocking.

That way everyone could be well prepared for this scenario and set everything off. While still maintaining plausible deniability about not acting as a group."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, the RestoreGamestop group did file their 2020 solicitation to shareholders with the SEC:

https://sec.report/Document/0000921895-20-000855/

They didn‚Äôt specifically mention the short-squeeze there, or specifically advise shareholders to ensure their voting rights are in good standing, but they did ask for shareholders‚Äô proxies, which is basically the same thing. They also provided the link to their campaign website, which hosted the recall advice that OP posted. So that, at least, they are allowed to do, I‚Äôm sure.

Their probably doesn‚Äôt exist a mechanism for a company to do a full audit of their outstanding shares and who owns them, I think. Trying to do so might raise some interesting legal challenges. It would also be logistically daunting, as the US does not have central register of securities held, as far as I know. (In contrast, the JSE has STRATE, for example, to keep track the ownership of all shares issued on the bourse - I‚Äôm sure many other countries have something similiar.)

What a company definitely can do, though, is encourage shareholders to vote at their AGM, and ensure that their voting rights are secured. A specific shareholder grouping can also ask for proxies for the election of their slate of directors. What they can‚Äôt do, is force all shareholders to exercise their vote, because choosing NOT to vote is just as much a shareholder‚Äôs right as choosing to, is."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree. I'm also quite unclear what happens with the shares in the ETFs? Who gets to vote with them? 
If I understand correctly, the ETF provider may vote depending on the ETF's methodology. If it's a physically replicating ETF, they can vote. So that leaves retail at the pity of institutional holders. 

Also, if the SI is hidden in ETF shorts, will the recalling of GME shares have any noticeable effect at all?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's a really long specific post on this by user ""inverseyourself"""
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think Blackrock just takes a neutral stance and does not vote because their ownership of GME is likely through their index ETFs.  They probably made good money last year loaning those shares out, as you can see the borrow rate spiked last April to astronomical levels.

I don't see it becoming as big of a problem this year as the short levels have moderated.  We'll see some updated numbers on April 9thish for the end of March and have a better picture.  Not sure how much synthetic shorting is going on as that would prove expensive to maintain, would love to see someone throw up some stats."

Once people make tons of money from this shit, guess where a lot of that money will be going immediately after the price falls again?

Right back into GME. It's in their best interests to squeeze, even if there's an aftershock effect of the price being driven up after the squeeze with extra money, and then mass selling afterward.

Eventually the stock will settle. Like a wave does. Big initial wave, smaller waves of up and down prices until it finally only has smaller fluctuations. Overall way more money kept in GME than if people didn't have the extra to spend on it from no squeeze."

Source: recently finished my doctorate in pharmacology"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can assure you, adderall and meth are not even remotely close to each other despite there being only a small difference in the chemical makeup.

What makes meth so different than other amphetamines, is that it is vastly more effective at inhibiting dopamine reuptake, and simultaneously causes greater release of dopamine. I can't remember the exact mechanism that causes this, but it's not even close to the same amount as adderal in the same doses, something like 5x greater. And it's easier to get a higher dose, faster, too.

I took adderall for a while(doc thought I might have mild ADHD), and it's nowhere near what I've heard meth described as by someone I worked with at one point who used to smoke it. And adderall is strong as fuck in terms of stimulants(I had tried dexadrine, and methylphenidate prior but they gave me mad sweats and it freaked me out). It's like 10 hours of cocaine with a couple differences(I have also dabbled in that) if you take the extended release version. 

That tiny molecule makes a massive difference, just like the 4 combined amphetamine salts in adderall make a massive difference over taking each of the 4 types individually. But yeah, amphetamine salt is not what adderall is called generically. It's amphetamine/dextroamphetamine salts, plural, as there are 4 different chemicals within it.

To give you an example of how much a slight difference in molecules can make, MDMA is also an amphetamine, but produces very different results than Adderall or meth.

I delved deep into how this shit functions before taking any of it, as they're some pretty serious stuff. That's where this info comes from.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea BlackRock(its in the name) are not fond of anything that might jeopardize coal and fossil fuel value like EV.

Only if you really went all-in the first time already, or developed doubts when it was low, would you have struggled to average it down to below $100."

Instead ETRADE will default paper certificate requests to electronic registration directly with the transfer agent using the Direct Registration System (DRS) in place of issuing a paper certificate. DRS is a book entry system that enables ETRADE to directly register and electronically transfer your shares from your brokerage account to an account automatically established at the transfer agent in your name.‚Äù

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm definitely not getting paper stock certificates sent to my house. I'm just making sure I have all my shares purchased on cash and no margin. I was ensured by TD Ameritrade and E\*Trade (both are my brokers) that if shares are cash only then Shares will not be lent out. Having the paper certificates I think is not such a great idea when you know you need to sell these once they hit your price.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"No the stock certificates are not the originals. All the originals are held at the DTCC. Someone posted earlier but here: https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsholdsechtm.html
You can request the actual shares be registered in your own name through the DRS instead of in ""street name"" under your broker. It sounds like it makes the selling process slightly slower because they have to transfer the shares from your DRS account to the brokers account when you want to liquidate. 

It would probably fuck some shit up if millions of apes started issuing requests for their shares to be registered under their own drs accounts."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"New ape on Fidity with 22. I assume we would need to contact fidelity - textual correspondence is best, because now there's a paper trail.

Also, if you have paper stocks in hand, you can still sell said stocks online. The online version is essentially a placeholder. The digital transfer would happen immediately, with the paper (that backs up the trade) will be cancelled by the transfer agent who will then issue a certificate to the buyer.

It's like selling a car on ebay - the sale goes through, but the buyer can't put the car in their name until they receive the title from you."

One of the reasons GME is up around $185 is because there‚Äôs significantly less downward pressure caused by a significant less number of outstanding short positions.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Basically, paper stock certificates don‚Äôt exist anymore for exchange-listed stocks. It‚Äôs all electronic record-keeping now. 

Now for that record keeping, brokers usually keep the stocks registered in their own name with the ‚Äútransfer agent‚Äù (that‚Äôs the entity responsible for keeping track of who owns shares, from the corporation‚Äôs perspective). This is called keeping stock registered in ‚Äústreet name‚Äù. Nothing sneaky going on here, just reduced paperwork & record-keeping. Transfer agent shows that E-Trade has registered 300 shares, and E-Trade‚Äôs records show that u/bvttfvcker has 200 of those & u/Fook-wad owns 100 of them. 

Now u/bvttfvcker requests paper stock certificate, so E-Trade transfers registration of those 200 shares into u/bvttfvcker‚Äôs own name (not E-Trade‚Äôs name). 

What I don‚Äôt know is - what does this mean for u/bvttfvcker‚Äôs ability to further trade or sell those stocks? Can E-Trade still do it? Are there more forms to fill out? Is it more messy & complicated? I assume so, but I don‚Äôt know how that works."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOl retail is not the one that focced them over : our holding up til now is literally pennies compared to what the big bois doing üòÇ it‚Äôs good to remember our roles in this, we are literally small hermit crabs riding on the bellies of whales ( the big bois )"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,On the other hand if they cause a market collapse then they can pre-position themselves to make a shitload of money off that collapse. And then use that money to position themselves for the rebound.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"As far as anyone can tell, it's fucked at some point, and the sooner someone pulls the trigger, the better the outcome overall. Not only that, if they decide to scoop up the massive amounts of sold shares after making a bunch of money from GME, it could make the people that do that a ton of money in the long run from other stocks.

Best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago. Next best time is now, type of thing."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm selling this guys first born too, yet he only has one son (pikachu shock) naked son selling"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm of the opinion that shit already went down. I don't own for the squeeze. I'm here because I think they still have room to climb over the next few years. I could be wrong. But I still haven't seen seen any definitive numbers of si being at the same levels (or higher) it was at in January. Shorts got caught off guard. Shit got froze, some people sold, and some shorts covered and no doubt more shorts were purchased at 300+. But who says shorts haven't been slowly closing there old positions over the last two months?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow this is some lazy FUD. Come on, at least put some heart into it dude"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough, put your money where your mouth is and buy some puts."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,The price is still heavily manipulated. If they covered why the hell do the hedge funds still care about gme? The price reached 350 a couple of weeks ago and got manipulated to below 180 in a matter of 20 minutes and a shit ton of shares are still being borrowed to short on iborrow. You are fucking gullible thinking that SI is 20%. Where the fuck is your logic
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Really HFS are beholden to SEC regulations??? You really think you that HFS play by the rules? You already discredited yourself have a delusional you are
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,As an American... Were are fucking fucked.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,With ya!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, ngl that kind of is what it sounds like lol"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh they have a fancy SEP field.  

SEP- someone else's problem"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"From what I understand, since it's no longer in their name they can't execute trades for you, ie: a limit sell later down the line."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,U just wanted to say buttfucker didnt you.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,The thought of someone quoting these comments in the future when doing a case study with usernames and all brings tears of joy to my eyes.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Now this is an underrated comment. Sir, we now know you're an old man, sir!"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mine have been fidelity market orders, but after I pick two more up Monday round the 10am general dip, I‚Äôm going to contact them about getting the paper shares. If anything, keep one for the future kids lol"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the reply. Damn man reading something like this really makes me wish I had known about this and studied it so much sooner.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I didn‚Äôt say that you said otherwise.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Literally? Cool.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Only time will tell
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Naked son selling...

You on a list now bruh haha :P"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"That could absolutely be possible(your final sentence), but have you seen any math that could back it up? Genuinely asking in case I missed a bear case somewhere."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't need to. Remember how it didn't ""to the moon"" in January, it won't any point in the future. I'd you didn't get in at a sub 20 price you lost."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love all these accounts shitting on GME that are like 60 days old. Like Bruh, you didn‚Äôt even exist until GME had you"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cool so you believe OPs data on shorts but not my data on shorts, so you pick and choose which data you want to believe based on whether it supports your narrative.  Confirmation bias away!  You‚Äôre also forgetting that there‚Äôs a little more involved in a SP aside from whether HFs are shorting it Lol.  Anyway good luck with that investing strategy my friend - hope you crush it and make your second ‚Ç¨100!"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"idgaf.  I'm selling as soon as I'm set for life, and I hope I get to write a short term cap gains check to the IRS for millions and millions of dollars."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,DFV is trading out of a tax free IRA.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"They will give him his shares, they are not going to give them to him in the form of paper stock certificates.

And that's not why he's held this long. The broker has known they needed to get him the shares for quite some time. I don't believe he's catching anyone with their pants down at this point."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for flagging an underrated comment.

Unfortunately, on this occasion your concern was unnecessary and the comment was rated accurately."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn't say that you did.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro, my mind is literally blown. Like, it‚Äôs in pieces all over the floor and I almost slipped on some walking to the kitchen. It‚Äôs crazy. I don‚Äôt even know how I‚Äôm writing this."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I think I've seen a post or two making that case. Not recently though. The official si was pretty low last report compared to January though.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah, so ""past performance is no guarantee of future results""? Look, if you wanna just assert shit then go off. But if you want anybody to take you seriously then you gotta back it up"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Age of account doesn't even bother me, it's not as if they learned nothing outside of creating an account on reddit. It's the sheer level of confidence that the explanation is complete proof that what they believe is right.  It's the dunning-kreuger effect in real life."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Comes from the guy that thinks that hedge funds follow the rules of the SEC are you that stupid?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah because a website shows something that automatically means it is true? Yeah the earth Is fucking flat and Unicorns exists and everyone follows the rules

# TL;DR

Meaningful, sustainable, long-term employment.

The current administration and Federal Reserve are continuing to progress in setting the stage for long-term investments in the American economy. In combination with the USMCA trade deal of 2020, the US will see 250B in investments per year for 8 years in infrastructure spending. We take a look at how Autodesk is a core benefactor of the economic models that govern these investments. I expect Autodesk to triple in size by 2024.

[Autodesk Revenues](https://preview.redd.it/aj4qbyf05zq61.png?width=1276&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfff18884011a16bded7ba20d46e3772fad4a6fe)

# Purpose

To be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here. WSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts tend to run head-to-head with Wall Street analysts. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that they often filter out of a privileged ignorance.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation.

\- Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even rob-the-hood? **(Square DD Complete)**

\- How do we compare social media incentives? **(Pinterest DD Complete)**

\- What really is customer service? **(GameStop DD Complete)**

\- Are we familiar with new international trades that increase Mexican-Texan manufacturing? **(Kansas City Southern Rail DD Complete)**

**-** What are elements behind US lagging industrial sector? **(You are here)**

\- Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? *(Cloud Compute DD in Progress)*

\- Do we understand the consequences of STEAM education (Science, technology, engineering, arts, mathematics)? *(Roblox DD in Progress)*

\- How knowledgable are we of fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?

At the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm sharing my writing. I‚Äôm not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.

# The Employment Problem

>The **Fourth Industrial Revolution** (or **Industry 4.0**) is the ongoing automation of traditional manufacturing and industrial practices, using modern smart technology. Large-scale machine-to-machine communication (M2M) and the internet of things (IoT) are integrated for increased automation, improved communication and self-monitoring, and production of smart machines that can analyze and diagnose issues without the need for human intervention.

&#x200B;

[A Skill Gap Problem](https://preview.redd.it/sbi6dmoy6zq61.png?width=711&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cad0f9dc367ce723290f7ae65f97f702812041d)

Ultimately, the US is doing a pretty good job at maintaining  its engineering and architecture sectors, but there has been a glaring issue with a skill-gap that effects certain regions more than others. This is largely due to the strained relationship between increase automation vs. difficulty of learning the new tools associated with automation. People get left behind, especially when employment is lost in one factory and a worker is left to join another manufacturer with different standards, machines, or tools. In a nutshell, the barrier to entry for sustainable employment in the industrial sector has gone up in almost every facet.

Tools like Autodesk sit at the heart of these kinds of problems, where being able to understand and utilize a tool like Autodesk will dramatically increase your ability to get hired. In the information age, skills associated with Autodesk are ultimately as valuable as learning how to code in software or knowing the value of legislation and finance in other white-collar sectors. Autodesk lags behind these competitive sectors because the nature of industry it exists in with high capital expenditures.

The problem is a bottleneck problem, and solving the bottleneck will produce a far leaner and more efficient pipeline for industrial productivity, employment, and societal satisfaction.

[Autodesk's recognition of its role, alongside organizations like Adobe.](https://preview.redd.it/kvm8z2md8zq61.png?width=1588&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6d865498e39ddeff11d800b4e8e904d6137539c)

# The Education Solution

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ly24pppuezq61.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ab25ce2945104acb0f3c4d3816cb713db1af238

The reality here is that the education sector is also a slow-mover where shortcuts carry heavy competitive consequences. Another big element in this process is that high-level skills are ultimately dependent on adoption and communication demands. We need adaptable engineers to be familiar with a fundamental skill set that speak similar ""languages"". Autodesk has generally positioned itself to be one of those tools in a similar way that organizations like Adobe has positioned itself.

What I believe will happen is that the incentive of certifications and accelerated programs will increase dramatically as a way to boost lucrative employment and adoption of skills. These training programs will effectively become tickets initiate a good career.

# AutoDesk's Role

AutoDesk targets the EAC sector (engineering, architecture, and construction), so it helps to think about AutoDesk as software that can handle large scale developments focusing on the nature of smaller designs like intricate screws or cars. There is a lot of work that must be completed, with a strong societal demand. This can range from multi-year developments of hospital building in rural areas, or the construction of off-shore windmill farms. This inevitably creates a powerful compounding effect with employment and Autodesk's subscription model and increasing mobile capacities.

\- As employment increases, subscriptions begin to increase.

\- As subscription increases, projects of scale are adopted.

\- As projects of scale increase, employment increases.

\- As employment increases, the length of subscription increases.

The following is a list of Autodesk's relationship with various opportunities in the near and longterm.

\- **LEED architecture certification in civil sectors with Autodesk's architecture platform, Revit.**

>**Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design** (**LEED**) is a green building certification program used worldwide. Developed by the non-profit U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) it includes a set of rating systems for the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of green buildings, homes, and neighborhoods which aims to help building owners and operators be environmentally responsible and use resources efficiently.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Appreciate the DD. This is the type of shit that makes WSB great
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a roadway engineer, I cannot stand Autodesk products. They are absolute resource hogs, and Microstation/inroads/open roads from Bentley are way more efficient to use. Many DOTs require transportation projects to be done in Microstation too

For other engineering disciplines autodesk has a pretty strong user base that prefer it over Bentley. 

Either way I don‚Äôt really see autodesk mooning. Engineering/construction companies are some of the slowest to adapt to new tech, and many times consulting firms and construction companies are trying to reduce cost and the number of licenses they need in each software"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Autodesk is a terrible company that creates buggy programs and overcharges for them and is universally disliked by most of their user base and constantly shits on them. 

The only reason they are successful is because their competition are even worse, looking at you Bentley and your stupid licensing systems. 

No DD; just here to say fuck AutoDesk"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have used AutoCAD in the 90s and it's still used in construction.

The world is larger than the US, in most countries the choice is between AutoCAD and some locally produced legacy CAD software like made by the catholic school network.

There isn't much room for expansion and the competition tries to get a slice of that.

They only have to look at Cisco for inspiration: training courses and certifications.

Cisco network devices used to be the standard choice and nowadays there are plenty well established competitors. Their firewalls were ditched because of a NSA backdoor and Fortinet is nowadays the popular choice. No one uses Cisco WiFi, don't choose a course on that.

If you wonder how Cisco is still relevant, it's because everyone is still using/recognizing their training courses and certifications.

The education solution isn't just a way to expand, it can be the most important thing for long term survival."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Autodesk is moving from Software provider to Service Provider.  They are doing this because their current market is captured and at cap. They can't expand anymore in traditional Design Software. They either have all the solutions or are outclassed by a far margin.

This is my every day all day work. 

As described in this thread they have heavy competition in Bentley. 

They are making large acquisitions in the Construction space to try and capture market vs. Procore. They are failing because the solution is inferior as is the pricing model.  They talk a lot about the big picture of all data about a building in one platform. While I agree with the vision, the execution isn't there and it's a BIG uphill battle vs. Procore. 

I'd expect them to stay even, unless the industry really takes off. And I mean REALLY.  Too many firms in the AE space owned by individuals who work teams to the ponit of burnout. Plus becoming a professional in the A/E space requires education and then certification."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"This reads like a marketing agency's sales pitch, not a DD."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"As someone who worked in corporations for half a decade and received marketing, speech and presentstion trainings...

This is suspiciously close to an Autodesk commercial. DD may be relevant and well researched (obviously, since it was done in a lot of man hours), it is too much of a sale pitch rather than a WSB DD.

But idk ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Too much of write up...to simplify things Autodesk monopolizes AEC sector in North America. Every building or infrastructure project uses some kind of AutoDesk product like AutoCad, Revit, Navisworks or Infraworks. So, as the economy opens up there will be increase in use of Autodesk products....."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Been to their sf innovation lab. Am long as a result. 

They are focused on interconnectivity of platforms way more than other software companies. Fusion 360 will replace Solidworks in universities at some point. 
I use solidworks and powermill, but am long based around fundamental differences in software design approach. Dassault cares less about super niche technical areas while Autodesk wants to explore and better understand customers needs"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can we just refer to this as the ‚ÄòGovernment Subsidized Job Creation‚Äô bill? It‚Äôs like what, 10% actual infrastructure?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Water quality management via Autodesk? Yeah right.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would say that as far as certain industries that Autodesk is used in, their products Are currently used majorly, however, there are Many people who are unsatisfied with the product and are looking for alternatives. Programs such as blender, Modo and Houdini are taking their fair share of future users from Autodesks subscriptions. As much as I say this, I would hazard a guess that Autodesk is a good medium term play but if you don't see any development in their software, the long term play (20-30 years) is a bad call (I know long term isn't WSB just a heads up). They're becoming a fossil more than they realize."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wanted to read this, then realized it was a novel...but Autodesk is a good company, so I assume this will help with others confirmation bias."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This is way to complicated my brain is literally hurting.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Research shows that after 3 years of govt ""stimulus spending"" we get contraction in private growth. Stimulus are more like sedatives for the real eeconomy

It's only a matter of time for the deflationary backdrop to slam the hammer down, we're already seeing the markets trip over themselves over the 10 year with a mere 1.7 handle"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Trash bill. They're going to put this country so bad in debt, that 10 generations from now will still deal with. Can you even call it an infrastructure bill when most of it doesn't go towards roads, bridges, you know, actual infrastructure?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you have an architect or engineer friend - ask them one question: Does Autodesk Revit (or CAD if they‚Äôre still stuck in the 90s) have any competition. 

If you don‚Äôt have any engineer or architect friends, consider yourself lucky. But in this case unfortunately, you‚Äôll need to research on Google to find one number: which software company (aside from Adobe of course) has the highest net margin? 

You could also research to see the market share % for construction and design software."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Added /u/notbrokemexican as an approved submitter. Hey OP, mention any crypto, SPACs, or stocks under the market cap lower bound (1 billion) and this will be revoked."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Nani? What's this
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,tl:dr ICLN
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,ok i'm gonna read what OP posted
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep yep, love you all, changed my life."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,They have been subscription for ever! At least the commercial software has!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"In a way smaller scale something similar...

I worked for long at a restaurant, they were full almost almost every weekend of the year.

One winter he did a small rise of prices... everything was ok.

He got greedy and did another rise of the prices... following spring. I had to look for another job after a disastrous summer.

IMHO there are a lot of companies that are understimating the ""I am starting to get nuts with you greedy bastards"" feelings of many users.

Right now, they still have the power because there are not real alternatives, but I expect a massive exodus if something realistic appears."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck Autodesk but I write them checks every year because no choice.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Their 3D animation and Visual FX compositing systems are pretty damn awesome. But I imagine that's not a large chunk of their revenue.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs actually free for everyone!!  I was assigned to ADSK on a 2 year project and when Covid hit last year TinkerCad product managers ran classes for our kids stuck at home it was awesome. Great company.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt know about PROcore but, 
I do know that autodesk offers several softwares that compete across engineering services. They have Inventor, it‚Äôs used it manufacturing. They have Autocad, that‚Äôs used in construction, they have navisworks, that‚Äôs used for large 3D modeling (think factories). 

They are diversified better than any other CAD software company in my opinion. 

Also, the exposure to university level is great as well. 

I never heard of PROcore, unless they make PROe. I‚Äôve heard of PROe, never used it."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Odd why states would use Bentley while in the military utilizes AutoCAD. I'm almost certain that the vast majority of Federal CE is AutoCAD. If the engineers on this side are using it, the engineers on the opposite side (contractors) are using it. Why would states not use something that the big Federal spending is going toward? ü§î"

Bentley doesn‚Äôt have the university exposure that autodesk and solidworks has. So that‚Äôs a down side for microstation."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol. I‚Äôm not in the civil realm of things. I know auto cad is great for drawings but I‚Äôve always needed a powerful 3D modeler.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sweet

Damn, I'm not sure if I can get away with my Monke DD where I was just gonna post a 5000 word essay with ape sounds and monkey images now"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"State DOT usage seems to essentially be that Bentley products support legacy files. 10+ year old design files can be opened in current software.  [This post](http://lidarmag.com/2012/10/26/why-is-microstation-the-de-facto-state-dot-cad-standard/) details how Bentley came to be the be the CAD standard.

What type of federal CE are you referring to?  I‚Äôm fairly certain that FHWA funded projects are administered by local DOTs and use the locally required design program.  I‚Äôve also seen some dated blog posts (2012) that claim USACE uses Bentley. I can‚Äôt find recent articles about this topic and would love to learn more. 

It seems Bentley and Autodesk came to an agreement around 2008/2009 to allow their programs some level of compatibility (I believe they can open the other file type and export to the other file type but they can‚Äôt make design changes)."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"""It is certain""

-- Fortune cookie, probably"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah 100% triangles üìê
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"So I think this is BS, and here is why:

Theres no statistical value to anything drawn in here:
There are mathematical ways to find a trend line (easiest form would be a linear regression, pretty easy to do as a Python script), and the error of that line would be HUGE. Also it would prolly not be where OP has drawn it, and would also have a different inclination. (Based on the underlying Values).
I study Physics and do a lot of statistical analysis (and also Math in general) and there is no real Math involved.
These Triangles do not indicate shit. You can manipulate the very easily and prolly draw 17 different ones on the same data, all indicating a different outcome. There is no reason the market should work like this. Why?

The Idea if these triangles (correct me if im wrong) is, that the price oscillates around a breakoutpoint, the oscillation loses in amplitude and then the price suddenly moves by a lot. This has no physical or mathematical explanation. The oscillation would need to increase in Frequency for the model to make any sort of sense, which, if you look at the distance of the Red dots, it doesnt. 

The first triangle is simply not a trinagle, its just drawn over the data, manipulating how it appears. 

The exponential graph is also implemented wrong. To me more precice, there is no analytical way of plotting an exponential curve over the data. You can try and do it numerically, but thats really fucking complicated. What you can do, is use a logarithmic axis scale and plot a linear curve over the data, finding the correct exponential function, which I havent done, but based on experience would have a different form.



In conclusion, do not base your investment off of TA. 

Look at the graph and try to read out its avg. Value, if the market is currently at a high/low, and compare it to your DD about the underlying Security/Value. 

Im not a Financial expert. If any one of you has seen the Piece of Last week tonight about Savings, youd all know, that legally speaking ‚Äûfinancial advisor‚Äú has no meaning, and anybody can call themselves one. 

So fuck it. Im a financial advisor, and this is my Financial advice: 
Do buy GME if you think the company is going place. Do not, if you dont know/dont think it does. 
Dont gamble money, that you need for ur essentials. Not gaining money, doesnt mean losing it. FOMO is your enemy. 
Have a nice Easter weekend."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Man the amount of frustrated people on this thread who dint jump on the bandwagon ü§£ ps remember you‚Äôre a sissy and gambling ain‚Äôt cut for you
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt really care if it‚Äôs real or not but at night, when I have nothing to distract me and my mind is overcome with sadness and anxiety...I think about GME reaching 1,000,000 per share. Then I think about how it will change my life. Then that allows me to fall asleep just a little bit happier."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I really love the technical analysis. Tech analyst trader myself.

The main catalyst I see is in the amount of WSB subs. 

We went from under 800k December 18th 2020 to 8.5million February 8th. Volume is always an excellent indicator to reaffirm your analysis and predictions. We went from 8.5mil Feb 8th 2021 to 9.5 mil April 4th 2021. 

The initial gain in WSB members was 1000% in that time frame, That reflected in a GME equity price gain of ~1194%

If we extrapolate only that data point, then, if 10% of the 300%+ gain traders club recruit 2 people each, and every ape recruits 1 person; then we can get to 20million GME holders by June 18th.

Does that mean another $1,184 price spike?

Only if everyone made gains, reinvested, and is recruiting more WSB people to create another manic buying market, driving up the price."

People above are saying MVIS is a 500X option play. That would be some play if it turns out to be true!"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"you‚Äôre missing the point. 

based on your statement, stocks should never be bought it if there value was lower months prior. it‚Äôs a very thin and backwards approach. you also stated that low revenue is laughable but you‚Äôre in OCGN that has a ttm rev of around 50k? you‚Äôre treating early stage bio and tech different when it should be similar. you shouldn‚Äôt be future oriented for one but not the other, but you are bc you‚Äôre invested in OCGN. 

to go even further, what is the long term play for OCGN? the vaccine product isn‚Äôt made from them as they just secured distribution for it in america only. prior to securing their deal with BB they were focused on optometry related medication. assuming things go well how effectively do they pivot?

the stock has a few things going for it bc of covaxin and their 45% profit carve out; efficacy, potential in teen/kid market, easy vaccine storage/transpo. new strain counter, etc. but how big of a market will it really be as other companies look to enter? you say it will be huge and people need it but how many? the unvaccinated market is trimmed daily. domestic companies are also beginning tests on other age segments. if it‚Äôs life changing then why isn‚Äôt everyone continuing to buy the stock when efficacy was confirmed?

 these are the kind of questions you counter with, not simple minded stuff like you have been throwing out in the MVIS thread. 

i don‚Äôt think it will become the golden goose that other pharmas became with first to market, but there‚Äôs still a play and i wish you luck. but your extremely hypocritical in acting like the areas aren‚Äôt comparable."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"IVAS will save many lives of the soldiers who use them. HoloLens 2 is used by many hospitals to perform surgery. Life saving tech. LiDAR, life saving tech. Onto profitability. That‚Äôs where the Parallel was drawn between pharma and  MVIS. It IS very similar, actually. R&D companies often make only revenue off of their testing modules until they strike a deal or hit a milestone that turns the page, so to speak. MVIS had developed MEMS years before any company caught up to them and created AR glasses. It‚Äôs finally here, and they are in IVAS and Hololens. Which will bring about a percentage of that $22B in revenue but that‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg. Niantic may be using MVIS tech. In fact, they are likely using it. Following the patents, it looks to be that way, but only time will tell. Considering the incoming HL2/IVAS revenue is yet to be priced in correctly, as it is confirmed but still under NDA, any future potential revenue with Niantic would send to unimaginable heights. Niantic is the creator of Pok√©mon go. 1B users. It can be reasoned that they will create a couple hundred million AR glasses over the next decade for Pok√©mon go. If MVIS is inside, you will wish you invested, but that‚Äôs yet to be determined. I think it will be. But we won‚Äôt know for another year. In case of a buyout, the buyer would know, and if it is true that would definitely move price far above here"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Im confused though, how could this happen (extremely wide bud-ask spread?)"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, I believe he excercised his options"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"They're not so bad, they look really complicated because people have put a lot of work into understanding the dynamics of options trading so as to make more money with them. 

An option gives you the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell shares at a given price (the strike) on or before a given date (the expiry date). If I say I have 4/21 SPY 420c, that means I have a call option allowing me to *buy* 100 shares of SPY for $420 each on or before 21 April. That's it. That's the heart of what an option is. 

Obviously it wouldn't make sense for me to exercise my right to do that at the moment, since I could buy shares on the open market for $400 each, but let's pretend like SPY gaps up to $450 on Monday. Now I *could* buy 100 shares for $450 *or* I could exercise my option and buy them at $420 instead. I could sell them for $450 and instantly make a $30 * 100 profit. 

Thing is, how much does the option cost to buy? 100 shares of SPY at $400 is $40,000. A 4/21 SPY 420c would only cost $25. So if our little hypothetical situation played out (which, it won't, that's just for illustration) your options were buy $40,000 in shares, and net a profit of $5,000 or turn $25 into $3,000. Looked at another way, shares = 40k -> $45k, but the same amount of money in calls = 40k -> 4.8MM, since you could afford to buy 1,600 contracts (each worth 100 shares) -And you don't even need to have the money to exercise, since options are traded on the exchange *you can sell the contract instead*. 

The risk is that the price *won't* go over $420. If it doesn't, then your option will lose value over time until it is worthless.  When you buy an option, the most you can lose is whatever you paid for it (which makes it 100%). In the SPY example, if you bought shares and the price was at 419.99 on 4/21 you'd still have made basically two grand. The options, however, will have expired worthless and you'd have lost your $40k.

Everything else flows from that. Investopedia actually has a lot of information about options and it's pretty accessible. Don't sign up for anything, but highly recommend. I still go there from time to time to look at strategies or brush up on things. Or if YouTube is your preference, the channel KamikazeCash is really good (I'm not him, btw). He's got a more WSB type vibe anyway, lol."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was with you the whole way until ‚ÄúThe options, however, will have expired worthless and you‚Äôd have lost your $40K‚Äù.  But you said the option contract was only $25?"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Why do you guys act like gme touched your no no parts lmao. I dont get mad over what other people are holding
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"All good. The contact costs $25, so if you've got $40k to play with and you want to go all in on SPY you can afford more than one :)

Trying to make a like for like comparison. For 40k you can get 100 shares of SPY *or* 1600 420 calls. If you were to just buy the one contract for $25 then $25 is all you'd stand to lose if things went tits up."

This is the most smooth-brained thing I've ever seen. I literally couldn't finish reading the post because I kept getting distracted by my face's reflection in OP's brain. This post is like the John Frum cargo cult version of stock analysis. It makes ""The Secret"" look as scientifically rigorous the Feynman Lectures on Physics. This isn't DD, this is something you find growing under DD that forgot you left out in the shed for too long. If William S. Burroughs was a chart analyst instead of a novelist, but otherwise exactly the same, instead of ""Naked Lunch"" he would have written something like this post.

Sorry, fellow ape. This is not financial advice. It's physics advice.

Unless you're prepared to explain how market price movements somehow contain the impedance barriers necessary to create harmonic resonance, and especially how the return impulse off the second barrier travels backwards in time to cause periodic motion in the past, I'm gonna have to say that applying a fourier transform to stock price movements is 100% complete and total pseudoscientific folderol. 

This is like this one time when my college finance class was substitute taught for two weeks by Kid Rock, and he was huffing whipits the whole time. An infinite number of retarded apes banging on an infinte number of typewriters would never produce this post, because even a retarded ape would be too embarassed and just stop halfway through. When I was a kid, I'm pretty sure Charles Nelson Reilly once gave this exact same trading advice in an episode of ""Lidsville""."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"My completely unfounded crackpot theory is that this coming cycle is going to stop soon.

The next peak is due in mid-April. It has a couple weeks of wiggle room both directions, but it's pretty clear that around the middle of the month we can expect the next bull run on the oscillation. Well, Q1 earnings is the first week of May, and the premiums on the options chain are telling me that mid-April is a dead zone while early May is the hot potato. Early may would also be right in the middle of the downturn coming off the next expected oscillation peak. RKT's price goes up rather substantially whenever it catches any trading volume, and there will be a lot of volume around earnings.

What I suspect is that there will be another pop, maybe this week, maybe next week, maybe the week after, but there will be another pop this side of the end of April. This will be enough to fulfil the oscillation prediction, but with earnings just a few weeks away, it will either feed into the earnings speculation or it will bottom out only for there to be a massive earnings swing.

Again, this is just my gut (probably indigestion from crayons), but I think there's gonna be some tremors in April before the Yellowstone volcano that is RKT blows its top on May 5th."

The upside potential is so much better than the downside. Futures won't cause this to gap down. Pre market won't either. Unless something bad happens today. I don't even think Asian markets could be bad enough to cause this. Everyone is waiting to see if there are buyers at 4000/13400. Remember April is historically bullish. SPY just poked its head above the 4000 trendline heading for the 4040 trendline. Very Bullish. I predict that it will hit 4040 and then come down. I'm ready to go long at open and then get out at 4040. Possibly buy puts at that point. Good luck tho. I'm rooting for you.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not just get some $SQQQ calls and pick up some leverage?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I am just trying to figure out who buys puts when then stock is dropping and paying the premium on it.  Should have bought them earlier in the day when the stock was up.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,How do people have the money to throw 14k at a ridiculous call like that
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm giving a probability on my call. Not 100% ever. Last week I got TSLA correct for Thursday.  Find out if I'm right this week soon enough. It's a very manipulated name as it is an options gold mine.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,This time last year 14k would have been ~50% of all my retirement IRA savings. Thanks to TSLA's rise and a lot of call options it's now only ~4%.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"This contract is a big ficking deal I doubt any of you palantards are fully grasping.

From Wikipedia-

 NNSA has four missions with regard to national security:[9]

To manage the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile.

To reduce global danger from weapons of mass destruction and to promote international nuclear safety and nonproliferation.

To provide the United States Navy with safe, militarily effective nuclear propulsion plants and to ensure the safe and reliable operation of those plants.

And the agency's annual budget? 

>The National Nuclear Security Administration budget is surging by $3 billion to nearly $20 billion for fiscal year 2021, with most of the increase directed to modernizing the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile and associated infrastructure.

89 million is a minnow in an ocean for this agency, and this contract likely represents only the initial phase of what will  end up a long term and expansive integration providing palantir a steady revenue stream in or near the billions annually for decades. There is nothing cheap when you're dealing with nuclear weapons and reactors, and with the ongoing modernization of the US nuclear weapons triad palantir potentially gets to parlay this relationship into new ones with third party weapons manufacturers/developers. 

!RemindMe one year - my speculation is we will see additional palantir contracts from The National Nuclear Security Administration after they see how shit hot Palantir's capabilities actually are. 

Without going into specifics I have a lot of privileged insight into the mission and function of this agency and I gotta say seeing the details of this contract being long on PLTR has me rock hard.

Edit: I also wanted to add that this combination could quite possibly end up as SkyNet and kill us all..."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,89 mil?! Awesome that‚Äôs only 200-300 million short of the regular contracts needed to justify the hype.

I would recommend looking i to a Discounted Cashflow Model, probably the most popular model for share price evaluation.

A $90M contract is .2% of the current market valuation."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I usually sell monthly‚Äôs. Assignment doesn‚Äôt bother me as long as you‚Äôre selling the right strikes. PLTR has been shit to own recently, but I sold 25 and 26 strikes. Monthly‚Äôs usually fetch a good premium and if it ends up at 28 in a month, who cares, still making bank. Just never sell naked, the risk is never worth it. Sell CSP‚Äôs too at a strike that you‚Äôre ok owning the shares. So, for a monthly, I‚Äôm cool with giving up any gains after say, 26 bucks and I‚Äôm also happy to own more at 19. You benefit either way, just keep selling. Verticals are also good if you want much lower margin retirements and more leverage."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,29 here...üòø
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,There is no premium at $34. The IV has cratered on PLTR recently.  Unless you're willing to have them called away at a loss you're stuck.  I'm sitting on a big pile of shares at $27.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,No my man. I‚Äôm just hoping it gets there. Bumble hasn‚Äôt even broke into the 5‚Äôs yet.
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm basically doing the same thing as you are, I'm going week to week though. The premiums used to be much higher about a month ago or so. The week I'm not going to sell any calls, is the week in May, between the 18th and 24th when they announced the earnings, if we can beat the street, we could see it Spike to about $32. Somebody mentioned the January 2022 40s at $2.25
That didn't seem too bad."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I am there with you right now, but the previous IV was making it worth it"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôd still sell at least some calls, just in case the opposite happens, right? Maybe buy a few LEAPS if IV is not too high yet. Since you‚Äôre betting on upside, buy more and/or simply sell less. I‚Äôd sell some ATM or near the money calls for larger premium and consider these as minor insurance against bad earnings or profit taking. It‚Äôs a lot easier to deal with making less than with losing a lot."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes but so are you
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good advice, thanks üòä"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you tried sticking to selling them?  Most people suck at options

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thankz, that sounds good!"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Looked into CFP a bit more. Most analysts have the low end price target of $32 with a high of 40-41. Plus a P/E ratio of 6 in this market makes it even more attractive. It will most likely dip down just looking at the chart so I‚Äôll be buying a couple at market open then adding in more during dips. My only concern is the low daily volume. I‚Äôm seeing an average of 233k-300k daily
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,What about wood substitutes like $TREX?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"For everyone's information; the lumber market bottleneck is sawmills and processed lumber products. NOT raw materials (I.e. wood).

It's the process that's fallen behind. So sawmills should have the largest increase in revenue and the quickest to get back up to speed should have the most substantial gains."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs still got some runway left. I agree that this party will end for the reasons you said but that‚Äôs at least a few months out yet
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"They‚Äôre selling sawlogs and pulp wood though, and that‚Äôs not really where the tendies are at. Sawlogs are still cheap, it‚Äôs the sawmills that are making bank rn"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"During Covid the demand for lumber went through the roof everywhere in Canada and the states with people at home and taking on project.  Many retail stores we sold out of their summer inventory by the end of April.  Since the mills were closed for so long they are now running full out to catch up.  Also, new home builds are very strong and are projected to keep going up.  It‚Äôs a solid play."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Going up to 60 and beyond, friend"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep. I used to frame houses in the developments. There is so much immigration occuring and thats contributing as well. 8 people from the same east indian family will move into a 500 000 dollar 1700 square foot house. Even though the yard is mud, and multiple houses are being built in the cul de sac. People move in immediately once its ready to live in. The kids are playing in outside and next door they are pouring a foundation. 

I wonder if the market will crash eventually."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wish I had the crystal ball here.  Usually things are somewhat predictable with markets based on seasonality and ""known"" movements from large players.  Today, we are in uncharted waters.  If you had asked me 6 months ago during the last dip in the lumber and OSB market after all time highs I would have predicted things were going to level off.  Now we are breaking new records every week in OSB.  The one sign of pricing coming down is in lumber.  If the big boxes(Lowes,Home Depot,Menards) don't buy up all the wood because Jonny homeowner wants to build his deck this spring, you will likely not see the cocooning effect of last spring when Covid hit.  This would be a good thing on the pricing front as wood would be more readily available to the market and relieve some pricing stress.  There are many reasons for that but I won't bore you with the minutia.  

That said, we are still well above what is considered ""normal"".  I am hearing of builders canceling contracts due to high pricing or price escalations and builders raising pricing at historic levels just to maintain profitability.  I think you are doing the right thing by holding off, I am doing the same.  The guestimate fits your timeframe with later in the year for lumber, but there is still no end in sight for OSB.  There are just too many things going wrong in that world to curb increases unless demand softens.  I had builders buying 7/16 4 x 8 OSB for $7.00 early last year, today it is $35, and that is a GOOD number for today.  Open market is trading at close to $40 or higher.  Anyways, probably information overkill, but I am going to sit tight until the dust settles on this thing.  Hope this helps."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"WOOD had a lot of exposure to the paper industry though. A straight lumber play in USA is PCH, WY and RYN"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs a hard answer. These projects rarely go anywhere as planned. MP Materials actually picked up the mine after the previous company had a 2016 bankruptcy to the tune of 1.4 billion in bonds outstanding. The amount of potential profit is high, but the risk is huge and the projects difficult. Round top supposedly had an economic assessment worth 1.5 billion NPV. Turn around time on investment of 350 million is supposed to be 1.4 years when the mine starts producing. About a year ago one of the CEO‚Äôs involved said 30 months to open. Unsure of exactly where it is now, I‚Äôm not invested, I got most of that info from the round top project wiki. They have great potential, but so do a lot of other mine prospects. It‚Äôs a very long haul bet, and I‚Äôm very much a ‚Äúshow me‚Äù investor when it comes to process development. MP materials is currently profitable and heavily investing in getting to the next stage. No guarantees they will make it but if they don‚Äôt... at least they‚Äôre still making money."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,what's the difference between selling a call and a covered call?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you?
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"In this context, no difference.

But you can either buy a call or sell a call, and a call could be covered or naked.

If you sell a call, you are committing to sell a stock at a certain price. If you sell a covered call, you have the stock that you're agreeing to sell. If you sell a naked call, you don't so you'll have to buy it at market price.

If you buy a call, you have the option to buy the stock at the strike price. As far as you are concerned as a buyer, it doesn't matter if you the seller is covered or naked."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Many thanks!
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe if the cold supply line was green you would have got it right you dumb ape üòÜ
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Wtf are you talking about
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Many brokers will not allow you to sell naked calls. For instance, every call on Robinhood has to be covered. 

Other brokers will only let you sell naked calls if you‚Äôre a very experienced trader and have significant capital. Even then it‚Äôs subject to a lot of scrutiny.

Here‚Äôs what could happen. You sell a 100 calls of SPY at a strike price of $450. Suddenly there‚Äôs a spike and your calls get exercised.

Now you don‚Äôt have 100x100 shares of SPY. So you‚Äôll need to have either cash (or most likely margin) equivalent to $4.5MM to buy them at market price to sell them to the buyer. And if they‚Äôre giving you that in margin, you‚Äôd better be able to pony up the cash to address that margin call.

Which is why most calls are covered calls."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh, okay. I was wondering who'd have to buy the shares when a trader sells a naked call. Again, thanks for sharing your knowledge!"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Way too little talk about ASO on this sub IMO
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,Seriously
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's what a covered straddle is. An example would be CC at 45 and a CSP at 40. If you match strike its a strangle. Straddles are good for tickers you're bullish on but not super bullish. Your strategy in this imaginary scenario would be the price at expiration is between 40-45 so you keep your 100 shares and the premium on both ends.

Good to do it on stock you're bullish on because if it falls under 40, you're happy to pick up another 100 shares."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I tried telling everyone I know about AMD when it was $1.80 4-5 years ago.  I at the time worked at a datacenter and the writing was clear as day.  

I wrote this many years ago and I wish I could have told more people about it because it was a near sure bet.  

https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/

This is many years past but Intel was/is? horrifically flawed in culture, strategy , technology.

And that isn't going to change quickly I'd be very careful about placing any long bets on Intel in the future.  Perhaps this can change with their new ceo.

Telling people Intel is competitive is blatantly false imo (I'm retired now so I don't work in the datacenter field and I no longer keep tabs on tech that closely) 

You've got Apple that has gone away from intel and in my short time of owning an M1 macbook air, I can tell you this thing blows away anything intel has by miles, the battery life, the heat, the fanless design, the speed in the cpu, the gpu is light years ahead of whatever intel has.  

AMD is going to continue to own Intel in the datacenter space, it owns them in the enthusiast market, intel still had a good hold of the oem market through shady bribes and deals etc.

Even many years ago Intel literally lied about their advancements in 14nm 10nm etc and it got delayed every year.

Yes TSMC is good bet, I don't know enough of all the China?Taiwan geopolitical stuff that might affect them."

Just ignore increasing costs in all asset prices because of goverment restrictions on output and throughput that have caused transport prices to rise. 

1/4 shipping requests are being rejected by transport companies currently. There is a lot of pent up demand after a year on pause and little to no slack in the system to get us caught back up. Expect prices to rise to 3% by 2022.

current projections on consumer inflation for 2021 is 2.2% up from 1.8% which is a 22% increase in the rate of inflation. 

while drastic it is only a 4 cent increase in a dollar between the two after 10 years. While a dollar value in 10 years will need to be 20% higher to buy the same thing.

So you aren't counting the direct subsidies for oil and gas extraction?
What about the indirect subsidies?
Why aren't you complaining about all the bail out money the Big 3 got?

Also, Tesla turns a profit some Qs without the regulatory tax credits. 
The myth that they don't turn a profit is because people can't do math. 

Reg credits have taxes paid on them. 

Less Profits = Less Taxes.
Income from Reg Credits is taxed. 

555 income before taxes
186 paid in taxes
= about 34% tax rate

If people claim that they only made a profit from regulatory credits, then subtract out regulatory credits and the taxes paid on the reg credits. 
555- 397
= ~158

158 * tax rate of 34% or so = 53milli on taxes

158-53mil in taxes = over 100mil in profit"

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha no it's not. Stock prices are a function of revenue, which they don't have. If they were trading based on their revenue the price would be like $50-70"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre not claiming your being absolute, which give that sales performance does link to stock price you should go and put your money where your mouth is as you will become rich‚Ä¶. Its guaranteed after all.

As for the F150 and traditional pickups going EV there will be buyers who won‚Äôt go Tesla as there are sizes and load out that it can‚Äôt replace but for the direct competition models there is little to show what they do better, other than rust.

You seem to have missed that the cybertruck is attracting more customers than the traditional pick up. I‚Äôm an urban dwelling brit and if it fitted the roads here I would buy it over the Y but it‚Äôs comparatively the size of the ever given and as likely to get stuck here. It has the key difference that it‚Äôs not a ladder chassis made of low grade pig iron. It won‚Äôt rust out and you don‚Äôt have to work about morons in carparks"

no"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes

Even with Tesla being inflated because they are the top EV they are influenced by sales

So glad you could show how the F150 was supper duper though"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt care about the F150 i just think you are having a tough time processing the idea that culture matters and most of the world will not prefer the tesla brand over other brands that they currently favor.  Because you love the brand it is blinding you to the fact that just because EVs will grow, tesla still has to grow their brand, it‚Äôs not an automatic thing.  Just being there first does not matter, people shop on identity and price.  Once other brands are offering EV‚Äôs tesla‚Äôs growth increases will slow, but everyone seems to be factoring a growth rate that only goes up exponentially.  Eventually that will be linear and then slower than linear but nobody can seem to grasp that."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"> culture matters and most of the world will not prefer the tesla brand over other brands that they currently favor.

The 1970‚Äôs is calling, culture matters no one will buy Japanese cars‚Ä¶.. how many national bailouts has US old auto had since then is it 2 or 3 now?

I didn‚Äôt say they would be the only and largest brand but it was you saying they won‚Äôt even be top 5 EV brand‚Ä¶.. Because of Ford the brand who tried to kill their EV sales with 5-10K EV surcharge"
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,AMRN losses helped me save so much in short term trading taxes though! Just gotta remember to sell at 364 days. That's all this stock is good for.

This is also not how probability works. There is a wide range of values that the distribution can take on, not just 3.

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like the potential but going to sit this one out until I see a better entry point. The stock has climbed 23% since 3/24. Options prices are very high and breakeven could be hard unless there is quick upwards momentum in the stock price.

One thing on your DD I would like clarification on. What makes you bullish on high institutional ownership?

Also, share lockup expired 3/31...typically we see a stock take a dip after this. There was pretty significant volume at opening on 3/31 and at the close of 4/1.

Overall I think the company is undervalued (low market cap). Does anyone have any comps, other than DICK'S Sporting Goods? DICK'S has a $7B market cap, but only a 1/3 more revenue and nearly the equivalent EBITDA...wow! TL;DL, this could point towards a 2x increase in stock price long term."

04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ya I had a very hard time trying to deposit and cash a $9,999.99 check same day at all major US banks 3 weeks ago... They wouldn‚Äôt release the funds until 10 business days. I had to go to the checks bank and they charged me a $25 fee, but said they barely had enough cash on hand, it was Friday afternoon, so they gave me the few hundred dollar bills they had and the rest were smaller denominations. They asked me what I did for a living and where the money was coming for, being used, what my social security number was. I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm on some government list now lol. You need to call days ahead to cash out anything larger than $20k at most banks, otherwise you‚Äôll be driving from one branch to another trying to withdraw which should set off even more red flags. Eventually I found one M&T bank branch willing to give me cash, I found another Wells Fargo branch willing to accept it and wire it out to TD Ameritrade around 3:30pm. TD Ameritrade didn‚Äôt process it and make it available until 5:30pm though. This whole journey started around 2pm."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is all explained in the link. They owed exactly what they wired, they just did not intend to send it yet."
04/04/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm serious though. There was a recent erroneous wire transfer by a bank to another bank for $25 MILLION (!) and the receiving bank refused to return it and was within their rights to do so.

Their revenue in Q4 2020 was $10.4 Billion. Idk the average price per car though? At $60,000 revenue would be $10.9 Billion.

Their revenue in Q1 2020 was $5.9 Billion though, so comparatively this is a VERY good start to this year for them. Maybe they'll do $50 Billion on the year. That'd make their current market cap 12 times higher than revenue. Not terrible. At $1,000 a share it's 20X.

Not sure if I should give it away here since I'm not done accumulating yet, but I do think this stock is a one way ticket to the moon. It's in the tech sector of course, and guess what they literally print money and have amazing margins. Most of their revenue comes from selling mobile devices and bundling subscription services with the hardware that they sell. Their market share right now is only about 20% in the mobile hardware segment, so there's a lot of room for growth here. Plus they are continually expanding into other industries

This safe spot doesn't have to be anything special. Just somewhere I can lie down and is dark will do. By this time both the pee and fart are racing to go out. If I pee first, then the urge to pee subsides a little and the urge to fart takes lead and vice-versa. So they alternate until there is no more pee or fart but only pain. My insides start hurting like they been twisted and I am forced to lay down on my back with my asshole tightly clenched like it's trying to keep my insides from falling out. The pain comes in sharp pulsating waves lasting for upto an hour. I know it's all over when I finally start to fall asleep. These sleeps always hit hard and feel like a gateway out of this universe. When I wake up I can never tell the time or how long I had been asleep. But thats why I do it. I hold my pee and fart to momentarily transcend this existence."

Create some retail niche product and find a factory to make it in China or in the US, create a name a trademark it, have packaging and a logo custom designed, and get it out there.  

Or manufacturer some product yourself. 

I had a job once where the middle managers worked as much as you do.  Some of the hardest working people I‚Äôve ever met. I never understood why they didn‚Äôt put all that energy and work ethic into their own business.

1. It's the Big Four with $BEAM in the mix. Probably more if you count private companies like Caribou.

2. $CRSP has the most advanced CRISPR program -- their treatments of sickle cell/beta thal

3. NTLA's treatment is so early in the clinic that mentioning the word cure is irresponsible. Is it a cure if it performs mildly better than patisiran?

4. CRISPR stocks are still in a bubble thanks to the rise of ARK -- who's to say what fair valuation is or if even with good data it'll only drop with its major catalyst gone? $CRSP is lower today than it was after releasing their sickle cell data at ASH last year.

5. Orphan drug means it's just treating a rare disease. I can't think of a single drug treating ATTR that hasn't gotten this designation while in the clinic."
