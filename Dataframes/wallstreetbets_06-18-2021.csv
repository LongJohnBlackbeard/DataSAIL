2021-06-18 19:58:21,wallstreetbets,Sorry my dude it broke a major trend line going back to March 2019.
2021-06-18 19:58:49,wallstreetbets,😩
2021-06-18 19:47:26,wallstreetbets,When did u buy the options?
2021-06-18 19:47:01,wallstreetbets,pleas sell
2021-06-18 19:51:47,wallstreetbets,"Y’all have prime day in the states?

It canceled in Canada.."
2021-06-18 19:42:00,wallstreetbets,Of all the stocks. Godspeed.
2021-06-18 19:55:00,wallstreetbets,"Dude, if you have made $209k yo-yoing that's great! If you started yo-yoing with $209 k and dropped it on one meme stock. Well, that's another situation entirely.  Good luck!"
2021-06-18 19:42:54,wallstreetbets,"Godspeed retard. 

It smells like boomer in these comments"
2021-06-18 19:37:14,wallstreetbets,Best of luck! 🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-18 19:43:13,wallstreetbets,We hope it moons for u
2021-06-18 19:53:40,wallstreetbets,"fuck this comment section jesus christ.

good luck and fuck you, retard."
2021-06-18 19:38:18,wallstreetbets,Please put that in something stable. Something with guaranteed growth.
2021-06-18 19:50:43,wallstreetbets,"EEEEEEEE YOLLOOOOOOO! BITCH! Hahahahhaa real dope dealers for haha, hahahaha"
2021-06-18 19:39:23,wallstreetbets,Do you have 209k all in one stock? That seems incredibly risky. After Enron I can't believe people still do that.
2021-06-18 19:49:11,wallstreetbets,Have you considered going half in on options? You could be a millionaire in one swing then
2021-06-18 19:55:17,wallstreetbets,<Original poster's father turning over in grave>
2021-06-18 19:53:13,wallstreetbets,Let me guess. White?
2021-06-18 19:51:45,wallstreetbets,Wish to the MOoooooOoOoOoOoOooOn
2021-06-18 19:43:28,wallstreetbets,It reeks
2021-06-18 19:42:24,wallstreetbets,Cheers
2021-06-18 19:54:03,wallstreetbets,YESSIR 🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-18 19:41:01,wallstreetbets,"yea definitely not smart to play such large sums but we don’t know op’s financial situation, maybe he’s a multimillionaire and this is his chump change."
2021-06-18 19:38:50,wallstreetbets,No such thing as guaranteed growth bro. Yolo
2021-06-18 19:51:58,wallstreetbets,LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
2021-06-18 19:40:14,wallstreetbets,Bro it’s 2021. YOLO
2021-06-18 19:45:28,wallstreetbets,This. Not sure about OP grand Master plan but he could easily become a millionaire in a year with a moderate 2% daily gain.
2021-06-18 19:51:30,wallstreetbets,Or broke in one swing ahaha
2021-06-18 19:55:42,wallstreetbets,He’s cremated so
2021-06-18 19:53:29,wallstreetbets,White as fuck
2021-06-18 19:47:03,wallstreetbets,He says it's dad inheritance. Research shows that 95% of people who come into money quickly revert back to their original financial status within three years.
2021-06-18 19:42:14,wallstreetbets,No this is my entire net worth I’m 21
2021-06-18 19:39:25,wallstreetbets,Your right there. Good point
2021-06-18 19:53:49,wallstreetbets,Tell em!
2021-06-18 19:55:33,wallstreetbets,Would be a cool movement if all the wishtards that made fat tendies from wish donated a small amount to the make-a-wish foundation if I do I'll def will
2021-06-18 19:43:25,wallstreetbets,You can do what you want but diversification is how one becomes financially stable. You only live once but you live for 100 years.
2021-06-18 19:52:42,wallstreetbets,If you’re convinced enough that it will go up to invest this much money in it then may as well go full retard. Not financial advice....
2021-06-18 19:49:49,wallstreetbets,really? Well fuck me
2021-06-18 19:46:14,wallstreetbets,"I know we both love the thrill, but take 50% off of that position and distribute it across more stable stocks, think long term and not short term."
2021-06-18 19:40:39,wallstreetbets,Maybe a mutual fund or an investment guy. Not trying to be a dick. Wish is a great company. I just don’t want to see anyone risk that kind of money
2021-06-18 19:54:21,wallstreetbets,no cap ! 🧢
2021-06-18 19:56:08,wallstreetbets,maybe
2021-06-18 19:44:13,wallstreetbets,I’d rather potentially be a baller for my 100 years versus an average 9-5 slave job life
2021-06-18 19:53:02,wallstreetbets,Nah bro hahaha hell nah
2021-06-18 19:48:14,wallstreetbets,I am thinking long term. I will get into real estate if this play doesn’t blow up.
2021-06-18 19:41:38,wallstreetbets,That’s where it was. But I decided to take it into my own hands. Why would I want 8% gains when I can make 50% gains in wish
2021-06-18 19:45:42,wallstreetbets,That is a false dichotomy. With this kind of money you have a head start most people only dream of.
2021-06-18 19:42:38,wallstreetbets,I hope to see you a millionaire in the future. Best of luck.

2021-06-18 19:44:15,wallstreetbets,"Fucking sad to see this whole sub go to shit so fast because of a couple meme stocks. Great entertainment, but for guys like this you just want to slap them."
2021-06-18 19:47:23,wallstreetbets,"Don’t get me wrong, I am grateful beyond words for my financial position at my age. I was just making an analogy. Potential baller or average life. Im fine if this goes tits up. I will grind my way back. Risk vs reward with this play fits me perfectly and I understand the risk."
2021-06-18 19:50:36,wallstreetbets,The mental break down of losing some money here does not compare to the mental break down of losing my father at such a young age. I am prepared
2021-06-18 19:45:12,wallstreetbets,Yeah lol this is wall streetBETS not boomerstreetinvesting

2021-06-18 19:52:34,wallstreetbets,My dad would have wanted this 😎💪🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-18 19:37:29,wallstreetbets,"Fellow retard here. I think you will be good since I bought 90 day calls on UDOW today. Everything I touch goes down in value. I am a buy high, sell low pro. That is all."
2021-06-18 19:58:01,wallstreetbets,SPY closed under the 50dma.  I’m going to take Monday off and see whether or not it recovers the trend.  All cash until the market decides what it wants to do.
2021-06-18 19:46:18,wallstreetbets,"Chart looks like a classic short signal.  Straight out of technical handbook.  Tough not knowing what the fed will say/do to invalidate any sane bet.  Battle scars run deep fighting JPow.  

I might grow the balls to jump in on monday.  I have some puts on Qs that might be better here to be honest.

Good DD, only because your a bearded 🌈 🐻"

2021-06-18 19:40:05,wallstreetbets,"IMHO MACD is trash. On the other hand you could do worse than betting against the index when it is stalled at ATH. No guarantees, but better than shorting a dip for sure.

FWIW, most indicators are garbage now. And fundamentals were useless a long time ago. Business cycles don't exist anymore. And Elliot waves are pure fantasy. The markets are worth whatever people will pay for them --- TINA and sentiment and liquidity tsunamis are all that matters now."
2021-06-18 19:36:16,wallstreetbets,Let’s hope we don’t get SONNED by SPY again 🥴😂😂. Every time I’ve taken a position against it I wish I hadn’t. Let’s find out if this baby drops 😎🤙🏽 Good luck
2021-06-18 19:50:36,wallstreetbets,I got spy calls we will see. I'm super bullish right now though. The dollar just gain .08% percent and for the first time in a month 10 year bond yields are going down. I hope you bought some monthly and not weeklies
2021-06-18 19:56:51,wallstreetbets,"Classic RSI+MACD trader, classic divergence seeker, I love it! Love that close below the 50 MA hopefully it will use it as resistance now and you will be a very rich man!🤡"
2021-06-18 19:49:56,wallstreetbets,You're exactly where you need to be then.
2021-06-18 19:40:39,wallstreetbets,Markets will go sideways and you’ll both lose.
2021-06-18 19:36:38,wallstreetbets,"What a wonderful intelligent, insightful processionally presented post..... BAN!!!!   


Seriously though thanks for posting"
2021-06-18 19:31:28,wallstreetbets,Tl:dr... buy clov?
2021-06-18 19:18:21,wallstreetbets,Ehh it ain’t much on here but it’s more than nothing. Nice job but you haven’t earned a fuck you yet.
2021-06-18 19:29:47,wallstreetbets,Did you sell before the dump?
2021-06-18 19:39:35,wallstreetbets,When did you buy it?
2021-06-18 19:20:51,wallstreetbets,Lmaoooo true that. I’ll post my AMC calls from the other week when I’m craving it
2021-06-18 19:31:01,wallstreetbets, Around 10 am
2021-06-18 19:44:30,wallstreetbets,$730 on Wednesday. $750 & $760 yesterday
2021-06-18 19:40:41,wallstreetbets,"Which one? The $730, $750 or the $760?"
2021-06-18 19:26:42,wallstreetbets,Bruh people are throwing a fit that it isn’t crashing but I found a broken 8 ball outside my homeless shelter and it says I’m about to be fucking loaded
2021-06-18 19:31:38,wallstreetbets,Nice
2021-06-18 19:29:36,wallstreetbets,"If it’s any consolation prize to them, I papered handed 2 $720 calls I bought for $600 each 🤦‍♂️"
2021-06-18 19:32:28,wallstreetbets,I bought some FOMO calls for next week
2021-06-18 19:46:46,wallstreetbets,Oof. Honestly I misplayed the crash a bit too but made it out in more than one piece. This week definitely strengthened my faith in the amc trend. Which will likely singlehandedly sink it lol but honestly that it keeps going and didn’t fall off on the 11th is encouraging.
2021-06-18 19:48:39,wallstreetbets,Couldn’t have said it better myself.
2021-06-18 19:52:09,wallstreetbets,[This surely had a big hand in the battering this week ](https://www.reuters.com/business/quadruple-witching-friday-see-818-bln-single-stock-options-expiration-goldman-2021-06-18/)
2021-06-18 19:16:31,wallstreetbets,Atleast you bought shares ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|snoo)
2021-06-18 19:19:58,wallstreetbets,Fuck yeah !!!!! Yoloing this butthole on this for the next few weeks!! Apes 🦍💪
2021-06-18 19:27:33,wallstreetbets,New Lambos next month
2021-06-18 19:18:46,wallstreetbets,In the coming weeks you’ll be paid cha Ching!
2021-06-18 19:14:33,wallstreetbets,No you need a life saver your breath stinks like 🌈🐻😷
2021-06-18 19:14:00,wallstreetbets,Smh bro that’s been pumped and been dumped days ago
2021-06-18 19:25:20,wallstreetbets,Pumped and dumped? It literally is down since it’s ipo lmao
2021-06-18 19:25:02,wallstreetbets,I’ve seen this comment on another WISH post. Seems like these shorts are getting desperate
2021-06-18 19:20:20,wallstreetbets,No bro.  You don’t know
2021-06-18 19:34:59,wallstreetbets,It went up 6 bucks in a day then dropped right back down. Pay attention
2021-06-18 19:56:59,wallstreetbets,I made money off of it. Did you? Because I bet you DID… aaaaand it’s gone. Good luck with that
2021-06-18 19:37:07,wallstreetbets,"That’s called volatility. There’s clearly a support line at 11. High institutional interest. Founders with some good background in tech. Doesn’t have to be your position, but that’s investing. It’s honestly on sale right now."
2021-06-18 19:55:46,wallstreetbets,"It did that because its forming a reverse head and shoulders on 4hr chart, we are forming the 2nd sh. currently.
15 is the neckline and 30 is the target."

2021-06-18 19:56:55,wallstreetbets,78 day old account with BB in your history. How’s that BB pump and dump going? Either you’re a contrarian or genuinely just haven’t bothered to research anything. Not gonna sit here and argue with a hypocrite.
2021-06-18 19:59:30,wallstreetbets,Have you looked at Wish's chart the last couple weeks?  It's very volatile and very upward.
2021-06-18 19:59:34,wallstreetbets,BB has growth. It has self driving technology that was recently picked up by the biggest Chinese company using the technology. And cyber security is going to be huge in the future. I’m looking forward not just until next week. You should’ve moved your money a week ago

2021-06-18 19:44:19,wallstreetbets,Woooo 11th place isn’t too bad for my XOM calls
2021-06-18 18:35:11,wallstreetbets,Looks like you bought those options for Amazon price but sold for wish price.
2021-06-18 19:04:15,wallstreetbets,45 DOLLARS??? DAMN.
2021-06-18 19:07:53,wallstreetbets,Chillax home fry. Wait till next Friday.
2021-06-18 19:25:37,wallstreetbets,This doesn't make me hard at all. Come back with a bigger loss.
2021-06-18 19:08:38,wallstreetbets,"Do you retards know what market cap is? If wish were to hit 45, it will have a 30b plus market cap. I’m not saying that’s impossible to attain but it would be extremely difficult to do in the short term."
2021-06-18 19:02:17,wallstreetbets,I wish I hadn’t got fucked on my options too
2021-06-18 19:14:05,wallstreetbets,I can understand that a week ago seemed like everything was blasting off so when a company like Clov triples why wouldn't another stock like Wish. Could still happen but that is really far out of the money 😐

2021-06-18 19:16:53,wallstreetbets,"WI$H!!! is not a fucking meme stock!! So stop treating it like one. It’s a GREAT long term stock. In years to come, people will be 
WI$$$$$H!!!!!!!! They had gotten in at these prices. MARK MY FUCKING WORDS!! I understand these are options, probably not the best pick but whatever. I have 15,17.50 and 20 exp 7/16. But my $10 oct 15 is straight chilling. 

I also own shares."
2021-06-18 19:46:07,wallstreetbets,Damn I might need to buy some calls
2021-06-18 18:52:46,wallstreetbets,Feels bad 🤡
2021-06-18 19:15:14,wallstreetbets,Options pinned at 11.50 for max pain brah.
2021-06-18 19:19:12,wallstreetbets,Right!! Does he think it’s GME or AMC?
2021-06-18 19:08:36,wallstreetbets,Yours are that high?
2021-06-18 19:21:47,wallstreetbets,"Stack shares, stack em deep!!"
2021-06-18 19:21:49,wallstreetbets,I guess. It's crackhead logic. LMAO!!!
2021-06-18 19:22:10,wallstreetbets,Oh no I haven’t quite elevated to the diamond retard standard. However my calls were down 95% when I sold them.
2021-06-18 19:43:09,wallstreetbets,So why’d you sell
2021-06-18 18:30:06,wallstreetbets,Learn IV and theta
2021-06-18 19:03:52,wallstreetbets,You literally kept digging a hole while a bulldozer pushed more dirt in. You belong here. P.S only average down on Leaps
2021-06-18 19:21:51,wallstreetbets,"Atta boy, average down!"
2021-06-18 19:47:30,wallstreetbets,The same here. Learned a lesson of buying short term options
2021-06-18 18:52:46,wallstreetbets,"Let’s start with 2 questions. 1st- do you know what options are?? F-it, there is no hope, too retarded to make it to question #2... good work👍you pass."

2021-06-18 18:35:17,wallstreetbets,I prefer hoping the price will jump $1 in the last hour and everything pays off
2021-06-18 18:35:49,wallstreetbets,I don’t think this smooth brain can learn.
2021-06-18 18:31:41,wallstreetbets,"Haha, this 👍🏽"
2021-06-18 19:51:20,wallstreetbets,Averaging down means you save money in the end

2021-06-18 19:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, he meant retarded."
2021-06-18 18:11:29,wallstreetbets,"True retard, go for it.

Ps: Bezos stepping down was news some time ago,  when the event actually happens it is basically already discounted in the share price and thus a non event"
2021-06-18 18:12:34,wallstreetbets,Wouldn’t the news be the catalyst?
2021-06-18 18:36:44,wallstreetbets,"When Bezos dies on the rocket, will Amazon go up or down?"
2021-06-18 18:13:33,wallstreetbets,"whenever you have a strong feeling to do something, DO the complete opposite 😂"
2021-06-18 18:49:19,wallstreetbets,"I have a feeling that you’re retarded for thinking this isn’t priced in  but I also think puts will print this summer, so by proxy I’m also retarded and gay. When you multiply double retard + double gay you = genius. Do the deed my man."
2021-06-18 19:22:56,wallstreetbets,"I'd buy puts whenever he goes up in that shuttle.  Bezos can ""step down"" from amazon, but I guarantee of anything happens to him on that flight AMZN is drilling to China"

2021-06-18 18:57:17,wallstreetbets,Post when you actually enter the position. If it's a strong feeling then just do it. Personally I think AMZN is playing catch up to FB NVDA MSFT. If you feel really 🌈 🐻 then it'd just be smarter to buy puts on NVDA over AMZN. Think TSLA drop after run up going into split. My 2 cents
2021-06-18 19:20:22,wallstreetbets,"Tuesday, Yes. Moonday, no."

2021-06-18 19:43:33,wallstreetbets,"AMZN is close to the top of its range right now, so I think a pullback is inevitable. It will happen soon, so 7/9 is a good strike date. Good luck ~insert ableist slur~."

2021-06-18 18:34:22,wallstreetbets,"That is the common thinking, yet so many times something is believed to be priced in, definitely isn’t priced in. I’m not saying OP is right, I’m simply pointing out that no one knows for certain how priced in anything is into any stock, if they did it wouldn’t be a speculative market."
2021-06-18 18:17:54,wallstreetbets,Oh I’m aware. Like I said I have a feeling about it but then again it’s probably the autism speaking. For some reason I really wanna bet that for some reason people will be selling their stocks when he actual leaves. Again I’m not some investor like you are u/Actual-investor. I’m a gambler here to entertain people with my stupidity.
2021-06-18 19:11:05,wallstreetbets,"Yeah half the time when stuff like this happens the price goes up because everyone's like ""eh let's wait for the dip when he leaves to buy in"" and then you get all the pent up buying pressure when they realize it's not dipping."

2021-06-18 18:16:34,wallstreetbets,This advice would have saved me so much money
2021-06-18 18:53:39,wallstreetbets,If I make enough next week I’ll go ahead and do it just for the fuck of it. Although I am considering moving the out expiration date to be past 07/20 as that is when his flight to space is scheduled and if something unfortunate were to happen (not wishing death on anybody) it could be huge
2021-06-18 19:27:03,wallstreetbets,I agree. I rethinking the 07/09 date and will likely go with a further out date after 07/20 just Incase that happens.
2021-06-18 19:50:09,wallstreetbets,Yeah that was my thought process when I wrote the post. Sure a lot of investors already know he will retire but a lot of casuals don’t just like you said. I might extend the expiration date to go past 07/20 because he will be going on the ship at that time. We’ll see how it plays out.
2021-06-18 19:28:06,wallstreetbets,Can I be your designated Lambo washer? I could really use the extra money

If I feel like I made enough on a few things I got running right now then I’ll play it. Need the right amount of chips to play at the table.

2021-06-18 19:38:07,wallstreetbets,Like Bezos blowing himself up in his rocket next month that only flew a handful of times? Even Elon isn't that dumb.

2021-06-18 19:02:23,wallstreetbets,Lol I did exactly the opposite of what I was thinking today… let’s see what happens next week
2021-06-18 19:03:23,wallstreetbets,But if I can’t be number 1 at anything else I might as well be the number 1 retard in all of WSB

2021-06-18 19:37:11,wallstreetbets,Dude said I waited two weeks and nothing happened. Cries a bunch of tears and pounds fist into ground. If you are only willing to wait two weeks or you are listening to all the hype positive or negative and not just holding you will never cash in on amc.

2021-06-18 19:07:46,wallstreetbets,"The average short position sits at 10$ per share which means approximately 500% loss so far. Financial analytics shows us hedge funds haven’t covered (just a few millions on June 2nd).

2021-06-18 19:48:53,wallstreetbets,It's still in an upwards trajectory. It hasn't become a bear market yet? Do you know anything about technical analysis? I don't understand why anyone could thing this is over. A ducking gamma squeeze and it's just consolidating... And it's suddenly over? Who the Frick cares if it doesn't go to 100k. It's gone up 3200% in 5 months and it has another 50% in it at least. What sort of investment gives you that much? Ducking hold on till it forms a lower low. Greedy poor people problems.

2021-06-18 17:52:10,wallstreetbets,too much word
2021-06-18 19:22:09,wallstreetbets,Shills everywhere. Buy AMC
2021-06-18 19:54:56,wallstreetbets,"We closed over$59 today with the SEC taking the day off telling the HFs that no one would be looking at the crap they would do. 
We kicked butt!"
2021-06-18 17:57:38,wallstreetbets,"AMC was never a “value” investment imho.  Maybe when it was so far down (like $2.00) it had very short term strategy, even at $8-$10 as well.  But until the world as we know it returns to a “normal” where no one has to fear for their lives leaving their house, if I was invested in AMC, I would have sold it at $50+.  Any smart invested would do the same and walk away from it.  One always needs an exit plan.   Or at least enough shares to sell CC’s on it to average down to a level where they could take the loss. 

I’m not trying to be critical of anyone who invested in AMC at a higher then today’s close.  If anything, I feel sorry for them FOMO’ing into it thinking it was going to be their golden ticket."
2021-06-18 17:51:04,wallstreetbets,Foh with that bullshit
2021-06-18 19:07:09,wallstreetbets,I sold everything today at $63. I have the exact same feeling. Nothing wrong with taking profits. I wish you all the best.
2021-06-18 19:15:57,wallstreetbets,"Your spot on, but your talking to people who think the hedge funds are losing billions a week not covering.  When i say losing, they think every week the shorts don't cover costs them billions of new dollars.  This is how they math.  When half your premise is 1000% wrong (again, using real math) your beyond fuk.  They also believe increased reverse repo usage is because shorts need to borrow money to pay these billions of dollars weekly.  Obviously, they so far into the Donny Kruger experiment there is no saving them.   

I think at this point, the funds have positioned so well that they are just making fat premiums and toying with these apes.  They bleed it slowly to keep hope alive.  

Essentially, AMC peeps own 25bil of 3bil company and paying dearly to keep it overvalued.  The greatest cuck of all time.  All the hedge funds have to do is feed the paranoia and paint the tape.  They will collect premiums and once apes lose faith ride all the way back down to about 10bil, where a handful of these dummies will baghold forever."
2021-06-18 19:48:15,wallstreetbets,"Haha look at all the confirmation bias. Person raises extremely excellent points, but y'all can't get past the echo chamber. If you don't have an exit plan, you'll probably be a bag holder."
2021-06-18 19:57:14,wallstreetbets,"You’re missing much. You are at a poker table but everybody else is also a retail investor. You’re just shoving the chips back and forth to each other at this point.  The hedges don’t have anything to do with this anymore because like you pointed out, they prolly learned their lesson with gme. Retail is sitting on amc and that’s why no gamma squeeze or quad witching shit happened. You guys all hype each other up for some big battle not understanding you’re fighting each other and missing out on other opportunities where you COULD take on the hedge’s, you COULD burn the shorts and COULD create a legitimate squeeze. But you can’t get past these stupid DDs and yolo plays because your too busy throwing ape shit at each other."
2021-06-18 19:18:26,wallstreetbets,This is why I sold at around 56 bucks after buying in around 13. I can't imagine the shorts would not do something to mitigate losses. They have a plan for sure.
2021-06-18 19:08:45,wallstreetbets,"Squeeze happened.  Amc a $40 billion company.  $30 billlon equity and 10 billion debt.  And in a declining business.

That being said I’m short calls.  So keep this fucker at $60.  My strike.  So I can keep collecting fat premium."
2021-06-18 18:01:22,wallstreetbets,You’re a dumb fuck for listening to dates. Short the stock please!
2021-06-18 17:53:58,wallstreetbets,Hedge funds and moneyed people control the country. Retail is gonna fucked at some point and that's just how it is. Make your money whole you can.

2021-06-18 19:18:15,wallstreetbets,"It’s all hype bro. People pump a bunch of money into something when it’s hyped up, then when it starts sinking they make up their own storyline to save them from drowning. No one wants to hear the negative everyone just wants to shout “MOON” like it really means anything. In the end the stock is where it’s at because of the hype. It’s a good thing, but stay grounded it’s not going to 300 anytime soon. Stay calm"
2021-06-18 19:15:51,wallstreetbets,"Wow bro really long winded. Are you new here? Most of us got in below 10, you were probably saying nothing was going to happen back then too. The fucking shills and intelligence in this sub is actually laughable. 

$5-$70 and the guy says ""where is the squeeze""? You're either young are actually retarded."
2021-06-18 18:56:06,wallstreetbets,"What is the short float? This doesn’t feel like a short squeeze and the company has done several offerings, surely this means a squeeze is very unlikely? Ape and rocket emojis only go so far"
2021-06-18 19:42:48,wallstreetbets,I love to see a good ol' fashioned brawl!! Lol!
2021-06-18 18:04:44,wallstreetbets,I have pondered exactly this. I was happily surprised at the jump to the lower $70's. I'm sure they read WSB posts as much as we do. So do you think the jump to $70. was just sheer buying volume? Or what?
2021-06-18 18:52:45,wallstreetbets,"If it's only been 2 weeks of YT videos for you, you're late. The gamma could be on Tuesday again since ootions are normally T+2 date, so people have 2 days from now to exercise their options. Last one did a 100% rip."
2021-06-18 19:01:19,wallstreetbets,"AMC was used a a lower entry buy in. There were so many signs it was going to do bad. But out of nowhere it spiked to 5x+ a price it had been around for a while.

This came after the CEO announced doubling the shares, released an article telling people not to invest, was exposed for selling off personal stock with other execs and has been tied to VC to pay off debt.

So when reading your post I agree. There's a ton of little people who were misled into it. I just hope they got in before the spike and sold. Although the current culture makes that unlikely.

And here we are, back to AMC and GME lines replicating each other.

Just a giant distraction. But congrats to everyone who made cash. For real."

2021-06-18 17:52:27,wallstreetbets,Good perspective! Like it
2021-06-18 18:18:00,wallstreetbets,Short squeeze already happened. 50% of shorts covered. Short interest used to be 20%+ and was reduced to 13% after it hit $70. So that was the squeeze. Now it’s riding the high of volatility and small gamma squeezes as the stock adjusts to this new flow of trading.
2021-06-18 19:01:35,wallstreetbets,"I sold my AMC yesterday and bought more GME. There is only one rocket, the rest of the meme stocks are just fuel."

2021-06-18 18:24:03,wallstreetbets,The squeeze happened when it went from $10 to $60. If you fomo'd in above $50 be careful not to find yourself as a bag holder.

It's still going to squeeze just a matter of time.  There was a lot of hype for many reasons going into this week but we don't put a date on it.

On any timeframe beyond 1 day, amc is up and slated to break an all time high. Maybe this is the edge of the atmosphere but I don’t think this is the moon. Against all odds this thing is screaming to the point where you have to reconsider how you’re calculating your odds."
2021-06-18 19:19:39,wallstreetbets,"Let me correct you, approximately 20% covered and they even established new short positions since then. Do you research (S3 + Ortex) and you will find out by yourself."
2021-06-18 18:37:23,wallstreetbets,Short it then.
2021-06-18 19:50:38,wallstreetbets,I’m take you up on that offer.
2021-06-18 19:02:46,wallstreetbets,amc has no dd. ive been trying to find some.
2021-06-18 19:01:49,wallstreetbets,"Short interest dropped in half, and much of the existing short interest was probably loaded at 60+. And even if they did decide to cover every short share, they'd be out before you even knew it. You're in clown mode, kid. You just repeat what the cult says without ever thinking for yourself"
2021-06-18 19:03:02,wallstreetbets,And I have a 1.50$ snack 😉

2021-06-18 18:02:31,wallstreetbets,"Short squeeze and gamma squeeze are 2 different things.  If you read my OP, I did acknowledge that the hike to $70 was the gamma itself.  The short squeeze on the other hand?  That's a different story imo.  That may or may not ever come."
2021-06-18 19:12:23,wallstreetbets,Watch the volume. When the volume starts to drop its time to gtfo. I’m already out. On to the next retarded play for me.
2021-06-18 18:41:41,wallstreetbets,"It’s science I saw it on Reddit. 

I’m obviously goofing to a certain degree but every time this thing pops it draws more buyers and encourages people who have made money to buy in again when it drops. People have been saying the end is neigh for a while but I think they keep digging into saying it because they just cant adjust their expectations to the trends, they want the trends to adjust to their expectations. Granted we’re on fucking WSB but you said it’s stupid and six people upvoted. That doesn’t mean I’m smarter or something but trading is a populist event and I encourage you to check the numbers. ☕️

Update: lol"
2021-06-18 19:15:21,wallstreetbets,Or they're just an average person making some good points lol.

2021-06-18 18:27:29,wallstreetbets,Sir your paper hand is showing
2021-06-18 19:10:59,wallstreetbets,Hehe 🙃
2021-06-18 18:57:45,wallstreetbets,"It’s not a stock I own, but it’s one I’ve been following sense the beginning of the year.   I find it interesting to watch what others are doing in regards to this stock.  

I did enjoy going to the theaters pre covid, but honestly, until everyone can truly sit at an indoor space that recirculates the air we breath without fear of catching some unforgiving virus, without having to wear a mask, I’m going to take a pass.  

As far as the price going up 15% this week, hey that’s great.  I’m glad retail bailed AMC out to help keep their doors open.  I would love to be able to take my son to a movie someday.  Just not right now.   

As I said, I don’t hold a position on this stock.  It’s just a good comeback story that down the road, should be made into a movie."
2021-06-18 19:32:34,wallstreetbets,"The actual number is 38% of them covered, I was just rounding (going from 21 to 13 is close enough to 20-10). Going into June short interest was 21%. After it hit $70 on June 2nd, the short interest dropped to 13% later that week. If anything, it’s a worse situation than a full 50% of them covering because 62% of the shorts saw the run to $70 and thought that wasn’t high enough to force them to cover. Then others either re-shorted, or joined in to short and the short interest is back up to 23% at the current highs. So those who held their positions would still need to see the stock move beyond $70 to be willing to close, and those who just joined or re-positioned would need to see another 100-200% move to want to close. The likely-hood is slim"
2021-06-18 18:44:28,wallstreetbets,Thats above my trading level or I'd consider it.
2021-06-18 19:09:53,wallstreetbets,"That’s because it’s not worth $60. It’s not worth $20. I’m rooting for you guys (got out this morning paid $42 for my shares), but for the love of god if you paid $40 or more for this shit I hope you can afford the bag."
2021-06-18 19:07:55,wallstreetbets,"Name calling? But I'm a 35-year-old clown that is up $650,000 this month because of AMC and I post my receipts  winning and losing positions. Not sure why my belief in AMC bull case triggers you so much... 

However you're wrong because the short interest is up in the past week and not cut in half.  the average short seller from the information that we have available to us is in at $12 and over 45 days.  Not that those numbers are accurate because they can hide their shorts via long calls. Also it doesn't show synthetic shorts."

2021-06-18 19:45:12,wallstreetbets,"If you ask me it‘s much easier to just count the numbers of shares sold short. According to S3 that number been at the highest end of may (92,3M) and was down to 68,8 couple days ago but increased since then without new official data. Definitely more on the table because we own the float and weak hands already sold."
2021-06-18 19:22:58,wallstreetbets,"i dont own amc. thats what i mean, where is the dd. gme at least has dd. amc just repurposes gme dd"
2021-06-18 19:09:56,wallstreetbets,There you go with your imaginary cult ramblings. Yeah I made money too but it's still a deranged cult that keeps dragging this shit on and trying to push people away from all other fucking stocks on the market because you think your stocks in a dying industry with low short interest is special.
2021-06-18 19:19:00,wallstreetbets,"What they said makes a hell of a lot more sense than people who say it will legitimately hit $100k lol. Even expecting it to go above $100 is iffy at best, it is an overvalued stock."
2021-06-18 18:55:59,wallstreetbets,Well I'll let it go once the shorts cover. Then buy it back after the drop and support it for years to come.
2021-06-18 19:12:12,wallstreetbets," ""There you go with your imaginary cult ramblings"" ...those are called facts guy...

  ohhhh I didn't realize you were a CLOV guy in my message that explains a lot why your so triggered. I apologize and sorry for your loss this past week and half"
2021-06-18 19:22:45,wallstreetbets,We know it’s overvalued! What control the price is put to call ratio and the volume! It has the highest daily volume in the whole market with low put to call ratio. Yesterday call options increased from 100k to 960k in one day
2021-06-18 19:14:01,wallstreetbets,"Lots of people were down on amc for a long time before it took off. At least clov is actual growing business with actually high short interest. And no, I didn't sell amc to buy clov, I sold amc and then discovered clov"
2021-06-18 19:18:21,wallstreetbets,"If you want to invest in clove for a long time I'm not going to say it's a bad play cuz it is a growing company. It's a different kind of play than AMC right now. If you're playing it like a short squeeze you're going to be in it for a long time and that's fine too I don't care. 

Just looking at your post history, you get out of AMC and then you've been crying about ever since you got out. Chill man. If you like your position on clov cool. But every third post doesn't have to be how terrible AMC is since you got out."
2021-06-18 19:22:12,wallstreetbets,lmao hows that clov head fake the last 4 of 5 days treating you? 😆
2021-06-18 19:21:19,wallstreetbets,"Imagine going through people's post history when they say anything against the amc cult. You guys are creepy. I had to stay off Twitter because they were trying to dox me to send me death threats. I can wait for clov, I waited for amc. But there is absolutely nothing about amc that makes it worth buying. It's just a pump and dump that hasn't been dumped yet. Supported by a ravenous, moronic cult that spreads misinformation like their stock is the one stock that has billions of synthetic shares that a computer will have to buy back. I was sick of the cultist trash even when I held the stock"
2021-06-18 19:25:38,wallstreetbets,"Why you think he's mad? Hedge funds and shills pump clove for 3 days to divert from AMC and he buys 9,000 shares of clov at $25. That was the date AMC hit 40. If he bought AMC that day instead he would be up 50% instead of down 50%. ...Then he is complaining about AMC holders because they're taking attention away from clov and it's their fault that clov dropped from $25 ->12... I kind of feel bad for the guy now."
2021-06-18 19:23:46,wallstreetbets,"Well it sucks, can't say otherwise. But I bought it from parts of my gme and amc takings so it's not a big deal. I can wait. People bashed amc for months too, or do you guys not remember how amc was treated everywhere from February to may"
2021-06-18 19:22:46,wallstreetbets,"I looked at your post history to see what investments you're into because you start attacking me, my DD, and calling me names. Maybe you actually give good advice in other posts and I can learn from it.. but nope. Just AMC hate every 3rd post.  You don't even post your positions. 

Anyway have a good one buddy"
2021-06-18 19:32:27,wallstreetbets,alright i mean we shouldnt shit on the guy we have all done stupid shit.  shouldn't even be on wsb lets be honest
2021-06-18 19:37:01,wallstreetbets,Did you really buy 9000 shares of CLOV at $25 ? Damn.  I'm sorry man. That would be tough either way. I sincerely hope you can get it back ASAP.

2021-06-18 18:57:22,wallstreetbets,"High Stock-Based Comp is the norm. Software Engineers / Staff at FAANG are highly paid in stock options and PLTR needs to compete with them for talent.

AMZN has a max cash salary of $180K (even for the C-Suite) -- everything else is stock. I Believe GOOG is $200K. Meanwhile a Sr. Engineer (5-10yrs) of experience are easily pulling in $500K a year meaning about $300K in stock. Not unusual for new grads year 1 to make closer to $200K. Principal Engineer is 7 figures."

2021-06-18 17:10:31,wallstreetbets,Made rough estimates of operating costs from cruise ship company 10Ks.  Profit per cabin based on that.

2021-06-18 18:40:41,wallstreetbets,"I can get you a whole crew lol,"
2021-06-18 17:20:00,wallstreetbets,"Way low.  A merchant ship in the 90s was running $25k+ per day.  Thats with a crew of less than 20.  You need a LOT more crew for a cruise ship.  Granted if you run a flag of convenience you can pay em nothing ($4/day).  Or you could be ruthless, not pay them at all, and when they complain throw them overboard and hire replacements at the next port (just like some companies do now)."

2021-06-18 17:50:04,wallstreetbets,"Bahamas, Cyprus, Liberia are all very lax about their requirements.  Its been a while so I'm not sure where your best bet is currently."
2021-06-18 18:25:04,wallstreetbets,Go with Liberia. Easier sales to dumb American tourists thinking it's a US boat. Need a salesman?

2021-06-18 19:38:35,wallstreetbets,"So as someone who doesn't get involved with options, explain to me what I'm looking at: Did OP put out a call for $65, and missed it by $0.05 as today's high was $64.95?"

2021-06-18 19:24:37,wallstreetbets,"Most of that is in the last price for those calls, but my guess is he couldn't even do a market sell on those before close. He has $100 in cash."

2021-06-18 16:51:09,wallstreetbets,He took a 0DTE (zero days to expire) bet that AMC was going to close above $65 and it gaped his portfolio. Insta roadkill for thetagang.

You buy put if you think stonk go down.

2021-06-18 18:04:39,wallstreetbets,I have some. First one is free.
2021-06-18 16:55:09,wallstreetbets,This was an absolutely terrible fucking bet. Highly risky. You do this when you know something or you prove you know nothing. Knowing it will close well above the strike would be needed to profit cause theta was against this the entire time after buying it.
2021-06-18 17:19:59,wallstreetbets,"assuming that .02 is the  -98.8% of his initial investment, he bought the options for about 1.66 each.

had AMC ended today at 70 like you say, they would have each been worth 5.00 so he would have tripled his investment (3 x $42k = $126k). Every dollar above strike is worth about 25.2k, so this could have paid off very well if the quad witching day worked out.."
2021-06-18 17:18:40,wallstreetbets,$0 at 65 close for 65 strike

2021-06-18 18:40:36,wallstreetbets,They are contesting it and it’s like them and 6 other banks. They committed $70 billion US to improving the environment and economy of Brazil. Not sure they would do that if they knew they were screwed.
2021-06-18 17:12:50,wallstreetbets,I believe in the insider trading and nothing on this sub will do anything

2021-06-18 19:40:35,wallstreetbets,I did a well….. but I also bought more shares at 15 and 20 to sell additional contracts… that part didn’t work out so well lol
2021-06-18 19:42:20,wallstreetbets,The way it goes....
2021-06-18 19:33:37,wallstreetbets,I'm 3.5k shares in

2021-06-18 18:35:45,wallstreetbets,Nice. I bought $13 calls for 8/20. LFG!🚀
2021-06-18 18:16:41,wallstreetbets,Were up 22ish percent this month. Steady gains every week and almost every day. Gonna be a green Christmas.
2021-06-18 18:17:51,wallstreetbets,Bruh I pray for you. I mean I don’t actually pray but clov is looking rough.
2021-06-18 16:33:18,wallstreetbets,Its in there man.
2021-06-18 16:33:05,wallstreetbets,Done.
2021-06-18 17:04:51,wallstreetbets,No!
2021-06-18 16:31:29,wallstreetbets,"Yep. Going to buy more when it levels out as well in the high $22's. Its a good value play and should be valued in the higher $20's. What's left of my calls will expire OTM but that's fine because the massive IV crunch earlier I gained enough to double down on the shares. 

Analysts on the street are issuing a $30 price target but I think due to such a diluted sector that $WEN will eventually go up to the mid to high $20's. So that's around a 25% increase. Do with that info what you will. 

&#x200B;

Best of luck man!"
2021-06-18 18:25:31,wallstreetbets,Given how it's moved the past week or two that's on the low end. I bought in at 10.47 and it was above 13 within a couple days
2021-06-18 18:32:07,wallstreetbets,You’ll be crying when it hits 20 in July/September

2021-06-18 18:21:54,wallstreetbets,Thanks brother 😎. AMC was also a rocky road to the land of milk and honey.  $CLOV fundamentals and massive short squeeze potential will bring home the tendies 👍

The lonely blue light of Jim Cramers laptop screen illuminates his 300sq ft apartment. His eyes, bloodshot from scrolling through Reddit looking for tomorrow’s best trades. 

Exhausted, he tosses his head back and the last of the beer in the can with it. He has been waiting up all night for a reply from that special someone with a response to his request. 

DING

His heart is racing, suddenly he’s not so tired any more. Did she say yes? Did she Call him a disgusting pig and chew him out in a novel sized rant? Jim slams his beer down and fumbles through his phone to open his telegram app. He takes a deep breath and opens the message. 

“Jimmy, of course! I would love to help you out, for the right price 😘

I wore the white ones alllll day baby. The blue ones were worn during my morning walk yesterday and the pink ones were worn during Pilates.

2021-06-18 19:32:37,wallstreetbets,"The credit spreads between long duration and short duration bonds is narrowing. That means, the bond market is pricing in: we are past peak growth. Low lending activity, less economic activity. On top of that, a debatable inflation problem, not because of Fed's QE but because of fiscal spend. This to go alongside a complex labor market problem. Market is going to be turbulent for months, I think, as long as there is no economic clarity. We are really close to the top. I think we already saw it. Bond market is cuing the stock market on the future. The chances of a correction in the coming few weeks is really high.

My thesis is: first, 🌽 breaks down below $30k; second, all meme stocks gets taken to the woodshed the next day; third, reflation plays see further downside (especially financials and energy stocks); fourth, commodities keep dipping (especially copper), fifth, upcoming no PE tech gets hammered."

Jim Cramer lifts his head from under his desk and sniffs loudly. Clearing the last bit euphoric substance deep into his nasal cavity. His eyes are alert yet unfocused. 

“10 seconds Mr. Cramer” the PA cries

He stretches, and articulates for his next guest. 

“Red leather, yellow leather, red leather, yellow leather...”

“5 seconds”

Jim ducked under his desk one last time, reached into his pocket and produced a soft white sock with the name “Yellen” embroidered on it in pink silk. 

He takes one last deep sniff from his “little helper”, emerges from his desk and stares directly into the camera lens. 

“It’s showtime.”"

2021-06-18 17:01:09,wallstreetbets,"Still distraught from the wild bear attacks of this afternoon SPY can vividly remember being surrounded by the towering shadowy figures and their throbbing red bear cock. Pinned down by the alpha, he was ready to thrust into her as the group sneered and laughed. 

The alpha bear saw an entry point and began to drill his member into SPY. She closed her eyes and clenched her jaw hoping someone, anyone would help her find an exit strategy. Just as soon as the alpha entered his position he was met with resistance. 

With A flash of light and several yelps the bears dispersed and ran off into the woods. 

SPY opened her eyes and tried to focus them in the light to see her hero. JPOW takes his hand and gently brushes the market’s hair out of her eyes. She blushes. 

“Thank you for saving me from that terrible position. If he drilled another 7% I would never have been the same.”

JPOW looks deep into SPYs eyes. The energy around him shifts from a calming familiar friend to that of a sinister deviant. 

SPY senses she’s not out of harms way. She winced as JPOW leans in to her ear and whispers: “I put on my robe and wizard hat.”"

2021-06-18 18:28:37,wallstreetbets,limit up? 🥺👉🏻👈🏻
2021-06-18 18:28:19,wallstreetbets,"We have seen circuit city, where was it now 🤗"
2021-06-18 19:26:35,wallstreetbets,"With that mentality just call it quits on stocks bro, plenty of great careers out there. Become a kayaking instructor or something fun. Write this one up as an experience, in a few years you'll laugh at it, sporting a tan, while boning your hot kayaker gf."
2021-06-18 19:19:43,wallstreetbets,Ur dog loves u bro
2021-06-18 19:06:00,wallstreetbets,Then contribute something to make it tip towards the og subreddit instead of whining. It’s slowly tipping back. Have a drink bud
2021-06-18 19:04:05,wallstreetbets,Now 5k in stocks is considered yolo. 🤷‍♂️
2021-06-18 19:01:49,wallstreetbets,Whatever stoolie

2021-06-18 17:43:24,wallstreetbets,"I mean, yeah. It ain’t gonna touch that high again for a while. Don’t give into the dumb diamond hands “ape hold” mentality here. Get profits, get out. Do it again."
2021-06-18 18:17:24,wallstreetbets,Let me know what your next play is so I can do the opposite.  I'll split tendies with you.
2021-06-18 19:48:28,wallstreetbets,💼🧳👜
2021-06-18 16:42:56,wallstreetbets,"My theory for a while is it’s going to trade somewhere between 30-60 forever. Market makers are making so much money running it up and down regardless of what bullshit numbers ortex is putting out there.

MMs are running it up all while selling idiotic options that will never print. Shorting from the top and selling off and covering all the way down. Taking profits and collecting premiums from fucked options buying the bottom and running it back up. Rinse and repeating forever, all while keeping just low enough that bagholders at the top never get out, but just high enough that early apes feel no pressure to get out cause they’re permanently green on paper.

It’s a madness that will never end"
2021-06-18 16:39:58,wallstreetbets,Institutions are selling calls to the apes who still think it's going to hit $5000 a share. Just collecting premium until they capitulate.
2021-06-18 16:41:43,wallstreetbets,Right app
2021-06-18 17:46:09,wallstreetbets,Why did this sound like an anime outro?
2021-06-18 17:46:58,wallstreetbets,This post is not going to age well
2021-06-18 17:48:01,wallstreetbets,I feel like options are still purely a gamble. Deep leap calls just feel like they were invented for insider trading or WSB yolos

2021-06-18 16:49:20,wallstreetbets,Kids love panic selling. I enjoy it too. Ran around the office screaming and throwing papers in the air for a little while. It's cathartic.
2021-06-18 16:50:13,wallstreetbets,The interest rate hike they're talking about talking about in the future. The market is overdramatic as fuck

2021-06-18 16:28:58,wallstreetbets,"I day trade SPY and AAPL. I am down 1.6k this week, but I was down 5.7k this morning and managed to climb up through puts/call scalps. all I can say is fuck Bullard for stroking bear dicks just in time for quad-witching, you can't tell me CNBC didn't do that on purpose."
2021-06-18 16:36:06,wallstreetbets,You’re living in the clouds if you don’t think CNBC knows exactly what there up to. He was one of 7 fed chairs that voted for early rate increases and they know that. Shit was pre planned.
2021-06-18 16:42:15,wallstreetbets,"23&me just IPO’d through a spac & the new ticker is ME. Anything below $11 is good and you can make more than 10% easy peasy, don’t know about long term.

Even  though I looooooove their product, I don’t care for their business model. They’re running on old sequencing tech, do not own their labs, and are dependent solely on brand name & all the data they gathered. If they start sequencing their own stuff, while also modernizing, I’d be more enthusiastic. But they specifically said they have no plans to do that, and are focusing on membership and pharceutical deals instead."
2021-06-18 16:39:47,wallstreetbets,"forreal, that's the one silver lining of taking an L"

2021-06-18 17:31:27,wallstreetbets,"Did you mean literally (on c0cain) and you’re asking what to serve with the cocaine? I recommend a banana. If you meant more figuratively, you could put it into helium stocks to go to the moon, cause helium will not actually take you to the moon."

preposterous."
2021-06-18 18:56:13,wallstreetbets,Foreseeing sell-off. Maybe to 410? It'll recover again soon enough.

2021-06-18 19:54:25,wallstreetbets,"I dunno, do you want to tell the same 8 stories about how different the people there are from now until you die? Do you want to be 45 years old wearing a college sweatshirt regaling people with your “years abroad” as “the most impactful and invaluable shift in your perspective you could have ever asked for”?

It’s probably worth it, but you run the risk of being really fucking annoying. I had a teacher who spent a year in Belgium and he acted like he knew everything about the entire world, so don’t go if you’re a know-it-all prick."
2021-06-18 19:51:37,wallstreetbets,If you come from money. Otherwise nah

2021-06-18 16:04:43,wallstreetbets,"Rig got kicked out of one of the Russell indexes, that may have caused some short term selling?"
2021-06-18 16:57:23,wallstreetbets,I think they are still paying off deep water horizon.
2021-06-18 15:49:50,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-18 17:57:23,wallstreetbets,and also paying off the box office flop...
2021-06-18 16:28:13,wallstreetbets,Think we might have soared today if all of Wallstreet hadn't collectively shit the bed. Monday's going to be interesting.
2021-06-18 16:11:15,wallstreetbets,"I am not really sure about technical analysis since it requires a lot of uncertain forecast that has nothing to do with the market sentiment. The trading volume is there, the interest is really high however, people need to start investing in the stock in order to drive the stock price up, not options. You buy the stock, the price will go up and vice versa."
2021-06-18 17:18:24,wallstreetbets,I am BALLZ deep and going DEEPER
2021-06-18 16:33:11,wallstreetbets,"$WISH will be shining the next couple of weeks as I have stated before, then it will drop before reaching the next option expiring day (7/16). Be smart, be a winner, buy stocks instead of doing options! You will see the difference."
2021-06-18 15:48:37,wallstreetbets,"Ape see blue wobbly line ...
 Ape likes blue wobbly line....
Ape buy more wish to make more blue wobbly line ..

Makes  Ape  happy"
2021-06-18 17:36:09,wallstreetbets,"I saw the same wedge, only by my charting today it broke north and hit the $12 resistance/former support. We’ll see if it can break through next week and maybe get a little gamma squeeze going."
2021-06-18 15:35:16,wallstreetbets,We seriously doing technical analysis on a meme stock lol
2021-06-18 15:48:11,wallstreetbets,BEST
2021-06-18 16:28:05,wallstreetbets,All it says to me is that it'll break out. Which way though who knows? Just get a 13C/8P 20AUG21 strangle and $WISH for the best;)
2021-06-18 19:32:04,wallstreetbets,Looks promising. Im in
2021-06-18 16:12:27,wallstreetbets,went from 7% up to 1.5% up suck my cock
2021-06-18 15:49:28,wallstreetbets,The inside of my wallet is a converging wedge pattern lately. ⬆️💰⬆️💰
2021-06-18 17:21:50,wallstreetbets,Not retarded.....it is forming a wedge...but the broader market may take it south of this formation!
2021-06-18 17:42:49,wallstreetbets,I would like this to go tits up
2021-06-18 16:26:21,wallstreetbets,It’s like taking the Rorschach test. I see head and shoulders on conjoined twins. Bearish!
2021-06-18 17:20:05,wallstreetbets,Definitely not a wedge
2021-06-18 15:50:07,wallstreetbets,Wish is hot garbage imo
2021-06-18 19:37:07,wallstreetbets,What does this mean boss?
2021-06-18 15:48:52,wallstreetbets,YO THIS ISNT GME
2021-06-18 17:33:36,wallstreetbets,They added weekly options...
2021-06-18 17:46:47,wallstreetbets,Maybe it would have if the Dow didn’t go down 500 pts
2021-06-18 15:42:05,wallstreetbets,How else can I convince myself to lose more money
2021-06-18 15:42:03,wallstreetbets,Monke see monke do
2021-06-18 17:35:03,wallstreetbets,I would not recommend that... By shares and sell covered calls each week to collect premiums.. with 97% institutional ownership there's not a huge reason to keep us down at $8 and nothing in the market is going to dictate us going to that level...
2021-06-18 17:52:29,wallstreetbets,Nah I can tell you what it really is. But you have to promise not to tell  the rest of the Ape Nation that I passed second grade geometry
2021-06-18 19:00:22,wallstreetbets,Mmmmm the delicious temptation......
2021-06-18 18:15:16,wallstreetbets,Monkey P all over you

2021-06-18 18:16:24,wallstreetbets,O lord this is getting outrageous with all these loss porn posts coming through. Mark this fucking Sub NSFW.
2021-06-18 15:49:56,wallstreetbets,That’s hot. Congratulations on having balls the size of Christmas hams
2021-06-18 15:17:04,wallstreetbets,y
2021-06-18 15:45:31,wallstreetbets,You tried and that's all that matters
2021-06-18 18:15:56,wallstreetbets,"You don't diamond hand options, LMFAO."
2021-06-18 15:29:56,wallstreetbets,"Nice man, good to see that there are still retards like myself on this sub. 🙏💎"
2021-06-18 15:22:21,wallstreetbets,When did you buy that option?
2021-06-18 15:27:11,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely brutal week, keep your head up as next week brings new opportunities!!"

2021-06-18 19:06:33,wallstreetbets,"Retard Class of 2021.

Congrats Valedictorian!"
2021-06-18 15:23:16,wallstreetbets,"Next week you will make it, it time to move on. By the way in my humble opinion today before the market close is a fantastic day to make money, because it’s has been brutal week."
2021-06-18 15:17:53,wallstreetbets,Wow 😮
2021-06-18 19:38:06,wallstreetbets,Yes you do!   Wtf yes you do!!!   If you’re not a retard ape.. then maybe
2021-06-18 15:46:52,wallstreetbets,Back when I had 8 thousand more dollars
2021-06-18 16:30:30,wallstreetbets,Your wife’s boyfriend won’t be happy you blew his 8k in Sony stock instead of AMC he had asked you to YOLO it in.
2021-06-18 16:06:55,wallstreetbets,You should always push options out 2-3 quarters at least
2021-06-18 16:48:59,wallstreetbets,Yeah maybe if you sit down to pee.
2021-06-18 16:50:48,wallstreetbets,Ok brokeback mountain. The only tendies you’re getting are in a happy meal
2021-06-18 19:37:10,wallstreetbets,I’ll have you know..
2021-06-18 15:14:43,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure you qualified beforehand
2021-06-18 15:25:16,wallstreetbets,Sorry. Was there an opportunity to sell that you missed or do you just have a bad picker?
2021-06-18 15:26:29,wallstreetbets,Always next time🍇💰
2021-06-18 15:17:25,wallstreetbets,when you guys gonna start playing the long calls?
2021-06-18 15:34:53,wallstreetbets,I say yes my fellow retard.
2021-06-18 15:16:15,wallstreetbets,You should have just bought physics silver it would have preserved this lost
2021-06-18 15:42:09,wallstreetbets,"“of course i know him (retard), he’s me”"
2021-06-18 19:45:34,wallstreetbets,I have covered calls for the $30 strike price. I’ll have to buy those back soon
2021-06-18 16:26:57,wallstreetbets,Overqualified
2021-06-18 17:07:34,wallstreetbets,🤣🤣🤣🤣
2021-06-18 17:10:24,wallstreetbets,Yep 100% retard verified
2021-06-18 17:36:25,wallstreetbets,Maybe you’ll get lucky in July…
2021-06-18 18:45:29,wallstreetbets,1 share lol just a little token to remember your shitty options play
2021-06-18 18:16:39,wallstreetbets,Guuhhhh
2021-06-18 18:46:59,wallstreetbets,He was tarded before and now he’s re-tarded
2021-06-18 17:37:14,wallstreetbets,Some hate going on here. I say good luck to all of us apes who holds
2021-06-18 16:11:27,wallstreetbets,"While I understand Wish is currently competing with upcoming memestonk for the attention of this subreddit, why is it getting all the hate?"
2021-06-18 17:17:03,wallstreetbets,"I'm ALL IN
1330 @ 11.11"
2021-06-18 18:27:36,wallstreetbets,Got everything I have available in Wish now. You got this 👊
2021-06-18 15:48:53,wallstreetbets,BEST
2021-06-18 17:11:03,wallstreetbets,Only 11 contracts? 🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-18 19:19:03,wallstreetbets,That’s been dumped. You’re late to the party it’s already over
2021-06-18 15:31:43,wallstreetbets,"Sir, you’re in a pump n dump."
2021-06-18 15:30:18,wallstreetbets,Only people who invest in that trash are people who never bought anything from that trash app. Lol
2021-06-18 15:49:08,wallstreetbets,If it ain’t gme I don’t want it
2021-06-18 15:46:57,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-18 15:45:21,wallstreetbets,"1) bagholding is not cool
2) you haven't lost enough to post yet

Ban this loser"
2021-06-18 18:00:02,wallstreetbets,I only see hate from the boomers and the amc cult
2021-06-18 16:12:59,wallstreetbets,"Seriously. It has both shorties and actual value, seems like this fits the narrative perfectly!"
2021-06-18 18:49:19,wallstreetbets,Proof or ban! I’m kidding. Nobody cares.
2021-06-18 17:20:29,wallstreetbets,I know. But can you blame me for all the 🐓💩 on here trying to take down anything that’s not GME or AMC?
2021-06-18 19:59:53,wallstreetbets,Who’s paying you to comment like this? & how much? I can beat their price $$
2021-06-18 15:33:10,wallstreetbets,I know! I love it. I flush my money as fast as possible.
2021-06-18 15:36:00,wallstreetbets,"On a serious note, I own a large AMZ seller business and I fucking hate them. I’d gladly die on the trash tree to potentially keep another marketplace alive.

Call me Oscar the grouch. Trash baby."
2021-06-18 18:12:58,wallstreetbets,"Kinda cute how retarded some people are, buying a pair of Yeezy for 9 dollars plus 2 dollar Shipping thinking its a legit pair delivered on your girls bf's doorstep after 2 weeks.
You get what you fuckagoating pay for.

1.Dont blame wish for being a retard 
2.WISH is still not selling the products, its for other retails to Sell THEIR PRODUCKTS. 
3. Do your DD before trashing a stonk

You can talk alotta shit about wish  but they are competing with the biggest e-commerce companies in the World without a problem.

EXACTLY why they are offering a different kind of service. Both amazon and Alibaba tried to buy wish... Now i think about it Jack ma is retarded an bezos too so not the best argument but i still think its woth trowing in there.  

Want real Yeezy and fast shipping ? Yolo on wish ;) see u at 30 pussies"
2021-06-18 16:23:45,wallstreetbets,"Bought leds, magnets, shoes, clockmaker glasses. They were all fine. Bought a shoulder bag. It was crap. The casino quality is part of the fun."
2021-06-18 18:00:50,wallstreetbets,Oh shit. Am I supposed to like the company to buy its stocks? I didn’t know that
2021-06-18 19:18:45,wallstreetbets,"I think the GME, AMC, PLTR runs are over"
2021-06-18 16:20:24,wallstreetbets,I’m up almost $150k on wish. So yeah.
2021-06-18 15:51:04,wallstreetbets,I don’t usually talk about my shits until after I poo and have time to reflect. So?
2021-06-18 19:31:55,wallstreetbets,I hate it because it's lost me a lot of money. Maybe there are others lol.
2021-06-18 17:40:34,wallstreetbets,"There's definitely a lot more excitement on Twitter for this stock, and it has the volume to prove it's real."
2021-06-18 16:10:15,wallstreetbets,Don’t listen to him. You’ll be very happy with those shares.
2021-06-18 19:31:21,wallstreetbets,Shows how much you know
2021-06-18 18:42:18,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-18 18:58:07,wallstreetbets,"I’m sure that sounded better in your head before you typed it out. 
In any case, I don’t expect to see you around very much longer."
2021-06-18 17:36:25,wallstreetbets,I've decided to buy NVDA shares for the fundamentals a long time ago. If it crashes some time this year  (I hope it does) I'll finally have an opportunity to double my position.
2021-06-18 15:50:06,wallstreetbets,So... sell?
2021-06-18 16:42:36,wallstreetbets,Buy the rumor sell the news.

2021-06-18 16:31:11,wallstreetbets,Yup. It tanked at close
2021-06-18 17:36:53,wallstreetbets,"Tanked,down .1 % ?"
2021-06-18 18:42:33,wallstreetbets,Yes. It was up 4% intraday.
2021-06-18 16:41:01,wallstreetbets,Chargepoint gets your frontrow parking at disney parks. Bullish.
2021-06-18 14:57:53,wallstreetbets,Did they also partner with another automaker or did I make that up?
2021-06-18 15:04:12,wallstreetbets,I bought at beginning of SPAC. Still holding.
2021-06-18 17:00:54,wallstreetbets,"I'm long. But still down 12%...

Jan 22 $30c paid 8.70.  Had the right idea, just bad buying."
2021-06-18 16:53:07,wallstreetbets,Long and strong 💪!!!!
2021-06-18 17:44:18,wallstreetbets,"I had some shares at 22$, sold at 30 😔"
2021-06-18 15:39:11,wallstreetbets,GM a few months ago
2021-06-18 14:47:06,wallstreetbets,"lmao, WSB has come full circle,"
2021-06-18 15:28:46,wallstreetbets,"im sold took a massive hit on BB CPNG, RKT and NIO this week. need some break even with this next week lol.

100 Contracts at $20.5 Strike EXO 6/25

wish us luck"
2021-06-18 16:00:09,wallstreetbets,"Kinda pricey but you may be onto something, I bought some shit there after each of my shots."
2021-06-18 18:18:27,wallstreetbets,Rad was the first stock I bought outright off of DD from a friend. Maybe it's time to get back in it with new knowledge?
2021-06-18 15:13:49,wallstreetbets,Ok I’m in!!
2021-06-18 17:07:39,wallstreetbets,Sounds totally RAD!!!
2021-06-18 15:07:06,wallstreetbets,Great DD! Also do not forget that Rite Aid may actually be acquired by Amazon (as mentioned in the Motley Fool piece). So this also could be a major catalyst! Let's not forget LinkedIn stock jumped by 50% in a day when Microsoft announced its acquiring it.
2021-06-18 14:38:27,wallstreetbets,What's a major squeeze?
2021-06-18 14:45:08,wallstreetbets,Institutional owners don't always report at the same time so there is no guarantee that they are being double counted and the total ownership combined is 60%
2021-06-18 15:28:56,wallstreetbets,"Post history is entirely pumping RAD. 

No thanks gtfo"
2021-06-18 16:23:19,wallstreetbets,"Watch, it's going to smash expectations but sell off because dipshit hedge funds saying ""well, it didn't beat our expectations by as much as we'd like."""
2021-06-18 14:50:15,wallstreetbets,"Very true, very true.  Rite Aid was a one-time darling of the WallStreetBets crowd a few years back.

Now it is on the brink of finally returning to profitability this year after several years of struggle.

Hedge funds have done their best to short this one into complete bankruptcy, but have failed.

I would love to grab a pint of Rite Aid Thrifty brand ice cream, sit back, and watch this one soar on Thursday if they post strong earnings.  That' would be sweet."
2021-06-18 16:02:24,wallstreetbets,"If you sign up for the Rite Aid app you quickly gain GOLD status and qualify for and automatic 20% off everything that is not already on sale.

They are always running great specials.  Buy-one-get-one-free, etc.  

I usually walk out with anywhere from 25 - 40% off the listed prices on my entire purchase."
2021-06-18 14:40:46,wallstreetbets,"I think a doubling of the stock price is possible to $40+ per share.  Even at that price level, Rite Aid's market cap would still be below $2 billion.  Quite low for a company that did $24 billion in revenue last year representing 9%+ year-over-year growth."
2021-06-18 14:46:31,wallstreetbets,May very well be true.  But institutional ownership in RAD typically hovers around 60%.
2021-06-18 16:18:23,wallstreetbets,"Trying to bring attention to a missed placed valuation stock isn't Pumping! RAD is as much as a Naked Shorting victim as AMC and GME, however as an overall company they are 10 times more of a sound investment. RAD has a squeeze potential unmatched except for Game Stop before they released more shares. If you can't see it. It's because you can't add."
2021-06-18 17:34:07,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, I’d be more concerned when bunch of random account show up in bunches with “buy [insert ticker] now”. If someone provides detailed DD. I’d read it and judge accordingly. No one has the time to be expert on all tickets. Most of us focus on one or two. We all have day jobs you know.."
2021-06-18 15:02:11,wallstreetbets,Got some calls for old time's sake.
2021-06-18 16:06:38,wallstreetbets,"I meant the SP seems pricey right now, not the shit I bought, lol. It's had a nice run up over the last month or so. I think it can run more though, and I'm in."
2021-06-18 14:42:04,wallstreetbets,Hmm...would it a decent notion to buy shares for them as of now?
2021-06-18 18:26:33,wallstreetbets,"Buying calls seems like wasting money.like every day that passes by, u have to hope the stock goes higher."
2021-06-18 16:10:00,wallstreetbets,"Oh, OK.  

At $1 billion market cap and $24 billion in revenue, I think the stock is actually priced quite low.  

I haven't been able to find any other companies (with market caps of $1 billion or more)  that have a sales to market cap ratio of 24 to 1.  If anyone knows of such a company, please post.   (I may want to invest in that company!)"
2021-06-18 14:43:57,wallstreetbets,"It depends.  If your motto is YOLO and you crave high-risk / high-reward, you buy here.

If you are a boomer who prefers to see which direction the wind blows and capture a few percentage points at the end of the run, you wait."
2021-06-18 16:17:16,wallstreetbets,"That is way to technical for my retarded brain, I just look at how many 🚀💎✋🌕🦍🍌🖍️and other emojis I see in a post and the responses, then take a quick look at the  📈 before I decide to buy a stonk."
2021-06-18 14:45:50,wallstreetbets,I am still very much new to stocks. I'll purchase one share and see where it gets me.

2021-06-18 15:23:50,wallstreetbets,Sus
2021-06-18 14:41:28,wallstreetbets,so it's trading at 10% valuation but fair market value is 2x from here?
2021-06-18 14:27:27,wallstreetbets,"Rookie numbers, but not too shaby."
2021-06-18 14:44:56,wallstreetbets,"Excellent smartest man, but you’re under the capital requirements for an ‘ISDA’ 😬"
2021-06-18 16:14:17,wallstreetbets,-$69 today. At least you got that going for you.
2021-06-18 14:19:45,wallstreetbets,"This is why that sub was created, to sell retards calls and make 20% a week"
2021-06-18 14:38:10,wallstreetbets,Poor ape wasn't even close..
2021-06-18 16:07:54,wallstreetbets,What’s a stop loss?
2021-06-18 16:23:05,wallstreetbets,Have you tried...... doing the opposite?
2021-06-18 14:45:21,wallstreetbets,Theta gang thanks you
2021-06-18 14:47:21,wallstreetbets,I have that same strategy too.
2021-06-18 19:44:05,wallstreetbets,"Just delete the app, you’ll be fine."
2021-06-18 14:20:46,wallstreetbets,Today’s return: nice
2021-06-18 15:44:57,wallstreetbets,The most interesting man in wsb!
2021-06-18 19:49:19,wallstreetbets,"Super juiced IV, insane theta decay, and a weekly option. Yep it's the WSB trifecta"
2021-06-18 14:22:35,wallstreetbets,Why not just buy the stock. I dont understand that part
2021-06-18 16:41:25,wallstreetbets,GME options are peligroso
2021-06-18 16:19:09,wallstreetbets,IV was too high
2021-06-18 17:01:35,wallstreetbets,But are you the most interesting options trader in the world?
2021-06-18 14:23:20,wallstreetbets,Yeah I got crushed on CLF call for -$2k but sold instead of losing -$4k today. Getting crushed in gold too :/
2021-06-18 15:16:39,wallstreetbets,"lost 2g's on the $CLNE $13 call today.... i feel u fellow 🦍.... me say....""here's more crayons"" 🖍🖍🖍"

2021-06-18 17:08:26,wallstreetbets,Fr i got fucking burned on some amc cal options. It was a stupid momentum trade which was profitable at first but im a bad trader and an idiot
2021-06-18 17:13:46,wallstreetbets,The worlds most invested man
2021-06-18 17:14:40,wallstreetbets,What made you think it was going to 330 by June 18?
2021-06-18 19:09:37,wallstreetbets,You don’t hold gme options till Friday! It always dip on Friday. I only buy on Friday.
2021-06-18 16:15:15,wallstreetbets,I lost $600 this week and felt bad hahah gahdamn! You legend!
2021-06-18 14:23:21,wallstreetbets,RIP where you up when we were at 350? what was your buy in price?
2021-06-18 17:03:51,wallstreetbets,Exactly like me 😎
2021-06-18 17:12:56,wallstreetbets,Lmao did you get to keep the $6?
2021-06-18 17:22:34,wallstreetbets,Ouch. I need to make some options videos to teach people how to make money on calls.
2021-06-18 17:27:32,wallstreetbets,i feel you 🙄
2021-06-18 17:38:43,wallstreetbets,This is why we've been saying not to buy GME options since January... Lol sorry for your misfortune
2021-06-18 18:01:09,wallstreetbets,*ɘɔin*
2021-06-18 18:40:16,wallstreetbets,Baby guh
2021-06-18 18:53:04,wallstreetbets,Stay retarted my friend
2021-06-18 19:20:04,wallstreetbets,"Bruh legit came into market open this morning like “this is it, I’m bout to be ITM finally” 😂😂😂"
2021-06-18 19:44:26,wallstreetbets,"This Fridays been the embodiment of the ""This is fine"" meme"
2021-06-18 19:46:38,wallstreetbets,🤣
2021-06-18 19:52:38,wallstreetbets, Me on amc options today
2021-06-18 14:27:37,wallstreetbets,Y’all should buy steel dynamics. Has a great future
2021-06-18 14:26:21,wallstreetbets,Ouch. You're retarded for not choosing $CLNE or $AAPL.
2021-06-18 14:19:57,wallstreetbets,Someone likes you.
2021-06-18 17:14:31,wallstreetbets,This didn't even give me a semi.
2021-06-18 18:21:11,wallstreetbets,Yeah I was down 20k this morning and still came out 3.6k ahead because I’m retarded lol
2021-06-18 15:16:20,wallstreetbets,"It looks bad that we didn't know that, doesn't it?"
2021-06-18 15:57:51,wallstreetbets,20% a week is a bit unrealistic without taking major risks.  I like to minimize my downside risks while keeping my annualized return on investment at least 50%.  It's pretty amazing what selling options to FOMOing apes will net you once you stop swinging for a grand slam for every at bat regardless of who's on base and learn to instead aim for a solid double every time.
2021-06-18 14:59:02,wallstreetbets,r/thetagang
2021-06-18 19:14:03,wallstreetbets,Hahahaha!! 😂🤣
2021-06-18 18:10:24,wallstreetbets,What's strategy? 🙈
2021-06-18 18:30:56,wallstreetbets,Me too except contrary to OP I usually do buy options and go for this same result.
2021-06-18 14:47:00,wallstreetbets,Rolling the dice
2021-06-18 15:43:18,wallstreetbets,"No no NO.

Buy the stock... sell deep (>50%) OTM calls  *after* a ""cycle"", buy puts.

It's like... it's like infinite money glitch."
2021-06-18 15:40:58,wallstreetbets,"higher risk, higher reward"
2021-06-18 16:45:58,wallstreetbets,"This is why if you like the stock, open a long collar. Sell the put, use the premium to buy a call. You can do this for a net profit depending on where you set your strikes. Or could even go for a combo, sell the put, buy the call on the same strike. But you have to be ok getting assigned on the put you sold."
2021-06-18 18:44:14,wallstreetbets,I sold those fuckers this a.m. lost 5k but recovered a tiny portion vs nothing.
2021-06-18 18:45:54,wallstreetbets,Teach me please. I’m sad from losing.
2021-06-18 15:22:16,wallstreetbets,"Uh, it’s…it’s not great. But hey, come back when you get it way on down the line, yah know? 🤣"
2021-06-18 16:23:50,wallstreetbets,"Nah, 1000%+ gains or ion want it"
2021-06-18 19:59:34,wallstreetbets,"Well, the rule is,  never go full retard."
2021-06-18 17:15:29,wallstreetbets,"How does the ""Maximum loss: unlimited"" make you feel though? Or what are you doing to hedge against that?"
2021-06-18 18:11:29,wallstreetbets,Wow you sound so cool and smart can you teach me to sniff farts too?
2021-06-18 16:01:34,wallstreetbets,What u mean a cycle 50% ?
2021-06-18 18:54:58,wallstreetbets,"i coulda split at like 900 something,  but kept hope alive too long... wish i woulda scalped on Monday for a nice little profit... hindsight 20/20 and all that bull***t lol .... 🦍... me say ""me go eat more crayons now"" 🖍🖍🖍"
2021-06-18 16:29:45,wallstreetbets,"Ahh, you've selected ""instant noodles""."
2021-06-18 18:17:00,wallstreetbets,"> How does the ""Maximum loss: unlimited"" make you feel though?

alive"
2021-06-18 17:25:05,wallstreetbets,"Maximum loss is based upon exactly what options play you're messing with.  The maximum loss possible selling covered calls is the same maximum loss possible simply buying and holding stocks with the added upside of earning premium in exchange for capping your maximum gains.

With buy-write people literally subsidize your stock purchase.

CSPs are the same except people are paying you to buy something you maybe buy something

After that shit gets weird with names that sound like street drugs such as ""iron corridor"".  Yeah, anything where a name option is involved is not something I want to play with.


Listen, all this stuff is gambling.  Never forget that."
2021-06-18 18:54:14,wallstreetbets,That's more of an innate talent than a learned skill.
2021-06-18 17:38:53,wallstreetbets,I am wondering the same thing.
2021-06-18 19:13:11,wallstreetbets,I moved the 50. Im saying 50% otm
2021-06-18 16:32:59,wallstreetbets,Wait there was other options?
2021-06-18 19:09:29,wallstreetbets,"This is what I've been doing for a couple years.  Sell ATM covered calls on volatile stocks.  Not with my whole portfolio, but like 20%.

Sold 2 month calls on SPCE for 20% premium, and then it decided to tank like 40% so I was still significantly down.  So you can definitely still lose.  I rolled those out 2 more months and now they're back in the money.  A few more % but 2 more months means it's nowhere near the best case returns of the initial bet."
2021-06-18 16:54:03,wallstreetbets,"When you're aiming for 1000+% gains?  Degenerate gamblers at least get complementary steaks when they do whatever it is they're doing when they explain to they're friends and family that they ""break even""."
2021-06-18 19:24:27,wallstreetbets,"I usually aim for a delta of 0.4-0.3, but depending on the exact stock and situation a buy-write around 0.7 might be called for.  This is especially the case if the stock is wildly overbought like AMC.

Yes you can get burned, but ""burned"" on a CC or CSP is nowhere near as bad as buying an option that expires worthless.  It's a question of what's your risk tolerance.   I see a lot of people in here who seem to have no idea what risk management is."
2021-06-18 14:19:18,wallstreetbets,This is perfect for me because I don't do any of my own research and rely souly on this reddit to keep me informed on which stock to by next. How much should I buy?
2021-06-18 14:20:42,wallstreetbets,Does anyone have buying power at this point? Every day its a new pump
2021-06-18 14:21:35,wallstreetbets,Time to buy 1 share
2021-06-18 14:25:32,wallstreetbets,"It’s also important to point out that a majority of their revenue comes from SaaS services, so the customers are the dispensaries as well as the actual consumers of the cannabis. As legalization spreads across the US and abroad, new markets will be created for weedmaps to enter."
2021-06-18 14:27:00,wallstreetbets,"I like the service, they always find the best dispensaries but I’m gonna wait for a dip before the rip."
2021-06-18 15:23:20,wallstreetbets,I am new here. Do we care about EPS? (-4.24)
2021-06-18 15:53:07,wallstreetbets,"I’m up 40% on MAPS, even with the dip today."
2021-06-18 14:43:05,wallstreetbets,"Weedmaps is my main method of buying weed, it’s used by most dispensaries around where I live. New dispensaries are added to it all the time, definitely bullish on this one."
2021-06-18 15:24:16,wallstreetbets,Fuck. I love girth.
2021-06-18 14:26:40,wallstreetbets,"FYI, this company does have a dept. of justice investigation ongoing regarding their app listing unlicensed dispensaries. Evaluate your risk tolerance carefully."
2021-06-18 14:32:17,wallstreetbets,I'de rather buy into OF's IPO
2021-06-18 15:35:29,wallstreetbets,Now we just need Tinamaps.
2021-06-18 14:27:40,wallstreetbets,This comment wins
2021-06-18 15:53:12,wallstreetbets,I bought LEAPS minutes after reading a comment in a thread with even less information.
2021-06-18 19:25:29,wallstreetbets,69 or 420 depending on your budget
2021-06-18 18:00:12,wallstreetbets,Amazing.
2021-06-18 14:20:23,wallstreetbets,😂
2021-06-18 16:52:27,wallstreetbets,Massively underrated comment right there.

2021-06-18 14:36:18,wallstreetbets,This is an excellent point. 🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-18 17:18:07,wallstreetbets,Minor details
2021-06-18 16:25:19,wallstreetbets,def not true. it’s obsolete in most of the US. here in WA everyone uses leafly to build their websites. weed maps is kinda like a meme between stoners in fact. lol
2021-06-18 16:26:59,wallstreetbets,Y
2021-06-18 16:30:12,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I’m from maine, so I shouldn’t be speaking for the entire country. I mostly like it so I can check out other dispos in my state, and to check menus and shit. Also, it seems like half of the dispensaries in Maine are delivery only, and a lot of them don’t even have websites which sucks"
2021-06-18 19:53:52,wallstreetbets,dude i would die to have delivery as an option. that sounds amazing. on the flip side i would have a hard time controlling myself so probably best i have to drive.
2021-06-18 17:17:30,wallstreetbets,You’re right. You shouldn’t be.

2021-06-18 14:12:15,wallstreetbets,"Shitty company, can’t blame you but no amount of analysis could even show what direction this stock is going, it’s the epitome of a meme stock"

2021-06-18 14:09:23,wallstreetbets,"Me too, hopefully I’m not wrong, I have more time in my contracts though 😂"
2021-06-18 15:01:01,wallstreetbets,Inverse quick!
2021-06-18 15:13:36,wallstreetbets,"As I mentioned in other comments, the largest two positions ($41 and $47 naked put) were purchased on 6/2, (which remains the highest recent close at $64) when shares were $60 and $66, respectively. I felt pretty clever when it briefly tanked below $40 the next day, and again a bit later as the steady decline was on pace to be profitable."
2021-06-18 15:02:18,wallstreetbets,"I was overconfident that it would drop by now, and didn’t want to risk that it’d rise again if I put the expiry any further out."
2021-06-18 18:43:23,wallstreetbets,that sucks. don't worry im next in line right behind you lol 10p jul 16
2021-06-18 19:22:00,wallstreetbets,Least you don't have to look at it anymore
2021-06-18 14:53:31,wallstreetbets,"To sell call without risking getting railed if the meme goes full meme, you need to go CC. And we don't do shares around here."
2021-06-18 15:00:52,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I purchased the two larger positions when it spiked to 66 a few weeks ago and I’m still learning about options and since learned that buying puts when IV is high is bad. The smaller positions here were put debit spreads to be less greedy. I honestly thought it’d sell down to at most $30 by today as last spikes in value declined over a couple weeks and then I added an extra week “to be on the safe side”.
Not about to sell naked calls due to unlimited loss, but I’ve been looking at OTM call credit spreads as an alternative bearish position."
2021-06-18 15:06:04,wallstreetbets,I (didn’t) understood that reference.
2021-06-18 14:35:10,wallstreetbets,"None sought, thanks!"
2021-06-18 14:11:46,wallstreetbets,Mine all expire today so it’d have to crater an unprecedented amount in next 50 min. My L is all but certain. Good luck on yours. Mind sharing your actual position(s)?
2021-06-18 15:16:56,wallstreetbets,Meme stocks never make sense. Better luck next time.
2021-06-18 15:43:59,wallstreetbets,"It did, yesterday. All these meme stock do the same thing, peak, then fade. This time the autists are a little tougher to dislodge cause they are diamond handing the shit out of physical stock, lol. So the supports are tough as shit to break through. At 15 I knew we were heading to 12-13, just did not expect support to be as solid as it had. 

C'Set la vie, don't play with money you will miss."
2021-06-18 15:03:32,wallstreetbets,Sell call spreads limit upside exposure
2021-06-18 15:56:24,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I was prepared to lose this money even though I obviously would rather not have. And I get what you’re saying about many shareholders Diamond-handing, but for the price to remain high, there must still be people buying shares in this $50-$60 range and they’re the ones I really don’t get."
2021-06-18 19:20:26,wallstreetbets,"Why not say spreads then in your original comment, why say 'selling calls' guy?"
2021-06-18 17:23:48,wallstreetbets,"> people buying shares in this $50-$60 range and they’re the ones I really don’t get

Trust, I felt the same way about the BB support, lol. Spent DAYS at 14.20-13.80 and bouncing back and forth that allowed theta to chew up my value, lol"

2021-06-18 14:25:09,wallstreetbets,"This was always in the cards, not new info. We were just waiting for the sale to be complete so it would stop being a drag to whatever effect it was in fact a drag. Considering CLF’s run despite all this proves it was not a true headwind either way. Hopefully we start the grind higher going into July, but no matter what earnings will be a catalyst given all the positive news going in its favor."
2021-06-18 14:36:17,wallstreetbets,"Let me break it down. So far, I've lost 17.5% on CLF. To get back to my original cost basis, in needs to increase by about 21%. Because 21 is a bigger number than 17.5, that makes me think thoughts of more money. Thinking about money makes me feel bullish. If I gave financial advice, I'd say to buy now"
2021-06-18 14:08:36,wallstreetbets,confirmed
2021-06-18 14:32:36,wallstreetbets,Buy the dip on CLF will run to 130 plus. I live in Cleveland and follow it close and bought in at 8.00 last fall.you also have to remember most pension funds won’t touch it till it hits 25-30 area and keep buying in. Best part of the run is yet to come.
2021-06-18 15:04:29,wallstreetbets,"I think it's been a factor in $CLF market action, but it's history now. The big issue we are facing is the quasi-hysteria caused by ""Inflations Fears"" and some big money managers are preparing to launch their life boats. They may be right or wrong, but they are being heard."

2021-06-18 14:30:02,wallstreetbets,I just bought a shitload of 8/20 calls @ 35. Hope JPM is right!
2021-06-18 14:11:50,wallstreetbets,Basically completing their sale and then buying stock back in the process so shares aren’t super diluted.
2021-06-18 15:48:36,wallstreetbets,I think it could drop below $20. That’s when I load up on calls
2021-06-18 14:18:54,wallstreetbets,I read it as the holding company sold CLF shares and they will continue buying back the holding company shares not CLF
2021-06-18 17:14:29,wallstreetbets,"FWIW, it tagged the bottom of the channel it’s been riding. I almost moved in today but decided to wait and see what happens Monday."
2021-06-18 17:17:28,wallstreetbets,Same. I think more market downside next week before buying the dips happens

2021-06-18 14:50:45,wallstreetbets,"Nuts take more water, and nut farmers will sink deeper wells and then plant more trees saying they have new water. So if you really want to hate a fruit, hate a nut.

Nestle was still siphoning water in California and the tune of 58 million gallons last year for their water brands.

But they got a sneaky way to get around states sending them dirty letters about stopping their stealing water gig.

They sold all of their water brand operations to Blue Triton brands. That would be ticker capital TRTN. 

So if you really want to invest in the downfall of California, make sure you snag some of that golden TRTN stock (I believe they are currently on it buy rating). 

In the meantime, I'm buying Florida avocados. I love me some green gold."

Investing 101 not financial advise, buy the stock if you want the price to go up and vice versa."

He posted loss porn for the banter and jokes."

I am also holding 47000 CLOV shares and 350 calls expiring today worthless.

Today there is another massive shorting pressure, sadly there is not enough retail appetite to buy in.

The shorts double down to prevent the gamma squeeze today, like the one it happened on June 8th. They had significant exposure above $15/share. Today over 50% of CLOV is shorted"

2021-06-18 16:48:51,wallstreetbets,"There is a lot of negative comments on this trail, criticizing someone that is showing his position. We had a lot of infiltrators from hedges trashing CLOV and creating FUD.

Hedges are not ""pumping and dumping"" there are SHORTING, you can see that on any technical analysis...very low volume meaning we are holding.

The spies are doing their job well and the hedges managed to keep the price below $13 today. If the stock was above $13; they would have to cover their losses. See the max pain estimate in this website: [http://maximum-pain.com/options/CLOV](http://maximum-pain.com/options/CLOV)

The good news for the ones holding shares (my calls became worthless today) is that the shorts kept increasing their borrowing and taking more days to cover. So don't listen to the chicken shit talk and hold, our day will come sooner than later and with a BANG.

I am not a financial advisor, just sharing my thoughts and positions. Holding 47000 shares of CLOV."
2021-06-18 14:24:36,wallstreetbets,Still has a month on the call and the rest are shares so...

Knowing how these jump and the short interest on clov, I might get some calls now and ride with you guys back to the 🌙"

2021-06-18 14:22:21,wallstreetbets,"The new hvac units are extremely efficient. Heating is now 50% more efficient and the range will not be near as affected by AC as it would heat. 

If you're cruising around like a normal person, AC won't fuck up your day or range. If you want to cherry-pick a ""day long-road-trip circuit through Death Valley with the cabin set at 64 degrees"" you might succeed at skewing the results to the intended effect. 

But then again, I drive about 150km per day and charge my car at home while I sleep, like I do my cellphone. Four years of Tesla ownership (older models with far less range than the plaid) and range has never been a concern.  If it was, I might consider the very convenient lifestyle of an ICE: visit a secondary location once a week to have the privilege of paying 10x more to fuel my car."

I’m not expecting to hold too long.  Chuck S has been clear he plans to introduce legislation this year, and I think that’s all it will take for TLRY to pop (along with ACB and a bunch of other weed stocks.  TLRY is just the biggest of the bunch and best positioned)."

Not to mention the tobacco companies, medical companies, and other MASSIVE market caps that will enter into the sector when legalization happens.

Let this be a warning to anyone who dares share this same outlook - the downvotes will flow in. Not because we're wrong, but because the crowd that thinks Tilray will be the next coming are delusional. Don't trade this shit thinking you're going to get rich because you're not.

And I'm sure there are some old fogey D Senators even that are still afraid of pot and vote against it.  Are there really more than 10 R Senators that would support it?

Yes it's favorable in polling but that just seems to make it less likely to pass.  Even R's that support it could vote against it just to make sure Biden doesn't go down as the President that made pot legal."

I’m not gonna dispute that ford is a capable automaker but their EV lineup remains skeptical.

I wouldn’t discount Tesla right now, they still have products that are yet to launch and excitement over their refreshed flagship sedan and SUV could bring them back to their $900+ evaluation.

Having said that though, I’d wait for the stock to drop a bit before entering."

2021-06-18 13:01:44,wallstreetbets,Exactly. I think rise of eSports will also eventually present another adjacency for betting companies to expand. It's already a huge market in Asia where these restrictions are looser.

2021-06-18 15:45:57,wallstreetbets,Real apes recognize the true short squeeze opportunity with 60% short interest $WKHS AND 1.74 MARKET CAP ⬆️🦍🚀🚀 you think AMC will even squeeze with 12% short interest 30B market cap? That will be a fart in the wind compared to what’s in store for WKHS. 100% shares on loan w 60% short interest + low float (CHECK ORTEX) . It’s literally a rocket just about to take off us apehorses are the fuel⛽️🚀💥🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎 after the squeeze they will have to rename the whole company to APEHORSE!!

2021-06-18 16:05:59,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but it’s not likely workhorse will get the usps contracts, I mean they are challenging it sure but unfortunately not looking good. If workhorse got it, there’d be some rockets for sure"

2021-06-18 12:59:54,wallstreetbets,"It’s 60% shorted , insane"
2021-06-18 14:34:34,wallstreetbets,It’s only up like 2-3% today… What about its movement makes you think there’s a reason behind it?
2021-06-18 18:18:36,wallstreetbets,"They could negotiate part of it though, right?

Like they might construct some part of the car and ship it to Wisconsin to finish. This could be justified to support the EV industry and fought for by Ohio politicians using the lawsuit as leverage. This kind of stuff happens in defense all the time.

So it's not really full contract or no full contract, it's full contract, no contract or compromise.

Would the stock pop if workhorse got $7k in revenues with 20% margins for each car?"
2021-06-18 13:24:54,wallstreetbets,BAN
2021-06-18 13:01:21,wallstreetbets,60% is too insane got any proof?
2021-06-18 14:51:28,wallstreetbets,went form 14.80 to 15.30 in a minute
2021-06-18 14:35:24,wallstreetbets,For what? He was just wishing you luck

2021-06-18 14:54:20,wallstreetbets,That happens with stocks every day my guy
2021-06-18 18:21:16,wallstreetbets,Straight to jail
2021-06-18 15:28:45,wallstreetbets,but today most of the market was red and that jump was weird so i just questioned it my guy
2021-06-18 12:56:34,wallstreetbets,"based on the history, I see no reason for the dips over the past months"
2021-06-18 12:56:10,wallstreetbets,"People need to sleep.... But,.wow.  God speed."
2021-06-18 13:00:12,wallstreetbets,I also added more on today’s dip.  This ones gonna print
2021-06-18 13:37:49,wallstreetbets,You’re the true DFV of the mattress kingdom.
2021-06-18 13:24:19,wallstreetbets,Looked at this the last couple of days after your last post. I'm getting in on this. Looks like a good entry point.
2021-06-18 13:26:22,wallstreetbets,"Just bought 07/16 $25c x2 I’m in

Edit: Doubled my position"
2021-06-18 13:24:18,wallstreetbets,2000 shares at $26. I'm loving my Harmony pillows. My only complaint is that I bought them a month before they announced the king size pillows 😡
2021-06-18 15:25:06,wallstreetbets,My calls came back from the dead today. I was literally about to close them out at 35% loss mid day when I saw that big boy volume spike.
2021-06-18 12:59:28,wallstreetbets,"You’ve got balls, I’m in."
2021-06-18 12:54:56,wallstreetbets,You sold out of the other random blank check companies?
2021-06-18 17:02:20,wallstreetbets,He's back
2021-06-18 17:17:07,wallstreetbets,"I bought 17 PRPL calls right on the dip today, feels great. To Valhalla brother!"
2021-06-18 17:18:35,wallstreetbets,"Their products are great and its almost enough to buy in just on that haha. Their earnings are terrible though, I wonder what their roadmap to profitability looks like"
2021-06-18 17:36:31,wallstreetbets,Just want to say I love that you advocate for shares and literally ducking everyone buys FDs
2021-06-18 12:54:03,wallstreetbets,I see more red than green so I will be my life savings into this as well.
2021-06-18 14:06:14,wallstreetbets,My buy order went through at 24.80 was super pumped when i saw the notification.
2021-06-18 14:14:30,wallstreetbets,I’m in. This thing is ready for a dead cat bounce large enough to put it in the stratosphere.  IV super low too so I’m buying calls. Hoping for a face ripper on this one.
2021-06-18 17:57:09,wallstreetbets,Godspeed. I’ll buy in Monday. Maybe I’ll be able to afford a purple mattress after this rips
2021-06-18 14:34:49,wallstreetbets,"I've been getting pounded purple since 35.  Reshuffled the position yesterday, get rich or expire worthless I guess."
2021-06-18 18:34:13,wallstreetbets,Bro isn't PRPL like so 2020.
2021-06-18 19:56:02,wallstreetbets,"What would you value them at out of curiosity?  They’ve been on my watch list for a bit and I’m kicking myself for not getting in today.

Might throw 10k at it come Monday if they numbers are good"
2021-06-18 12:48:44,wallstreetbets,I saw something I didn't like in here but the user is approved so I ignored it. /u/zjz
2021-06-18 13:16:14,wallstreetbets,Not even sure why it's going down. All the analyst targets are like at 40.
2021-06-18 13:50:36,wallstreetbets,"I could also contribute with an investment of 2.25... 
2.25$ I mean by that."
2021-06-18 17:44:27,wallstreetbets,I guess you don’t care for assignment risk. Is that you 1r0nyman?
2021-06-18 19:47:06,wallstreetbets,"Bought some 7/16 30cs for pretty cheap a couple days ago, probably stupid. But we shall see!"
2021-06-18 14:32:20,wallstreetbets,"too much competition. 

all the tech bros talk about Eight Sleep"
2021-06-18 13:21:16,wallstreetbets,Exactly this.
2021-06-18 13:22:18,wallstreetbets,"Mattresses aren't going away and purple has been selling cushioning for like 20-30 years. Their tech is solid, albeit not for everyone. I personally love my harmony pillow and my mattress (Purple 4 hybrid premier)."
2021-06-18 13:01:56,wallstreetbets,For no catalysts.... It is trading u/about 60% of where it was 3 months ago... Goldman just did the underwriting @ 28.50 a share and the offering @ 30.00. It's insane.
2021-06-18 13:57:26,wallstreetbets,What if it dips more?
2021-06-18 13:40:47,wallstreetbets,Same. Balls deep here.
2021-06-18 13:43:03,wallstreetbets,Deep Cushion Value
2021-06-18 13:38:37,wallstreetbets,Excellent entry
2021-06-18 13:33:22,wallstreetbets,Shares! Shares! Shares!
2021-06-18 13:31:27,wallstreetbets,ha- I love my harmony pillows and the 4inch premier as well. it's a solid product.
2021-06-18 15:25:36,wallstreetbets,I am pretty excited for next week.
2021-06-18 13:00:14,wallstreetbets,"Average size, but solid as rocks."
2021-06-18 12:58:45,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-06-18 12:59:11,wallstreetbets,You can never time the bottom but overall I love this price
2021-06-18 15:04:06,wallstreetbets,"Yeah- it's been a brutal 3 months- that being said, I think this entry point is phenomenal."
2021-06-18 19:37:35,wallstreetbets,Bro it's still 2020(1)
2021-06-18 16:41:18,wallstreetbets,this fascinates me.
2021-06-18 13:17:09,wallstreetbets,"Just bad markets, interest rate concerns and a secondary offering all creating heartburn. It's volatile AF but a great deal at these prices. If it continues to dip, I'll continue to add."
2021-06-18 19:11:17,wallstreetbets,How much of this 2.3M is your overall wealth?
2021-06-18 13:17:32,wallstreetbets,"Edit Bank of America, not Goldman."
2021-06-18 14:01:06,wallstreetbets,"Buy more shares if funds allow, and wait 💪"
2021-06-18 15:45:02,wallstreetbets,Nice. Take em to the mattresses.
2021-06-18 13:31:14,wallstreetbets,Diamond balls💎

2021-06-18 19:56:54,wallstreetbets,"Nah, thanks. Last time I played lock-up expiration was DASH. And you know what? No one sold because price was already lower than at IPO, and my puts died from IV crush"
2021-06-18 12:48:14,wallstreetbets,All in Calls. Got it.
2021-06-18 13:37:54,wallstreetbets,"I have a hard time believing there will be massive dump by employees, especially given that company yesterday announced concrete go-to market plan (to recap: factory to be built in Oklahoma with $300mm incentives, VDL Nedcar as manufacturing partner, 1k cars to be shipped in Q4 2022, 10k in 2023). 

I can't imagine the CEO, Tony Acquila, jumping ship, he is heavily vested (most of his compensation is in stock) and he actually bought his shares above 10$. It just makes no sense to sell them at this price (hell I can't even imagine employees selling below SPAC merger share price).

Disclaimer: I've been long on GOEV for the past 4 months and intend to stay long. IMO there's a perfect storm brewing for a heavy pop in GOEV."
2021-06-18 12:47:52,wallstreetbets,Car looks like a bean
2021-06-18 19:50:27,wallstreetbets,"With inclusion in the Russell on 6/25 a high probably, why would insiders want to sell before that date? It could take the various funds that add GOEV a few days to finish buying shares."
2021-06-18 12:56:54,wallstreetbets,This DD is not good DD. And anybody can look it up they moved away from subscription. Only a small % will be subscription. They just had a pretty good Investor Relations yesterday.
2021-06-18 13:10:36,wallstreetbets,What if they wait for the inclusion to see if they can sell at better price?
2021-06-18 12:48:40,wallstreetbets,"So buy puts but also buy shares to hedge your puts ape confused, ape buy calls."
2021-06-18 15:46:45,wallstreetbets,Ah yes buy puts before the Russell 3000 inclusions 🙈🙉 look monkeys portfolio is gone
2021-06-18 14:34:32,wallstreetbets,Uhhhh 📈?
2021-06-18 12:50:37,wallstreetbets,Oh this is a new one. I bet it tanks in 3 days
2021-06-18 16:01:16,wallstreetbets,Thanks for this info did not know about such a large tranche of stock going off restriction on Monday. Pulling my buy order for now will reconsider mid next week.
2021-06-18 13:06:54,wallstreetbets,Wsb doesn’t short. Stonks only.
2021-06-18 16:06:22,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the heads up. I bought around $8.60 and have been skeptically watching it slowly slide down the backside of the P&D for a while. When the announcement on investor day resulted in share price decreasing, I felt like there was something else going on. Just closed my position in this company for a small profit. Better safe than sorry."
2021-06-18 13:15:29,wallstreetbets,I'm bored. So I'm in.
2021-06-18 13:30:26,wallstreetbets,"1. Current shares outstanding are 237,501,486, so more like 50%
2. Otherwise awesome DD and looks like it checks out. I am buying puts. Should be easy money. Insiders will want to dump because no one, other than retail Apes, believes in these small EV companies anymore."
2021-06-18 13:25:35,wallstreetbets,"GOEV was PandD already.... no where to go but down I feel. If we look at the one month chart on this ticker, it was under 7.5 before it's major pump this week, which quickly dumped. Thanks for the heads up."
2021-06-18 14:31:22,wallstreetbets,Good DD. Bought 50 puts as a lotto.
2021-06-18 14:02:25,wallstreetbets,"Would have to agree there, the risk isnt worth it to short this or waste money on Puts. IV has been relatively stable and the price movement isnt enough to really overcome theta decay this close to expiration.  Whose to say that the OP isnt a shill trying to get everyone to pay money for Puts before this pumps next week so you go broke for no reason."
2021-06-18 15:48:07,wallstreetbets,Maybe read the article again? Expect stock to go down on Monday (cash out puts) then re-evaluate re: Russell inclusion (potential long)
2021-06-18 13:30:15,wallstreetbets,Already tanked right after the pump! Just bleeding now.
2021-06-18 14:36:23,wallstreetbets,Go up
2021-06-18 17:32:04,wallstreetbets,🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
2021-06-18 12:48:50,wallstreetbets,You’ll wish you didn’t sell
2021-06-18 12:48:44,wallstreetbets,Because you made profit out of it. Lmao
2021-06-18 12:58:30,wallstreetbets,you'll WISH you didn't sell
2021-06-18 13:38:24,wallstreetbets,You got out three days ago and are just posting now during a huge run up? Seems sus
2021-06-18 13:41:06,wallstreetbets,I made my money back today on my last WISH call and bought further out. If it don't print this time I am out until I see otherwise
2021-06-18 13:01:03,wallstreetbets,SPY looks sick right now.  Flirting with disaster at the 50dMA.
2021-06-18 19:22:12,wallstreetbets,"Ussy, regret."
2021-06-18 13:02:31,wallstreetbets,I wish that for longs! I'll be happy if its the case. good luck bro
2021-06-18 15:18:51,wallstreetbets,I mean mostly everyone's gotta be in profit l. The stock is still near it'd all time low lol like wtf
2021-06-18 13:40:16,wallstreetbets,If that’s the case prob sold at a loss
2021-06-18 13:53:35,wallstreetbets,true. I got out because of FED risk.. When price today was over 12$ I thought it would be decent to share now because it fell right after I closed my position.. it would be nonsense to share after stock fell %10 from the point I got out..
2021-06-18 17:36:09,wallstreetbets,It is really frustrating. Not breaking the resistance of $12
2021-06-18 17:51:10,wallstreetbets,It's all good. The markets been pretty shit this past week and the stock consistently made higher lows. I think it'd looking good going into next week
2021-06-18 19:34:27,wallstreetbets,Hope so..

Hey OP, **positions or ban.**"
2021-06-18 17:26:33,wallstreetbets,Tell this to the guy who lost quarter mill on 11$ calls expiring today....
2021-06-18 14:21:34,wallstreetbets,So load up coke?
2021-06-18 12:33:10,wallstreetbets,They say having an erection for more than 4hours after taking viagra is bad. I don’t see how. Either way I’m all in on Uwmc.
2021-06-18 12:38:43,wallstreetbets,Remind these retards in order to squeeze we need VOLUME. That means that the only thing missing on this perfect mix is retail investors buying a shid ton of shares.
2021-06-18 12:34:31,wallstreetbets,"Coke doesn't ever get cheaper, though…"
2021-06-18 13:47:20,wallstreetbets,I’ve put every dollar I have to spare into this stock. I can give nothing else….please pay my medical bills 🚀
2021-06-18 12:40:10,wallstreetbets,Could we get some fucking volume please!?
2021-06-18 13:20:35,wallstreetbets,"Well, yes. But smart money is here for the long run and uses models to value the stock. Those models probably take that into account and are expecting better results in the short term than on the medium term.

Investors know when a spike in demand is transitory."
2021-06-18 15:49:24,wallstreetbets,Bought some calls for July 16 🤷‍♂️

My argument is that this demand will be front loaded and cause a surprise increase in revenue, and then excitement over the stock from retail buyers. I am also assuming most retail buyers aren't planning on holding this long term (when interest rates will increase in 2022-2023 and mortgage loan demand drops). There's also the time value of money to consider when demand is front-loaded, especially in a moderate inflation environment."

Personally I hope this one goes for you, and anyone else holding it. I looked at it some months ago, but it never made/retained that outsized move. Still a very interesting long term investment."

It more sounds like someone from Wall Street shouting their books to get people to buy and help their own positions:

Here’s some idea you can add to your DD:

Company structure,
Ideal long term customer & acquisitions.
Competition/Rivals.
Company Financials and Investments.
Past growth YoY.
“Actual catalyst”.
Price prediction basis.
More in-depth long-term Technical analysis.
Employees incentives and productivity.
Achievements.
Recent conferences.

Inflations is a market-wide factor. It’s not a benefit to UWMC solely and doesn’t attract price action.

Take a look at what Blackrock is doing to the current RE Market. What is UWMC undergoing to give them an edge?
Currently, they’re just doing business as usual.

Regardless, the more the detailed the DD is, the better you attract investors. (Don’t just mention short interest - FF)"

2021-06-18 12:47:58,wallstreetbets,"The massive short attacks were mind blowing. Gme truly had the capability of breaking the markets or hedge funds. This is different. I was selling both sides for a while but was burned on GME last week with puts. The diamond hands on AMC gang might be stronger, but massive selling into low liquidity can wreck the price just as quickly."
2021-06-18 19:04:57,wallstreetbets,"It was my first calculated yolo I wanted a $30k scalp, then they turned off the buy button and I started turning red. I took it personal. DD like a mad man and I realized I was on something special, all in. Took a few weeks. I was initially very displeased with my average. It was like that quote from “the big short“ I felt “I may be early but I’m not wrong” I have a theory about winning big that got me here as well if you’re interested."
2021-06-18 12:23:37,wallstreetbets,The market isn’t actually lifting off the value of the dollar is just tanking. It’s correcting to take into account the new valuation. SPY calls confirmed.
2021-06-18 13:29:11,wallstreetbets,"This guy should seriously shut up. The suits were basically begging for any reason to tank the market to prove their ""inflation fetish"" but Jpow didn't give them.

So in their desperation to find something, they bring a nobody to tell them what they want to hear..

🌈 Bears r fuk"
2021-06-18 12:33:53,wallstreetbets,"Funny how they're trying to say it's good. Well, get ready for total collapse apes. Monke time is coming"

2021-06-18 13:36:43,wallstreetbets,Fed’s Bullard changes name to Bearard.
2021-06-18 13:31:27,wallstreetbets,Yes. He’s being used
2021-06-18 18:05:01,wallstreetbets,"Hypothetically speaking if the market crashed how much would GME and AMC possibly tank? Or would they not tank at all?

With that said, is it even possible for the market to tank while hedge funds are still fully vested in those stocks? Seems to me if big money tanked the market and GME and AMC crashed 75 percent+ EVERYONE would load up and crash the funds."
2021-06-18 13:43:40,wallstreetbets,"So, they are like WSB meme stock DD’s?"
2021-06-18 13:25:22,wallstreetbets,How do I profit now vs later w/o puts
2021-06-18 13:37:32,wallstreetbets,Not as much as his wife is being used by her bf

2021-06-18 12:46:46,wallstreetbets,Good find. Go $BIG or go home!
2021-06-18 12:30:11,wallstreetbets,"They're a pretty solid company.  They're doubling down on furniture which imo is a good bet.  Also, if your tight on cash you can use progressive leasing though them and pay payments.  It's expensive, around double, but still cheaper than Aaron's and rent a center.  When I went though a divorce a few years ago that's what I did to get a new bed."
2021-06-18 12:37:49,wallstreetbets,"Deep in BIG, I think you’re right!"
2021-06-18 12:36:09,wallstreetbets,"One thing to add,  I commented on a post a week or two ago about $BIG  and one of the commenters brought up that investors like to see a retail chain that is expanding.

I checked the new store openings for big lots is supposed to be 20 stores this year, up from 1408 stores, a 1.4% store count increase.  [source](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/discount-chain-big-lots-invests-in-new-stores-as-stimulus-checks-boost-sales-11623163022)

Now TJX  is increasing store count by ~2.5%.  [source](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/03/21/store-openings-2021-10-retailers-that-are-opening-new-shops.html)

In conclusion, TJX is increasing store count at a 78% higher rate than BIG  but PE ratio is 1,300% higher.  Seems to me BIG should go up.  What are we missing here?  And when is it  time to buy $BIG FDs?"
2021-06-18 14:50:59,wallstreetbets,"So, does $BIG have BIG potential?  With the way the game has been played here recently on WSB, its all about the ticker name.  Sounds crazy, but true.  

I think the financials here are compelling. I really don't like the store, but I am one person, out of millions.

I can respect the positions you have, you are not a high roller here, but you are contributing by posting DD.  If BIG picks up big (didn't mean that pun), you'll be wishing you had a bigger position.

I will scoop a few calls and shares!"
2021-06-18 17:47:12,wallstreetbets,"Nice find. They have room to grow their online presence as their websites a bit basic, I wonder if theres anything in the woodwork to revamp their ecommerce platform"
2021-06-18 12:13:45,wallstreetbets,"Unrelated to the stock, but the Big Lots by my house used to be trash. I went in there the other day for the first time in a couple of years and was very happy with the experience. Will be back again. Might buy a share or two to support them too."
2021-06-18 12:47:53,wallstreetbets,Positions?
2021-06-18 12:11:47,wallstreetbets,How 🦍 make 🍌 tho
2021-06-18 12:16:07,wallstreetbets,Fucking Big Lots?
2021-06-18 13:39:00,wallstreetbets,We just need to all get on the same page. We are everywhere right now and it’s showing.
2021-06-18 13:52:28,wallstreetbets,"Lol big lots is trash. Like a notch below k mart, which is just under Walmart.

Edit: for the same amount I'd rather buy SNAP, a company that I use and enjoy regularly"
2021-06-18 12:14:00,wallstreetbets,This sub sure does love to push some of the worst possible companies.

2021-06-18 15:26:25,wallstreetbets,"I might need to visit a Big Lots again. My first experience was three years ago, not a great one.  But, this might turn out to be a big play."
2021-06-18 15:39:25,wallstreetbets,"I read their 10k, the company has good potential and is undervalued. they care about their shareholders and devote a good portion of the writing into how the company is setting itself up for future growth."
2021-06-18 14:29:30,wallstreetbets,"I was about to comment about the one and only time I walked into a Big Lots.  It was such trash, I refused to go back.  Maybe it will be better as you have mentioned, but I have refused to go back into one.  That's how bad my experience was.  Worse than a dying K-Mart."
2021-06-18 12:31:09,wallstreetbets,Yeah they've completely changed over the past year or so. Big Lots used to be the place to shop only if you like buying expired food and low-budget housewares. Now they carry a lot more furniture and stopped trying to compete with Dollar Tree.
2021-06-18 15:26:52,wallstreetbets,"They got posted at the bottom.  Not a screen shot, but based on the amounts listed, I believe them."
2021-06-18 15:27:34,wallstreetbets,"What page is there to get on?  Collusion?  I mean, this is WSB not lets all pick one stock and pump it up."

2021-06-18 15:49:22,wallstreetbets,"Well, I need something to make my portfolio grow, hopefully $BIG is it."
2021-06-18 13:57:48,wallstreetbets,"Back in 7th grade Big Lots was the go-to spot for cheep candy. That's all it ever was, and all it ever will be."
2021-06-18 13:12:09,wallstreetbets,Yes. It's a boring potentially not terrible long term stock.
2021-06-18 16:37:17,wallstreetbets,Whoops thought it was in the daily
2021-06-18 14:18:17,wallstreetbets,"they are sitting on a mountain of cash, have a 1.5x asset to liabilities ratio and have been profitable every year; they are not going anywhere."
2021-06-18 15:29:11,wallstreetbets,"Cheap candy is where it's at!!  I didn't have a BIG in my town, but I definitely would frequent other places simply for some cheap candy.

2021-06-18 14:29:13,wallstreetbets,"I just got some pretty good patio furniture and a new pull-out sleeper chair for my office. Prices were great, and quality is 1000 times better than the stuff I find at Walmart.

Don't sleep on the current Big Lots."
2021-06-18 16:38:17,wallstreetbets,"That's fair. But since you are here, would you like to hear about $BIG?"

2021-06-18 12:33:22,wallstreetbets,He wants to short. That's why spreading fears
2021-06-18 12:58:22,wallstreetbets,But when tho? Can you ask him that? So that we can hold him accountable to his words. You cannot just spout crash crash and cause FUD with vague warnings.

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"KnowBe4 - KNBE - Cybersecurity Awareness Testing & Training - Virtually No Discussion This is not financial advice, I am retarded. I tried to time the bottom on the tech correction with calls and got bogged. I own shares of KNBE.

KNBE - Everyone is sleeping on this stock and this sector.

Sector DD:

As in industry insider (systems engineer) I am finding that cybersecurity insurance companies are cracking down on practices and minimum prevention standards. I've seen multiple customers of ours edged into security testing + training by the insurance company telling them its mandatory. The insurers seem to get more strict with every major breach - and we just had a nuclear weapons company breached this week.

My investing theory for 2021 is that insurance companies are going to compel massive amounts of cybersecurity spending and produce huge earnings reports.

If you're on LinkedIn, you might have noticed job alerts for cybersecurity jobs have gone up triple or quadruple since January as companies scramble to not be the next one on cable news for getting bogged by eastern european glow in the dark boys.

KNBE DD:

\- Barely recognized, almost zero results searching WSB or Reddit as a whole.

\- Good market cap but almost no volume.

\- Recent IPO - only two quarters. Price discovery still taking place.

\- Doesn't even have options yet.

\- Widely considered the industry leader for email phishing test campaigns.

\- HQ'd in Florida. Most employees are Florida Man / Florida Woman.

\- 45% rev growth YoY

\- Turned profitable this year - positive EPS

\- Financials: [https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/KNBE/financials](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/KNBE/financials)

The product: The main product is email phish testing. Fake scam emails sent out by IT meant to get Karen in HR to click on free Apple giftcards / etc. Some more advanced and believable templates as well and the ability to customize them to internal company branding / terminology.

They also have awareness training to remediate staff and departments that are falling for the scam emails, or to proactively introduce employees to email security concepts.

I did a short trial run with them for a few clients a year ago and was impressed with the platform. I also tried Microsoft's 365 equivalent.

Risks:

\- Not a monopoly. Already other companies in the same security awareness / testing space.

\- Competitors includes Microsoft - premium Exchange 365 licensing grants a similar but much less developed product amongst other security tools - but minus the remediation training.

\- The greatest risk from MSFT is that companies may ""already be paying for"" their phish testing tool as part of existing security licenses - similar to business onedrive / sharepoint vs dropbox.

\- First DD I ever posted so it's probably shit.

\- Stock already up 60% this week, might correct.  


tl;dr: Insurance companies are making small/midsize businesses spend money on cybersecurity and getting more strict about payouts. KnowBe4 has a good product and a first mover advantage. They're profitable already. Almost zero social media sentiment or press around KNBE and no options - this feels to me like an early bird special.

\-We setup a yearly hack-a-thon where employees globally compete to find bugs in our tools, systems, and phish emails we make look super realistic internally.  


We have had great success in having our employees actually read emails now and examine what they are looking at before they click them.   


The biggest benefit it is teaches and trains normal dipshit employees to read emails and know what to look for in phishing."

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Dubai-based Emirates Airlines records a $6Billion loss. First loss in 30 years. What this means for Airlines. Yep, you read that right. The all-mighty oil-wealth-funded Emirates Airlines saw the impact of halted travel the most, as a bulk of its longer-route lines were disrupted by lockdowns.

I know you degens don't give a flying fuck about financials, but it's kinda important to understand where we're headed with this:

Emirates Group records an annual loss of AED 22.1 billion (US$ 6.0 billion) due to the COVID-19 pandemicimpact, its first non-profitable year in over three decades.

* Group revenue of AED 35.6 billion (US$ 9.7 billion) impacted by worldwide travel restrictions and border closures during the entire financial year
* Results impacted by one-time impairment charges of AED 1.5 billion on Group’s non-financial assets
* **Ends year with cash balance of AED 19.8 billion (US$ 5.4 billion)**

**dnata** reports a loss of AED 1.8 billion (US$ 496 million) down from AED 618 million (US$ 168 million) profit in the previous year

* Revenue declined by 62% to AED 5.5 billion (US$ 1.5 billion), reflecting the pandemic impact across all business divisions in the UAE and worldwide

So how does this reflect on other public carriers - American Airlines or Airline manufacturers? - first, major airlines across the globe are watching this, and for a very good reason - Emirates has lesser cash balances than its previous year's losses (5.4 Bn v/s 6 Bn). Meaning, that if air travel doesn't pick up as much as expected, Emirates will either:

\- Need a billion-dollar cash injection just to sustain operations (Abu Dhabi to the rescue!)

OR

\- Need to go asset-light in an effort to save the airline (asset reduction refers to selling off assets - mostly airplanes). If this happens, we could see an oversupply of long-range carriers in the markets in the next 6-9 months, which could snowball into a reduced-order pipeline for the likes of Boeing $BA.

This is something worth considering when comparing the business model of Qatar Airways for example to AA.

Edit: didn’t read the Boeing put play. Errrrm I’d be careful with this one. Qatar, Emirates, and Etihad have some of the largest orders for the triple 7x and Etihad and Emirates retired several A380s during the pandemic."

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Curevac - Terrible Vaccine, Bull Case via Corporate Welfare **TLDR: CVAC sucks, but may pull a rabbit out of the hat with some slightly questionable data tricks and the willing support of their patron, the German government. May cause a surge in a few weeks on the 'surprise', and calls there aren't expensive.**

CVAC sure took a beating this week on news that their vaccine basically... sucks - 47% effectiveness only vs other mRNA vaccines at 90%+!

If you are like me, you were very confused as to why the stock rallied hard after correctly dumping to $35. It's now in the mid 60s. When it initially happened, I also piled on some ITM puts, which promptly lost a lot of money.

At first, I thought this was a bid from idiots on yahoo stocks or wherever the dumbest traders are on a reflexive ""it's cheap buy the dip' view as the price rose. But, like any trader, I try to figure out who is trading.

I looked closely at this - if it's a retail bid, it's probably a weak one - there's just not that much social media chatter about it compared to anything else, and it's a pretty big company and float, so institutions didn't dump, and retail isn't buying much either. And, while options dealers got wiped out, people monetizing puts would've only been a few million shares of buying most likely. **It has since dawned on me that this is actually a smart money bid on German governmental corporate welfare, and while this company in no way deserves it at these price levels, it could have 'surprise' good data seen as able to cause an approval in 2-4 or so weeks, which in turn leads to a surge in the stock on the theory that they'll then collect on at least some of the doses.**

Because of this theory, despite thinking their business is dramatically over valued and their vaccine sucks, I have entered 100x $80C for July since I think there will be a 'surprise' here in seeing the German federal corporate welfare apparatus kick in. I of course will sell the news, or even a rise back to near the old price prior to news. It's possible this wont happen, but contracts that are up are actually pretty cheap because no rational person thinks the company is worth that, and it's not being hyped on social media. So in a sense, it's betting on an unlikely outcome, but I think the dice are weighted... because...

**German Corporate Welfare:**

Germany wants to build out more high tech industries - profit isn't the goal, long term national competitiveness is. They have a history of throwing good money after bad if it either supports innovation or employment. Remember how they protected Wirecard for a long time? Deutchbank? VW? According to this, they also own 23% of Curevac:

[https://www.curevac.com/en/2020/06/15/bundesregierung-beteiligt-sich-mit-300-millionen-euro-an-curevac/](https://www.curevac.com/en/2020/06/15/bundesregierung-beteiligt-sich-mit-300-millionen-euro-an-curevac/)

If you are rationally acting as Germany, you want this company to keep going, and you want this vaccine approved so they collect revenues from non-German entities who then get no shares, just a borderline useless vaccine, rather than having to issue a ton of stock and dilute everyone. I believe Germany will make this happen.

**The Vaccine:**

While I believe the the vaccine is terrible (opinions shared by non-interested 3rd parties: [https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/06/17/curevac-comes-up-short](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/06/17/curevac-comes-up-short)) and will be way worse by the time it's in production and more variants are around, and while I also believe that 'fixing' it is probably re-development, dose increases, and putting in new variants which will add considerable time, the company has been spinning hard around how they got sideswiped by variants, how it might be a dosing issue (through the press), and how they expect that when they cut the data, they may very well have a path to approval. Quotes from this morning from their CFO: ""We are so close. We are two, three weeks away from final data... if we have something, then, of course we will leverage it. We need to look at the data and see, OK, what would be the best value, how can we place this vaccine to make this available"".

**Let me translate that cynically - ""We will, without breaking any rules, find a way to creatively make the data barely go over 50% by selecting removing flawed data or focusing on specific variants, allowing our friends in the German government to pressure an approval if they want to, which we all know they do.""**

A lot of the benefit of the vaccine is that unlike other mRNA vaccines, it is stable for 3 months at 41 degrees F. That means it can be distributed to the third world. This is important because while the EU won't use this, they may buy doses if it's 'magically' at 50.1% efficacy and then give them to third world nations.

**The Vaccine Contracts:**

I had trouble getting details on this. the closest was simply that they get a downpayment for the vaccine, then EU buys about 200m with an ability to order more. I don't think many EU member states will want this, but, if it's 'approvable', I would expect some trading hype on it, as well as the possibility it is given to third world nations.

**CVAC Pipeline:**

CVAC has a moderate pipeline of various other mRNA remedies. The cancer sutff is all promising. Realistically, they are much behind BioNTech and Moderna, which have larger pipelines that are further along, but I think the pipeline without the COVID-19 vaccine is still worth 20 or 30 bucks, and this space is really hot:

[https://www.curevac.com/en/pipeline/](https://www.curevac.com/en/pipeline/)

**Conclusion:**

This stock sucks and should be at $20. However, it matters who is buying and what will happen. Right now, retail isn't a big force as far as I can tell. It sure looks like smart money. And, the theory that makes sense is German corporate welfare, which would manifest first as ""Exciting"" unexpected data breaching 50% in a few weeks, which in turn will catch a broad bid most likely. I certainly would not YOLO all in this one, but it feels like good risk-return to buy OTM Calls into July or August, then promptly sell any positive news. If positive news, calls would likely turn a very significant profit from current prices. If not, you bleed out to zero. 

If anyone has more info on this or contrary views, I'm happy to update if it makes sense. I don't actually like this company, I just think it's a good tactical trade on this theory. I'll back out of it if my view looks incorrect.

I didn't get timing great on this. I do think it may bleed out in the coming week, but believe there's a good binary play here.

Positions: 100x $80C july 16 2021

2021-06-18 13:22:35,wallstreetbets,"The reason it makes a difference is consistent access to cheap capital. mRNA therapies are hot and will be a lot of upside at an industry level. If you believe they'll have non-dilutive capital raises (government money, and customer payment for COVID vaccines being the likely suspects here), and you believe they will succeed at some of those, owning shares is interesting on some level, so institutions hold. The short-term trading theory though is retail hype bidding up the stock on 'good' news. The reality is that a fudged approval still gets them sales, which is non-diultive cap raise.

Again, I'm bearish on the stock at this valuation long-term, but I think a good story could form here. I'm long BioNTech because they are a better company with a better pipeline even on a value adjusted basis."
2021-06-18 12:20:44,wallstreetbets,"100%, but it's a very binary play. If they 'surprise' you probably get a furious bid up. IF they don't, this bleeds out. I could see waiting to enter."

After the initial post pandemic craze simmers down, I'm willing to bet AMC will go hard on a push to get some of the streaming action either by merging with an existent streaming giant, or by starting their own service."
2021-06-18 18:41:39,wallstreetbets,Short it then.

This is funny stuff.  I hope you do take profits though if you have them.  Take profits and gamble with house money, etc.  You really think AMC is going to become a +$1T company?  Long term?  You buying your crayons from the cannabis industry?"
2021-06-18 19:57:52,wallstreetbets,"If you haven't noticed, besides the behemoth that is Netflix, which itself became a content creator, all the new streaming services are from media companies that have their own IPs.  AMC Theaters neither has it's own IPs, nor has anything of substance to offer to any media giant to enter into an agreement with them, besides, what, show their films in theaters, which they already did, and have had to fight hard to retain that model in the face of at-home, release-day streaming.  Just shouting ""lol streaming service"" from the rooftops, like consumers are not already fed up that there's 20 different streaming services out there that shattered the convenience of having one place to go to, like old school Netflix, well, you're high on something, man.  That boat has sailed, there isn't room for a theater chain that just barely escaped bankruptcy to somehow throw their hat into the ring.

I truly hope theaters don't die, because it's a great experience, but it's wishful thinking to say they're going to be the next Netflix.  Netflix, which has a market cap, by the way, of $222b.  And your pipe dream of AMC steaming service, that somehow doesn't run afoul of trademark infringement against AMC+, from AMC Networks, a different company altogether, is going to be worth how much, do you think?  What % do you think AMC shares are going to grow?  You think they're going to go 3x, 6x?  You think AMC is going to magically become worth more than Netflix, despite having no original IP and no infrastructure to offer a streaming service?

Y'all funny.  Give me that negative karma."

2021-06-18 14:53:05,wallstreetbets,It’s going to look at the chart it may go lower. I traded it from 2.25 to 12 ish and sold. It ran to 17.50. It will make this correction and go to $40 I am waiting to buy.
2021-06-18 15:23:32,wallstreetbets,By when do you think 40? The entire market looks weak at the moment im for sure holding the shares however considering halfing my option holding to 100. Im still up 50ish dollars lol.
2021-06-18 15:26:02,wallstreetbets,This is not a time to buy options they are keeping it sideways sucking all the time out. They own all the contracts they set the price over inflate and on the pullback sell the contracts back to themselves at a much lower price to squeeze everyone. The market is a complete scam you have to know how to read a stock chart. I would only own the stock rn. They call it IV.
2021-06-18 15:27:46,wallstreetbets,Who is they?
2021-06-18 15:28:20,wallstreetbets,Banks and HF’s they feast on retail traders.
2021-06-18 15:32:14,wallstreetbets,Okay thanks for the advice. Ima lower my average cost right now on the options and buy more!
2021-06-18 15:32:56,wallstreetbets,Wait till Monday today is a big expiration date I expect a pop next week today is a good day to buy not to sell.

2021-06-18 16:05:08,wallstreetbets,"What is your next play. Double down?

Play options far out next time fwiw."
2021-06-18 16:05:47,wallstreetbets,"I bought BB 7/16 calls Monday, sold them this morning for 33% gains.

Profit is profit."
2021-06-18 16:06:59,wallstreetbets,"Lol fuck

Learning lessons"
2021-06-18 16:08:21,wallstreetbets,Fuck me up fam.
2021-06-18 16:09:29,wallstreetbets,"Yeah $Ba$By... Let's go 🚀 

I went in at 16...15...14...and 12.7 today... Wait... Is this the right direction?.. Red's good right?"
2021-06-18 16:09:46,wallstreetbets,"No one said options, probably"
2021-06-18 16:11:04,wallstreetbets,Ouchies!!!!
2021-06-18 16:15:02,wallstreetbets,are ur shares ok at least???
2021-06-18 16:19:37,wallstreetbets,This is why you buy contracts expiring far in the future like September just to be safe
2021-06-18 16:25:49,wallstreetbets,Yeah lets hope BB goes to to the moon soon
2021-06-18 16:29:58,wallstreetbets,This is exactly why I don’t do options. I don’t trust my judgement enough to do anything other than traditional stocks
2021-06-18 16:34:23,wallstreetbets,I bought Kinross Gold and they burned down 😩
2021-06-18 16:35:45,wallstreetbets,"Shares look good. Hopefully you have LOTS of time left in those options. If so, you might be sitting on top of a good year. Else, we’ll consider this your down Quarter."
2021-06-18 16:42:49,wallstreetbets,I hear you! Are you staying in or selling? I’m not sure what to do!
2021-06-18 16:44:46,wallstreetbets,Maybe we’ll get rich next week? BB til moon or bust.
2021-06-18 16:46:35,wallstreetbets,Fine I will say this for you: GUH!
2021-06-18 16:47:57,wallstreetbets,I eat crayons for a living sir.. don’t blame me..
2021-06-18 16:49:57,wallstreetbets,"I was actually in at $9 on BB and when it went up to $20 I cashed out. Right after I did that it dropped all the way back to down to $17/$16 and then held a bit and dropped some more. If it drops back down to single digits I'll get back in.

I actually have good vibes about BB. The name actually works against them since everyone associates them with phones from the early 2000's still, but I honestly expect the company to go back up to the 20's or 30's down the road. It's just that when you slap meme stock on something it gets super volatile and a lot of people are in it for a day, two days, a week at most and then they dip out which tanks the price. Even if I'm not cashing out at the peak, I'd rather take some profits then end up stuck. The good news is that if you have shares in BB you're at least stuck with a solid company that isn't going anywhere. It's just a matter of time until you can get your tendies."
2021-06-18 16:51:36,wallstreetbets,So I should buy now at the dip?
2021-06-18 16:59:38,wallstreetbets,It's not just a meme. It's a way of life.
2021-06-18 17:00:44,wallstreetbets,"By the time you hear moon comments and see rocket emojis, it's already too late"
2021-06-18 17:03:41,wallstreetbets,Email the app and ask for a refund
2021-06-18 17:06:09,wallstreetbets,Whatever trends on the sub just do the opposite
2021-06-18 17:07:02,wallstreetbets,You only lose money when you sell for less than you bought in for.
2021-06-18 17:43:15,wallstreetbets,You guys were a victim of pump and dump
2021-06-18 18:03:31,wallstreetbets,Hehe wait for earnings week
2021-06-18 18:05:24,wallstreetbets,"I’m in at $27. Have patience, OP."
2021-06-18 18:07:11,wallstreetbets,"Well, look at it this way; at least you'll save money on taxes."
2021-06-18 18:13:02,wallstreetbets,BB stock probably dipped cause whole market is red and management sold 1000000 shares today. Just hold n buy the dips to the moon apes.
2021-06-18 18:14:47,wallstreetbets,Yea this & NOK 😔
2021-06-18 18:21:48,wallstreetbets,"**buy BB Citadel said, it’ll moon Citadel said. 

Fixed your title"
2021-06-18 18:25:58,wallstreetbets,Godspeed retard…I shall bless you with this rocket 🚀
2021-06-18 18:36:38,wallstreetbets,Dude I’m with you. All in BB
2021-06-18 18:43:10,wallstreetbets,"It gets worse before it gets better, PROBABLY haha I'm RIGHT THERE with you ape"
2021-06-18 18:45:30,wallstreetbets,I saw the top part and im like thats not bad but as i scrolled down i fucking died
2021-06-18 18:46:53,wallstreetbets,we said buy it in JANUARY!!! lol
2021-06-18 19:00:33,wallstreetbets,Still have 88$ my dude your good for next weeks yolo
2021-06-18 19:00:44,wallstreetbets,"Ouch same here. Lost my whole portfolio.

Edit 1: my contracts expired today worthless"
2021-06-18 19:02:05,wallstreetbets,You deserve it…AMC OR BUST DUMMY
2021-06-18 19:03:10,wallstreetbets,Yup I sold my AMC to buy bb and got sucked
2021-06-18 19:04:35,wallstreetbets,BB to the 🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕🌚
2021-06-18 19:09:32,wallstreetbets,"I don't think Blackberry is going to moon like gme and amc, but I do believe that it will increase in value over time due to their car cyber security systems and the rising need of cyber security in cars
-not official financial advice"
2021-06-18 19:16:03,wallstreetbets,Gme stop getting distracted like a dog seeing a squirrel
2021-06-18 19:31:36,wallstreetbets,It could definitely moon but even if it doesn’t it is certainly undervalued.
2021-06-18 19:45:06,wallstreetbets,"Sorry Bro, but that's what you get when u listen to HF trolls. That's how they try and beat us, by pushing 🐂💩 tikers to get our focus off the real GME & AMC. Hope it works outgood luck 🤞 🍀"
2021-06-18 19:45:45,wallstreetbets,lmfao $1650 in shares $22K in options
2021-06-18 19:49:29,wallstreetbets,"Apes are stronger together.. I believe some of these stonks are distractions away from AMC and GME.  

🤔"
2021-06-18 11:15:28,wallstreetbets,Make a wish and do the right thing.
2021-06-18 13:46:53,wallstreetbets,Shouldn’t have bought a pump and dump scheme. Shoulda bought gamestop
2021-06-18 13:55:31,wallstreetbets,Don't buy stuff that already mooned.
2021-06-18 14:52:09,wallstreetbets,Yeah fuck BB I lost $24k piece of shit
2021-06-18 16:21:02,wallstreetbets,Do not buy any stock that's trending or has their own daily thread on WSB.  This place is filled with Bots now
2021-06-18 13:31:24,wallstreetbets,"That’s the problem with this subreddit, it was supposed to be focus on one stock and squeeze it, Fuckover the hedges. Now you have wee spastic timmy, his dog and his granny spamming random shit stocks no one even knew existed or heard of 50 times a day. I see about 100 different stocks a day being shilled by genuine degenerate retards thinking they’re first to discover fire. Just shut the fuck up. This is the results of what happens, people expect everyone to band together on a stock and instead only a handful of people actually do and people lose their money, yes this is a casino but we should be band together not a fuckin circus of blind apes."
2021-06-18 13:39:09,wallstreetbets,BB is 💩
2021-06-18 14:40:18,wallstreetbets,No one besides bots and new users with no more than $47.95 in their pockets said it would moon
2021-06-18 14:41:57,wallstreetbets,Hedge funds lied to you here....no one is buying BB right now..
2021-06-18 11:15:30,wallstreetbets,Feel the pain. $1700 of worthless calls expiring today
2021-06-18 11:20:17,wallstreetbets,"I'm told you only lose when you sell. Hope you recover it, OP!"
2021-06-18 12:03:00,wallstreetbets,AMC one battle at a time.
2021-06-18 13:50:21,wallstreetbets,BB is falling like a rock.
2021-06-18 14:00:50,wallstreetbets,"Real talk. I just borrowed 30K from CC and put it all on BB, almost 1500 shares TODAY, north of 13.

I hope it penetrates 15, or else I am getting penetrated with margin and interests from CC on the daily."
2021-06-18 14:01:57,wallstreetbets,I sold my shares last month after buying in late February.  I got tired of watching the stock go nowhere.
2021-06-18 14:36:44,wallstreetbets,"Buy the rumor, sell the news. By the time you apes start “yoloing” smart investors are closing their positions. Wall Street bets is just glorified bag holders anonymous."
2021-06-18 14:58:19,wallstreetbets,Guh.
2021-06-18 15:20:06,wallstreetbets,OMG! Why did you screw up with options! Stay away. Just load up on shares
2021-06-18 15:34:31,wallstreetbets,"I've bagheld (??) BB twice now, bought at the top both times. The next time it breaks even i'm selling and never touching the stock again, nothing else in my portfolio has ever tanked 30% in a single week lol"
2021-06-18 15:51:14,wallstreetbets,"Suckers. Lol. 
If you want to be an ape, you have to lose some shit, then gain some shit. Hold and let it happen."
2021-06-18 15:46:50,wallstreetbets,You have to stop buying short term options. The hedge funds and market makers writing you these short term options will manipulate the stock. Buy long term share and calls if you want. This is going to easy be $100 soon.
2021-06-18 11:21:55,wallstreetbets,"Um...it was sitting at like $8 for the longest time then went to near $20 I believe.

If that's not mooning I don't know what is. You are a victim of FOMO and mob mentality. Sorry for your loss"
2021-06-18 11:17:25,wallstreetbets,I WISH it’ll moon for you.
2021-06-18 11:13:26,wallstreetbets,There’s only one play.
2021-06-18 12:09:13,wallstreetbets,🤡 blaming the internet for your decisions
2021-06-18 12:27:07,wallstreetbets,Buy amc !!!
2021-06-18 13:51:51,wallstreetbets,Amc and gme only how many times does that have to be stated my guy
2021-06-18 14:20:22,wallstreetbets,It did moon. Not for long though.
2021-06-18 15:12:18,wallstreetbets,You need to buy CLOV
2021-06-18 15:21:07,wallstreetbets,Everything went down the sitter today.
2021-06-18 16:02:40,wallstreetbets,hold these bags while i liquidate my positions
2021-06-18 16:40:43,wallstreetbets,8k patents and cant turn a profit......it's not mooning anywhere. They are there own short interest.
2021-06-18 16:43:54,wallstreetbets,"You been hit by, you've been struck by... a smooth brain"
2021-06-18 16:56:56,wallstreetbets,"Damn man, history repeats itself. did the same back in January."
2021-06-18 17:01:06,wallstreetbets,If it hits 30$s buy 2022 the ceo gets 400 million dollar bonus .* don’t quote me I’m half asleep but it’s going to hit 30$s by the the time the ceo needs it to.
2021-06-18 17:08:36,wallstreetbets,BB is just a distraction for those to not buy AMC. How many bots in the comments talking about to the moon. Get out of this lie and fly on AMC !!!!!
2021-06-18 19:00:42,wallstreetbets,"They thing people don't realize is, if you're hearing about it on wsb, the ship has sailed. Those aboard are in for a great ride. But don't be the dumbass trying to swim out to a ship that set sail yesterday"
2021-06-18 16:17:46,wallstreetbets,BB betrayed you
2021-06-18 11:17:55,wallstreetbets,WISH is better move
2021-06-18 11:19:49,wallstreetbets,I bought for 10k at $20 two weeks ago. After 1 hour it tanked back to 13-14 and so its now. Loose a few 1000 bucks. Is there still growth potential or is GME or AMC maybe the better bet for rn? Maybe i would transfer all my BB to AMC
2021-06-18 11:14:16,wallstreetbets,"Buy BB at $5 and go to moon, not buy at $14+"
2021-06-18 11:32:16,wallstreetbets,They also said not financial advice
2021-06-18 11:33:04,wallstreetbets,"They didn't say buy the most out of the money puts available, retard."
2021-06-18 11:40:39,wallstreetbets,"Don’t listen to media/shills 🦍s say, invest in safer stock like GME they say… (none of this is financial advice) and really sorry for your loss in BB"
2021-06-18 11:44:47,wallstreetbets,You love to see it.
2021-06-18 11:52:49,wallstreetbets,Not worried about it I expect a surprise ER coming with new management being a part of it for the first time.
2021-06-18 11:55:22,wallstreetbets,"*results may vary, not a guarantee."
2021-06-18 11:58:26,wallstreetbets,Bb a distraction. Amc to the moon
2021-06-18 11:59:32,wallstreetbets,Don't get stock.market advice at Wendys.
2021-06-18 12:13:28,wallstreetbets,Gotta pay attention to who's saying it bud
2021-06-18 12:13:36,wallstreetbets,Jesus you’re retarded. A true ape.
2021-06-18 12:25:50,wallstreetbets,"""Buy FDs"" they said

""It literally can't go tits up"" they said"
2021-06-18 12:30:18,wallstreetbets,that’s because you bought into bb. the goal is amc/gme and you fucked up.
2021-06-18 12:40:08,wallstreetbets,"I keep trying to voice the opinion that this sub is now just a predacious pump and dump farm, and my posts keep getting removed by mods...."
2021-06-18 12:42:47,wallstreetbets,"I believe the DD said buy shares, not options

You have your own self to blame - LTSBG ftw"
2021-06-18 12:45:55,wallstreetbets,First time?
2021-06-18 12:48:53,wallstreetbets,Next week friendo!! These things tend to have a second life
2021-06-18 12:50:06,wallstreetbets,RBM : Relax Buy More!!
2021-06-18 12:52:56,wallstreetbets,I’m down a little too. Been selling calls to make up the difference.
2021-06-18 12:55:40,wallstreetbets,Damn and you got metro pcs for cell service taking multiple Ls
2021-06-18 12:55:53,wallstreetbets,"Clearly not smart over here with contracts, but if you bought in at $14 and it's now worth $12 then how are you 99% down? I assume it's valuing the percentage off of the $88 value but that can't be true because no one in their right fucking mind would think it'd get to $88 anytime soon"
2021-06-18 12:59:24,wallstreetbets,"Personally, I’ve only bought shares with BB. See it as more of a long term play (good returns in a year or 2) 🍇"
2021-06-18 13:04:56,wallstreetbets,Isn't there a theory where Moon is formed from the pacific ocean basin? Maybe BB came back to the OG moon
2021-06-18 13:08:16,wallstreetbets,"stop listening to dumb apes

and 

# TAKE YOUR FUCKING PROFITS"
2021-06-18 13:10:05,wallstreetbets,"Everyone will be a milionaire, they said..."
2021-06-18 13:13:36,wallstreetbets,I would just hold til it goes down to zero at that point lmao
2021-06-18 13:13:57,wallstreetbets,F
2021-06-18 13:15:21,wallstreetbets,You get what you fucking deserve
2021-06-18 13:24:54,wallstreetbets,"It did moon, you were just late."
2021-06-18 13:28:53,wallstreetbets,So no hope for bb jumping up next week?
2021-06-18 13:29:58,wallstreetbets,"Your on the high end for your purchase, but it’ll go well past that again in a month or so.

Stocks don’t always make you rich ASAP - I bought high in gme and held onto bags for nearly five months before I made a profit."
2021-06-18 13:36:00,wallstreetbets,"They say that about every stock!
Sorry dude"
2021-06-18 13:38:23,wallstreetbets,Lmao 1.5k for shares but 22k on options. You belong here!
2021-06-18 13:38:32,wallstreetbets,It's a pretty good idea to take whatever is WSB flavor of the month to shill and do the exact opposite. Almost every ticker being spammed constantly is some form of pump and dump.
2021-06-18 13:39:15,wallstreetbets,Quit listening to “they”
2021-06-18 13:46:06,wallstreetbets,"Today mixed with yesterday your emotions must be in taters, lol"
2021-06-18 13:47:32,wallstreetbets,listening to the wrong people
2021-06-18 13:50:22,wallstreetbets,Red ooooo.red is the color of your energyyyy
2021-06-18 13:57:57,wallstreetbets,This except WOOF for me
2021-06-18 13:59:11,wallstreetbets,Spce is doing pretty good and if you hop over to that sub there's some exciting news on some flights going on today.
2021-06-18 14:00:51,wallstreetbets,"They don’t make anything groundbreaking anymore. They just cling to the shoe of the telecom industry. So, I’m not sure what value anyone could place on them. It’s not like AMC where people will go back to the theater or GameStop with real estate. They are the power cord or phone you thought might be useful so you put it in a drawer, but never needed again"
2021-06-18 14:09:23,wallstreetbets,Should have gone with #gme or #amc
2021-06-18 14:16:18,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-06-18 14:50:50,wallstreetbets,I’d rather be sailing
2021-06-18 14:56:14,wallstreetbets,Ill just leave this here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_JkkV9GRpI
2021-06-18 15:02:29,wallstreetbets,And I thought I lost a lot today on BB options... 🤡
2021-06-18 15:03:59,wallstreetbets,"Short term BB was overvalued. I think longer term, barring a market crash, $20-25 is reasonable"
2021-06-18 15:07:56,wallstreetbets,"Call me a bear, but I only buy stock on memestocks. A stock of GME is more volatile than an option on AAPL"
2021-06-18 15:09:28,wallstreetbets,I panic bought a call 📞
2021-06-18 15:16:31,wallstreetbets,They meant June 18th of next year.
2021-06-18 15:16:43,wallstreetbets,What is a stop loss?
2021-06-18 15:21:17,wallstreetbets,Does that come with any lube?
2021-06-18 15:26:49,wallstreetbets,"""What's the matter, Harry? Some little filly break your heart?""  


""No, it was BlackBerry."""
2021-06-18 15:31:50,wallstreetbets,Shoulda hopped on the AMC train
2021-06-18 15:37:03,wallstreetbets,"I mean. It will.


Eventually. :)"
2021-06-18 15:39:47,wallstreetbets,I suddenly feel better about my 422 spy calls that will expire worthless today
2021-06-18 15:41:24,wallstreetbets,Your down 22k hahah
2021-06-18 15:45:11,wallstreetbets,Pick a stock with a bigger float next time
2021-06-18 15:46:51,wallstreetbets,"need 12 more post like this and that will be a good buy indicator. 

keep it coming retards."
2021-06-18 15:51:23,wallstreetbets,The dip means you buy more retard
2021-06-18 16:08:06,wallstreetbets,im seeing red across the board today..
2021-06-18 16:13:57,wallstreetbets,"I think they meant shares, not options…"
2021-06-18 16:23:38,wallstreetbets,"You fucked up with your positioning, should’ve went balls deep in shares and just the tip in options"
2021-06-18 16:26:10,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I’m a month new to all this, I’m not touching options until I absolutely know what I’m doing. There must be a inexpensive way to practice them. For now I just buy, hold and sell if needed. Classic swing trading."
2021-06-18 16:29:16,wallstreetbets,You should be buying shares in bb and then with leftover cash contracts. This isn’t a short term play and if you are investing in it purely bc it’s now a wsb play you’re playing the game wrong. This isn’t just a wsb play. You should be looking to hold this for at least 3 years.
2021-06-18 16:31:37,wallstreetbets,"I only buy options with money I can afford to lose. 

Try calling your broker and see if you can get a refund."
2021-06-18 16:42:53,wallstreetbets,'They' being WSB only and everyone else saying you shouldn't

2021-06-18 16:52:47,wallstreetbets,I bought the peak in January

2021-06-18 16:54:45,wallstreetbets,"Mmmmm, looks so good.  Such tasty losses."
2021-06-18 17:02:01,wallstreetbets,I’m down 10k I ain’t selling
2021-06-18 17:02:47,wallstreetbets,I’m at 161 and adding more
2021-06-18 17:03:06,wallstreetbets,"No one said make calls, we're talking about buying stocks bud.."
2021-06-18 17:03:10,wallstreetbets,Actually they said it’s a long term position
2021-06-18 17:04:50,wallstreetbets,That position allocation is brutal… 22k in FDs and 2k in shares. Oof
2021-06-18 17:05:37,wallstreetbets,"Right there with you, but I am not selling...they can eat a big fat giant corndog"
2021-06-18 17:05:55,wallstreetbets,Take that $88 and get you some crayons 😂

2021-06-18 17:14:51,wallstreetbets,"It’s alright mate, just hold for the next 20 years"
2021-06-18 17:15:22,wallstreetbets,"No shit, what did you expect. We all know the real play is GME."
2021-06-18 17:19:05,wallstreetbets,"The average ape would benefit greatly from buying puts along their shares of meme stocks, instead of doubling down with stocks & calls."

2021-06-18 17:29:14,wallstreetbets,"I have a cliff option that is worthless, but have played CLNE and Wish well.  BB under 10 is a buy, but no matter how much BB is spoken about I won't jump in unless its under 10.  I bet thousands of ppl have gotten destroyed yoloing thinking it is the next GME or AMC.  Remember we never know who is actually posting the info or the insane gains!!"

2021-06-18 17:48:51,wallstreetbets,"Knew it was sus when AMC skyrockets and BB gets more/equal attention simultaneously on the sub, somewhat suspicious"
2021-06-18 17:49:53,wallstreetbets,"Lol, with blackberry’s history of the stock not moving when/how it should based on company and industry news, buying the option was foolish…. But if you hold those stocks they will eventually make you back at least double on their purchase…."
2021-06-18 17:54:14,wallstreetbets,Oh I thought they said AMC
2021-06-18 17:55:34,wallstreetbets,I'm all over red today. Bleed out bad! Hoping for Monday pump lol

2021-06-18 17:58:04,wallstreetbets,F
2021-06-18 17:59:05,wallstreetbets,Well your mistake was all contracts and little shares
2021-06-18 18:00:04,wallstreetbets,"Looks like a dip to me!!! I might buy back in now.

Edit: ouch, just saw the options"
2021-06-18 18:00:27,wallstreetbets,Next question you ought to ask is: Who are they?
2021-06-18 18:01:02,wallstreetbets,Yall are dumbasses of magnificent proportions for pumping all your capital into a company bleeding cash faster than a stuck pig.
2021-06-18 18:03:38,wallstreetbets,Congrats and fu... wait
2021-06-18 18:04:31,wallstreetbets,BB is not a meme stock getting drug my gme and amc. I got caught in the hype too. Looks like we are headed closer to $10 than we are $15
2021-06-18 18:05:21,wallstreetbets,"Time to short even more, those diamond hands will turn to paper"
2021-06-18 18:06:13,wallstreetbets,I bought in at $17.25 back when it was touted as a future short squeeze. It very briefly peaked to $17.25 again a couple of weeks ago and I sold. Quite happily came out even.
2021-06-18 18:06:38,wallstreetbets,BB actually has great fundamentals. It’s only better that it’s also happens to get caught up in meme rallies
2021-06-18 18:08:37,wallstreetbets,holdin bag at 14 and change
2021-06-18 18:09:42,wallstreetbets,In at $15.  🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️

2021-06-18 18:11:51,wallstreetbets,Looks like you just got barebacked by BB. Let’s get some F’s for this fallen king.
2021-06-18 18:12:46,wallstreetbets,That’s no moon
2021-06-18 18:13:36,wallstreetbets,They should just update the pricing of contracts to show a proper 100% loss on them ones you’re below like 90% under. Because you’re fucked. The fraction of a percent doesn’t make you feel any better. At all
2021-06-18 18:14:07,wallstreetbets,Not to late to hop on AMC fellow apes. I do wish BB moons for you tho! All love & peace ✌️
2021-06-18 18:18:09,wallstreetbets,😂😂😂 true retard
2021-06-18 18:24:03,wallstreetbets,"People are buying options trying to hit a huge profit. They are killing there bankroll. Super risky, be careful."
2021-06-18 18:24:24,wallstreetbets,Should I buy the dip than? Lol
2021-06-18 18:25:38,wallstreetbets,This is why people shouldnt buy options if they dont know wtf theyre doin
2021-06-18 18:28:39,wallstreetbets,GUH
2021-06-18 18:28:56,wallstreetbets,That’s why the stock market is just a gamble.

2021-06-18 18:33:02,wallstreetbets,What’s the short interest on bb?
2021-06-18 18:35:28,wallstreetbets,"$BB is the new $MSFT of the early 2000s. Writing weekly calls is BANK 🏦. Hold stock 💎✋🤚, write OTM calls ✍️."

2021-06-18 18:50:13,wallstreetbets,Did they say to buy weeklies?
2021-06-18 18:50:17,wallstreetbets,"I believe Dr. Burry would tell you to consider this a lesson on greed. Obviously the term, quantitatively, is subjective, but it'd imagine a loss >99% hurts anyone."
2021-06-18 18:51:43,wallstreetbets,There is a reason y’all call yourselves retards.
2021-06-18 18:54:11,wallstreetbets,"ooof, and i'll say it again. oof."

2021-06-18 19:01:12,wallstreetbets,It mooned for me. Just had to buy when it was sub 10
2021-06-18 19:01:36,wallstreetbets,"I sold early this am. I only had 100 shares. Had I bought back at 8$ or 9$ it would be worth it. I got in too late to the party. I have come to the conclusion that whatever Cramer says is the hot stock stay away from it!!! Today he praised CLNE I loaded up and maybe it move .80 cents 80$ on a hundred shares. I exited with a $38 profit on BB this am because I got in high and I had a feeling this AM it wasn't going to sustain with little bit of movement it showed yesterday  but a profit is a profit. AMC$ has been the leader and $GME is starting to show it's being sold off to load up on $AMC. Goodluck!!! We should have loaded up on $AMC
Hindsight is 20/20
I am not a financial advisor I just love trading stocks."

2021-06-18 19:11:10,wallstreetbets,We all got robbed and blinded by stupidity. It was stupid to think we could win against a rigged game.
2021-06-18 19:12:04,wallstreetbets,I was debating buying in today at $13.50. That resistance to risk exposure saved my ass.
2021-06-18 19:12:41,wallstreetbets,Tbh idk when u bought these options but i assume you couldve sold for a decent profit when it went over 20 a few weeks ago. You cant really 💎🙌 options so sorry but thats kind of on you. Dont get greedy. No one has ever gone broke taking profits.
2021-06-18 19:13:01,wallstreetbets,I mean. They did say it was a long term deal.
2021-06-18 19:13:08,wallstreetbets,Yeah your just supposed to buy before the moon

Guys so many people said it that there is no other GME.

I made 100 Doller today because i said yesterday to my friend bb will tank and AMC will not reach 60 because it is a trap.

Obviously was a trap.

Now perma ban 100% because i said something about GME and against their trap stocks.

WSB pure FUD."
2021-06-18 19:46:15,wallstreetbets,This will be GME and AMC in 2 weeks
2021-06-18 19:50:19,wallstreetbets,Meh. Dumb phones are in.  BB makes the smartest of dumb phones. Including “walkie talkie” feature. Who wouldn’t want that? They’ll come back around. Whole market sucked today…

2021-06-18 19:02:26,wallstreetbets,Thats very close to what i did. My $1500 in $10 call options from months back turned into a nice almost 10x play during the moon
2021-06-18 15:05:23,wallstreetbets,"It would help but it would still have been bad.

Honestly there wasn't much organic interest in BB to begin with.  There was no ""they"" here really pushing BB.  I said it before, it was obvious that it was mostly shills / swing pumpers who were advocating BB.

Consider this, BB according to shitty volume metrics had equal mentions as AMC and GME many days.  Now look at their individual subs, and the **quality of conversations** not just sheer # of mentions or comments.  Go on YT, Twitter, FB, and the personalities that advocate those 3 tickers and their following.

It's just such a MASSIVE difference and it's obvious which is really being pushed by WSB / retail and which is P&Der / shills.  Not saying there are no people that earnestly like BB.  I'm sure they exist but they're not nearly as much as raw numbers would suggest."

2021-06-18 13:10:39,wallstreetbets,I think gains are directly correlated to the % charge a phone has based on this post.
2021-06-18 13:40:42,wallstreetbets,But it's LTE.. Not even 3G =(
2021-06-18 13:15:11,wallstreetbets,You sure it wasn’t a Marine subreddit you saw that?

2021-06-18 15:28:10,wallstreetbets,Dont trade news.. news is usually bait
2021-06-18 13:47:38,wallstreetbets,"It isn't enough to justify the price run up and without WSB dry humping it's leg, BB will fall back to earth"
2021-06-18 15:19:49,wallstreetbets,"Is there a lot of positive news?  Positive news would be revenue growth, not winning some corporate pay-to-play award.  Give me Cylance and IVY sales and I'll get excited about the ""news."""

2021-06-18 12:21:04,wallstreetbets,Get me all the drinks (‘:
2021-06-18 12:01:32,wallstreetbets,This is good advice to anyone out there lol
2021-06-18 12:43:50,wallstreetbets,But then we aren't leveraged to the tits then
2021-06-18 12:55:56,wallstreetbets,Better strategy: don't buy meme stocks being pumped by bots on WSB at all

2021-06-18 11:38:45,wallstreetbets,Same (:
2021-06-18 17:20:22,wallstreetbets,How many months did people complain about how they pissed away their GME earnings trying to snowball on AMC?
2021-06-18 17:43:42,wallstreetbets,lol similar boat. Used GME gains straight into BB. I'm in at $16 =(
2021-06-18 13:41:06,wallstreetbets,"It's not people pumping and dumping, it's shill bot accounts and people with shitty english being paid $4 an hour to post."
2021-06-18 17:01:52,wallstreetbets,Do you know of a group that’s more about each other than this BS individualism. I thought this group was about 🖕🏼 Illegitimi non carborundum
2021-06-18 12:23:29,wallstreetbets,"You good my man, you good!"
2021-06-18 14:32:44,wallstreetbets,Just hold the contracts? That's not how that works when they expire. You should sell them. Get your pennies back at least.
2021-06-18 12:06:59,wallstreetbets,🦍💎🦍💎🦍💎🚀🚀🚀🌝
2021-06-18 14:52:56,wallstreetbets,this BB dish need some meme sauce.
2021-06-18 15:13:48,wallstreetbets,or at least bounce back somewhat haha
2021-06-18 13:32:16,wallstreetbets,I mean that's great logic until they expire worthless 🤣
2021-06-18 19:00:31,wallstreetbets,"Doubt it.  I don't see a date on the screen, but at 99% down these must be expiring soon."
2021-06-18 11:53:21,wallstreetbets,16 days ago did you really think BB would stay under $25? Lol
2021-06-18 11:38:15,wallstreetbets,"Yeah when I bought the calls BB was like $19 and I thought for sure we would see at least $25 like in January, my break even is $22.50 wanted to take profits and split them into AMC/BB but the market had other plans (:"

2021-06-18 15:26:18,wallstreetbets,Nah ur savage 😂😂😂
2021-06-18 18:19:20,wallstreetbets,"BB is one of the few companies that are overshorted but have good fundamentals and prospects. (The others I'm in are WKHS and BBBY - they share the same characteristics.) Garbage like WISH or others might not be around 5 years from now...

Read up on BB. They're excellent at cyber security, and their AWS Ivy deal will get a lot money flowing, but not until 2022-23. It'll eventually hit $30 on its own, without any meme momentum."
2021-06-18 11:20:17,wallstreetbets,I never left :’(
2021-06-18 13:20:24,wallstreetbets,Today 💔
2021-06-18 14:39:08,wallstreetbets,So positive it's negative.
2021-06-18 13:19:49,wallstreetbets,A combination of inexperience and a very high certainty that BB would hit $25 again like it did in January (:
2021-06-18 18:35:32,wallstreetbets,That’s what I’m here for! (:
2021-06-18 11:32:44,wallstreetbets,"Today sir, still have hope!"
2021-06-18 11:54:43,wallstreetbets,Down 30k right now. Not panicking. Just holding and averaging down.
2021-06-18 16:09:33,wallstreetbets,Congratulations sir!
2021-06-18 16:33:02,wallstreetbets,Bro I bought these options when BB was at $19 and I thought FOR SURE we where headed right back to $25 like in January and this is what happened. So I don’t blame you lol
2021-06-18 19:07:08,wallstreetbets,Never give up champ 💪
2021-06-18 16:37:35,wallstreetbets,You really think BB will be $100? I’m investing in it long term.
2021-06-18 16:32:53,wallstreetbets,"you must be down bad, spamming these absurd price targets all over WSB. saw you say 300-400 in another comment. save some copium for the rest of us, you're overdosing."
2021-06-18 11:24:44,wallstreetbets,AMC going from 10 to 60 in 2 weeks 🙄

2021-06-18 11:30:07,wallstreetbets,If you never sell you never lose money. Sell covered calls to average down and wait.
2021-06-18 11:27:22,wallstreetbets,Lmao stop bro.
2021-06-18 11:54:17,wallstreetbets,Just hold them. They'll be up again someday. Never sell with a loss.

2021-06-18 13:25:54,wallstreetbets,I just thought the mooning would be in the 20’s 🤷‍♂️💔
2021-06-18 13:52:01,wallstreetbets,Nah I accepted that I was either going to make a lot of money or lose a lot of money after the first 2 or 3 days lol
2021-06-18 15:17:19,wallstreetbets,I don’t understand your question..

2021-06-18 12:34:36,wallstreetbets,Most people promoting BB are 4 month old accounts who never post their positions. They're literal shills. They don't comment about anything else. Your DD should at least checking peoples' profiles.

2021-06-18 12:05:27,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I had no idea what the price was going to do which is why I stayed away from it. You never know what will happen with These types of plays.

AMC mooned to $20 in January then crashed back down before finally taking off again 6 months later. In comparison, GME mooned and never really looked back."
2021-06-18 11:41:43,wallstreetbets,"BB rally was broken when AMC greedy cock suckers executives bailed on their own company and asked investor to be on their own risk. 

BB has been under grim shadow of AMC. Its evident from last 15 days. 

But its gonna end soon. BB is having earnings next week. Its gonna pull through. I don’t expect a squeeze coz WSB guys just pump and dump these berries. But it’s gonna sustain and climb slowly and steadily on its own for sure. 

Long on BB."

2021-06-18 16:31:36,wallstreetbets,Completely new to options. So realistically what happens? 22k is a lot of money for most people. If you have a million dollar account it’s not a bad loss. How does one come back from 22k?
2021-06-18 18:36:40,wallstreetbets,Love you homie keep your head high
2021-06-18 11:46:10,wallstreetbets,"I hope you get lots of $$. I have 2 contracts expiring July 2, I'm not far behind you :("
2021-06-18 18:50:53,wallstreetbets,"Just to be clear, you paid a huge premium and took a huge risk, for a possible 30% gain? Yea you belong here retard. 
In all seriousness learn something about options.

Edit: just say your break even was 22.50. So if you thought it was going to 25 that’s like a 10 % gain. Jesus, that’s a hefty amount of risk for very little reward."
2021-06-18 19:04:05,wallstreetbets,I have a few shares at an average of 16.40
2021-06-18 17:09:34,wallstreetbets,"That’s my short term target, actually about $140, then in about 5-7 years it should hit $700-$1000. I know bb very deeply let’s just say. Good luck and god bless!"
2021-06-18 11:36:13,wallstreetbets,BB hasn't moved in weeks. It made a parabolic move already. Asking for a 2nd chance from wall street is cute. F O M O
2021-06-18 12:15:47,wallstreetbets,"Nah, my bad. Rude comment. Sorry man. I see your contract loss now, and ""F"".

2021-06-18 11:31:49,wallstreetbets,"I know you are right but from now on... lets say in 1 month. 
BB could be worth $50 for example.
And AMC could be worth $300 for example.
The both grow but you can gain more with AMC"
2021-06-18 11:29:05,wallstreetbets,Why?
2021-06-18 14:39:37,wallstreetbets,"LOL, well, speaking for myself, one of set of BB puts are expiring worthless today, lol. I too carried the same mindset set as you, lottery ticket or kindling. LOL"

2021-06-18 14:15:42,wallstreetbets,I bought some to help out a little
2021-06-18 16:47:46,wallstreetbets,Buying a share. I still believe
2021-06-18 18:43:42,wallstreetbets,Lol. Whoever sold him those calls made a fortune on premiums.
2021-06-18 12:19:58,wallstreetbets,Bought shares and sold calls to people like himself
2021-06-18 14:08:54,wallstreetbets,No doubt. Buying “options” isn’t buying into the company.
2021-06-18 15:34:58,wallstreetbets,Would you favor shares over long calls? For example a call option ending in Jan 2023? Isn’t one and half year plenty of time for BB to increase by a lot?!
2021-06-18 19:35:59,wallstreetbets,Actually it seemed the opposite. BB was way more random new accounts with no history spamming stuff like one-liners nonstop.  Then many of them disappeared.
2021-06-18 16:26:07,wallstreetbets,"It will be quite some time, but yea it will be a $20 stock in the future no doubt. I just do not see a moon squeeze potential in this stock... fundamentals are promising long term none the less"
2021-06-18 16:42:01,wallstreetbets,Ok good to hear. I was really thinking I just move on.
2021-06-18 18:06:07,wallstreetbets,Shares and leaps so you are there when BB finally makes its big run.
2021-06-18 18:06:42,wallstreetbets,I bought more leaps today 🤷🏼‍♂️

2021-06-18 12:40:48,wallstreetbets,I’ve been here a while and I like BB. I thought 🌕 of their cybersecurity and usefulness in the EV space. Hopefully good things will come
2021-06-18 13:28:48,wallstreetbets,"mann I swear to god I been saying this ‼️‼️ it’s unfortunate seeing everybody fall into it, I would just get downvoted to hell everytime I made a little sense as to why BB is not the best option unless you’re selling calls"
2021-06-18 16:32:05,wallstreetbets,Yea I feel like BB is inevitably going to die. People can pump it up temporarily but end regular will be death unless they come up with something big soon
2021-06-18 13:01:43,wallstreetbets,I just plug my phone in at the mcdonald's during my shift.
2021-06-18 19:08:11,wallstreetbets,I hope you’re not being serious 😂
2021-06-18 12:20:47,wallstreetbets,"I agree. BB is going to be a great play long term. While it has had some great performance in the short term, the real money is going to be seen in a year or so and beyond."
2021-06-18 11:35:32,wallstreetbets,"Bought it like 2 weeks ago, but I agree with you sir!"
2021-06-18 11:54:18,wallstreetbets,What is selling covered calls? Is not a bad thing of selling calls that there is no limit ot the money you can loose? Why would approach selling calls instead of the shares?
2021-06-18 14:26:07,wallstreetbets,"Do you only sell covered calls at your average share price or above, or do you risk for higher premiums but if it gets exercised, a loss on the share price? I want to take in some covered call premiums but I’m in at $16 and I get nervous if I sell some CC below that for a better premium and they get exercised."
2021-06-18 15:27:17,wallstreetbets,I would not recommend selling covered calls on potential WSB meme mooners.  I really cock blocked myself out of a lot of money on clov that way.
2021-06-18 18:58:14,wallstreetbets,Does this mean hold?
2021-06-18 15:39:21,wallstreetbets,"Well not individuals, it’s a team effort from somewhere bigger."
2021-06-18 17:05:15,wallstreetbets,There's usually a bid unless they're already worthless
2021-06-18 12:19:34,wallstreetbets,"Good on you! Me on the other hand, I thought for sure we would hit $25 in the short term like it did back in January, went all in on calls and well here you have it 😭😂"
2021-06-18 16:37:28,wallstreetbets,"I’m a broke boy, that 22k was accumulated over time through blood, sweat, & tears, but you know what? Never give up."
2021-06-18 12:27:00,wallstreetbets,9 contracts exp july 2 here and it ain't lookin too hot
2021-06-18 12:20:28,wallstreetbets,Hahaha right on dude!
2021-06-18 11:48:45,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that's opportunity cost, you can also lose a lot more with AMC given the volatility."
2021-06-18 11:33:49,wallstreetbets,"....uh. You're hopping from one meme stock to the other at the TOP both times and wondering why you're losing money?

I mean it's your money and you can do what you want, but don't wonder why you're getting clapped lol."
2021-06-18 16:33:53,wallstreetbets,You had this extra pair of buyouts the entire time?
2021-06-18 16:16:48,wallstreetbets,Are we still gonna average down? OHHH YEA!
2021-06-18 13:04:51,wallstreetbets,Appreciate you sir!
2021-06-18 12:58:06,wallstreetbets,I got one today too for the cause. We can help.

2021-06-18 16:10:42,wallstreetbets,"Yea, but where's the retardedness in that?"
2021-06-18 18:07:13,wallstreetbets,Do you want / need leverage?
2021-06-18 17:12:59,wallstreetbets,"I absolutely agreed with you. 
Is a long term thing, but not a squeeze.
Whoever said it would squeeze is an fcking idiot. They kept spreading lies like this would squeeze and that would squeeze. 
Just want to create distraction to separate the Apes into many different little groups."

The company has great fundimentals but is not a bottle rocket stock.  It will be one of the ones I invest in for a good long term portfolio. I'm not bashing them , bb is a good company. Just saying they aren't the meme stock everyone says they are."

2021-06-18 13:08:46,wallstreetbets,"Liking BB and being willing to buy BB are two different things. BB is a special case stock, has been for many years. BB gets good news, stock goes down. BB gets bad news, stock stays flat."
2021-06-18 13:04:55,wallstreetbets,"It's definitely a good long term stock for sure, in my opinion."

2021-06-18 19:11:34,wallstreetbets,"I am on WSB, it's impossible to tell"
2021-06-18 13:20:18,wallstreetbets,"I had a cost basis of $19/share. I started buying up shares and selling covered calls to lower it. Selling covered calls to lock up high premiums due to BB's volatility and setting the strike price at/above my cost basis ensures that I profit regardless if my shares are called away or not. If the contract expires worthless, I keep my shares and continue selling covered calls to lower my cost basis. Rinse & repeat.

I'm waiting on getting access to cash secured puts, so I can start picking up premiums, then buying below my cost basis(if I get assigned), then selling more covered calls(eg. wheel strategy)."
2021-06-18 12:05:23,wallstreetbets,"Selling covered calls is selling options against the shares you own, so the loss is limited. The unlimited loss shown is the hypothetical situation where the share price goes to infinity but you have to sell your shares at the strike price."
2021-06-18 14:34:07,wallstreetbets,"technically you should only have losses in the sense that you cannot take profits from your shares as you only ""lose"" profits by selling at a lower strike than the stock price"
2021-06-18 17:47:23,wallstreetbets,You literally can’t lose money on covered calls as long as you don’t sell them below your cost. So you’d pretty much have to be retarded. Even then you can manage the position to be profitable.
2021-06-18 14:50:23,wallstreetbets,"You can risk higher premiums and just watch it throughout the week, prepared to roll it over to next week if you need to. I'm in at 14.73 and I have CCs at 16, 18, 15, and one 14. I woke up early prepared to buy back the 14 based off of the 5% gain in AH yesterday, but it only dropped..."
2021-06-18 15:33:47,wallstreetbets,Just gotta rebuy your CCs before they are ITM
2021-06-18 18:02:41,wallstreetbets,And also individuals lol
2021-06-18 12:10:13,wallstreetbets,Yeah sure but imo AMC is for the next week the better bet
2021-06-18 11:43:11,wallstreetbets,"Im a new ape, just started a month ago but already made a few thousand bucks. So please dont judge. imo AMC has the better growth potential than BB regarding for a super short termin like 1 week"
2021-06-18 16:21:45,wallstreetbets,I feel your pain but I only have 30 calls expiring today at 14.21 (I tried for 14.20) and the rest are shares I’m down 9k plus a additional 5k on shares 🥲
2021-06-18 18:23:06,wallstreetbets,About time somebody said the truth.
2021-06-18 17:14:41,wallstreetbets,You're right my honest Ape. We in here to help one another. Some booshit dude keep saying everything gona squeeze. 🙄
2021-06-18 18:35:21,wallstreetbets,had to check .. i’m in $14.40
2021-06-18 14:02:27,wallstreetbets,So what you are saying is that there is hope still.
2021-06-18 16:58:36,wallstreetbets,But a low P/E might indicate that the current stock price is low relative to earnings? What do you think?
2021-06-18 19:52:41,wallstreetbets,Doesn't that assume BB doesn't plummet to a point that trying to find a buyer for a call that far OTM means you're selling a covered LEAP? It seems like a great plan for a much less volatile stock no?
2021-06-18 13:37:57,wallstreetbets,"This is the way.

Only caveat is if the security itself bombs, then you might lose more than you gained on the covered call."
2021-06-18 15:23:21,wallstreetbets,"Let’s say someone had 200 shares of AMC, how many options contracts is that and what would an example of all this, including the wheel strategy look like. Let’s say you’re teaching a man to fish for example."
2021-06-18 17:36:27,wallstreetbets,"Im following, but can you explain the ""roll it over to next week"" part? Still learning options."
2021-06-18 15:07:09,wallstreetbets,You're in the right place and I look forward to your loss porn.
2021-06-18 17:17:10,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, but yeah not every investment has to be about squeezes though. Some stocks are just good long term investments with good long term plays.  Bb is one of those stocks in my opinion."
2021-06-18 19:59:36,wallstreetbets,$14 gang checking in . In at $14.02
2021-06-18 14:22:32,wallstreetbets,This guy gets it
2021-06-18 15:00:39,wallstreetbets,I'm not even able to sell reasonable calls above my purchase price. I need it to moon to sell calls 🤣
2021-06-18 15:46:44,wallstreetbets,"Each contract represents 100 shares; so in your case, you'd be able to write 2 option contracts if you're doing covered calls.

Essentially the wheel strategy is using cash secured puts to lock up collateral(cash) from your account to buy 100 shares of a stock if the price hits/goes lower than the strike price. You lose out on the collateral, but you pick 100 shares of a stock you were willing to hold at that price anyways, plus you collect the premium by selling the CSP.

Now that you have 100 shares, you decide to sell a covered call. As long as you get the strike price at/above your cost basis, you make a profit regardless due to collecting the premium and getting your shares called away(since the strike price is greater/equal to cost basis, you don't mind this). If you keep the shares, then roll it over and just write another covered call, collect the premium, rinse & repeat. If your shares get called away, you regain your capital + premium, then utilize CSPs again.

Wheel strategy = Using CSPs and CCs to continue this strategy. Downsides are if the price bombs & the premiums aren't worth collecting when setting your cost basis as the strike, or if the price moons and your CSP doesn't hit the strike and your collateral is locked up until the contract expires. You can search this stuff up on YouTube as well, which is how I came across it. InTheMoney has videos on this as well"
2021-06-18 15:35:00,wallstreetbets,A month ago i started with trading and so on. I deposited 5k and now i have 10k and a piss. Will let you know when i hit my first 50k. So check your DMs 😘
2021-06-18 18:27:49,wallstreetbets,I fully agree with you. Which is why I bought in at all. Going to the moon is fun and all but I wouldn't be on if I didn't see it as a proper buy. AMC though.... I yoloed some there and got out at just above 100% profit :P
2021-06-18 19:50:14,wallstreetbets,"I'm really new to the stock game. BB is really low, but I keep seeing people say it's a good fundamental stock. Why is that? How can you tell?"
2021-06-18 16:25:11,wallstreetbets,He's a true ape.
2021-06-18 17:12:38,wallstreetbets,"I 1000% appreciate your summary, I will 100% look into InTheMoney. I am still pretty lost on this stuff but I see there’s a lot of potential to make money off premiums of stuff I already hold, just gotta figure out how."

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Question: GME holder here, but if GME has approximately 70 million shares, and even if each share hits 10 million, that's $70 000 000 000 000 dollars, more than all the wealth in the world combined and then multiplied a few times as well. How can this be possible? Not trying to spread any kind of FUD, just looking for real answers. How can GME per stock value reach 10 million if that makes the worth of GME more than everything in the solar system combined. Am I missing something here? are there things I am not considering?

thanks"
2021-06-18 11:25:31,wallstreetbets,"Yes, it's almost like that's completely ridiculous. Almost."

2021-06-18 13:41:07,wallstreetbets,Seems like you answered your own question within the question.
2021-06-18 11:37:11,wallstreetbets,It's not and it never will. There is no way in any universe you would have enough people holding until it got even a fraction of the way there.
2021-06-18 11:52:22,wallstreetbets,Oh ffs a short squeeze stops when the brokerage account of the short seller hits 0. This is the stupidest shit I've ever heard.

2021-06-18 11:28:30,wallstreetbets,Those that owe go bankrupt and you get paid out based on whatever assets are sold off I would assume.
2021-06-18 11:48:12,wallstreetbets,You're looking at it the wrong way...$70 000 000 000 000 is more than all the money in the world right now BECAUSE GME isn't at 10 million a share yet...
2021-06-18 12:22:03,wallstreetbets,Same with AMC
2021-06-18 13:11:46,wallstreetbets,"I think its worth whatever someone will pay for it. With that being said supply and demand play the biggest role in what someone will pay for it. And finally with that being said i think it understood:

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Blackberry QNX Design Wins 2019 to 2020  

I went through all of blackberry's ER transcript and extracted the design wins here's the proof. [proof](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/investors)

[Blackberry QNX Design Wins 2019 to 2020](https://preview.redd.it/ts59gvhoh1671.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed3cab1e194ccf12075a5136f657c819dd87089d)

NOTE: Their Fiscal Year (FY) is one year ahead of calendar year.

These are design wins for QNX in last two years only. These are major car OEM and defense and industry companies. It takes 18 months after win for revenue to show up on books. Majority of revenue is not on books yet from QNX.

**Modern cars have over 100 ECU Modules**This is where QNX will have to go into majority of these critical and smart modules that connect to internet. This is how QNX will generate $25 per car produced. 100mil cars produced/year times $25...or $2.5billion revenue just from QNX. This does not include revenue from Blackberry Ivy. Ivy will be **\~$10 per car times 175mil cars ANNUALLY!**! We're talking pure software revenue(high margin) of about **$4.25billion i**n near future annually just from QNX product.

**Blackberry Monopoly in car modules + ASIL D certification**Blackberry has a monopoly in the Autonomous car modules and critical modules (brake system, accelerator system, modem, back camera, etc) because they hold ASIL D certification that no other real-time operating system can attain. This is why they won every OEM! Even tesla uses QNX in their modules they buy from other providers.

**Blackberry QNX + Cylance**Blackberry went ahead and integrated cylance ai(industry leading) into QNX two years ago so basically it's the ONLY operating system that has cybersecurity built inside and is the only OS(with cybersecurity) that runs on cars, drones, trucks, medical devices, iot. Y**ou can't run** crowdstrike or mcaffe on cars!!

In short...institutions know this data and that's why Blackberry has high institutional ownership! Hedge funds are dumb and shorting because they were taking advantage of the transformation period of blackberry from hardware to software! F them!!!

**Summary: This is extremely undervalued based on all the design wins. Basically every IOT device that's connecting and talking to smart city and infrastructure is using QNX because it's the only OS that has cyber security built inside. Do your own DD. This is not a financial advice.**"

2021-06-18 12:31:47,wallstreetbets,Daim OP! This is easy to understand DD for the noob. Your need to repost this every month to educate people.i like it!👍🍇
2021-06-18 11:49:23,wallstreetbets,thanks for the DD. Already balls deep a couple thousand shares in BB shares at 20 Cad. Not worried cuz this baby will pop in the future 🔥🚀
2021-06-18 12:18:54,wallstreetbets,"Long on BB. But I do have Short Term concerns which might impact their bottom line.

My short term concerns for their QNX / QNX Hypervisor / Ivy are ***all out BB's control***.

These short term concerns are:

1. Semiconductor Shortages - How chip shortages will impact auto industry
2. Inflation - How inflation will impact Auto Industry
3. USA's obstinance to invest in smart city and EV centric infrastructure solutions to combat Climate Change

Great DD OP"
2021-06-18 13:55:23,wallstreetbets,Why is bb taking a shit now. Im holding on to my shares but goddamn. I bought at when it was 19

2021-06-18 11:18:42,wallstreetbets,they have a monopoly when it comes to software for cars. The Cylance integration basically  sealed them as a leader. This means that your car can't get hacked or something for money when you're driving. they control entire car space and that's what Wallstreet is missing.

2021-06-18 11:52:51,wallstreetbets,i had opp to sell my shares for $32...all i had to do was hit SELL button. I didn't because my analysis shows this stock is minimum $140 today but is heavily manipulated and misunderstood. I interviewed 10 people and asked them what is Blackberry...and they all said a phone company. 99% of people don't know it's a leading cyber security and car software company.
2021-06-18 14:07:01,wallstreetbets,same here; CA$19
2021-06-18 18:16:12,wallstreetbets,$TSM if anyone wants to bet on chip shortage.
2021-06-18 18:49:47,wallstreetbets,The auto industry is booming.  There have been great reports about car sales numbers. It’s going to be a record year for car sales.
2021-06-18 15:31:40,wallstreetbets,"I can refute all your concerns:

1. Situation can only improve from here. Govts are stepping in to to try to boost chip production and research to remedy the situation long term.
2. Inflation isn't a major concern because automakers don't really have an alternative that is as good and secure as QNX.
3. Smart city investment is less concern than supporting EVs directly. Biden administration is pushing for better EV charging network and infrastructure. Fact that F and GM committed billions into EVs means they will also lobby govt to assist in setting up the infrastructure so they can sell more cars."
2021-06-18 17:50:49,wallstreetbets,"Because everything actually meaningful was already priced in when it went *up* to \~$9 from $6 in December after the AWS announcement. Everything after that has been mostly driven by meme hope trying to find another GME when it's not even remotely the same. For instance BB has a shorted float of only 9% and had been trading at the $8 average range for a nearly decade. It wasn't being held back by anything other than their longstanding failure to actually make any money year after year after year after year. There is no short squeeze or institutional manipulation on BB. In reality, the actual ""manipulation"" has been the pump and dump(s) driven by WSB.

The vast majority of BB ""DD"" on WSB has been basically garbage by people who didn't even know what the fuck BB was themselves until this last year. If you want proof of that, the second last paragraph of this ""DD"" is this guy not even understanding that Hedge Funds *are* Institutions. This DD is full of stupid unfounded projections based on nothing. It's worth $140? Lol. It was $140 for only a week at the ***absolutely very height*** of it's existence in ***2008***.

Nobody actually gives a shit about ""design wins"" if it doesn't actually make you any money other than morons trying to rally other morons.

BB is a long term hold (2+ years out). The 2 big swings this year have purely been WSB driven that HFs jumped on to pump and dump and left people who bought at 19 bag holding because they didn't know what the hell was going on in the first place. Even at $13 it's based on hope and not reality until they can actually show consistent change after a decade of floundering.

It's showing promise and it should grow, but the prices and projections being thrown around are completely moronic."
2021-06-18 11:49:43,wallstreetbets,2000 shares of BB. Some i bought around $7 and some at 10.40. Call positions i will exercise to convert to share and hold for 7-10 years. I heave leaps and no short term calls.
2021-06-18 11:21:08,wallstreetbets,Why its still at $13-14 weeks long? :(
2021-06-18 18:38:11,wallstreetbets,"Just like how Tesla is worth $600+ right? xD You act like you know a lot more than others, but you really don't. The market is manipulated and illogical, so what makes you think BB couldn't be worth $100+?"
2021-06-18 18:38:14,wallstreetbets,"you also need to understand that blackberry is not a hardware phone maker. They are cyber security leader protecting 500million endpoints with their industry leading ai cyber security software. Entire US military and pentagon is using Blackberry spark...they're not using Crowdstrike or Mcaffee. After the solarwind hack that took our microsoft security, all enterprise are switching to blackberry spark."
2021-06-18 18:36:34,wallstreetbets,"i never said hedge funds are not institution! BUT it's true that majority of hedge funds manipulate and short blackberry unlike mutul funds and long funds(which are not hedge funds). 

It seems like you haven't read any transcript from BB. The design wins do translate into revenue. Once the OEM signs on with BB QNX, the software has to be integrated with their products. The product dev cycle is about 18 months and QNX gets paid when it rolls off production line. So essentially all these wins are coming in as revenue starting this year...there was some slow down due to covid but not a problem."
2021-06-18 11:24:29,wallstreetbets,hold. it's being manipulated by hedge funds/shorts and those that want to buy out the company(leveraged buy out lbo). But it's not going to happen because BB has lots of cash and more cash coming (\~5-\~10billion) from patent sale. these patents are no longer needed by BB because they switched from hardware to software only. This company is going to run soon thanks to WSB!!!
2021-06-18 18:47:57,wallstreetbets,"I'm Canadian and have been around current and former and future BB employees for over 15 years and had the option of working for them back then too. I've looked at their statements over the course of their longstanding shift attempt. I'm not unaware of what BB was or is.

The Spark deal you're talking about was priced in in September of 2020. Everything you're talking about is already there. You are not giving any new magical information.

Edit: Also, to clarify that was just for the USAF. The other military deals have been there since 2014-2017 and no, they aren't for the entire military so stop bullshitting. In the end, the important part is that they do not drive *new* revenue.

You’re clearly just learning all this for the first time. Do better DD that goes beyond just 2021 and parroting their own press releases or you might as well start telling people about how Enron is about to moon."
2021-06-18 18:50:35,wallstreetbets,9% of float is shorted.
2021-06-18 15:54:18,wallstreetbets,"But what's ""soon"" for you?"
2021-06-18 19:54:48,wallstreetbets,"No, it's not. Only 9% of float is shorted. There is no buyout attempt. At most there was a rumored hostile takeover attempt to replace the whole board back in 2013 after they laid off 40% of their staff that was abandoned while the company itself was also feeling out buyers themselves but could only be valued at 4.7B and so it was rejected. That turned into a 1B investment at the time instead by a long term growth investment fund. Again, that was 2013. No one is manipulating a stock for 10 years straight while screwing their own fund out of any return."
2021-06-18 11:28:36,wallstreetbets,"You are right but for now i think the GME/AMC bomb could explode every second... so i think its maybe wiser to transfer all BB to GME/AMC. 

imo BB make solid small steps in the right direction but GME/AMC make huge dinosaur steps to the moon in the next few days"
2021-06-18 15:57:27,wallstreetbets,"My projection is by end of year. Next big catalyst for stock is patent sale that will be before July end(per ceo). Then we have ivy customer announcement coming before October. Then we have ivy shipping to car oem and developers end of October. The ivy will be huge as it will give everyone an idea of what it is and how it will be used. 

Ivy is like an App Store but for cars and eventually it will support all iot devices(think smart cities)"
2021-06-18 17:04:44,wallstreetbets,BB actually has prospects as a company. GME and AMC are both just meme stocks. Nothing good about the underlying companies.

2021-06-18 15:23:06,wallstreetbets,"Just stay away from options unless they're only $0.01 each, currently at the money and expires in 1 year with tons of catalysts down the line."
2021-06-18 16:15:02,wallstreetbets,Fuck shares. Both of us should’ve bought 11$ calls expiring 3-6months from now. My 13c for September is still up.
2021-06-18 18:44:38,wallstreetbets,If you have all that money why don’t you buy SHARES so you can sell when you want? I’ll never understand why people do this. Or at least go long on 50-100 contracts vs 0dte or 1 week LOL
2021-06-18 12:21:20,wallstreetbets,"Clne shares goinggg brrrrrrrr brrrrrrr brrrrrr 🚀🚀🚀

2021-06-18 14:06:51,wallstreetbets,"Get ur position to 80% shares next time and 20% calls. Real advice. Protect yourself , the market is extremely volatile right now. Dont chase the euphoria"
2021-06-18 14:38:18,wallstreetbets,Market makers love 'meme' stocks because they can dump extremely high IV options onto retards like us and clean up the premiums.
2021-06-18 17:35:17,wallstreetbets,don’t worry bro you’ll be okay keep those shares .
2021-06-18 19:42:15,wallstreetbets,Those CLNE shares will be worth 20 a pice in no time hang in there
2021-06-18 11:00:50,wallstreetbets,This is gambling… you just have to get lucky
2021-06-18 13:20:35,wallstreetbets,"If only I could attribute that to the mishandling of my funds.

Edit: Grammar."
2021-06-18 17:35:53,wallstreetbets,"Lol my broker is cashapp


Seriously though if you ha e good recommendations for a broker I'd love to hear them as I'm starting to realize cashapp's limits (am poor btw)"
2021-06-18 12:12:36,wallstreetbets,"Wait bro, you might be a genius, think this might be the loophole. Everybody can post all their loss porn but have discussions in the posts??"

2021-06-18 11:00:15,wallstreetbets,Source?
2021-06-18 11:48:06,wallstreetbets,I’m balls deep in WKHS. It will explode once the USPS contract is overturned. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-18 12:43:38,wallstreetbets,"Literally every single one of your submissions is nothing but wkhs and 60% shorted.

Post a screenshot of your positions or I hope you get banned."
2021-06-18 10:55:10,wallstreetbets,I bought my options June 8 and June 9. Now I’m aware of the risk of weeklies and will make calls further out.
2021-06-18 11:41:10,wallstreetbets,"I hope so, man, but this train needs to get rolling."
2021-06-18 13:36:15,wallstreetbets,"I can’t really provide you with anything that you may not already be aware of. For me, apart from calls I made last week, these were some of my first options. So while I did prior research and didn’t go in blindly, I still lacked substantial knowledge in options investing.

I’ve also learned more about exit strategies, whether I’m at a profit or a loss. Other things learned, but nothing necessarily tip worthy, more like lessons learned."

2021-06-18 12:45:20,wallstreetbets,Can't post a screen shot here
2021-06-18 10:56:34,wallstreetbets,Yea when you purchased you are already so far into the decay! Sheesh!
2021-06-18 11:31:35,wallstreetbets,My calls expired worthless as well. Not much compared to you. But yeah learned a lesson
2021-06-18 12:08:08,wallstreetbets,"June 8th and 9th?? Ooh you gotta trim some calls for profit, it hit the 18 a couple times playboy."
2021-06-18 12:46:41,wallstreetbets,Was this most of your portfolio? How much do you have left?
2021-06-18 17:37:52,wallstreetbets,Ya I learned my lesson a few years ago. I stick with at least 3 months out so theta doesn't just rape you if it goes sideways for a bit
2021-06-18 15:12:59,wallstreetbets,Experience in gambling only leads to a worse gambling addiction lol
2021-06-18 11:06:50,wallstreetbets,Can verify
2021-06-18 12:07:39,wallstreetbets,That works! I’m all in on WKHS and I’m a college student. Hopefully I will eat steak in my dorm next year🐎🦍
2021-06-18 13:03:39,wallstreetbets,"https://imgbb.com

Then post a link. I'm not saying you're a shill but there are a lot of them here."
2021-06-18 13:29:04,wallstreetbets,"It was. I started with $60k buying power and turned that to nearly $122k with WISH and CLOV calls early last week. When my portfolio dropped down to around $84k, I closed my positions in WISH and CLOV and opened my current positions in WKHS and CLNE and my portfolio is currently sitting at $25.4k.

The math doesn’t necessarily add up because I made additional poor bets on other tickers and sustained more losses, but these are my biggest losses."

2021-06-18 14:03:59,wallstreetbets,"Damn, I think you have plenty to make a full recovery though. I wish you the best. 👍"
2021-06-18 11:08:51,wallstreetbets,"I'm saying I can verify this is true, I checked yesterday"

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,I still have time lol😂 
2021-06-18 10:45:56,wallstreetbets,You WISH you had more time.
2021-06-18 11:03:43,wallstreetbets,"Great, so now I'm going to be watching this all day to see if you win. I hope it happens."
2021-06-18 10:44:33,wallstreetbets,it just broke out! you have a puncher's chance
2021-06-18 11:07:15,wallstreetbets,Remember.  That money is already lost. Anything you  get back today is money won. Take it it if goes up

2021-06-18 10:45:21,wallstreetbets,Bananas for all!
2021-06-18 10:49:19,wallstreetbets,Starting to move. If it hits 12.50 it will go!!!
2021-06-18 10:44:27,wallstreetbets,LFG! LETS PRINT
2021-06-18 10:52:48,wallstreetbets,"That was WISHful thinking @ $13.50+.... It's making a climb right now, $12 could be in the cards by lunch, but who knows what this afternoon will bring!"

2021-06-18 10:51:48,wallstreetbets,"My only green.

Good luck my friend"
2021-06-18 11:06:04,wallstreetbets,You definitely eat your apple sauce with a straw

2021-06-18 11:36:03,wallstreetbets,$WISH. YOU GOT THIS HOMIE
2021-06-18 13:55:54,wallstreetbets,"Fingers crossed for both of us. I'd say we learned our lesson but we both know that's not true. We're going to be grabbing more options in a few weeks and be up 1000% thinking nothing can touch us only to lose it all on a 'sure thing'. 
 
But I'm still praying this day ends at 15 so we can go get blown behind a Wendy's instead of doing the blowing."
2021-06-18 10:46:25,wallstreetbets,I WISH I could buy more shares than 500
2021-06-18 10:51:14,wallstreetbets,Squeez
2021-06-18 12:59:30,wallstreetbets,"Damn, dude... you still could pull it off. Good luck 🍀"
2021-06-18 13:06:51,wallstreetbets,Even if it reaches 13. Ur still down from declining IV%
2021-06-18 10:50:44,wallstreetbets,You might consider invest in the stock as well. The only way for your option to make money is if your option (clairvoyant bet) to hit the strike price and in order to do that is to invest in the stock. Stock price will go up if you buy the stock and vice versa.
2021-06-18 11:06:00,wallstreetbets,12.50 baby- push
2021-06-18 11:02:10,wallstreetbets,Should known wish was a trash investment from the beginning. Sorry for you loss of money
2021-06-18 10:50:24,wallstreetbets,Wish sucks.......I held that ahit for a month fuck that stock
2021-06-18 11:20:06,wallstreetbets,Would it be better to exercise at least some of these??
2021-06-18 13:16:31,wallstreetbets,Bro sell those before they expire worthless
2021-06-18 13:40:24,wallstreetbets,Congratulations
2021-06-18 15:39:11,wallstreetbets,Why YOLO lifesaving?
2021-06-18 10:53:55,wallstreetbets,When did you buy these?
2021-06-18 14:57:18,wallstreetbets,"Twitch trading should be a thing, watching calls,puts lose/gain value"
2021-06-18 11:05:21,wallstreetbets,so what your saying is my calls for 17.50 are basically worthless lmao!!!
2021-06-18 13:59:06,wallstreetbets,Best comment! For some reason I’m not even 😡
2021-06-18 11:13:28,wallstreetbets,"Only if you help invest in the stock as well, otherwise you are just putting a bet without doing your part to get to your strike price."
2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,The first time a put option worked for me. Let’s go 
2021-06-18 11:17:36,wallstreetbets,Do your parents know about your coming out ?
2021-06-18 10:53:18,wallstreetbets,ET just wants to go home
2021-06-18 15:04:17,wallstreetbets,OP about to get fucked by end of day rally if still holding...
2021-06-18 10:50:35,wallstreetbets,Now buy calls
2021-06-18 12:50:26,wallstreetbets,So In order to make this profit you have to sell it back before expiry? Or so you just let it expire or will it execute?
2021-06-18 11:47:11,wallstreetbets,Explain please. You paid .18 What was the price shown above where you made your money. You were betting the price would go down? Now its at $10.64
2021-06-18 10:54:22,wallstreetbets,"ET is a retard.

Makes sense."
2021-06-18 14:42:00,wallstreetbets,He just needs to let it expire and it will be sold automatically
2021-06-18 12:48:33,wallstreetbets,"The contracts are currently selling at an .18 premium per share. 448 contracts is 44,800 shares. Looks like they originally paid .03 per share."
2021-06-18 13:08:10,wallstreetbets,Go read a fucking book or google a video.
2021-06-18 16:09:47,wallstreetbets,Sold or excercised?
2021-06-18 13:27:13,wallstreetbets,Thanks. I didn’t understand what the .18 was indicating. So now how does he make his money? Does someone buy his put? Does he actually have to sell stocks and then buy them back at the cheaper market price?
2021-06-18 14:39:39,wallstreetbets,No let him first try options before
2021-06-18 13:19:58,wallstreetbets,Thanks. Never traded options before. Thinking of putting some of my $1.7M 401K in to play on options.
2021-06-18 16:30:33,wallstreetbets,"I’m kidding it will expire worthless 

You either will exercise before the deadline or will sold them"
2021-06-18 15:00:38,wallstreetbets,He sells those contracts at their new value or waits and executes them
2021-06-18 13:37:57,wallstreetbets,In The Money on YouTube explains options really well. He’s also on Reddit occasionally
2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Joining the CLNE Crew. I’ll take assignment and buy more. 
2021-06-18 11:51:14,wallstreetbets,Exercise the shit out of those
2021-06-18 12:42:15,wallstreetbets,Thanks to you we will break this 13$ 😍
2021-06-18 11:47:03,wallstreetbets,Just bought some CLNE today! Let’s clean up Wall Street
2021-06-18 13:09:03,wallstreetbets,Good job! We need to hit that $13 to get things going

2021-06-18 14:20:56,wallstreetbets,Beware! Citadel owns over 644 thousand shares of $CLNE! WSB is run by HFs employees apparently!
2021-06-18 10:38:47,wallstreetbets,"Definitely a nice avg price to hold shares but also a nice and tidy profit you could take and make new trades. Ahhhh rich ppl problems. I'll give you my crappy opinion, sell half exercise half, that way your regret will be guaranteed to only be half!"
2021-06-18 14:03:30,wallstreetbets,i wish i knew how to do options😢
2021-06-18 10:48:03,wallstreetbets,"[CTRL + F: ""Citadel""](https://fintel.io/so/us/clne)

EDIT: We have known WSB was compromised for months, but coming back to check in on how bad it has gotten and WOW. Reddit should honestly be ashamed. Some genuinely naive investors are getting played on here and Reddit's endorsement of that is sad."

2021-06-18 10:39:06,wallstreetbets,I'm confused. Do you think you're going to get assigned or do you intend to exercise these?
2021-06-18 14:07:37,wallstreetbets,Disappointed
2021-06-18 15:44:56,wallstreetbets,Why is everyone calls on June 18th?
2021-06-18 12:42:36,wallstreetbets,Exercice now broo
2021-06-18 13:53:36,wallstreetbets,"Why tho?

Sell to close, take profit and be happy."
2021-06-18 13:21:44,wallstreetbets,I bought earlier this morning. Do I sell at $13 or hold.  This is my first stock buy. Thanks!
2021-06-18 16:24:14,wallstreetbets,"lulz, once you look up who the big institutional longs are in this ticker you’ll redact that last bit"
2021-06-18 13:29:28,wallstreetbets,says the gme cult member 🙄🙄🙄
2021-06-18 13:30:15,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, as well as call and put positions. Very easily a short option position with some long stock to hedge."
2021-06-18 13:32:14,wallstreetbets,found the gme fundy 🙄

Idiot apes say Citadel is long."
2021-06-18 11:39:58,wallstreetbets,First I’ve heard this one.
2021-06-18 10:55:56,wallstreetbets,Huh? Is everything a conspiracy theory now with you people? Let the man spend his own money.
2021-06-18 13:36:57,wallstreetbets,True
2021-06-18 13:33:57,wallstreetbets,You don't get assigned with buy calls. And exercising the call would be dumb in the long run because it's^(stock price) going to tank again. OP should just sell to close and be happy.
2021-06-18 13:54:00,wallstreetbets,That doesn't help the gamma squeeze
2021-06-18 13:27:36,wallstreetbets,"The idea is that if it gets to 13, it gets way past 13, so if you buy that then 13 wouldn't be the right time to sell."
2021-06-18 18:40:48,wallstreetbets,Why would u turn it over that quick on that little movement if you were moved to buy it in first place?
2021-06-18 16:12:44,wallstreetbets,"Literally up 1,267.25% in 6 months, definitely just a cult 😂"
2021-06-18 17:03:14,wallstreetbets,"Have you realized how fucked up WSB has become? Idk if it’s actual shills but these comments make me fucking cringe to the max

Where the FUCK ARE THE GAY BEARS?"

2021-06-18 11:10:17,wallstreetbets,"Yes, trust no one"
2021-06-18 19:48:11,wallstreetbets,Agreed. It's going to tank again.
2021-06-18 13:39:19,wallstreetbets,"Lol, yeah, I'm really not sure what OP is on about with the title."
2021-06-18 13:55:29,wallstreetbets,"Neither does holding onto 9c options that will expire in 2 hours. Because 10k shares isn't shit, in regards to a gamma squeeze."
2021-06-18 13:56:27,wallstreetbets,Totally agreed!
2021-06-18 14:15:50,wallstreetbets,Thank you.  I bought at 12$
2021-06-18 18:48:54,wallstreetbets,Why?  I see nothing noteworthy at 13.
2021-06-18 18:36:21,wallstreetbets,Gay bears went extinct (they're gay so they don't reproduce) and the ecosystem of WSB is all messed up now.
2021-06-18 17:35:30,wallstreetbets,"Shut up retard. But I agree, soft af"
2021-06-18 16:19:27,wallstreetbets,"I’m trying to find some proof, can someone with more wrinkles help out?"
2021-06-18 17:24:40,wallstreetbets,The proof was the second sentence.
2021-06-18 15:21:10,wallstreetbets,"Thanks,they are long"
2021-06-18 11:27:34,wallstreetbets,What she say?
2021-06-18 11:12:00,wallstreetbets,We’ll go to church if you’re scared.
2021-06-18 13:52:58,wallstreetbets,"Gotta remember, this is wsb. Seems most people here only know that options trading is where all of the cool YOLO kids get rich."
2021-06-18 13:56:02,wallstreetbets,"I agree, he definitely shouldn't hold them.  My comment said he should exercise them."
2021-06-18 11:49:52,wallstreetbets,"She said (as many people elsewhere long noticed) that there is an unusual amount of orders, particularly in ""meme stocks"", being routed to dark pools. This matter of fact negatively affects price discovery and results in a price that doesn't reflect real supply and demand.

Citadel and Virtu, being the two main entities routing retail orders, are the likely responsibles for this."
2021-06-18 11:19:36,wallstreetbets,"I’m not scared, and church is for the brainless"
2021-06-18 13:57:55,wallstreetbets,"I added to my comment. Point is, exercising to get 10k shares won't push the needle closer to a potential gamma squeeze."
2021-06-18 11:51:01,wallstreetbets,Ah I see. Well now the apes have to beat the odds. The game is rigged against the everyday American. Fight!
2021-06-18 11:21:54,wallstreetbets,5 Hail Marys and a 2 mile run for your sins. Be gone Satan!
2021-06-18 14:00:36,wallstreetbets,"It's a team effort, every bit helps.  And how many people holding contracts are reading this thread and making a similar decision?"
2021-06-18 15:51:05,wallstreetbets,I thought the gamma squeeze was only for calls expiring today.
2021-06-18 15:52:38,wallstreetbets,It was

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Ultimate $ASO DD 🌙🚀 # Let me start by saying: I like the stock

I  live in Texas where guns and sports are king. Most of us have been   pent  up in our houses this past year and with JP not stopping the   printer,  people need an outlet to spend their stimmies (normal people  who are not  degenerates and dump their stimmies on FDs, myself included) go to $ASO  Academy Sports and Outdoors for their needs.

Since this stock hasn't been getting the love it deserves, I thought I  would post the ULTIMATE DD on Academy. Why? Because, I like the stock.  Been   shopping here since I was a kid, got my first bike from this  place, first pair of Nikes, ammo, and everything outdoors. Here's the  bull case   I have (and feel free to poke holes in it):

# 1. They absolutely KILLED earnings last week

*Net Sales Increased* 39.1%*; Comparable Sales Increased* 38.9%

*Gross Margin Rate Increased 950 basis points to 35.7%*

*Pre-Tax Income Grew to* $225.0 million *from a loss of $9.5 million*

*Company Raises Full Year Diluted EPS Range to $4.15 to $4.50*

# 2. The entire sector is on fire

$ASO competitors Dicks Sporting Goods and Big Five have also reported ER   numbers that all confirm an uptrend in sports goods as a recovery play.

# 3. Insiders have been buying

There are form 4's filed by 6 chief officers. They have ALL been buying this shit up. Insiders sell for many reasons but there is only one reason they buy.. We're talking multiple form 4s this month, last month, and the month before that too.

# 4. (Insert S-word) is high on this

Hedgies thought this thing would fail before covid changed the game on us all

&#x200B;

[SI is high and days to cover is nigh](https://preview.redd.it/vho6stuca1671.png?width=1476&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbe6fac63a47662eef20238c53aba0b83432a0d9)

 

SI is high and days to cover is nigh

# 5. NASDAQ reported higher than usual options activity

Should the price increase past $40, causing ITM calls to be exercised, combined with the low volume could make things interesting.

#  7. Strong Balance sheet and cash on hand

This re-iterates point 6

As  of the end of the first quarter, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $593.3 million and no amounts were drawn on its credit facility. During the first quarter, net cash provided by operating activities was $219.2 million compared to $90.8 million in the first quarter of 2020.

Subsequent to the end of the  first quarter, on May 10, 2021, Academy's largest    shareholders completed  a secondary offering of the Company's common    stock and Academy  purchased and retired 3.2 million shares for  approximately $100 million.  As a result of this reduction in shares    owned by the largest owners,  Academy's largest shareholder owned    approximately 31% of the Company. In  addition to the stock repurchase,    the Company paid down $99 million of  its outstanding term loan and refinanced the loan's interest rate from LIBOR + 5.0% to LIBOR + 3.75%.

Michael Mullican, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said,  ""Based on  the extraordinary sales and margin results, the Company has    fortified  its balance sheet and is also increasing its full year earnings outlook.  Academy's cash balance is stronger today than at the    end of fiscal 2020  even after using $199 million to repurchase shares  and pay down a  portion of its term loan.""

# 8. Increased guidance for 2021

While there is still economic uncertainty from the impact of COVID-19 and other external factors, based on the strong  performance of the first quarter and the visibility we have for the  remainder of 2021, the Company is increasing its fiscal 2021 guidance as  follows:

&#x200B;

# 9. Every analyst and their moms have this thing rated at BUY

I know, I know, who gives a shit about analyst right? Wrong, if you have read the reasoning behind their ratings, it is because this stock is so undervalued right now. The whole street knows it.

&#x200B;

# Positions:

* 500 shares
* 10x 6/18 $35C
* 40x 7/16 $35C
* 20x 8/20 $40C

TL:DR - this stock is going to the moon and, I like the stock. I am going to keep buying the dips

# What is the Hershey Highway?

The Hershey Highway is slang for anal sex, derived from the brown color of Hershey chocolate being analogous to feces. The evidence shows people love anal sex, in particular ass-eating has become the hot trend. Hershey's is positioned to make money on the anal sex surge in popularity. As more people started eating ass, chocolate demand has also gone up. This is science, fellas. COVID killed the demand for [chocolate](https://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/17944-covid-19-eats-away-at-global-cocoa-demand), but with airports and hotels and boutiques going back up, candy bars will be flying off the shelves. Tl;dr: The demand for chocolate tracks the popularity of anal sex,

# I don't particularly like Anal sex, why should I invest in Hershey?

Tighten your asshole, grab a hot cocoa, and [read this 10K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47111/000119312511039789/d10k.htm). To my dismay, this thing had a lot more than 10k words, but I did the hard research and selected the most important part to share here.

&#x200B;

[Kit Kats? Kisses? Reese's? TWIZZLERS?](https://preview.redd.it/ljpqwuzo81671.png?width=1227&format=png&auto=webp&s=81cdc54c472cf1911d365d7ccdb0d67542f0b628)

When you look at these products you realize that ***Hershey's is a movie theater play***. If you're long AMC you should be long HSY, because who doesn't buy TWIZZLERS at the movies? WHOPPERS? MOUNDS? Mr. fuckin' GOODBAR?

# What was that about slavery?

That's right, [we use child labor](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/feb/12/mars-nestle-and-hershey-to-face-landmark-child-slavery-lawsuit-in-us) to farm cocoa. There are some obvious benefits to child labor. Hershey's is giving these kids valuable real life skills and experience while lowering the cost of labor. This is really empowering the children, but for some reason HSY doesn't market it as such. I guess that's our little secret, and it's how you can effect societal change with this play. By buying Hershey you are supporting children in other countries striving for a better life. This isn't just some monkeys, these are real humans that might be allowed to eat a couple Almond Joys if the underlying goes up enough.

# What was that about fat people?

&#x200B;

[A warrior for the cause.](https://preview.redd.it/qgcte3vs81671.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=4679ea7e165eccc209f7123bad3e73bff0bffff0)

The rate of obesity in America is incredible. Blue whales are choking on us. It's ridiculous. What do fat people love? Candy. But most people only buy candy when they're out, at the gas station or supermarket or travelling. Fat people especially know they can't just hoard candy or they'll eat it all and catch a coma. Now that most of America is vaxxed and people are out and about again, candy consumption will shoot up. Anecdotally, I bought some Reese's today at Wawa.

&#x200B;

[People are fat.](https://preview.redd.it/d62y8htu81671.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=291889bdda0dc9242653e03f48237222e5c6d33a)

# Life is like a box of chocolates, it doesn't last as long for fat people

I have established a correlation between obesity, anal sex, analingus aka rimming, and chocolate consumption. The bullish trend lines for all of the above are irrefutable proof that Hershey will be 200 by the end of the year. This is the summer of brown gold. Hershey's costs have stayed low thanks to slavery while revenue has gone up thanks to inflation.

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Be careful out there The FED is sending mixed messages, James Bullard has said he expects interest rate hikes to start in 2022, Janet Yellen also said she expected early rate hikes before backtracking a few days later (no doubt after getting her knuckles rapped) if inflation continues on its current track rate hikes will come much sooner than the FED is currently predicting

All these continued mixed messages lead to one thing - **uncertainty** and that is the very thing that markets do not like

The early warning signs that a market is about to turn are visible but often subtle and easy to ignore, there are more and more warnings signs appearing that the Bull market maybe coming to an (abrupt?) end

&#x200B;

**Is the market so far in excess that a correction is imminent?**

**Signs of Irrational Exuberance -**

OTC penny stocks traded 80 million shares in Feb 2020 increased to an incredulous level of 1.15 trillion by December and 2 trillion by February 2021

Ignoring the negatives, the price of many stocks are so completely removed from the business fundamentals that it is hard to argue there is any correlation left at all, you can literally throw a dart and you will hit a company that is 10x, 20x 100x its revenue

S&P 500 PE Ratio was at 40 on January 1st this year and is estimated to currently stand around 45 up from an average of around 15, just before the dotcom bust it was 29

[https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio/table/by-year](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio/table/by-year)

&#x200B;

**The Current inflation adjusted Shiller PE Ratio is 37.74 well over double its average of 15.8**

The ""Buffet Indicator"" market cap to GDP is currently 197% - during the dotcom boom it peaked at 140% and in 2007 it peaked at 105% , If you don't think we are in a blow off top situation at the moment just check out the ""Buffet Indicator"" chart below

Fortune 500 Company leaders calling themselves ""TecknoKing"" spending their time tweeting about a highly speculative and questionable currency asset class (unmentionable on WSB).

SPAC and Stock mega speculation, make 10x, 20x 100x your money in a week or a month, stonks only go up

IPO upsurge: in 2019 there were 232 IPOs, in 2020 480 IPOs and in the first 5 months of 2021 there have been 512, (at the height of the dotcom boom in 1999 there was a total of 289)

Investors bullishly positioned for permanent growth many thinking that inflation is transitory despite the massive money printing press which can only lead to a devaluation of the dollar

&#x200B;

The economy is limping along having never fully recovered from the great recession and further decimated by covid being propped up by unprecedented debt and money printing which is literally off the charts, there has rarely been a period with such disparity between stock prices and company earnings

**All of this is just tinder waiting for the spark**

TD:LR - The main clarion call of the last 18 months has been ""the fed has got our backs"" but even the FED is now signalling that the party might be coming to an end, if inflation continues on its current track rate hikes will come much sooner than the FED is currently predicting

It might be time at least to start looking at hedging your positions or consider how much risk you are currently exposed to if there was a sudden downturn"

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$DASH puts on the menu? I have 7 6/25 $165 Puts that I bought yesterday. I've been following pre-market and noticed the volume on stocktwits seemed like an error with 471k shares traded. Then I check the trades on Nasdaq and saw a 470k share block @ $164.52. That's a $77M trade after a huge weekly run-up on puff PR (Petsmart and B&B partnerships). No idea what this means (could it be related to quad-witching?), but seemed noteworthy.

2021-06-18 10:12:32,wallstreetbets,Dash is the most bloated trash stock on the market. How it’s over $100 is mind blowing. But you can clearly see buyers are manipulating the float. In a normal world you should make about 400% return but let’s see.
2021-06-18 10:06:18,wallstreetbets,"Good luck bud, DASH really likes to fuck over put buyers."

2021-06-18 10:38:00,wallstreetbets,The amount of people getting things delivered has plummeted in the past month. Watching dash closely the past few days has me scratching my head when this thing just wants to keep rippin.

2021-06-18 16:42:23,wallstreetbets,The public float is still showing 66million even after full lock up expiry. Some other sites showing 126 million as public float. There still seems another 80 million shares going to be unloaded. Today’s volume was insane 3 times the average.
2021-06-18 10:28:58,wallstreetbets,lol Dash is one of those stocks I just watch and laugh at.. if I was into conspiracy's I would think something...
2021-06-18 13:00:20,wallstreetbets,Yeah I’m pretty happy I got out today. I will happily take my 52% gains in a month and find something I can confidently support.
2021-06-18 10:56:32,wallstreetbets,"thanks, i got $15k in ST gains i gotta blow through by year end anyways lol."
2021-06-18 10:52:36,wallstreetbets,Yeah i know it’s closely held by tutes so the stock price doesn’t have to make sense. I just get the feeling one of them will cash out soon.

2021-06-18 10:40:42,wallstreetbets,"Yea it crazy. Like every insider has dumped millions of shares this past week and the ask just keeps getting hit, printing green. I think it’s MM trying to squeeze up shorts. Reminds me of LMND when it ran up to like $180 and crashed. They can’t keep it up forever."
2021-06-18 10:59:19,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I'm thinking about getting into DASH two weeks or so before earnings, it historically dips around then before shooting back up"

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$Wish and Bears I tend to agree with Bears that are pointing to the company's decelerating user growth and coupled with its widening net losses last quarter.
I believe in recent motley fool article that these are just short  term head winds and company by his track record of innovation and evolution will be able to cope with this short term headwinds.

You can only make so much money in companies that are already good because it’s already baked in their stock price. But investing in shitty companies trying to make themselves better that’s where most of the money is made. 

I think Wish is trying to make itself better and it will be reflected on its stock price sooner rather than later.
Stay strong fellow retards and wish for better times."

They talk about this in their shareholder letter & conference call transcripts. As for their widening loss in Q1 they said in advance of that that Q1 & Q4 would be their largest quarters of investment (ie spending)... and if you think about it it does make sense. After all, they just got a big mountain of cash in December. JP Morgan believes they’ll be EBITDA breakeven in 2022 & I see analyst prediction of EPS positive in 2023.. so they’re on track.

If you buy products reviewed by customers who took pictures, you know what you’ll get. 

By the way, if you get scammed, WISH refunds your money. Just send them a photo of what was sent to you.

They have even refunded me in the case of something not fitting.

I haven’t had a problem with them.

No, I don’t own the stock. :) Thinking about it!"

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UWMC could fly today and here’s how. What’s up apes?

Listen just to let you know full disclosure I have other meme stocks with contracts ending today that are OTM and reason why I’m saying this is so you know I’m not pushing any stock for any personal reason.

UWMC is a great company, shorted around 15-20%, fundamentals are amazing, dominating broker/wholesale channel (34% market share and growing), Russell inclusion, CEO 300M share buyback, the works etc. You want more details on the company there’s DD all over the place for it.

The important thing is that this stock has a small float, very easy to move the price and it’s very undervalued at its current trading price. 

UWMC has been chilling at around a constant $9.87 - $9.99 range.

There’s a lot of open interest for today with ITM being $10.00, $11.00.

We’re talking Goldman Sachs, Shitadel, etc having puts on these strike prices. There’s equally, a lot of open interest on calls as well.

If people simply bought shares and hold, this stock can be ITM and then all those open interest will need to be exercised.

This will lead to a nice increase in the price of the stock and once this stock breaks $10.50 resistance it has great potential to fly high.

Oh, also the stock has a dividend of $0.10/share per quarter.

Keep your eyes out on this stock (in general), but especially today! Also, I’m pretty sure retail owns majority of the public float. (Public float: 103.11M).

Best of luck my fellow apes!

Edit: Holy fuck, some of you apetards are really negative eh? Let’s get some facts straight, my post never stated to buy the shares it simply advised to watch out for it. Second, my post never mentioned a short squeeze or gamma squeeze, it simply mention that if the stock price is ITM for the options, it’ll drive the price up.

Also, for anyone who bought today or is holding from the past, don’t forget UWMC is a wholesaler. When interest rates go up they make more revenue as their a mortgage originator not REFI. Unlike RKT (nothing against the company) who are predominantly REFI heavy for their business, when rates go up, they’ll start to lose a lot of business. Broker channel (UWMC) provide the best rates especially in times of inflation versus companies like RKT (Again, nothing against RKT) who are direct to consumer.

Last but not least, no one could of anticipated the Fed informing of interest rates increasing in less then a year from now this morning which is the reason for this blood bath today."

In other words collude for market manipulation?

Nice."
2021-06-18 10:18:12,wallstreetbets,"That’s the problem. Lowest volume I’ve seen on this stock in a long time. All investors are straight diamond hands too. Also, this stock is a big play for July, Aug, Sept, but could have a massive rally today if it’s ITM. With the low volume from investors it makes it easier for the shorts to try and beat down the price but even they have a hard time with that because we own majority float. I’ll be disappointed to as this opportunity is a great setup."

2021-06-18 13:19:56,wallstreetbets,let’s goo!!!!!

2021-06-18 10:16:57,wallstreetbets,I feel you on this sentiment
2021-06-18 12:19:16,wallstreetbets,I can say this uwmc isn’t a pump and dump like most of the apetards pick. It’s value is set at around 14 dollars and that’s no bullshit either so just sit back and wait. I’m poor myself and own 100 shares in this.
2021-06-18 10:29:39,wallstreetbets,Sorry $10 and $11 strike. But those hedge funds are shorting the stock at stock price ~$10.53. Check the UWMCShareholders Reddit page a user posted the holdings and positions today.
2021-06-18 17:22:57,wallstreetbets,“Falling with style”
2021-06-18 09:47:26,wallstreetbets,Oh my.... best of luck with that....

2021-06-18 12:55:19,wallstreetbets,I've seen UWMC on here for months now but I've never seen 1 person make money from it
2021-06-18 10:54:59,wallstreetbets,Same here. Just bought back today's.  July's are still up tho
2021-06-18 12:13:49,wallstreetbets,Extremely unlikely.  I am long 10050 shares and can't see it getting past $11 or $12.  If it gets to $20 I will be sad because I will have sold long before then!
2021-06-18 12:00:20,wallstreetbets,"I’m Canadian, been holding UWMC for a while as I’m very long on the stock (Not in it for a quick pump), was talking about the option chain. If it were to be ITM those contracts would be exercised and in theory a gamma reaction can occur."
2021-06-18 10:57:19,wallstreetbets,True that.  Buy AMC.  It actually goes up repeatably.  I'm done waiting two months for a dollar.
2021-06-18 16:06:23,wallstreetbets,lolololol... i see approximately 100 UWMC posts a day

2021-06-18 11:24:33,wallstreetbets,Because it was an obvious PnD.

2021-06-18 11:53:25,wallstreetbets,Everyone is focused on WISH and shit. People see a stock spike and THEN it gets posted everywhere once it falls. Then you have a million bag holders. I don’t see why people aren’t buying more UWMC BEFORE the spike
2021-06-18 12:27:29,wallstreetbets,That’s true.
2021-06-18 16:26:50,wallstreetbets,Where'd you learn math?
2021-06-18 09:32:15,wallstreetbets,"Great job, I hope it rockets for you today."
2021-06-18 10:35:33,wallstreetbets,I rode my $10c's all the way from $0.2 avg to $1.00 and back down to $0.08 still holding nothing to lose
2021-06-18 10:57:59,wallstreetbets,"I read it.  Complete and utter nonsense.  Those are almost all funds that have net long positions.  What you see in that post are partial hedges, not short positions.  Here are the actual (complete) holdings:

https://www.holdingschannel.com/institutional/holders-of-uwmc/

As you can see Susquehanna, Citadel, and most of the other firms listed in that post are long, not short.

Don't fall for the tinfoil hat nonsense.  Take a few seconds and do your own research.  It literally took me 5 seconds to find this information.

By the way I own over 50k shares of UWMC and I am active in that joke of a subreddit.   Every fucking month there is a string of mouth breathers predicting a gamma squeeze.  It's getting old.  The best thing about options expiring today is that I don't have to read any more gamma squeeze shitposts for another 2-3 weeks."
2021-06-18 10:17:51,wallstreetbets,Probably they’ll be worthless in the next hour if the stock just keeps tanking more and more
2021-06-18 10:30:01,wallstreetbets,Still a good chance for it

2021-06-18 13:40:04,wallstreetbets,"I thought they are. But then again, I think everyone is out to get me.

2021-06-18 11:29:17,wallstreetbets,It’s holding 20% gains over the past few weeks. How is that a pump and dump?
2021-06-18 11:51:32,wallstreetbets,A pump and dump that went from $7 to $11 and hasn’t fallen below $9.50 in a good minute? Oh and I guess GME was one too? Didn’t it hit 450 from $2 and fell back to $50? How many ppl were calling that a PnD? Or when BB went from $11-$21 and fell back to $13? No logic here dude.
2021-06-18 12:15:47,wallstreetbets,"Thank you! That’s literally what I’ve been thinking all this morning. I studied uwmc and on paper it looks phenomenal. I then study BB just for shits and giggles and I about shit. No new ips, no cash to spend, same customers so blackberry is literally a mediocre business and that’s being nice. Yet ppl invest in it thinking it’s going to the moon? Smh. However if anyone is listening 14.5 is the value of uwmc to date. As of right now that is it’s true value."

Edit: sorry busy at work, not gamma, but if the options are ITM before exp, it’ll create a nice momentum in the price is all I was trying to state. Not a gamma squeeze or a short squeeze etc."

Next youre going to tell me that believing people dont want to see shit for brains memes about one stock dominating the sub makes me a sheep"
2021-06-18 11:53:17,wallstreetbets,"Yeah everything but GME was a pnd. Go look at volume. Stock price means dick volume and market cap. If there isn't enough volume to support itself it will decay slowly.

Even GME was a massive dump. Down to 50 from 450... Make money when you can but some of these meme stocks are straight cancer"
2021-06-18 18:47:33,wallstreetbets,"How do you figure when their QNX security software is sitting pretty in practically every EV being manufactured? They've aquired Nio, Volvo, tesla, Hyundai... no new customers? Ok"
2021-06-18 10:59:43,wallstreetbets,This whole thing is one big lesson.
2021-06-18 12:05:38,wallstreetbets,"You also said that they were shorting the stock, which is wrong.  They are buying puts to hedge their long positions, which is completely normal.

Also gamma squeezes don't happen at expiration, they happen in the run up to it, if they happen at all, which they almost never do.  It's not about options expiring ITM; it's about hedging caused by price movements before expiration, and it can squeeze down just as easily as up (as hedges get unwound as delta falls, causing a sell-off).  

But realistically the effect is almost never big enough to cause a squeeze because the MMs are not short anywhere near as many options as people think they are.  You have to be pretty fucking stupid to think that MMs are short every single contact in existence.  Regular investors sell a lot of calls, either covered by their shares, or as part of multi-leg option strategies.  This is why the gamma squeezes that people predict almost never actually happen."

Not unsurprisingly the government didn’t seize preferred stocks for GM, the government robbed from the poor and gave to the rich…

So you may be down 20% or 30%, but I bought a stock that is currently worth about twice what I paid, but the government seized it back then and I lost ALL of it… down 100%"

I worked at apple, and that 'its about the customer experience' and all that bullshit is just that, bullshit. Its about profit.  Don't let any company tell you its not. 

I was on a call with Ron Johnson who said it best. At the retail level, of course the employees should focus on the customer, and not worry about sales, but in the end, when was it EVER not about making money

The whole 'awesomeness' of working at these companies 'free food, dry cleaning, day care, unlimited time off, open work schedules, is all about keeping you on campus doing work, and making it easy for you to stay on campus by offering those amenities.  Ohhh and keep you from conversing with other people at the other tech companies. 

I have a friend that works at google, he loves it, I got a firm 'talking to' when they found out I met up with him for drinks and dinner.  I was also told what bars were 'google bars' and to avoid them"

2021-06-18 11:29:48,wallstreetbets,"wow, that's insane -- about Apple trying to persuade where and with whom you socialize. i'm a computer scientist, but within academia, and i had never heard of this.

i worked at google for a 5-month long internship during its infancy, but i haven't worked for any of the FAANGs since. however, i've continued to put Google Research on a pedestal.

your sentiments, however, agree w/ a friend of mine (who has been fairly high up at FAANGs) who stated ""it basically just boils down to which colored hat do you like. do you like Fuchsia, or perhaps Teal? under the hood, it's all the same. just focused on ads and getting people to click on shit"" :-( 

my research and teaching concerns some hot areas within deep learning. i absolutely love teaching and advising students; however, the salary is abysmal, and i could earn 3x - 4x in industry (when factoring in stock options). it's quite a dilemma as i go on the job market next year."

Hope they have a plan B for old age care at this point because they shit the bed so bad I dont see this working out for them and everyone of them thinking their home equity is a retirement plan because values shot up without recognizing the need for increased care and downsizing as one ages are in for being slapped in the face by their past selves.  Worse for them we won't be positioned to do a damn thing about it because they never did recognize the absolute necessity of giving up the reins to the next generation.

boomer is still a reference to the baby boomers and by extension, so is the nouveau phrase 'OK boomer', intending to dismiss antiquated ideas or perspectives.

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UWMC - After the Big Heist the Coast is Clear for Big Profits! In one of the most retarded posts in recent memory, on Monday of this week, u/250rider exalted his $180k loss in UWMC $11 strike calls expiring today. If he was happy with his 180k loss then, he must be super happy today, as it looks like his entire $275k investment will be torched at the close with UWMC currently trading just under $10.

At the time of the original post, seeing the huge open interest of almost 50,000 June expiration $11 strike calls, I predicted UWMC would finish today at $10.99, torching our fellow autist's entire investment. What I didn't realize at that time is that almost as many retards were holding the $10 calls--over 40k contracts--which is why UWMC should finish the day right about where it is at now,  just under $10/share. Another successful heist by the call writers!

This type of fuckery is oh so typical. Don't ever underestimate the ability of these criminals to steal ALL your money!

Seeing as how the coast is clear now that all the retarded $10 and $11 call holders have been wiped out, it looks like it may be prime time to get long.  I am buying UWMC today under ten and looking for a nice bounce back next week."

2021-06-18 10:26:36,wallstreetbets,"That's... not at all how this works.

Since it's very close to $10, MMs very likely already have *all* the shares they need to cover those contracts.  Now if UWMC jumped up a dollar to $11... Then it would be likely that they'd need to buy up shares to cover any naked $11 contracts.  And that might be enough to push higher to $12.  And so forth.

In other words, we would need a few million dollars pumped in very quickly to push it up high enough to start a gamma squeeze on contracts that they never planned on having to cover, plus enough of a bid order placed to cement the price floor at that higher point to force them to not even be able to short their way out of it.  They're market makers.  They don't just decide to not cover their asses on something that has a decent chance of going against them.  They cover on the way up, and they're likely covered before they start to lose money.  If they made basic mistakes like this frequently, they definitely wouldn't be in the game for long.  A little volatility would destroy them in an instant."

If UWMC rose $1.50 next week, and you were able to sell those calls for 1.63 each or $163/contract, your 180k just turned into $465k. Versus buying the shares and having a $27k profit. Now do you understand why options are so sexy?"

$RIDE 🚨 Lordstown is well position with minimal high-cost of maintenance parts. Gear boxes and other parts that will need to be maintained on other EV Trucks will allow the Endurance to be hands-down the lowest cost vehicle. In addition, the ability to move quicker than the Big 3 positions us well and early in the market.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/dth5em1qc0671.gif

✅ Rich Schmidt, Lordstown President confirms, Lordstown is fully funded through May 2022 with millions extra in the bank. There is additional fundraising happening to ramp up production, because hard tooling requires 50-51 week advanced and paid order before required. In order to continue to improve production with hard tooling, we will continue to work with ATVM Loan funding and asset-backed funding.

✅ Current interest is at an expected 20,000 non-binding orders through May 2022.

✅ The hub motors have been fully tested on street driving, and we have not been able to break a hub motor. You will break a wheel before you break a hub motor. They are built very much for difficult road conditions.

✅ 600 employees are hired on to support operations across Lordstown locations.

✅ Received FMVSS Penetration Requirements exceeded. Final certification test will be early fourth quarter. Vehicles will be produced in September and quarantined until final certification is released, at which time the vehicles will be delivered to customers.

✅ There is a Lordstown VAN prototype that is in final stages of completion completed, which will be shown this summer. The prototype is set up to use same products, build, and platforms as the Endurance.

✅ The cost for the Endurance will be at $55,000. There is a minimal parts supply cost increase due to covid. The average vehicle increase has been $4,000 across the industry.

✅ Vehicles will be available for press and investors to drive at Lordstown Week, onsite June 21 - 25.

✅ Lordstown will continue an open culture; engaging with the team and it's up to the employees and Lordstown family to seek unionization or not... Every team member owns shares in the company, we enjoy providing free meals, and each day we work hand and hand with all Lordstown employees.

2021-06-18 08:26:37,wallstreetbets,"KPMG’s audit opinion states the following in the company’s **restated** 10-K

> The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1, **the Company does not have sufficient liquidity to fund commercial scale production and the launch of sale of its electric vehicles which raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.** Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.


Honestly, you can find much better toilets to flush your money down.

Edit:

From Note 1

> Since inception, the Company has been developing its flagship vehicle, the Endurance, an electric full-size pickup truck.  The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to complete the development of its electric vehicles, obtain regulatory approval, begin commercial scale production and launch the sale of such vehicles. **The Company believes that our current level of cash and cash equivalents are not sufficient to fund commercial scale production and the launch of sale of such vehicles.** These conditions raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements.

2021-06-18 08:38:42,wallstreetbets,"No one wants hub motors.

In Lordstown's own rebuttal to the short report they said (I am not making this stuff up) they needed to do extra work tuning the suspension, strengthening the frame, and adding weight (fyi, additional weight reduces range) to get the hub motors to work. And you need 4 hub motors for a pickup truck (versus a single chassis mounted motor). Especially for ""fleets"" where you want to keep costs down, I am not seeing how hub motors actually accomplishes that. But then I am a ""hater."" Better to trust the people at Lordstown who have not lied and bumbled at every step of the way.

Maybe one day someone can produce a regular vehicle with hub motors (I am thinking more a lighter weight vehicle with hub motors on the rear wheels), however I would not say I am very hopeful. Inherently, the spatial limitations and inability to have a reduction gear, may have significant implications for efficiency, which is more important than saving a little space inside an EV and avoiding the need for half-shafts."

2021-06-18 12:52:34,wallstreetbets,"Yeah they sure did, and very nearly did not make it.

They had zero competition in the fully EV space at the time.

Lordstown has a boat load of competition

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Stick with AMC. But if you do diversify into another hopeful....... Do it with Workhorse $WKHS.

Not these other memers and fakes

Stick with AMC and GME, our Godfathers

Yes, this is me pandering to them to gain more approval.

but it is sincere, since I'm invested into them myself.

but

WKHS has been around before the Bots and spammers here in WSB

115 Million Float, 1/4th the size of AMC, making it 75% easier to Squezuird.

40% of the float is shorted.

Its an electric Vehicle/Drone company, so innovative and new/Trendy.

Its an Ohio Small town Manufacturing Blue collar worker business.

This really is a peoples Company, at least until it becomes bigger.

They lost a government contract that everyone expected them to win, so thats why they are shorted. And they deserved that contract and are in court proceedings to win it back, so there is definitely long term value here too, along with it being innovative. It holds a ton of hold value of speculation. 

I'm no stock expert, no numbers guy. Shoot, the only number I know is that it has $200 million cash on hand, so its not in debt.

Seriously. This stock has so much shorts against it and such a small number of shares, any volume can make this skyrocket. But theres so many other fakes, wannabes, bots and spams, its hard to get above it.

Stick with AMC and GME, our Godfathers.

Even our own Subreddit, people agree, we don't want to distract from AMC or GME. We are the OG apes.

But people are going to diversify. And when they do, I woulds hope that the AMC and GME Apes support us as the best option outside of the ApeGod Stocks."

I agree, I do not want to distract from AMC or GME, but if you have a few extra bucks, you might want to check it out.  It is currently around $15 and could easily go back to $40 and IF we catch the Shorts well over $100.  I missed it, but The guys that caught the  rich asshole short's with GMC are my Hero's!  Best of luck, any profit is GOOD!"

Look at the market cap of Workshorse only 1.8 B, the short interest 62% currently, plus any big news drop anytime, why not to put a couple of thousand dollars try? I believe it will be a big bet and we will see in a few weeks what gonna happen. Hope all you guys make good money from stock market!"

I dont think a lot of these “apes” or shill bots on here circle jerking each other understand that. 

Workhorse doesnt even have the capacity to fill the contract. At best, it was always just workhorse getting a portion of the contract with other suppliers handling the bulk. This isnt some tiny ass contract. It’s f’n massive and you need a bigger player than workhorse to fill it in addition to the issues with ev and infrastructure

There some small % of cases where routes are over 100mi but that’s why congress is throwing 8bil+ at usps asking that at least 75% are EV. Wkhs is a great candidate for the EV portion
2021-06-18 09:20:51,wallstreetbets,"Exactly it’s where the smart money is. GME and AMC are yesterday’s news, it’s only remaining hyped because so many people in this thread are in DD and praying to break even lol."

2021-06-18 08:54:22,wallstreetbets,First seen. I really wasnt into stocks until GME happened. But I've browsed this subreddit since I very first joined. But valid point none the less. Still wouldnt take away the fact that someone else would have been newer though.

2021-06-18 07:56:17,wallstreetbets,"How is this post any different from the multitude of posts I just read from your profile?  It’s not your stock, so you shit on it?"
2021-06-18 15:04:46,wallstreetbets,"You are out of your mind if you think a 50-100 mile version would be sufficient.  Range statements on an EV are based off unloaded, no climate control and nice weather.  A 50-100 mile range vehicle with an extra 1000 pounds in it in the winter time will end up being a 20-40 mile range, and remember battery decay is real. So that range when new will only go down.  

Also you can't just slap in 40 chargers in one location without upgraded transformers, heavier wiring, new breakers.  It's a huge additional expense.

Power walls... Unless you are going to put one in for every vehicle, add cooling to the area and fire suppression for that much lithium.  It would not be practical. Will add millions to the cost, per post office.

That's why Oshkosh design is so superior, they are designed to be retrofitted when areas can get the infrastructure in place.  Oshkosh also has a proven record for delivery of custom vehicles for the government.  On budget, on time and meeting the exact specs"

""We are the OG apes."""
2021-06-18 15:16:45,wallstreetbets,"12 to 15 amps is all each vehicle would require to fully charge trucks the same size as are used to day.    1 x 400 amp service (as I just put on my house) could easily charge 53+ such vehicles over night.  They do not require the fast 15 minute 60 amp chargers like Tesla is installing across the Nation for travelers.   An 800 amp 3 phase panel which is about the size of 3 high school lockers could easily charge 200 such vehicles over night. The power is already there, in the high voltage wires.  they might need to change out the transformer for a larger one, cost $5k at the most, Panel about the same.    All each vehicle would need is a standard 110v 15amp plug.

USPS: May 18, 2021 · Average Curbside Delivery Route: Number of stops: 500; Distance: 20.8 miles; Speed: 13.6 mph; Route time: 6 hrs Time spent driving: 1 hr 30 min (25% of the time) Average drive between stops: 11 sec; Time spent stopped: 3 hrs 50 min (64% of the time) Average stop between drives: 27 sec; Time on break: 40 min (11% of the time)"

2021-06-18 15:25:51,wallstreetbets,"Average lvl 2 charger requires 30-40 amps so you are looking 10 vehicles.  Not 50 especially as you never want to push your amp load to it's maximum.

Also you are ignoring the rest of the power consumption of the building.  Postal facilities are operating when these vehicles would be charging.  So upgrades will definitely be required, and significantly more than additional 400 amp service."
2021-06-18 08:58:17,wallstreetbets,It’s the “focus on GME and AMC” that gives me *bad* vibes
2021-06-18 16:27:54,wallstreetbets,"The difference is the charge time.  A 400 amp single phaze panel can havdle 800 amps of breakers.  The slower the charge the less strain on the batteries and the longer they  will last.  This is why Solar is the best way to charge batteries.   These vehicles are on the road usually around 6 hours a day.  They would easily charge with a 15amp service and it would be better for the batteries.  A 60 amp 220 volt charger (like Tesla) gets 37 miles per hour of charge.   it would take a 15 amp 110v charger 8 hours to produce the same amount of charge.   Ave postal vehicle traveles 21 miles per day and is parked 16 to 18 hours a day.  They would be parked and charging mostly after hours when the office is closed.  It is all in the engineering.   Time on the road and available charging time make a HUGE difference.  There are several ways to do it.  Solar carports with power walls, would be the neatest way to go, much more upfront cost, but they cold run the post office by day and charge the vehicles at night."
2021-06-18 09:01:53,wallstreetbets,"I mean I hate to be technical, but I did use the word ""Stick"" which would imply possession already more than the word ""Focus"". Even then, I think its petty.

2021-06-18 19:32:04,wallstreetbets,"During his interview with Jim Cramer, the CEO of CLNE while speaking about the Amazon deal said “I have to be a little careful about giving too much detail, because Amazon wants to control that.” Then goes on to talk about what they’re providing Amazon with (fueling stations and such). IMO I interpreted that as, Amazon is going to announce something having to do with their fleet being CLNE RNG powered. Think about this, under the terms of the deal Amazon was given the opportunity to buy 20% of the company (at 13.49$ a share) under the condition that Amazon spend 500 MILLION dollars first on CLNE fuel before taking control of that 20%. Do you think Amazon is incentivized to acquire 20% of CLNE after spending 500 MILLION? What about once they get that 20%? Think Amazon now has even more incentive to see CLNE succeed? IMO this (genius) deal CLNE was able to negotiate with Amazon tells me one thing, Amazon saw the potential of CLNE and bet 500 MILLION on it. I don’t know about you guys, but as soon as the casino opens on Monday I’m betting on CLNE even more. Do your DD but nothing I’ve seen thus far tells me this isn’t a great company at an incredible price."

2021-06-18 07:28:18,wallstreetbets,"CLNE typically gaps up pre-market. However, I believe that is simply a strategy to pay off the shareholders. Bring it up in low volume, sell off at open, and step down the bid and fade throughout the day. Enough days of this and people start to see a pattern, making it a self-sustaining phenomenon. On one hand I would expect bigger movement pre-market, and on the other hand it would probably be a bad sign."
2021-06-18 08:28:06,wallstreetbets,where can I buy a lambo that makes the moo sound when honking?

2021-06-18 09:02:18,wallstreetbets,"Repost of u/TMoney127 DD for CLNE nine days ago:

The stock is currently trading around $10 because IB wants to keep it under $13 for the time being. I'm sure you guys have read the gamma squeeze potential coming up on 6/18 so I'm not going to go too deep into that. Basically if $CLNE hits $13 by June 18th, over 1.86 million shares become in the money for calls. And another 400,000 shares at 12, and 280,000 at 11, and 390,000 at 10. The 5 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Clean Energy Fuels Corp have a median target of 20.00, with a high estimate of 27.00 and a low estimate of 11.00

Source

It's a company that's easily worth at least double what it's trading at right now but because of the small float it's pretty easy to manipulate. The IB's are fighting like hell to keep the price at 12.99 or lower which can be seen even in last week's last trading days where out of the total volume on Friday, 32% have have been sold short and it's an increase from Thursday where only 8% of the volume was sold short. That kept that spike from $9 to $11 from getting out of control for them.

The Play?

Shares. The small float means that shares can increase the price substantially causing IV to get bigger and makes the setup for the gamma squeeze that much more likely. And even if you don't play the squeeze at all, this company is still a no brainer in terms of being undervalued currently 

TL;DR: Cow farts go BRRRRRRR. Super undervalued company that has great potential in the future and actually has the fundamentals to support it.

It's almost as though somebody with more capital than you set up sell walls at 59.50 and 59.98 at the end of the day for no reason other than to screw you.  I can only imagine what kind of villain would do such a thing.  I bet he's really handsome and funny if nothing else.  But still, to be only TWO CENTS from your event.  That's gotta just be a gut punch.

And after you spent all day in a coordinated misinformation campaign to claim anyone in a more popular ticker was working for citadel, that there was no DD, and other general brigading including coordinated downvoting and harassment.  That's got to be so frustrating.

2021-06-18 15:37:48,wallstreetbets,Am I reading the volume on CLNE correctly? Seems huge for not a lot happening... almost 800% increase from their average. I'm new to this one.
2021-06-18 16:06:14,wallstreetbets,"CLNE should go up next week. Some of the volume today especially toward close was MM undoing their delta hedge on the outsized option volume at $13. The shares held to hedge $12 probably still need to be sold, maybe AH. Shares and July options on Monday should keep this thing moving. And, if not, it's still an undervalued, fairly low risk longer term play."

I don't think I like this split daily thread thing. There should only be one GME or top focus stock thread, and everything else back in the Daily thread, imo. That way we can all judge better what's hot and not every day, and get better participation on key plays. It's also less effort/less switching if you are following multiple plays in the same day. 

What do u think, monkeys? Maybe we should ask mods to switch back to previous daily thread approach. 🤔"

I’m sad ape and retarded theta scared piss out of me + pre market :/.

Long story short, if I join back in next pay check, no more weekly calls , months ahead. And probably no more bag holding to the point theta rips everything. Got calls when stock was $58 and at $62 4 days later call was still down 60% fuck that bullshit doesn’t even make sense"

These HF guys are not dumb.  If they haven't already hedged all of their lost positions, they'd be out of the job by now.  Which is why I don't think a short squeeze would ever happen tbh.  YT content creators get their daily views pumping out hype videos everyday, WSB pump and dumpers make their quick profits, and the other retarded retailers are just left holding the bag wondering when that ""squeeze"" will ever come.  I'm beginning to think this is just all hype train and there's never going to actually be any squeeze.   I mean, it's like we're playing poker with our cards facing up hoping for a miracle.  Am I wrong here?"

2021-06-18 18:18:39,wallstreetbets,One big difference between GME/AMC gains and BB gains is that no one has any positive memories about Blackberry. There’s not as much nostalgia-driven investing for failed phone companies that pivoted to cybersecurity and IoT.

115 Million Float, 14th the size of AMC, making it 75% easier to squizerd

52% of the float os shorted, more than double AMC, thus making its ceiling much more higher.

With a nasty crash all of August and beginning of September down to 380-400-350

The build homes. Everyone thought they would suck because lumber prices are through the roof, but their earnings call proved that wrong. Their margins actually went *up*.

2021-06-18 15:33:56,wallstreetbets,Guhhhhhh. Theyre too busy circle jerking in theaters to the thought of adam aron without pants on.
2021-06-18 15:32:17,wallstreetbets,We should have listened to you when you said apes didn't have the attention span for it.  The best possible setup and perfect timing with the Cramer pump.  The ball still was dropped.

2021-06-18 10:59:26,wallstreetbets,Exactly. It needs to close above 13.
2021-06-18 11:01:09,wallstreetbets,Basically if it ends option expiry over 13 they'll have to cover for the huge amount of calls at that price. Meaning they'll have to buy millions of shares at whatever price we sell it to them. Sending it to space. Hell they'll already have to cover for 11 and 12 so we'll already see a huge spike come monday. So it's already in orbit right now. But for that last booster we need 13.
2021-06-18 11:31:04,wallstreetbets,It's honest work. Every bit counts

Although with all the good news about it lately, especially with the CEO showing that he is on our side and hitting a home run on mad money last night I don't think investing in it is a bad move at all.

2021-06-18 17:40:36,wallstreetbets,I sorta get what you saying. But the stock kmgas kept going up through the weeks so your message is kinda cringy. Like you have some weird animosity towards amc stockholders or something lol

2021-06-18 16:41:47,wallstreetbets,"I lost some money on calls today too, but shares finished green overall for the week. Can’t be mad about that. Just grab some leaps and you will be happy. The Jan ‘22 calls look nice, I added a few yesterday"
2021-06-18 16:36:57,wallstreetbets,Make it 2 and you’ll prob be happy
2021-06-18 18:21:31,wallstreetbets,June 23 and 24
2021-06-18 18:54:57,wallstreetbets,are they fr 😳?
2021-06-18 09:09:47,wallstreetbets,100 is an actual easy goal to meet.
2021-06-18 09:09:55,wallstreetbets,Absolutely. Not a meme.
2021-06-18 14:37:55,wallstreetbets,It's a gift for those not aboard yet... 🚀
2021-06-18 16:27:27,wallstreetbets,"CLNE still has AH to hit its target.  


And the underlying thesis is SOLID."
2021-06-18 16:28:57,wallstreetbets,"The setup was nice today, hell the setup was nice last week. Ownership didn’t help the cause by selling a late portion of shares last week. Im in under $10 so hopefully it can squeeze before I get too bored and walk away with lil gains"
2021-06-18 16:49:19,wallstreetbets,I love CLNE but I think attacking other stocks/blame game is just as bad as what the GME cultists are doing. CLNE was a good play and is a good company. There just wasn’t really a simple squeeze on the menu. Call options made it do-able but the smartest play with CLNE and even stated in all the quality DD was to go shares/ITM calls because it’s an undervalued play with some catalysts.
2021-06-18 13:19:25,wallstreetbets,GME clowns the type of people to find $20 in a parking lot and keep going back every day to the same spot to see if there’s more
2021-06-18 13:20:03,wallstreetbets,That's called pumping.
2021-06-18 10:01:13,wallstreetbets,You can never go wrong with some good $CLNE fun  with cow farts
2021-06-18 12:02:02,wallstreetbets,I've put in sweep orders significantly larger than that and haven't moved it that high.  150K is basically....12000 shares?  You'll move it 3 or 4 cents.  There's a lot of volume in here today.
2021-06-18 12:01:59,wallstreetbets,So i shouldnt drop 50k right now into CLNE shares....
2021-06-18 12:01:48,wallstreetbets,It would help. I saw 10 Mios dropped yesterday and it pushed the price up about $0.50
2021-06-18 12:02:19,wallstreetbets,"I have no idea, but the more we buy, the more scared they get. CLNE TO THE MOON."
2021-06-18 12:19:23,wallstreetbets,"Exercise, thats a steal, free money."
2021-06-18 12:20:03,wallstreetbets,just do a little math with your expectations. exercising isnt looking like a bad choice with CLNE
2021-06-18 13:01:55,wallstreetbets,Sit tight
2021-06-18 13:02:13,wallstreetbets,Hold for a few hours imo
2021-06-18 13:52:03,wallstreetbets,You're fine... rope-a-dope and come out swinging. 💪🌙🚀
2021-06-18 14:31:57,wallstreetbets,Gamma squeeze has been the goal. Above 12 is good. Above 13 and it has to run.
2021-06-18 14:35:11,wallstreetbets,"There's a huge number of CLNE options that expire today, between $11-13.

If the share price beats $13 today, a ton of shares will have to be bought to cover those options, which will increase the price even more."
2021-06-18 14:53:17,wallstreetbets,Just bought $2200 wort at $12.69
2021-06-18 14:52:11,wallstreetbets,I did as well
2021-06-18 14:58:54,wallstreetbets,Same add more BB
2021-06-18 11:38:09,wallstreetbets,"There's already so much DD on this stock man. Basically, it's set up for a gamma squeeze if the stock can hold over $13 today."
2021-06-18 11:38:56,wallstreetbets,"They have a deal with Amazon, if it hits $13 it has major squeeze potential, they are in a very necessary and huge market; if we wanna ya know keep the planet habitable for human beings."
2021-06-18 11:37:22,wallstreetbets,Gamma squeeze at 13
2021-06-18 12:50:25,wallstreetbets,200.000 shares sold short.
2021-06-18 12:33:10,wallstreetbets,I’m in!!!
2021-06-18 14:56:43,wallstreetbets,"Except for CLNE, it's up 5.67%"
2021-06-18 09:57:59,wallstreetbets,"Reverse psychology. He wants us to drop out, because it is about to explode hard. Not today old man!"

2021-06-18 11:22:18,wallstreetbets,You mean me squeezing my hair and pulling them out atm?
2021-06-18 11:29:00,wallstreetbets,how about CLNE instead
2021-06-18 12:45:16,wallstreetbets,Hold the line
2021-06-18 12:47:05,wallstreetbets,Why would you sell just to break even on a bullish stock?
2021-06-18 12:46:26,wallstreetbets,if we get to 13 we go moon
2021-06-18 07:23:07,wallstreetbets,Part of the 4% easy. But I don’t know where you got that number. BB was $8 a month ago and seemed like a good bit of people were buying in that price
2021-06-18 10:07:30,wallstreetbets,Or the talking heads in literally investment groups/funds speaking on major news channels? Yeah seems totally legit to have opinions and recommendations coming from vested interests in said recommendations
2021-06-18 10:47:40,wallstreetbets,It’s the right horse just not right this second!
2021-06-18 15:32:26,wallstreetbets,The 🚀 decided to let more aboard prior to liftoff... did you get on?
2021-06-18 17:01:50,wallstreetbets,My CLNE stocks are currently green and all my other holdings are red.
2021-06-18 13:26:07,wallstreetbets,You'll be alright. It'll come back up again.
2021-06-18 13:26:49,wallstreetbets,It's a good long-term hold if you can wait it out.
2021-06-18 14:53:58,wallstreetbets,"Average down 🥴 

NFA"
2021-06-18 16:04:49,wallstreetbets,"We can baghold together, just don't let your bags touch my bags."
2021-06-18 16:05:39,wallstreetbets,You and me both brother imma go enjoy the weekend to forget about the calls and hope for the best for my longs for next week
2021-06-18 16:43:58,wallstreetbets,Nrdrage literally live posted in this thread while he set up a wall lol
2021-06-18 13:06:30,wallstreetbets,Same boat here. I averaged down again just now with another 500 shares. Really hoping for 20+ soon. Perhaps an earnings surprise could help reignite it.
2021-06-18 13:04:33,wallstreetbets,Sounds about right
2021-06-18 15:42:02,wallstreetbets,Don’t fall off
2021-06-18 12:24:29,wallstreetbets,Waiting for it to go 69

2021-06-18 11:37:49,wallstreetbets,Should do what you should do what you think is best. No one can tell you to take profits or not.
2021-06-18 13:28:15,wallstreetbets,Gonna watch it explode to 15 on monday when they have to cover those 11 and 12 calls. It's way too late to ever drop to 11.
2021-06-18 19:41:32,wallstreetbets,CLNE baby

2021-06-18 15:40:51,wallstreetbets,All the options got sold out from under people. They can't start pumping it again to play the same trick next week.
2021-06-18 09:35:01,wallstreetbets,Yeah that reverse repo.  755 billion in tbonds to cover their books.  Next week is gonna boosty AMC hold tight fellow apes real potential to break 70 next week

2021-06-18 13:20:37,wallstreetbets,"Earning next week, it will go back up next week boss"
2021-06-18 08:42:14,wallstreetbets,Also CLNE
2021-06-18 13:31:32,wallstreetbets,Gross. No thank you
2021-06-18 15:11:40,wallstreetbets,why not just buy shares ..
2021-06-18 15:13:49,wallstreetbets,"Stupid unless you bought shares, because no buying pressure = no stock price rise = worthless calls"
2021-06-18 15:36:43,wallstreetbets,"CLNE was a short attack, AMC was just you guys attacking each other."
2021-06-18 15:37:01,wallstreetbets,I like you sir
2021-06-18 14:02:48,wallstreetbets,"Dumb money right here. If she closes at $13, the tendie man comes next week for the gamma will be triggered"
2021-06-18 14:01:43,wallstreetbets,Once it hits 13 then you can retire Monday
2021-06-18 14:44:22,wallstreetbets,"I keep hearing Amazon and 13.50, I must have missed something?"
2021-06-18 15:39:36,wallstreetbets,It doesn’t need to in order to secure profit. 13.01 is just the gamma price point. The stock is undervalued and easily will be profitable in the near future.
2021-06-18 11:01:22,wallstreetbets,Yeah that’s why I sold bb and put it into amc
2021-06-18 13:05:23,wallstreetbets,Good time to cut losses and get in CLNE
2021-06-18 13:06:07,wallstreetbets,"after I sell my CLNE options for a hefty profit, i plan on buying more BB on sale next week"
2021-06-18 18:17:48,wallstreetbets,🙋‍♂️
2021-06-18 14:43:09,wallstreetbets,Biggest problem is folks who buy shares with money they need in 5-6 days so they hop in and out.
2021-06-18 15:21:27,wallstreetbets,No. There is no focusing going on in the subreddit SEC
2021-06-18 13:35:46,wallstreetbets,Might be turning around finally.
2021-06-18 08:43:33,wallstreetbets,"There are only like 2 -3 real movies out .

Next week market will rebound from this week’s fed and what not and things will be up.

2021-06-18 10:53:21,wallstreetbets,"Not I, said the duck."
2021-06-18 12:55:19,wallstreetbets,Lol that's when you hold and wait for it to gap up Monday when the MMs have to cover the calls.
2021-06-18 06:15:29,wallstreetbets,The fucking moon!
2021-06-18 13:01:37,wallstreetbets,I am all in on CLNE but we must support our fellow apes.  AMC 🚀💦🌑
2021-06-18 08:38:07,wallstreetbets,"It's old news, man. Not relevant atm."
2021-06-18 08:51:55,wallstreetbets,Because  it’s about to go to do a GME and fly to the moon.
2021-06-18 08:52:17,wallstreetbets,Counterpoint: People (me) were saying the same thing at $25.
2021-06-18 15:42:27,wallstreetbets,You posting from a different dimension?
2021-06-18 07:49:25,wallstreetbets,"I own both and really haven’t seen the hate flowing in that direction. I do think most people think the top is close at hand for AMC, while other lower priced stocks have the potential to squeeze and create more profit. Just my take. Make no mistake AMC 300M volume, CLNE 30M. BB 35M. Clearly AMC has the apes 🦍s attention, but if either of the other two got half the traffic, they could pop."
2021-06-18 15:18:06,wallstreetbets,"Gamma unlikely, holding because I paid less than Bezos and know it’s obviously going to go up sooner than later."
2021-06-18 15:18:05,wallstreetbets,Let's make it bk to 12$ EOD guys!
2021-06-18 09:17:02,wallstreetbets,"Actually, it is the right time. It is a buy and hold situation, if it gets to 13 today, big gains next week. If not be patient, it should keep going up over the next several weeks. This one requires patience."
2021-06-18 15:27:30,wallstreetbets,"They cover end of day so they can unleash it all next time AMC apes drive it high, profiting from the difference in prices."
2021-06-18 16:09:48,wallstreetbets,And sued to shit
2021-06-18 16:45:57,wallstreetbets,"whoa is me... i gambled and it didnt pay off.  its all rigged

jesus, you all so entitled you think your low effort gamble should be guaranteed... welcome to the casino bud, sometimes it does land on red."

2021-06-18 07:05:22,wallstreetbets,"The fuck, this is PM, sir, and look how quickly people sucked up that dip a few minutes ago."
2021-06-18 13:57:25,wallstreetbets,"Too logical 

$CLNE LFG 🚀🚀"
2021-06-18 14:01:52,wallstreetbets,"Ah yes lets give up our float, and let the shorts buy out of their positions so we can chase and hope CLNE squeezes, when we’ve already done our DD, and have been holding for months! Genius idea"
2021-06-18 13:57:33,wallstreetbets,not if it fucks up your cost basis
2021-06-18 11:32:41,wallstreetbets,But CLNE is a solid company
2021-06-18 11:37:37,wallstreetbets,Not about shorts (even tho they doubled from 8 to 19% this week). Gamma Squeeze setup. Catalyst is today.
2021-06-18 10:47:00,wallstreetbets,It never closes high enough because short sellers. There are 21k calls at $12 and 36k at $13 if those print it makes the options sellers need to buy more shares to cover.
2021-06-18 14:31:43,wallstreetbets,Not tofuckingday
2021-06-18 08:04:13,wallstreetbets,"Because there is still one week until the expiration. And in one week, AMC can be either at 100 or 10."
2021-06-18 10:43:53,wallstreetbets,Clne LEAPS gang rise up
2021-06-18 12:17:39,wallstreetbets,Rotate to CLNE
2021-06-18 12:18:25,wallstreetbets,Make it up on CLNE. This thing is about to go parabolic.
2021-06-18 12:17:54,wallstreetbets,"Could be worse, down 96% and 91% on my 6/18 UWMC $10 and $11 calls. At least you have shares and can hold until it bounces back"
2021-06-18 12:19:58,wallstreetbets,Always better to hold shares
2021-06-18 12:23:12,wallstreetbets,Same but I'm holding itll come back around
2021-06-18 15:00:00,wallstreetbets,Ohh in 10 years you'll have exactly 40k
2021-06-18 11:05:01,wallstreetbets,That stock has always been shit. Even as a SPAC. It was one of the few SPACs to not even pump and lose value
2021-06-18 15:15:58,wallstreetbets,Da fuck is MT
2021-06-18 15:36:19,wallstreetbets,That's actually pretty cool that CLNE is the only stock listed on that portfolio that's green today. That in and of itself is a big win
2021-06-18 15:36:14,wallstreetbets,If they don’t know now they know 🚀🚀
2021-06-18 16:03:00,wallstreetbets,Good ideas. Almost sold a 75 as well but decided to wait til Monday

2021-06-18 16:12:44,wallstreetbets,"I think you can be a bull for AMC if the price is $2, because then you could win big on the recovery to $10, maybe $16 if you're lucky.

But if you're bullish for AMC at $59, I dunno what to say about your 3rd chromosome"
2021-06-18 16:05:34,wallstreetbets,I like movies and popcorn.

2021-06-18 15:28:39,wallstreetbets,What is sell?
2021-06-18 16:14:56,wallstreetbets,It does help opening price. Also you're acting like they're really losing out on money. It could open monday higher than an after-hours price still 🤷‍♂️.

2021-06-18 10:50:31,wallstreetbets,Biggest tip I can give you. Don't listen to a fucking thing the people say here. If you really want to learn go read some Investopedia articles on how stocks are valued. Literally all you will get here anymore is just group think.
2021-06-18 10:49:56,wallstreetbets,Don’t want to be a dick but there’s an infinite amount if info on all of this on YouTube

It had way more upvotes before that brigade. I’m all for GME holders and want them to make money, but not if every person holding makes it their personal mission to shit on and downvote every comment/thread that isn’t about it."

2021-06-18 14:35:40,wallstreetbets,Everyone in GME already knows we don't need to spam the ticker and hope it goes up. It's already established and everyone is holding
2021-06-18 14:36:41,wallstreetbets,GME will be the black sheep until they announce that they’ve completed their offering.

2021-06-18 13:36:02,wallstreetbets,If only your parents gave you the same attention you're giving CLNE
2021-06-18 13:31:39,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-18 13:30:39,wallstreetbets,Hmm. Checks your karma vs mine…yea I must be the bot here.
2021-06-18 13:30:59,wallstreetbets,"Pump and dump!

wants you to buy AMC at 60 dollars tho telli g you that it will definetly squeeze!"
2021-06-18 13:30:45,wallstreetbets,Says the AMC shill
2021-06-18 18:24:33,wallstreetbets,I love how all you dumbass dudes from AMC are hating on other people trying to make a play
2021-06-18 17:59:36,wallstreetbets,"Been holding since April, still green"
2021-06-18 18:12:39,wallstreetbets,Still green here too and made a shit load of cash scalping along the way.
2021-06-18 18:06:03,wallstreetbets,You are actually retarded.
2021-06-18 11:20:29,wallstreetbets,if we knew that we'd all be rich.  don't feel bad about taking profit
2021-06-18 11:26:21,wallstreetbets,"if you haven't taken profits yet, now is definitely the time imo."
2021-06-18 16:34:42,wallstreetbets,My account is 4 years old and I post constantly what kind of horrible bot could I be
2021-06-18 16:47:44,wallstreetbets,CLNE is a great play. You’re just salty it got more attention then any of your plays. Enjoy the circle jerk at Wendy’s tonight
2021-06-18 16:33:10,wallstreetbets,"I mean, I believe in the long term thesis 100%  


and still see a chance for a very profitable gamma squeeze for everyone in the trade if AH trading hits 12 and especially 13.  


I'm still trying to understand why anyone wants to sit on the sidelines on this one"
2021-06-18 16:29:42,wallstreetbets,"You could literally say the same shit about GME, BB, NOK, CLOV, AMC, and WISH. 

Stfu"
2021-06-18 16:31:08,wallstreetbets,"Yeah man big foot is real and UFO are flying above all our heads in stealth mode, colluding with the Illuminati......."
2021-06-18 07:40:31,wallstreetbets,"Monday - CLNE
Tuesday - CLNE
Wednesday - CLNE
Thursday - CLNE
Friday - CLNE
Saturday - buy lambo with CLNE tendies
Sunday - sit in lambo and decide how much more CLNe to buy Monday."
2021-06-18 07:36:58,wallstreetbets,Ban
2021-06-18 07:41:39,wallstreetbets,pst...that's illigal
2021-06-18 09:55:51,wallstreetbets,"I believe the downvotes you are receiving stem from the fact that this is a popular tickers thread, in which CLOV is not included."
2021-06-18 12:46:30,wallstreetbets,Clne isn't a fucking pump and dump its a legitimately growing company
2021-06-18 12:45:42,wallstreetbets,"What? Amazon determined CLNE fair value to be 13.48.

If it spikes to 20, yeah gtfo FOR SURE. But anything below Amazon's warrant price is definitely not a PnD"
2021-06-18 12:43:47,wallstreetbets,Your mom was a pump and dump.
2021-06-18 12:43:40,wallstreetbets,You're retarded
2021-06-18 12:44:11,wallstreetbets,Lmao. You are a special kind of window licker aren’t you?
2021-06-18 12:36:48,wallstreetbets,Rotation into CLNE
2021-06-18 14:08:52,wallstreetbets,I ain’t a bot
2021-06-18 14:08:58,wallstreetbets,Mama didn’t raise no bot.

2021-06-18 16:00:02,wallstreetbets,btfd. BB thesis is sound
2021-06-18 16:01:23,wallstreetbets,Bb still isn't close to what i sold for at its highest LOL
2021-06-18 17:30:54,wallstreetbets,"Only green stock? Despite not hitting 13, CLNE ended comfortably green today"
2021-06-18 07:37:46,wallstreetbets,"Sometimes she goes, sometimes she doesn't go.  She went"
2021-06-18 08:25:52,wallstreetbets,It just dropped last month relatively low volume so far
2021-06-18 10:18:35,wallstreetbets,Get out

2021-06-18 14:18:45,wallstreetbets,That’s retarded and not in a good way..
2021-06-18 14:21:26,wallstreetbets,"Lol and I never bought it 
Ain’t regretting"
2021-06-18 14:20:19,wallstreetbets,Did you eat paint chips as a teenager?
2021-06-18 14:21:34,wallstreetbets,Imagine calling others dumb for investing in a company with good fundamentals just to shill a fucking movie theatre lmao
2021-06-18 14:24:47,wallstreetbets,I would rather go dwon to a dollar with CLNE then be part of your insane cult and confirmation bias.
2021-06-18 14:20:36,wallstreetbets,I mean.. AMC is red for the day..
2021-06-18 12:02:39,wallstreetbets,You are bigly wrong.
2021-06-18 08:21:20,wallstreetbets,Your probably wrong
2021-06-18 08:23:08,wallstreetbets,Where’d you get any of this from? “I’m a newbie here’s my highly specific market forecast for the next few months”. Lol ok
2021-06-18 12:07:43,wallstreetbets,Spam. Mods cmon
2021-06-18 10:37:40,wallstreetbets,It's Friday which means the people selling calls want it to dip. Monday is going to be huge backlash! Im saving 5k for end of day. If it's red I'm all in
2021-06-18 10:35:30,wallstreetbets,Knowing clne it 100% will dive this next hour. I hope im wrong
2021-06-18 10:35:56,wallstreetbets,"maybe not red, but it will most likely trade down towards end of day."
2021-06-18 12:51:43,wallstreetbets,They sure as hell aren't in this thread
2021-06-18 12:53:45,wallstreetbets,They are standing in the welfare line
2021-06-18 12:52:39,wallstreetbets,You're in the wrong thread.

2021-06-18 11:44:02,wallstreetbets,How dare you
2021-06-18 11:48:51,wallstreetbets,"Fuck outta here, we focused on 2 things today. AMC and CLNE. That’s IT."
2021-06-18 13:14:35,wallstreetbets,Bad ape spirit
2021-06-18 13:17:13,wallstreetbets,"AMC is great, but not everything else is a distraction. CLNE is great too. In fact I’m half and half in both"
2021-06-18 13:46:12,wallstreetbets,Last I checked I don’t work for them
2021-06-18 13:46:35,wallstreetbets,Did you use a palm sander to get your brain that smooth?
2021-06-18 13:48:30,wallstreetbets,Shitadel is shorting them you goofball. They own like 7 shares
2021-06-18 13:49:45,wallstreetbets,True retard right there boys. 🤡
2021-06-18 15:43:11,wallstreetbets,"They have the option to buy those shares through 2032. Again, this is a great long term play. 

Not investment advise, do your own DD."
2021-06-18 15:43:10,wallstreetbets,My understanding is Amazon's option to buys shares at 13 and what happened today with people's options have no relationship. Amazon can buy shares at 13 sometime in the future. I'm not 100% positive about that.
2021-06-18 15:42:44,wallstreetbets,Amazon will go out of business.
2021-06-18 15:42:15,wallstreetbets,"It will, it just doesn't have to be by this Friday"
2021-06-18 15:48:01,wallstreetbets,Amazon doesnt care about today. They just need it to go above 13.50 at some point (we dont know when). The 13 price point today was necessary to trigger a gamma squeeze from hedge funds betting too much on CLNE going down this month.
2021-06-18 13:23:42,wallstreetbets,Wrong thread
2021-06-18 10:33:50,wallstreetbets,Bro what…

2021-06-18 16:02:45,wallstreetbets,That means it has barely gone that red dipshit lol
2021-06-18 16:07:16,wallstreetbets,Imagine being this pissy and impatient over a green day while a stock is still mid-consolidation and barely dropping price at all
2021-06-18 16:33:42,wallstreetbets,"I dont. CLNE is up 6% while the whole market is down. And the stock I pulled out of to buy CLNE tanked, so I dodged a bullet there."
2021-06-18 19:40:50,wallstreetbets,"Very own*

Fucktard"
2021-06-18 19:34:56,wallstreetbets,Having a flair on WSB is like winning a gold medal at the special Olympics. Congrats but you’re still a retard

2021-06-18 11:54:18,wallstreetbets,never fold
2021-06-18 11:53:54,wallstreetbets,should have invested in CLNE
2021-06-18 11:56:09,wallstreetbets,Your decision.
2021-06-18 08:50:00,wallstreetbets,So I heard about these margin calls 🤔

2021-06-18 15:58:50,wallstreetbets,"Aren’t you too late for Friday fud shit ?
Go back to your hole you crept out of"
2021-06-18 15:33:49,wallstreetbets,"Meanwhile, I see Raisinets has shit the bed with a 5% drop.  I'm sure those imaginary shorts are going to spend their weekend in Cape Cod completely quivering in their deck shoes at the financial savvy :P.  Why, I bet they'll hardly be able to concentrate on their badminton game."
2021-06-18 15:38:54,wallstreetbets,"It'll go up next week.  It'll probably melt up for most of the rest of the year from here.  Every share I have I'm transferring to long term managed assets and adding to my dragon hoard of gold.  Today was the day that could have really created something unusual, though. The manipulators got away with their 2 month siege.  Sad.  I figured even if 13 didn't happen, enough OI had been created at 12 to where it still would have created pain for them, but they're not even gonna have to pay out on that.  And, looking at the volume and tape, it doesn't look like they even really had to try."
2021-06-18 15:32:57,wallstreetbets,Why should he? He won't be able to move it above the magic threshold from here.

2021-06-18 18:10:25,wallstreetbets,"Good idea. Hell, they wouldn't even need RNG if they could tap into that shit."
2021-06-18 18:18:14,wallstreetbets,"He set up sell walls to stop the price from reaching sixty, partly because he's sick of what has become of the AMC play, and partly because the AMC folks were actively spreading misinformation about how CLNE was really owned by Citadel, and all the people in that play are shills, etc.

The dude wrote all the original DDs for the tickers in this thread, so it's preposterous to think CLNE was a pump and dump or shill play, but that's the narrative the AMC folks were pushing all day, so keeping it from hitting sixty was not so subtle fuck you to them."
2021-06-18 17:57:55,wallstreetbets,"> Like you have some weird animosity towards amc stockholders or something lol

likely does. Because this dude was active when WSB was 1.5 million people, and had actually clever people. Now its full of actually full blown retards"
2021-06-18 17:45:13,wallstreetbets,"It really is cringe. Im not invested in it for various reasons but many of the people hes talking to are up 300%+ this month lmao. Like yeah, that really is rough"

2021-06-18 14:35:49,wallstreetbets,Not only this but the fundamentals of the company as well as deals with blue chips like Amazon pave the way for the stock to be valued in AT LEAST the $20s/share if not sooner then DEFINITELY later. Do your DD and you won’t be disappointed.

2021-06-18 13:15:23,wallstreetbets,YOU ARE SELLING COVERED CALLS TO EACH OTHER BUT THINK IT WILL BE A GAMMA SQUEEZE
2021-06-18 15:41:08,wallstreetbets,You are correct. CLNE was the play. Hence the ill show you mine if you show me yours.
2021-06-18 16:50:30,wallstreetbets,Ok. Thanks jay
2021-06-18 08:28:11,wallstreetbets,Ya I guess this is my first account aye bro. Good luck bagholding while rational men take profits for themselves.
2021-06-18 10:04:35,wallstreetbets,"I did, can we have a do-over, just to 40$ and I will throw 50k at it? Please"
2021-06-18 10:44:55,wallstreetbets,I mean the 13$ clne calls expire today. Why not jump on this one today. Then work on something else the end of next week. We have like 6 different stocks. That’s why they’re all red… you’re right tho 😂
2021-06-18 11:02:52,wallstreetbets,I didn't get in at all. But I'd never put 20k to a dying company

2021-06-18 15:10:24,wallstreetbets,Or they buy the stock to screw over a bunch of retards and pump it on here and downvote any other opinion. Do u really think they are looking at these stocks as good investments when they are fucked.
2021-06-18 15:48:42,wallstreetbets,What else would you recommend?
2021-06-18 17:41:43,wallstreetbets,His bag is too heavy from fucking himself on AMC and BB

2021-06-18 07:30:10,wallstreetbets,I will hold GME to the end
2021-06-18 11:24:21,wallstreetbets,Don’t worry when CLOV was here CLNE posted a thousand times a minute and I bought some to hold.  So
2021-06-18 18:43:15,wallstreetbets,"I’d be willing to go out on a ledge and say that there is far more nostalgia that has driven the GME movement than will ever exist for Blackberry, but I could be wrong. I do remember when Blackberry’s were far more popular, but I also remember them being ditched as soon as smart phones came along and they quickly became irrelevant because the company failed to adapt."
2021-06-18 18:48:51,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I remember being hesitant to switch to a touchscreen phone. I enjoyed the physical mini keyboard on the Blackberry because I could type without looking at the keyboard, like with a laptop. You can't do that with a touchscreen."
2021-06-18 19:16:43,wallstreetbets,Yup I thought owning a Blackberry would be cool when I was 13 too but then a year later before I ever got one Apple and Android phones murdered Blackberry and fucked its corpse. The first phone I got after my Razr was an iPhone
2021-06-18 18:54:44,wallstreetbets,"I also never owned a Blackberry and did most of my game shopping at GameStop for a long time.

2021-06-18 07:28:38,wallstreetbets,"What do you mean, GME went from $180 to $340 and back down to $220 in the last month how is that not having an account explosion"
2021-06-18 07:28:36,wallstreetbets,Its been 6 months man. I support it. But you cant say that WKHS doesnt have the potential for 100% but GME does when GME is $240 and WKHS is $14 and 50% shorted. AMC and GME arent the only stocks on the stock market that can give you 100% in the next two months. Thats just wrong.

2021-06-18 11:48:42,wallstreetbets,"So since AMC is largely owned by retail now and their only end game is to eat each other’s lunches, is there anyway to profit off of this or just not touch it with someone else’s dick?"

people bought GME and the price went down, because it got overshorted more

HFs still have the power to control it to a certain point, so it is not completely snowballing out of control, not even as much as AMC snowballed last month, but they can't bring GME down, it always hits a higher floor and with this floor higher potential"

2021-06-18 16:16:28,wallstreetbets,Oh no guess that negates the 50% gain in a month and a green day today because you don't have enough stake to get a good profit. 🤣 also the trading volume was double over average today. (just hush before you embarass yourself more...)

I have watched gains evaporate in an hour before on hard down days.

You remember that scene in Hunger Games at the beginning on the island when everyone has to decide what weapons and supplies to get... that is going to be the exit on AMC. Everyone is going to be looking out for themselves and it will end badly."

I guess the thing for me is idk who is more annoying amymore, the apes themselves or the people like nrdrage who are obsessed with talking down onto the apes. Its pretty annoying and kinda sad"
2021-06-18 19:41:53,wallstreetbets,"I've read your comment three times now and still don't see how you agreed with me.

&#x200B;

Your claim was the walls weren't a factor.  The very fact that some of the shares at 59.98 were sold indicates that they were a factor.  The candles bear that out.  Cramer talking crap at 10 am isn't anything."

Here’s one for you. What kind of financials do you think the majority of retail AMC investors have?  Do you think they can afford to be tied up in the float for any length of time?  Do you think they can afford to exercise their contracts?  You are really not very smart if you think it’s sustainable for retail to own that much of the float."

Looks like a big dip, but it could also be the start of a slide down to support at mid  $16 go low $17?

Thoughts on Puts/Shorts on SHOP. Seems to be really stretched right now. NVDA also seems to have short-term peaked."
2021-06-18 18:15:58,wallstreetbets,Great analogy
2021-06-18 19:09:30,wallstreetbets,Ahahah. Thats a perfect analogy. Definately gonna take my CLNE gains from today and the coming weeks and throw a good portion on puts. The only question is what date is it most likely to collapse? Im guessing 1 month out.
2021-06-18 19:07:23,wallstreetbets,"GME and AMC might be pumping on retard strength but the only gains theyre getting are from the less informed tards. 

Yes there were great gains from those who got in. And then small gains on option swings, but its done.

Its by far more annoying to see my feed full of nothing but willfully ignorant posts full of misinformation and cultish verbage. 

You cant censor ""bad"" speech. The only way to fight bad speech (coming from amc gme tards) is with ""good"" speech. The way to end this fantasy is through the exact speech and actions that folks like NrdRage displayed today."

PS:  I am a straw WOMAN."
2021-06-18 16:53:06,wallstreetbets,"Idk about rekt, because clearly you are. We are mocking you, and you are a noob with no experience and it shows lol. Thinks saying student debt is a insult when probably it's an excuses he tells himself for not getting a education, because you know. STudEnt DeBt. When in reality, no one would give him a student loan"
2021-06-18 17:45:26,wallstreetbets,"Ironically he just posted about it. I saw the 59.50, was unaware he set up another one right before close too 😂"
2021-06-18 16:13:01,wallstreetbets,I was making the point that AMC being magically suspended at 59 before close was obvious bullshit.  On your fucking side too genius.  Check the context and check the post history.  Fuck.
2021-06-18 15:22:01,wallstreetbets,"Yes you did your original post told people they should take money out of X stock, put it into XX, then if they wanted to buy back X. Your degree ain’t gonna get you far, strawman! Keep listening to fundamentalists u clown lmao btw #NotAPenny 🤡🤡"

2021-06-18 15:48:59,wallstreetbets,"When you see an extremely negative comment about the subreddit or anyone *not* talking about <memestock>, do yourself a favor and look in their post history.

More often than not they're coming from a single place that is increasingly growing comfortable with posting the links to single submissions with the intent of getting their users to come hassle us and try to convince us their stock is the way.

Do me a favor and report that when you see it. It's against the site rules and fucking annoying because random submissions turn into hostile territory and are decidedly *not* wallstreetbets anymore."

“Red leather, yellow leather, red leather, yellow leather...”

“5 seconds”

Jim ducked under his desk one last time, reached into his pocket and produced a soft white sock with the name “Yellen” embroidered on it in pink silk. 

He takes one last deep sniff from his “little helper”, emerges from his desk and stares directly into the camera lens. 

“It’s showtime.”"

*Jules: That's how SPY puts work?*

*Vincent: Breaks down like this, okay: it's legal to buy it, it's legal to own it, and if you're the proprietor of a SPY put, it's legal to sell it. It's illegal to buy it without money you don't have, but that doesn't really matter 'cause, get a load of this, all right; if you get stopped by Robinhood after you get margin called, they can't just take the money from you if you have it in another account.*

2021-06-18 10:20:59,wallstreetbets,"The Dow fell 1% on Friday after Federal Reserve official James Bullard said inflation was stronger than anticipated and it would take the central bank several meetings to figure out how to pare back stimulus.  
  
The blue-chip Dow and the benchmark S&P 500 were set for their worst day in a month after Bullard, president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve, said he was among the seven officials who saw rate increases beginning next year to contain inflation.  
  
The CBOE volatility index, Wall Street's fear gauge, spiked to 20.60 points, its highest level since May 21 following his comments.  
  
""The commentary has sparked concerns about inflation and people are questioning how transitory it will actually be, with most of the data showing gains in excess of 3% towards the end of this year,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.  
  
Wall Street's main indexes were jolted earlier this week after the Fed unexpectedly signaled it could begin tapering its massive stimulus sooner than expected, setting the benchmark S&P 500 on course to snap a three-week winning streak.  
  
However, investors returned to heavyweight technology stocks in particular on Thursday, focusing on the Fed's projection of the economy growing a faster-than-expected 7% this year.  
  
Financials and energy sectors fell at least 1.8% each as investors booked profits in the top-performing S&P sectors this year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq edged 0.4% lower, the least among the major indexes. \[US/\]  
  
At 9:45 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 371.35 points, or 1.10%, at 33,452.10 and the S&P 500 was down 31.41 points, or 0.74%, at 4,190.45.  
  
Friday is also ""quadruple witching day,"" the quarterly simultaneous expiration of U.S. options and futures contracts which bring about increased trading volume at the market close and can feed into market volatility.  
  
Transportation finance and logistics company CAI International Inc surged 46.0% after it agreed to a $1.1 billion takeover by Mitsubishi HC Capital Inc.  
  
Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 3.31-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 2.40-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.  
  
The S&P index recorded seven new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 18 new highs and 23 new lows."

$25k is definitely not a threshold that filters out idiots or identifies pros, and if I get day-trade locked then not being able to exit bad positions on the same day definitely does not help me escape my own idiot choices. 

This is America; I should be able to lose my money however I want. There definitely isn't anything stopping me blowing all my money in one day from Blackjack or Roulette, why is this any different?

Do we see this non-sensical rule ever going away?"

Some positive happenings in WKHS  
1. They filed a lawsuit to try to overturn the USPS contract illegally awarded to Oshkosh. ( This is huge and will single handily rocket this stock if they get even a % of the contract)  
2. Short % of the float is hovering around 70% ( Astronomically insane) Great for our cause  
3. They used everything they had to decrease the stock price (i.e ladder attacks, scare tactics, sell walls, they shorted every single available share they could today and we still finished +3% on a day when the market was down 533 points.) HUGE, HUGE, HUGE VICTORY FOR US  
4. Ortex listed this as their highest tier possible short squeeze candidate.  
5. 2 weeks ago our Reddit group had 1.6 members, Today we have over 7k. ( Word is getting out and the family is increasing rapidly.)  
6. CNBC is highlighting WKHS and our cause for consecutive days now.  
7. And lastly and most importantly WE ARE SOME BAD MOFOS WHO REFUSE TO SELL A SINGLE SHARE!!!!!  
UNITE MY FELLOW APES. LET'S ALL DO OUR PART EVERY DAY TO HELP PROMOTE WKHS AND OUR CAUSE.  
THE REAL MONEY IS COMING SOON. Maybe not Monday, or next week, or the following week BUT IT DEFINITELY WILL HAPPEN. No one ever times it perfectly so be patient and you will be glad you did in the end!"

2021-06-18 17:49:56,wallstreetbets,"Not the same thing.  Oil stocks trade on expectation of future delivery.  Spot Oil Trades on demand for current or near supply.  It take time to get the Black gold from the ground to distribution. The lag creates issues. Went a oil company halts or cuts production it is based of future price, demand and supply.  It take a lot longer to get rigs fired back up.  So they lag behind until it ramps and by then the demand could shrink again. 

Front month spot price is near for delivery so if there is no product ready for delivery they are fucked.  Also, Remember oil is run by cartels, it is not a free market. 

If future demand look bright, then when the companies are back to full production and the demand/price is high they clean up. oil Prices usually have to go up and stay up in future months. 

It can be a good thing for you bc eventually the Gap will fill and so can your pockets."

If it dips and they get assigned I'm cool holding at that avg cost.

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UWMC Stock Verdict The thing many people are missing is that a refinance slowdown would hurt Rocket more than UWM. UWM is more concentrated in new purchase mortgages instead of refinancings of existing mortgages. Thus, in the event that things decelerate, UWM should have a more graceful earnings trajectory going forward.

UWMC stock has rallied sharply. However, little has changed going forward. Maybe UWMC stock is just cheap now instead of dirt cheap. But that’s not a big deal in the bigger picture.

You can easily justify a $15 price, or even higher, for UWM Holdings based on its current earnings power. Throw in the meme stock status and this is an easy hold here. Who knows how far the social media enthusiasm will lift shares in the short run.

The bigger point, however, is that there’s a solid and highly-profitable underlying business here that is still selling at an attractive valuation. If you want to trade a meme stock with limited downside risk, UWMC stock is a compelling option."

2021-06-18 05:35:52,wallstreetbets,"Refinance business comes in waves and is not constant. The current wave is coming to an end. Every mortgage company that geared up to go after the business will start pulling it back, and you'll see some layoffs, etc. It's a cycle that happens every so often based on rates. So this fight is a turf war in Pompeii before the eruption and UWM has its whole main business to keep focusing on. The massive network of brokers that work with them are already seeing refis dry up and while they are sad the easy money is ending, they are going back to what they've done for years prior."

2021-06-18 18:30:31,wallstreetbets,"If anything, a bubble is the best time to own Mortgage Company stock. In the mortgage bubble home prices and offers are crazy high... Up to 50 or $100,000 above asking in many major markets. This leads to higher fees being collected by the mortgage companies because they are all based on a percentage of the loan. Housing bubble equals bigger profits

Additionally, overly inflated home values allow existing homeowners to tap into Equity faster than they would otherwise be able to do. So if the house you bought a year ago is now worth $100,000 more, you can get a Cash out refinance and access that equity. This means more refinancing for companies like UWM.

Pro-tip: cash-out refi to access equity and Yolo into the latest WSB darling. Make $$$. Buy a bigger house. Repeat. (this is not financial advice.)"

2021-06-18 16:49:19,wallstreetbets,"Not as much as I am into tequilas but mainly what I look for is smoothness and a good mellow tone to the flavor.   Quality bourbon will have a higher alcohol content than most other spirits but they won't bite you (sharp or sweet) like lower quality bourbon would, like Early Times or maybe a silver tequila would.   Basil and Woodford are my 2 favorites for sipping bourbons.   Also, stay away from flavored 'bourbons' with like honey or mangos, its a trap.  You can't be a bourbon if you aren't legit from the barrel like that."
2021-06-18 17:27:10,wallstreetbets,"* Eagle rare (quality, smooth)
* Basil Hayden's (well rounded, smooth)
* Woodford reserve (well rounded, smooth)
* Elijah Craig (smooth, sweet, 50% lol)

Personally I only drink mine with 2 ice cubes. You can do less, but the ice really opens up the sweetness/brown sugary taste. Much more palatable to me."

If you YOLO'd a million dollars for a WSB post, you're probably rich as fuck or mentally ill and the YOLO ceases to mean anything.

The true spirit of YOLO is turning a *maybe* a few tens of thousands (often your life savings) into a quarter milly.

>But I do wonder, is it normal for WSB people to yolo 100k all in one stock if that is a huge portion of their net worth? I have seen bigger yolos here but people never mentioned what their net worth was

2021-06-18 19:30:51,wallstreetbets,"Markets have been trying to price in inflation-reaction by the feds for 2 weeks back to back. Jpow announced a few interesting things

1. Inflation will be higher than their target
2. This meeting was meeting for meeting for taper talk

Markets reacted on Thursday and today on extra inflation-reaction fears. For the next 2 weeks nothing will come out, as far as I am aware, that adds to the inflation fear. Tech has consistently stayed positive while the rest of the market pleased the thetagang. Now that fear and uncertainty is temporarily out of the way, I think people will start pouring money back into the market and rotating out of tech into the rest of the market. 

I generally agree with the greedy/fearful adage but this is different. Everyone knows that inflation is here. Everybody knows that interest rates will start climbing soon. What nobody really knows are how far will inflation go; how quickly or slowly fed will raise interest rates or when; how quickly or slowly feds will stop asset purchase.

Markets love 2 things a lot. Certainty and green. Markets have been pricing the shit out of inflation for the last 6 months and will continue to do so unless told otherwise. Markets go red when there is uncertainty about the actions feds would take to curb inflation. This is why I think for the next two weeks the overall trend will be green."

2021-06-18 18:06:03,wallstreetbets,"Without lack of imagination, heres a theory 

The markets have a saying

“The news is just an excuse of what was already going to happen”

Based on recent events, I believe the quants who control the markets finally accepted the ugly truth- no one is in control

A correction was needed as no one was investing, everything has been overpriced and If you look around it started with commodities, metals, etc

Its been a slow 🩸 until spy today. Maybe were gonna have a rotation from spy to whatever hasnt been affected yet. Me thinks thats how the correction will be from now on, not just a big 💥 

But a controlled crash from sector to sector. Maybe spy is done for now until eow

I agree with you on the top of markets/slow bleed since ATH. I think a correction is natural and necessary to keep running, same with rotation. I disagree on the outlook, I think it's correction and another run past ATH for July.

If we go sector to sector rotation, it'd prob be profitable short term to play sector ETFs rather than index ETFs (thinking out loud here)."

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"TSLA Upcoming 4 for 1 Stock Split - An Elon Musk Twitter Analysis Last year Elon Musk tweeted that ""Tesla stock price is too high imo"". Most people did not think too much of this as they thought he was referring to the then recent price action. However, when the 5 for 1 stock split happened in august later that year, some keen eyes noticed that he was actually referring to a split.

https://preview.redd.it/gd2ixiclhz571.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=755c06a09499b39b429a492e67190e41478d5372

He tweeted it at 8:11am PT on 5/1. The 5 for 1 stock split was announced on 8/11.

[Tesla Announces a Five-for-One Stock Split | Tesla Investor Relations](https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-announces-five-one-stock-split)

So why do I think he is hinting at another split? There are a few clues on his twitter as well as several recent tweets that point at an upcoming 4 for 1 split next week on 6/23. First piece of evidence is a recent tweet about appealing to small audiences (i.e. retail investors).

https://preview.redd.it/blo3ms45iz571.png?width=592&format=png&auto=webp&s=3dbbf2cc89dcd10a9a04460c47c221f67ab92f99

Besides this tweet talking about appealing to small audiences, this was tweeted on 4/1. Similar to the last tweet, it was tweeted on the first of a month so it could possible refer to a 4 for 1 stock split. While this was tweeted at 3:23am PT, if you use the time zone that the markets are based on then it would be 6:23am EST which could be hinting at 6/23.

While this might not be enough evidence for some, there are a few other potential hints. First of all, he recently changed his name to ""Elon Musk, the 2nd"" which could be referring to the second stock split.

Furthermore, he has been tweeting some more cryptic tweets such as a recent talking about GME and AMC.

https://preview.redd.it/bw87j61djz571.png?width=597&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbd74f28b426161b14ac8854c257a12e030564f4

He could be referring to the sequel of the TSLA short squeeze. He has made fun of short sellers in the past and it would not be surprising if he is referring to an upcoming stock split as being the catalyst for this sequel.

Assuming that there is a stock split announced after market close next Wednesday on 6/23, calls could be a good play. Last stock split announcement saw a 13%+ rise the day after as well as an 80%+ rise between the announcement and the actual split which was roughly two weeks later.

&#x200B;

Positions: TSLA 6/25 650C & TSLA 7/9 800C

TLDR; Elon Musk hinting at 4 for 1 stock split on 6/23. Load up on calls."

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Deep DD and TA on WISH -> Stock price cheaper than its products! Dear fellow investors and apes,

First of all, I'd like to highlight that I'm indeed a new account, so apologies to people that only trust ""buy and hodl to the moon"" comments/posts from old legit reddit users.

Secondly, I already made a post where I highlighted several reasons why you should make a WISH and, if you haven't already read it, I suggest you do so as I will not repeat all the points on this post -> [Why you should make a WISH](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny69ns/why_you_should_make_a_wish/)

# I hope you will realize that WISH is not a ""meme stock"" but a growth stock priced like a underpriced value one

&#x200B;

**Peers selection for comparison**

To demonstrate that, I selected some peers and compared key metrics. The selected companies are the following:

* Alibaba (BABA): Aliexpress marketplace is probably WISH's most direct competitor and represents 86% of BABA's revenue
* Ebay (EBAY): Global marketplace but unlike WISH, people can also sell their items.
* Mercadolibre (MELI): Commonly called the ""Ebay of Latin America""
* Poshmark (POSH): Marketplace to buy and sell new and secondhand cloths
* Jumia (JMIA): e-commerce platform similar to WISH but active in Africa
* Shopify (SHOP): Provider of commerce platform for merchants

&#x200B;

**Fundamentals comparison**

*Methodology*:

* Comparing 1) ""fundamentals metrics"" such as estimated revenue growth, estimated EBITDA Margin and current Debt-to-EV; 2) ""valuation metrics"" such as estimated price-to-sales EV-to-EBITDA ratios.
* Estimations for revenues and EBITDAs are based on analysts forecasts from Bloomberg for 2025. (Note that POSH has forecasts until 2024 only).

*Results*:

* WISH has estimated revenue growth and EBITDA margin lower than average but lower debt ratio.
* Assuming Ebay and Shopify are good proxies for a value and growth stock respectively, from a fundamental point-of-view WISH seems in-between.
* However strikingly t its valuation ratios are even cheaper than Ebay's ones.
* I believe that a discount in valuation is normal given its exposure to China and actual negative EBITDA, but the actual discount is just too huge compared to averages and companies in similar positions (JMIA and POSH).

[Valuation metrics based on estimated fundamentals](https://preview.redd.it/w0bsc5re5z571.png?width=475&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b58cee3447c58959f262ccd49920bc885a39074)

* Furthermore, based on the same analyst estimates, WISH profitability is expected to increase more sharply than peers as showed in the following chart. Note that I use expected EBITDA/EV (aka EBITDA yield) instead of EV/expected EBITDA, as the latter would provide meaningless results for negative EBITDAs (similar to a meaningless P/E ratio for negative earnings).

[Evolution of estimated EBITDA yield](https://preview.redd.it/os6wwzlg5z571.png?width=437&format=png&auto=webp&s=39a4467d140ecfb7391aaea200a5ac71337cd27e)

**Analysts recommendation**

The gap between fundamentals and current valorization is clearly demonstrated in analysts recommendations. WISH has indeed the largest potential based on the average price target (PT) and even the worst PT is above current price. What is also interesting to note is that analysts are bullish on the industry as highlighted by no sell recommendations at all (expect one for Shopify) and a majority of buys.

[Analysts price targets](https://preview.redd.it/8geoh3xk5z571.png?width=544&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef74c03ff39ab4288c8a28db883418a7c19af096)

**Price action**

A key moment took place on the 13th of May when price dropped 30% to $8. That day, WISH published earnings below consensus (loss of $128m VS loss of $115m expected), revenue above ($772m VS $743m expected) and revenue forecast for Q2 below estimates ($715-730m VS consensus of $759m).

I'd expect a drop in the price given the lower guidance compared to forecasts, however that day the company lost roughly a third of its value (though guidance was only 4-6% below). But guess what, the following day was precisely the end of the lock-up period and insiders could start selling their shares (check by yourself: [IPO prospectus](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1822250/000119312520298630/d82777ds1.htm) page 200 at bottom)... Coincidence? Well I personally don't think so, market makers know very well this kind of information and given the important change in the float following the end of the lock-up (from 60m to 375m shares as shown in the following graph), I wouldn't be surprised if they kept lowering the price in order to buy shares from insiders at a wholesale price (in the end the market maker is indeed a wholesaler...)

[Recent price action VS float \(green line\)](https://preview.redd.it/4879pa1n5z571.png?width=735&format=png&auto=webp&s=b68ac7f96652ec5ec8a715ca1b761d51681d7f6e)

Regarding short-term price action, there was a strong incentive for market makers/option writers to keep prices contained until end of the week due to options expiry. Indeed, 75% of the call contracts expiring in June are tied to strikes above or equal to $12.5 and 44% to options with strikes between $12.5 and $15. In fact, if WISH price closes above $15 today, more than the equivalent of 5.1% of float will be in the money, from which 3.1% for strikes $12.5 to $15 alone.

[Open interests per strike for June Calls and Puts contracts](https://preview.redd.it/tw0qt1n66z571.png?width=463&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9f8ecb724d1586d2479308df4e0d1a123be3ad7)

From a chart perspective, two key downtrend lines were broken (red and yellow lines. A key element that I believe would strongly contribute to a sustained upside momentum is a close above the 50-days moving average and the slope of that same moving average turning positive (green line). If that happens and with recent strong increase in volume, I believe that more buyers will join the party (institutional investors, momentum algos, etc).

PS: Note how market makers managed to keep the closing prices below the 50-days MA every single day since Reddit apes' interest on the stock...

[Technical analysis on chart](https://preview.redd.it/b64qoc127z571.png?width=734&format=png&auto=webp&s=940175f4bae42f2bab57a396f77f0ef6eaf863d8)

**To conclude, I personally believe that WISH is an attractive opportunity based on his risk/return profil. I do expect some selling pressure from insiders, which is normal as their shares represent an important bulk position in their respective portfolio, but I strongly believe that momentum will soon turn positive, opening the way to a strong upside.**

2021-06-18 07:23:58,wallstreetbets,"Careful, yesterday we had a poor low at $10.75 (these tend to get repaired before legging higher) and Max Pain for today is $10 - $10.50.

So I would expect a dip today before going higher next week.  

The good news is that we've been balancing nicely this week which means that the prices at this level are being well accepted by the market, so this is still very much a good risk/reward play.

Today is also quad witching, so expect more volatility in the market."
2021-06-18 10:56:27,wallstreetbets,So I read only the first two words but I figured it out. WISH will get me a smoking hot wife who will than get a boyfriend to bang.

2021-06-18 14:11:48,wallstreetbets,CLOV was the most obvious pump and dump lately. You guys are bagholders. Funds and whales taking advantage of WSB noobs

2021-06-18 15:50:09,wallstreetbets,You can take a lose or hold it. I'd holding mine at 14$ a share. But this stock has a lot of potential as a stock with the bonus of %50 short. Most people on this sub are negative on it to be able to squeeze it. Large volume would spike it again imo. Most people on here talk as if they know this company and it's easy to tell when someone talking out of their ass.
2021-06-18 17:11:59,wallstreetbets,"I'm in the same boat.  Average cost of $19.50.  Holding for the squeeze.  Diamond hands, baby!"

Many bag holders created from the stock that were going to the moon with amc/gme. Seems there are only 2 stocks loaded for the long trip. The others make a day or two run and that’s it. Load up bag holder and trade sideways for months"

2021-06-18 11:41:32,wallstreetbets,So you can lose $20K?
2021-06-18 17:45:44,wallstreetbets,You're  my twin.  Almost bought at $11 but has issues with my funds clearing on time and that was the best I could do. Holding strong will buy more soon if on discount
2021-06-18 07:20:37,wallstreetbets,today is probably the day to do it. $12 is my re-entry point after the first big pop.

2021-06-18 08:43:49,wallstreetbets,Lol. Wish for stock to squeeze - also sell calls that would require you to sell the stock for significantly cheaper than the squeeze would be….

Since becoming relevant"
2021-06-18 05:42:35,wallstreetbets,Whats with the 4 dollar puts?  Thats the bigger question here.  What you need insurance in case it drops to 3 bucks a share so you only end up losing 85% and not 90?
2021-06-18 03:49:24,wallstreetbets,Man if you don't sell you basically lost 🤣
2021-06-18 03:15:50,wallstreetbets,' you don't lose until you sell' is possibly the worst trading advice ever. Cut your losers quickly.

Patience is 🔑 here."

2021-06-18 02:59:29,wallstreetbets,Probably. It needs a catalyst and I will just sell puts and calls against my share to decrease the cost basis
2021-06-18 03:13:58,wallstreetbets,Tell me about it. I wish I sold at $28. Just reload under $10 and wait for the next squeeze

What happened to you wsb"
2021-06-18 03:11:55,wallstreetbets,Easy to say man. Sometimes you got to put in the risk. Those who bought amc in January have certainly been paid. They deserve all their gains from holding that stock through the up and down days.

2021-06-18 03:41:49,wallstreetbets,"Ok so have a bit of AMC shares.  As I'm sure everyone is more or less in the same boat but my current dilemma - do I also throw in my 15k in savings into the stock as well?  Also, do I sell my other stocks and buy more AMC.  I mean obviously no one can tell the future but ill strategize to maybe sell a few if the prices drops to like 45 and I start getting uncomfortable. 

But for all you medium risk folk - go all in? Maybe sell 25% once/if it hits $75? Another 25% at $100?

Also, why apes? Is it some sort of lower intellectual thing, similar to how everyone says they are retards?  Cuz umm...if all goes well - this is gonna be mama effin planet of the apes and dem proved to be intellectually superior."

Don't know how it is correlated but are GME and AMC correlated in the sense that shorts lost a ton of cash?  What I mean to say is if AMC goes down for let's say new sec rules or whatever wouldn't GME also be affected?"

2021-06-18 04:10:16,wallstreetbets,Well I sold all my positions at a loss and tossed it into amc but I can’t tell you what to do also gme and amc are safe plays however amc IMO seems to be a better play because it is 1/4th value of a gme share
2021-06-18 04:15:15,wallstreetbets,"To answer the first part, I do **strongly** believe that GME's price will increase higher than AMC. Moreover, it is a much safer play (long term wise) that comes with little to no risk. For the second part of you questions, I see little to no correlation between GME and AMC. *not financial advice*"
2021-06-18 08:34:51,wallstreetbets,"You mean 1million, right?"
2021-06-18 11:47:41,wallstreetbets,"I'll give you that, and I see what you mean. I meant more in the terms of the action largely seems to favor the player rather than the house from day to day. Being around this price and the consistent swings being in the $5 range is what I look at. It does go lower, but doesn't stay at the low for more than a couple days. Just continuous momentum upward, as where many volatile stocks see $10, $20, and $100 swings. I'm interested to see it as it gets into the hundred dollar mark."
2021-06-18 07:39:17,wallstreetbets,Ate My Crayon!
2021-06-18 08:18:05,wallstreetbets,It has a larger market cap tho
2021-06-18 08:39:03,wallstreetbets,"referring to your analysis of gme going up higher than amc with the word ""moreover"" is so funny to me for some reason. like you're some professor ape retard of some sort"

He’s still worth $67b. 

If he invested his net worth in measly 3% fixed income assets, he’d make $5.5m PER DAY every goddamn day of the year. 

And the crazier part is that the $5.5m per day, if invested in 3% fixed income would earn an additional $60m per year in interest. 

(And that $60m in interest would in turn generate $1,800,000 in interest if invested at 3%). 

I won’t even do the math on what a 10% return gets him. My iPhone literally can’t do math that big. 

Imagine being so rich that the interest on your interest on your interest was $1,800,000 per year.

This guy could wipe his ass with gold bricks all day long and he’d still end the day richer than when he began."

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DD - Progressive Corporation (ticker: PGR) Admittedly, this is a pretty boomer stock trade but it's one that I'm excited about due to its potential.

For those not aware, **Progressive Corporation (ticker: PGR)**  is an insurance company that is one of (if not, THE) largest insurance provider in the US with customers in other parts of the world. Reasons I'm excited for this stock:

1. Imma use the F-word...this company has good fundamentals. They've been growing YoY with increasing earnings and revenue (43% growth in earnings from 2019 to 2020).
2. Their recent earnings for Q1-21 didn't meet analysts expectations (missed by a fraction) but there are a few opportunities in the pipeline for things to bounce back which I'll list in following points. The current price 90.61 allows a golden opportunity for anyone to buy the stock as it hasnt been this low in the past 3-4 months.
3. They recently finalised their acquisition of Protective Insurance at the start of June, another provider specialising in commercial automotive and property, making Progressive  secure additional policies and allow them to continue to grow their presecence in the commercial space.
4. With the timber shortage recently out of the way, there's opportunity for residential and commercial developers to ramp up construction. The market has already reacted positively to this news, just see the increase of D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar Corp (LEN) shares today. More construction means more insurance policies to sell.
5. The chip shortage plaguing automakers is so bad that it's forced some automakers, dealerships and suppliers to close down. Once the shortage is over, we could be seeing a surge of new car sales, and in-turn, see a slew of new insurance policies.
6. PGR stands out as an industry leader as they:

* Have a great leadership team - CEO, Tricia Griffith, has been with the company for over 30 years and held key leadership positions during her time and is largely responsible for the companies domination in the market today
* PGR hold a number of patents (WTF, patents?) - even in insurance, you have to protect intellectual property. Their product for usage based or ""Pay as you drive"" is patented to prevent others from cashing in on this brilliant policy idea.
* Did I mention theyre one of the largest insurance companies in the US?

PGR is probably one to keep mid to long term, and not as quick to rise as other stocks, but if you've gained some money in the memeconomy and want a place to park some of those gains, I reckon this one's a no-brainer.

I'm in with 12,200 shares (Mkt value of $1.1Milly)

&#x200B;

Will be taking a fat juicy position in this stock. Thanks!"
2021-06-18 07:48:05,wallstreetbets,On the claim side they have minimal oversight on their adjusters. Also you should update your DD to say exactly how they rank in insurance company size. State farm is twice as big as allstate for example. This information is readily available.
2021-06-18 04:02:10,wallstreetbets,"Thanks man, my first DD, appreciate the praise"
2021-06-18 03:40:23,wallstreetbets,Agreed. It’s undervalued currently. I can see this reverting back to 100 in a few months time
2021-06-18 02:32:47,wallstreetbets,"No worries. 

I’m just an individual who raked in massive gains during the run up on GME."
2021-06-18 08:12:34,wallstreetbets,"For short tail and less complex claims, it would benefit to have a team of adjusters that act autonomously and independent to produce a quick turnaround. A claims adjuster is usually the first point of contact for a customer, I’m sure Progressive adopt an escalation approach for less black/white claims.

I guess I left out State Farm as its not publicly traded and therefore unavailable to retail investors. Although, it’s still valid to say Progressive is one of the largest insurers out there."
2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"PLTR the DD you didn’t ask for. (Shitpost) 


Alright retards listen up, I’m not here to show you any fancy numbers or any type of research that will confuse your simple minds. I’m here to tell you what it is Palantir actually does. For quite some time it seems no one can plainly explain what Palantir does and that’s partly because no one has ever done it before. 

In plain words, Palantir fucks. 

Palantir isn’t your grandpa’s run-of-the-mill boomer stock, we’re talking about a full blown on-the-spectrum company headed by an aspergers wielding Giga-chad who fucks our wives reverse cowgirl while skiing down death mountain. This company oozes autism at the highest levels.

“But Palantir hasn’t turned a profit in 17 years” first of all shut the fuck up I don’t base my investments off of numbers. My main indicator I use is RSI (Retard Strength Index) and the tard strength in Palantir is astronomically high. For 17 years $PLTR has been taking the governments money (your money as well) and dumping almost all of it into R&D. That’s 17 years and 2 billion fucking dollars worth of time and money dumped into an operating system that can do everything from track terrorists to finger your wife. 


Now that PLTR is sitting on cash what are they doing? Well they’re not sitting on it. They’re investing that shit into day 0 companies for them fresh datas and basically on a mission to make legacy systems obsolete in the next few years. That’s fucking huge. Listen to how our fellow Autist eviscerated Googles CEO for lack of innovation and think about what they’re investing in. https://youtu.be/2Q26XIKtwXQ 


Currently Palantir trades at about a 5x premium compared to its peers, why? Because they fucking can. If Elon Musk wasn’t rich do you think he would still be fucking your wife? No, but he is rich and therefore he fucks your wife 5x more than you do. Therefore we can say Elon Musks penis trades at a 5x premium with your wife, because it can. Quality always costs more it’s the way of the world. 


What about stock based compensation? What about it? Every tech company has an obscenely large amount of SBC. Take Uber, for example, allocated 33% of its 2020 rev to SBC this is business as usual. 

And fuck 2030 Palantir will have a minimum SP of $200 by 2025, regardless of market conditions since this company is absolutely chaos proof as its tech will be more sought after during chaotic times. Just like how COVID helped put Palantir on a lot of radars. 

Let’s talk about Gotham for a second, the crack for entire governments. Now that you know that $2 billion was dumped into R&D I bet you retards didn’t know Gotham launched in 2007. So where did the all that money go? Some of it went to renting hotel rooms for when Karp fucks your wife but the rest went towards improving Gotham and more importantly towards launching Foundry and Apollo, the entire reason Palantir went public. If you’re not paying attention then listen up. Big daddy taxes tf out of your Wendy’s check, pays Palantir for them to make crack, Palantir then uses your tax dollars to create a Gotham for commercial use then directs lists at $10 literally fucking over everyone except the little guy and giving them a fighting chance at getting their money back 20x over. The amount of autism in Palantir is mind boggling. 

PLTR PT $275 2025


I gotta go warm the wife up she’s meeting with Karp later."

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"🌈🐻 Metals and Mining DD / Shorting Silver Slurpers 🌈🐻 Trigger Warning

Looks like a perfect storm for commodities to tank HARD coming up right now.  We have silver, gold, aluminum and copper range bound for months at multi-year highs in a zero interest rate environment. Usually these would be considered an inflation hedge but since CBs are going to have to raise rates to lower inflation you end up with bonds spiking which also brings this down.  On top of that a few weeks ago it leaked that China is outlawing their banks from selling ANY commodities-linked investments to retail investors, and now they are releasing HUGE amounts of their reserves of metals to slow down inflation.  Seems to me like they are either deliberately trying to tank prices or at least protect their own investors from losses when they flood the market.  

Made 10% off a 2x silver short yolo play today, closed the position since I feel like we will probably get a dead cat bounce tomorrow but I’m probably gonna go right back in.  Personally wouldn’t go near any mining stocks or metals right now, and I think there’s probably some good $$$ to be made with inverse ETFs or buying puts over the next few weeks so gonna be keeping an eye on silver / junior mining index charts especially ahead of any economic data being released.  Also I don’t know if anyone’s noticed but the people that buy silver are literally retarded so I don’t feel bad going full 🌈🐻 to stomp them.

TLDR I’d sell any mining/exploration stocks or gold/silver/copper ETFs if I had any right now unless you want to be cucked by China. 🌈🐻s might be able to make some easy money buying puts. I barely slept last night so I took a lot of Dexedrine today to stay awake so it’s possible I’m just retarded and they fly into green all week.

Good luck tomorrow! 🧙🏾‍♀️🧙🏻‍♀️🧙🏿‍♀️🧙🏽‍♀️"

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Secret to make money on Options Step 1 : load up your account with $$$ , read news and wait . 

Step 2 : Good company stock goes down due to overreaction after some news or a dumb analyst downgrade.

Step 3 : Watch price action carefully and  wait for the bottom and bounce after the sell off . It could be  be the second day or third day after the news 

Step 4 : Load up maximum you can afford in very cheap call ITM or close to ITM options atleast two quarters out . 

Step 5: Watch  the stock bounce ( they always do) and sell your options at 25-30% gain 

Step 6: Wait for the next target - rinse / repeat. Don’t worry they come often .

——-

I have repeated this so many times - will add my first and most recent examples if that helps . 

First 
———
Citi - crashed after some regulatory fine around risk management . Huge overreaction . Stock moved from 52-42 but reversed sharply later  . Sold calls at 50% gain 

Recent 
————

Abbot laboratories - Stock crashed after updating guidance . 116 -> 105 . Now back to 111 . Sold my calls at 30% gain 

PS: Don’t use this strategy against bad companies - most of them never recover from bad news and become bankrupt."

2021-06-17 23:37:06,wallstreetbets,I look for a garbage stock that shoots up 40-50% on some news. Then buy puts itm and then sell them back at about 25% profit. But I like your strategy too.
2021-06-17 22:11:01,wallstreetbets,"Better yet, sell covered calls way OTM on volatile stocks that expire weekly."

2021-06-18 01:42:49,wallstreetbets,What sources do you watch when it comes to news?
2021-06-18 03:39:00,wallstreetbets,I mean how can you realistically predict the bottom though? I fee like there's always a chance it will continue to tank and if you wait and it starts to go up its then priced in your calls.

Asking for a friend..."
2021-06-18 03:30:42,wallstreetbets,"How do you find the bottom and recovery, as opposed to a dead cat bounce? Do you wait for the price to go up 2-3%? Or is it something else?"
2021-06-18 00:42:03,wallstreetbets,Gains or GTFO
2021-06-17 22:55:37,wallstreetbets,"1. Find good company
2. Time the bottom

Should size each bet, rather than going all-in every time. Otherwise, it's a mathematical certainty that you will lose everything."
2021-06-17 22:36:36,wallstreetbets,"How do you define a ""good"" or ""bad"" company? If you load up on calls and it bounces then company = good. If you load up and company continues falling then it was a bad company?

I can't even tell you how many times I have done this and lost so much money. Yet I still seem to be drawn to dumpster fires. Ask me about the dips I bought in IQ, TME or VIAC... guess they were bad companies. 

And how did you make money on the C dip? I bought some and it's literally been zero bounce."

2021-06-18 09:31:25,wallstreetbets,I really need to walk through one of these with guidance.   Just one hand holding trade and then I’ll be outta your hair.

You guys want to know the key to being consistently profitable with options? They don't teach this in school:

&#x200B;

1. Taking trades that have an oversized risk reward(3:1,4:1,etc)
2. Cutting losing trades fast

That's it."

You mean OTM!  Lol"
2021-06-18 02:41:52,wallstreetbets,Ya fuck that. I’ll buy cheap OTM calls for less than a dollar and buy a fuck ton. Then when price goes up I’ll make 800%.

I moved away from RH during the GME bullshit and after about 2 months I migrated everything away from RH and into Fidelity.

Then I applied like 4 times, month after month after month and they will not give my account the ability to purchase calls.  It's tiring.  I have an accountant that handles my safe investments, I want to handle my own casino and it's tiring as hell Fidelity is acting like a mommy trying to protect me from myself when it's money I don't give a shit about losing."

You will be owning this company, you better like it!

never own a company you don't like or don't agree with. That will make you too susceptible to paperhand and veer astray from the original plan.

2021-06-18 07:08:56,wallstreetbets,This is one of the strategies I use with a portion of funds. I’m actually doing it today with a little SLV. Big drop yesterday after the Fed. Bounce back should be nice on the calls
2021-06-18 07:11:27,wallstreetbets,"In your method, how does the profit amount differ between buying close to ITM vs if u buy slightly OTM?  In other words, which would yield higher profit?  You’re buying at least two quarters out so plenty of time.

2021-06-18 07:41:02,wallstreetbets,Comedian and radio host Anthony Cumia called this N-vesting. Wait for a CEO to drop an N bomb or do something stupid and then buy options as the stock price drops due to public overreaction. He made huge bank when Elon Musk smoked weed on the Joe Rogan podcast
2021-06-18 07:41:07,wallstreetbets,"wrong forum. go to /r/options. 

also step 5 can take up to 2-3 months. and you can't paper hands as you watch Vega take you for a ride."

2021-06-18 08:10:40,wallstreetbets,"This is $T right now. Super cheap calls and a massive overreaction to their dividend cut even though the reduction won't take place until after the spinoff of Warner next year. Speaking of HBOMax/Warner, the market is basically assigning this minimal value. Analyst consensus is between $32-36. Trading at $28.7. Whenever it dips below $29, there's a sweet buying opportunity for $29 calls. IV is low so even small price movements (eg 0.5%) generate huge gains."

Ok, so what if I bought puts on obvious bad news before it spread and stock is overbought? >>>>>> stock skyrockets and never comes back down..

Ok, so what if I played an ITM straddle on an earnings play? >>>>>> stock doesn't move at all on earnings.

2021-06-18 08:46:05,wallstreetbets,This is something I have been doing and it works well. I tried 30-45-90-120-250-365 day time expiration. The leaps seem to grow in profits but you are stuck with the decision to sell at a 50-75% profit but with 3-9 months left on the contract and plenty of room to grow more. Take profits and re enter or hold for more profits

2021-06-18 10:13:11,wallstreetbets,MSFT is the prime candidate for this. Literally always goes back up after a random tech sell-off day.  IV like 20% so you make 80% easy
2021-06-18 10:13:19,wallstreetbets,I started trading few months ago after the gme thing and figured this out quick lol 2 to 4 weeks long and out

Good advice."
2021-06-18 10:27:38,wallstreetbets,"Trading options takes practice. It's easy to get educated on the technical aspect of options(calls, putts, the greeks) and learn what they mean. 
Its a totally different thing to know when to buy and sell and learn the strategy behind everything. I think that comes with practice.
I haven't found a website that teaches insight on options."
2021-06-18 10:28:53,wallstreetbets,"If you wait for the bounce you lose some of the discount in the options though...personally I buy mine during the worst day when the sentiment is lowest.  Riskier, but better payout."

Though the effectiveness is misleading in comparison to the other as the virus variants lower the effectiveness of all vaccines and the first vaccines didn't have the variants in their study as they weren't around at that time. The number just looks terrible at first view. The current effectiveness for Curevac's vaccine isn't the greatest, but good enough to be used, especially for the developing countries where every single vaccine counts.

Also they're a healthy company with lots of valuable knowledge. Their vaccine uses mRNA btw."

There was a Recent analyst Downgrade for Apple and it went down all the way to 124 . Now back to 130 . That is enough to get your 30% . Similarly Twitter crashed to 45 after Donnie was banned . Then recovered . There is always something every week ."

Just create a watch list with all of the major SPDR sector ETFs and see which ones are up and down.

2021-06-18 03:48:44,wallstreetbets,No doubt.
2021-06-18 03:48:29,wallstreetbets,"“Premium is way cheap compared to the day before the crash” is definitely false. 100% false. It just can’t be true, by definition. It may cost less, but it doesn’t mean it is cheap. You will get burned one day with the assumption you are making. And, since you are suggesting buying as much as you can afford, you will get burned badly. 

The problem is if an option traded at, for example, $3.50 before a volatility event, and traded at $2.00 the next day, all you know by looking at those numbers is that it would cost you $350 to buy that option the day before and $200 the next day. Whether either of those is cheap is something to investigate by looking at other numbers. It could very well be that that particular call was very expensive to begin with and is now even more so because of that volatility event. Paying less per option after a volatility event does not mean you are getting the better end of the deal. Visit r/thetagang and see how those guys prey on this very thing and make bank (relatively speaking).

For example in your fist deal you mentioned, where C dropped from $51 to $42, it was trading sideways for over a month after finding the bottom. All it would take for you to loose money is some low delta calls that you bought the second or third day (as you say in your thesis) after the volatility event.

Consider this real life example. I placed some limit orders trying to buy some DASH puts when I thought it climbed unreasonably high and was bound to come down (or so I thought). When I checked later in the day, those puts were selling about $200 higher while the underlying was also up about $3. Crazy right? Well, the delta on those calls was under $30, which means that if I bought those calls at market, DASH would have to drop additional (almost) $7 for me to get in the money. More in play, obviously, but do you follow what I am saying? 

Good luck with your endeavours and I wish you to get rich! However, it looks like you need to look more into how options work and how they are priced."

2021-06-18 03:13:14,wallstreetbets,I’d buy leaps on CLNE as cheap as you can. I did this with BB in March. I bought x40 $40 calls for an average of $52 apiece($2.1k). Sold them 2 weeks ago for $622 apiece($24.9k). Easy peazy.
2021-06-18 01:13:56,wallstreetbets,"Lots of the meme stocks in the 10 to 15 range can do it. They all have good volume and high IV which makes selling calls or going short IV profitable. 

CLNE, CLF, WISH, that kinda shit. If you're ok with it maybe going ITM and then being assigned. You can also sell puts when you think a volatile stock hit it's floor.

2021-06-18 15:17:27,wallstreetbets,"All good points. The main thing that people really should do when playing with options is to use an option profit calculator to compare different strategies. Many people act like the only move is to blindly buy calls or puts with expiration and strike that is seemingly chosen at random and then they get all shocked when theta decay destroys their life. 

https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/

Punch in all the numbers: strike, expiration, premiums. Then see your breakeven point, max profit, max loss and decide what level of risk you are willing to take. You can even see a projected estimate of how much your profit changes as it approaches expiration. For example, [my Visa calls](http://opcalc.com/wqP) would lose about $20 every 10 days if the price stayed flat OR I could make 38% return if the underlying goes up 10%. 

Also there are more strategies than just buying calls or puts, guys. I rarely see anyone using spreads around here. It can save you money. Selling cash secured puts can sometimes be a clever strategy (profits if the underlying stock goes up, stays flat, or even goes down a little bit). 

I have a few longer expiry options set up in SPY and MSFT that would weather a market crash better than holding shares, but the upside is capped so I would miss out on an unexpected moonshot. I consider those my ""safe"" mid-long term holds. The point is, options can be incredibly versatile, even fairly conservative if you want. It all depends on your goals and risk tolerance."

Yah nothing  works 100% . You should be willing to walk away with a 20-30% loss if it doesn’t seem to recover instead of hoping and praying for it to recover and losing your entire investment . It’s all about how many wins VS loses . 

If there is a crash of over 10% , probability of recovering atleast 50% of the losses is high . So you have an inherent advantage"

2021-06-18 07:48:58,wallstreetbets,"Let me be clear because these other guys are just making jokes that could easily ruin your life, selling calls/puts carries significant risk if you don't know what you're doing or don't cover yourself correctly. Potentially unlimited losses. I recommend doing some research on the way options work fully before touching them."
2021-06-18 04:34:02,wallstreetbets,"if you buy the other guy sells, if you sell the other guy buys .. kinda works like that with everything - trade and commerce"

2021-06-18 19:28:15,wallstreetbets,Well that just sounds like buying stock with extra steps /s thanks for showing the wheel
2021-06-18 08:04:42,wallstreetbets,"Easiest way to explain is that if CLNE starts to run up in share price, then the likelihood of it passing $35 by the expiration date increases. Which the premium price reflects by going up in value."

2021-06-18 03:27:11,wallstreetbets,Most people don't know anything other than having a long position. Being short on options is a slightly confusing concept especially for new traders.
2021-06-18 03:17:59,wallstreetbets,"Ahh. I was thinking he was talking about 4 different situations. Two where you make money buying calls and buying puts(2 separate situations), and two where you sell calls and sell puts(also 2 separate situations). Maybe the wording is hard for me to comprehend? How can you make money *buying* a call when you're spending money to buy the call?"
2021-06-18 08:17:01,wallstreetbets,">someone is selling it to you

That's usually the market maker btw."
2021-06-18 10:54:25,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for saying this. Selling calls/puts carries risk of losing a TON of money. Way more than buying calls/puts(which only loses the price paid) 

Plus. You have to have at least 100 shares in order to sell calls/puts, which not a single person in this comment chain mentioned.

I swear, this is the absolute worst sub for options advice. Seems like it's all a bunch of clowns that Google'd ""what's an option"" and then became instant experts after reading the two sentence explanation."
2021-06-18 12:27:51,wallstreetbets,"Not to mention the fact that if an ""in the money"" call or put is carried to expiration, you will be forced to either buy (call) the stock, or sell (put) the stock. If you don't have the assets to buy the stock (1 call = 100 shares of stock), or have the stock to sell (1 put = 100 shares of stock), you could be facing a fast bankruptcy."
2021-06-18 05:24:40,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but I interpreted him saying, you can buy a call and make money. You can buy a put and make money. You can sell a call and make money. You can sell a put and make money. All 4 situations - so I misinterpreted I think."

2021-06-18 04:30:00,wallstreetbets,I remember having to always look up what a call was and what a put was
2021-06-18 12:37:25,wallstreetbets,"No one who thinks it’s confusing really ought to be on either side of options. 

Ffs all you can do is buy or sell a put or call. There’s only 4 possibilities. The rest is combinations."
2021-06-18 07:45:31,wallstreetbets,"There are 4 different situations. You can buy a put, sell a put, buy a call, sell a call. And there's actual even more situations than that depending on if they're in the money or out of the money and what the delta is etc. 

Selling a PUT is like selling insurance on the underlying. Insurance companies make big money so it's not a bad rap. You're guaranteed a premium. Occasionally there's a problem and you have to pay (stock falls). But if you're not actually an insurance company and you want to own the shares long term this isn't a problem. It's actually a good opportunity to buy shares you already wanted. 

Buying a PUT is buying insurance. If you're a hedge fund and you have a large position you may buy a put to protect that investment. But just like with insurance you pay a premium and usually nothing happens. 

Selling a CALL is kind of like letting someone borrow your shares. They get to keep any profits that's over the strike price. If the call expires in the money your shares get called away. If you immediately bought the shares back you'd have to buy at a higher price. If the call expires out of the money then you get to keep the premium. If you do this right then you're like the bank lending out margin. You'll make a small guaranteed return. But just like with banks, you're taking all the downside risk. You're Archegos and credit suisse. 

Buying a CALL is like borrowing someone else's shares. You borrow 100 shares for less money than it would cost to own 100 of the underlying. You're dependent on volitility. You need to price to go up and quickly. Your call option depreciates in value every day. The less time to expiration the less time the stock has to make a move. Buying long dated calls is an alternative to buying shares on margin."
2021-06-18 05:19:46,wallstreetbets,If you own 100 shares of a stock you can sell a covered call and get money in your pocket immediately. If you buy a call you gotta hope it goes up before you make any money.
2021-06-18 12:38:03,wallstreetbets,You took something simple and made it complicated.
2021-06-18 14:35:47,wallstreetbets,"Just to clear up some of the information here. You need 100 shares to sell a covered call. If you sell a naked call and you're assigned you need to buy 100 shares at market price to sell at strike price to whoever excercises the option. For selling cash secured puts you need the cash required to buy 100 shares at the strike price from the person excercising the option. God fucking help you if you're selling naked puts. You're asking to go bankrupt if you don't know what you're doing. Don't fuck around with naked options unless you have a lot of money and don't mind being burnt.

Sorry just bothered me a bit reading you need 100 shares to sell puts because when you're assigned on a put you are actually buying 100 shares from someone."
2021-06-18 13:28:52,wallstreetbets,First time on wsb?
2021-06-18 14:34:54,wallstreetbets,You don't need to have shares to sell a put though. Probably gonna want to have the cash or margin to buy if assigned.
2021-06-18 12:31:49,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I mean, that is literally how the loss works. If it's not ITM then you would never lose anything"
2021-06-18 12:37:45,wallstreetbets,"if you have a call expire ITM and you don't have the cash for the shares, you can simply not exercise the call. Robinhood (which everyone here hates) will attempt to sell the call for you on the afternoon of expiration if you don't have the cash to cover. 

Options carry the right, but not the obligation to buy or sell. You are not facing bankruptcy from my understanding unless your brokerage operates in some odd way.

If you sell a naked (uncovered) call where you don't own the shares, then yeah that could easily bankrupt you. It honestly shouldn't be legal to do that. Same with selling puts, you need the cash to buy the shares under contract at the strike price of the contract otherwise you are fucked."
2021-06-18 06:46:44,wallstreetbets,"dude - whatever these hang-from-your-feet experts say, it IS  easy to confuse terms-  put/call/here/there, specially under stress.I do it the boring way - I just always step through it like handling a firearm, ya know?  routine & totally no advantage in making a casual  error. Yeah I know I'm hick and the smart dudes do it smart and flash and dont think twice (I guess). But have it straight in your head is all that counts."
2021-06-18 08:37:36,wallstreetbets,"Right, so if a stock like CLNE, which because it is a meme stock and could be vulnerable, the High IV could result in profits over the course of the next 6 months?"
2021-06-18 03:54:18,wallstreetbets,bruh you bought that shit at all time high or something? 😭😭😭
2021-06-18 15:28:46,wallstreetbets,Yep. Makes it easier when the premiums are sp high. The floor is pretty solid since retail owns the majority of shares and they aren't selling.
2021-06-18 10:54:08,wallstreetbets,"Come on now, no need for volatility"
2021-06-18 09:22:09,wallstreetbets,"Unrelated, meant to say selling first."
2021-06-18 10:47:52,wallstreetbets,"This is why I love this community. Thank you guys.

I know all about buying options and just started selling covered calls but I was confused about selling puts. Essentially the put seller HAS to buy 100 shares from the buyer at the strike right?

So if I sold puts on AMC at $10, if AMC crashes to $10 I would have to buy $1000 worth of shares from the buyer? So I'm assuming my broker would just auto debit my account for the amount I would owe?"
2021-06-18 08:02:12,wallstreetbets,"Whats the difference between selling a call and selling-to-close a call? For example, I have a few UWMC 12 and 13 calls that expire tomorrow. Why can't I just sell the contracts when the volatility increases? Doesn't seem like there's unlimited losses to me. Or am I misunderstanding what selling a call is vs selling to close a call you own?"
2021-06-18 10:40:05,wallstreetbets,What is the risk with selling a call?
2021-06-18 14:40:20,wallstreetbets,">God fucking help you if you're selling naked puts. 

Why I didn't make mention of it. Selling naked puts is nuts, IMO. I don't even think about it. I'm still learning options so I don't want to pretend like an expert, because I am NOT. 

Thanks for the additional information. I hope it gets read and taken seriously."
2021-06-18 13:30:46,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately, no lol."
2021-06-18 14:40:44,wallstreetbets,"I know, I left out naked puts for a reason."
2021-06-18 09:40:48,wallstreetbets,If you buy at a time of lower IV.
2021-06-18 15:23:25,wallstreetbets,"Probably not, IV is pretty high right now. If It cools off your contracts hemorrhage money."
2021-06-18 14:12:42,wallstreetbets,"295 bought in, averaged down to 265 ;("
2021-06-18 11:40:09,wallstreetbets,">Essentially the put seller HAS to buy 100 shares from the buyer at the strike right?

Yes. The guy buying the put is buying the option to PUT his shares in your portfolio

>So if I sold puts on AMC at $10, if AMC crashes to $10 I would have to buy $1000 worth of shares from the buyer?

Yes. If it's at or below the strike price. The thing with options is the buyer has the option to exercise. It would be stupid to exercise an option at a loss but it's possible. And they can be exercised at any time, not just at expiration. 

Options are literally just contracts that give the buyer the option to buy/sell. And those contracts themselves have their own supply/demand which dictates their price independent but related to the underlying. GME and AMC will have expensive option prices because everyone wants them.

>So I'm assuming my broker would just auto debit my account for the amount I would owe?

Yes. I've let puts expire in the money so I get assigned the stock. Usually happens over the weekend if the option expires on Friday. I think technically the option holder has until noon on Saturday to make up their mind but it usually happens on market close Friday."
2021-06-18 08:09:24,wallstreetbets,"If you buy a call then you can sell it to someone else to close it out. You're selling the contract you already bought. 

If you own 100 shares of the underlying then you can sell a call to open. You're like the first guy who writes the contract to begin with. Imagine these as literal written contracts. I own 100 shares. I write a contract on a price of paper that says you'll pay me x amount of dollars now and if the price goes up then the buyer has the option (see that?) To buy my shares from me. 

If you write a covered call then you can buy it back to close it out. 

So if you buy a call you sell it to close it out. 

If you sell a covered call you'd buy it to close it out. 

Same with puts"
2021-06-18 10:23:54,wallstreetbets,"There are two different ways to sell a call, you can sell to open a position (aka writing a call) or you can sell to close a position (aka cashing out).  Most brokerages won't let you sell to open unless you either a) own at least 100 shares or b) have lots of $ in your account. If you own the shares, you can write covered calls, which protects you from unlimited losses.  You will collect premium immediately when someone else buys the call from you. If the stock doesn't hit the strike price at expiration, you keep the premium and your stock and nothing happens. If it hits the strike you get assigned and your shares are sold for whatever the strike price is."
2021-06-18 10:54:18,wallstreetbets,"If it's a covered call, basically zero.  You either keep the shares and the premium if it expires worthless or you get assigned and sell the shares at whatever strike price you picked (plus you keep the premium). Either way you make money.
The only way it goes bad is if the stock craters and now you're holding worthless shares (which is bad in any scenario), or the stock moons before you get assigned and you're forced to sell at below the current share price (you still make money, just not as much as you could have)."
2021-06-18 14:35:14,wallstreetbets,"It’s at 141% as of now, seems best to wait and see if it can drop below 100 or 80?"
2021-06-18 15:06:21,wallstreetbets,Thank you for that detailed explanation. :)
2021-06-18 08:14:34,wallstreetbets,"Oh okay, so selling a contract you already own, you can only lose what you put in. If you sell a contract you dont have that's where the unlimited losses come into play? If so, that makes a lot more sense. Why do so many people on this sub mess with covered calls if they're so risky then?"
2021-06-18 08:33:35,wallstreetbets,Selling a covered call doesn't have unlimited losses. It actually has no losses. But you can miss out on unlimited gains.
2021-06-18 08:44:23,wallstreetbets,"Oh, then what about selling/buying calls has unlimited loss potential?"
2021-06-18 09:05:26,wallstreetbets,UNcovered calls
2021-06-18 09:26:51,wallstreetbets,"Just selling a call (Not covered, usually referred to as “selling a naked call”) is what has potentially unlimited losses. As high as the stock goes until it expires, you may potentially lose. You can be required to deliver these shares, what’s knows as “being assigned” and that’s when someone exercises the contract. It can happen any time from the second you sell it to the time of expiration."
2021-06-18 09:07:47,wallstreetbets,So selling a call without 100 shares?
2021-06-18 09:21:17,wallstreetbets,Yeah. Never be naked. Not even sure how that's legal

This is all just bulltraps but nothing I can say will change your opinion anyhow so enjoy the ride into the wall.  But hey when it drops to 20 within a month and then runs up to 50 again a couple of months after that will surely be proof of your idea and most definitely not some honey trap for FOMO idiots.

2021-06-17 21:53:47,wallstreetbets,Pltr is a huge company. Great earnings will only move the stock price. And I believe they will deliver. More of a long term investment if you ask me.
2021-06-17 21:57:05,wallstreetbets,I started buying at ~$35 and have averaged down to the point where it’s green again. I think I’m up about $200 on 1100 stocks. Lots of my calls are still red though. It’s getting there though.

I'll accept the long term PLTR gratification while munching AMC tendies with grated crayons garnish."

2021-06-18 09:19:43,wallstreetbets,Fidelity. Robin hood might be easier to start with
2021-06-17 23:32:12,wallstreetbets,I could buy 5000 shares with this money and let’s say PLTR reach 30 by EOY . How much I make - 25k. But with option 30 might give me close to $100k .

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"MYOV - A De-risked Fire Sale With 2 FDA Approved Drugs and More Coming Through The Pipeline Myovant has been hard at work. Leveling up in silence. While big pharma takes note and institutions build positions.

As a disclaimer, before we get started. Im not a financial advisor, I am long myovant ( Positions: 23k Shares and \~250 xcalls mostly leaps), and there’s serious value to be had in this play. Please also see my previous posts for more information as well.

[Post 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mlok9n/myov_deep_value_and_possible_buy_out/)

[Post 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nek6rk/myov_back_to_back_catalysts/)

**Quick about the company:** 

Myovant is a company specializing in Men and Women's health. Currently, they have 2 approved treatments by the FDA, both based on a GNRH antagonist for the treatment of prostate cancer and uterine fibroids, all received in the past 6 months. Now, the company is beginning a full transformation to commercialization. In this, the treatment for prostate cancer has seen a rapid uptick in sales with product margins of over 1000% and Myfembree launching with the help of Pfizer this week.

**Partners and investors:** 

Pfizer - 

Arguably the most important. [PFE and Myovant signed a deal](https://www.biospace.com/article/myovant-shares-rocket-22-percent-on-news-of-pfizer-deal/) in December worth more than $4.2b! This deal came with 2 important notes.

1. Cost, revenue, and resource sharing - this has proved incredibly important as it has allowed myovant to have 2 sales teams and a foot in the door, providing the aforementioned rapid sales growth.
2. Cash payments on a tiered system with double digit royalties if pfizer exercises their rights to serve any of the ex-us markets granted by the deal.

Sumitomo (Sumitovant) -

Currently holding 53.5% of the company, they make the largest investor by far. They were able to acquire an initial stake from Roivant and have increased their stake since with another planned purchase of over a million shares coming before the end of the year. They are also very likely to buyout the company, but this is explained in more detail down below.

Other Institutions -

Theres a nice large chunk of other institutions like Takeda (held by ark) and a few others who own a position here. In fact, so many other institutions are holding, that the shares available to retail are about 5% of the company! To put that into perspective, amc is an 80% retail float. Follow the big money here.

**The current valuation:** 

Right now, the current market cap from a very basic perspective is sitting at $1.8b. The company currently has $725m of this in cash with more to come upon completion of future milestones from Pfizer (management has called these ""Achievable"" in past calls) as well as sales from their drug. This means the company is sitting on close to 40% of its market cap in cash.

To expand, each of the use cases approved is expected to see more than 1b a year in net revenue within the next few years. So what do analysts on WS think? Consensus is in mid 30s (50% more than current) [with Evercore ISI projecting a $55 PT and another firm at $42!](https://www.markets.co/analysts-have-conflicting-sentiments-on-these-healthcare-companies-constellation-pharmaceuticals-nasdaq-cnst-myovant-sciences-nyse-myov-and-surgalign-holdings-nasdaq-srga/321463/)

Value is the name of the game here Looking at the share price and chart, you might say, oh man, why has this dropped? Good question, and good news. There has been no significant news in the past 2 weeks causing a price change. It is my theory that intraday shorting has dropped the price of the stock to a point for a big investor (possibly goldman sachs who seemed very bullish on their last call but doesn't have a position) could make an entrance.

**The future prospects:**

By the end of June they are expected to submit an NDA for relugolix for the treatment of Endometriosis. This is likely to be approved as their data has been incredibly strong (triple threat) and they already have relugolix approved on the market. Further, the company has 2 peer reviewed publications on relugolix in the New England Journal of medicine for its possibility as a standard of care treatment.

If you go and look at the end of the [RFP](https://res.cloudinary.com/pcf/image/upload/v1623079191/FINAL_PCF-PFE-MYOV_Relugolix_Challenge_Awards_RFP_vlte5l.pdf) recently published, they are currently exploring Relugolix as a treatment for hormone induced breast cancer. Within this, they are also exploring other opportunities for relugolix with the help of Pfizer.

MVT - they are exploring this compound and seeing positive data for the treatment of infertilityMyovant has also confirmed that they are shopping for other compounds to purchase and add to their already strong pipeline.

**List of catalysts:** I am keeping a list of future possible catalysts for the company. It should be noted that these catalysts are only the short term ones to keep the list short.

1. Endometriosis submission to FDA   
2. Announcement of further relugolix lifecycle development
3. Proxy filing - (likely to come in June or july similar to last year) we should learn details about Lynn’s departure and more importantly, payout 
4. Part D and Medicare coverage for prostate cancer application - expected in first half of year (any day now) 
5. EMA decision to approve for uterine fibroids for sale in EU (positive CHMP recommendation makes this highly likely and comes with multimillion dollar direct cash payment) 
6. Pfizer optionality - Pfizer can opt in to sell in EU. Resulting in a 50m cash payment 
7. Possible acquisition of new drug pipelines 
8. Data read outs for the current trials 
9. Q2 earnings - (expected in august) 
10. Possible acquisition of myovant

**Buyout possibility:** Sumitovant (mentioned above) has a very strong interest in aquiring myovant. This can be assumed for 3 reasons.

1. They have purchased 4 out of 5 of the ""Vants"" [from their deal with roivant](https://www.evaluate.com/vantage/articles/news/deals/sumitomo-takes-out-urovant-and-myovant-beckons).
2. They have a patent cliff on their current pipeline that expires in 2023 and by IFRS standards they can only claim the amount of revenue to their books in comparison to the stake they own
3. They have shown in multiple investor presentations that they have plans to acquire Myovant.

**Last but not least, fuck the shorts:**

It should be noted that the companies who are short myovant are the very same ones short $GME $AMC and other notable names. The list includes; citadel, Jane Street, Point 72, Susquehanna, and more!

2021-06-18 07:28:23,wallstreetbets,"> We may never achieve or maintain profitability.

> Investment in pharmaceutical product development is highly speculative

They're bleeding cash. Have more debt than assets which I guess makes sense for a pharmaceutical company starting up. They tell you right in the filing they're dependent on the success of ORGOVYX. So this is a very high risk, potential reward situation. Not even sure if it's high reward. 

This is a wait and see for me. If they can make money off this drug and they're able to make other drugs then maybe. Pharmaceutical companies are high risk Jo matter what. Their success always depends on the next drug being a success. 

MRK also has that spinoff that's all about women's health. OGN. That will probably be a better buy than this."
2021-06-17 22:18:27,wallstreetbets,"That’s one of the reasons I love it. At the end of the day, you’re supporting a company that is truly helping people"
2021-06-18 02:37:20,wallstreetbets,"I'm cautiously optimistic. A common drug used to ""treat"" Endo is a failed prostate cancer chemo drug. I want to believe they're looking at alternatives."
2021-06-17 21:36:52,wallstreetbets,"Thanks! 

It definitely doesn’t scream meme status, however, if you want to add high quality biotech to your portfolio, it’s a great addition. Plus, Pfizer has already done a lot of the screening, so if you’re not familiar with pharma, at least you know you can trust that they wouldn’t be so invested without promise.

I’m really thinking 2-3x value pretty easily in the next year or 2. Realistically a buyout is more likely to occur before actualization for a nice hefty premium."
2021-06-17 21:54:47,wallstreetbets,"Yeah you’re not kidding, the tag line for their company could be better. I think it’s more focused around the fact that it’s centered on prostate cancer, endometriosis, uterine fibroids, and imho soon to be breast cancer.

The upside is that these markets are all huge, so capturing a share and being a standard of care for any of them is billions a year in revenue. Making their market cap seem absolutely tiny."
2021-06-18 08:31:00,wallstreetbets,"If you’ve never read a financial disclosure statement that covers basic liability, and that shocked you, you really shouldn’t be investing."
2021-06-18 11:01:22,wallstreetbets,"The mechanism for treatment for both is the same, it's sexual hormone suppression.  Decades ago, they would cut a guy balls off if he had prostate cancer."
2021-06-17 21:55:44,wallstreetbets,Only issue I have is they always partner with another biotech for development.  It's good for upfront funding but the profits from the drug sales get split.  40-50 % I can see in the next year.
2021-06-18 00:25:36,wallstreetbets,"The part missing from tour analysis is to estimate what the earnings / DCF of these therapeutic products will bring that are approved. 

For a company operating at a loss, lots of positive things can happen but the products need to earn and offset operating costs. Just going to assume if you have half a million in shares and this much knowledge you are an insider anyway ? (Trying to dump?)

E.g it is just not usually common knowledge when a company will submit documents related to trying to get on Medicare formulary. What could be your source of that info ?"
2021-06-18 12:34:16,wallstreetbets,Hormone suppression won't unstick internal organs from each other or stop the internal bleeding. They don't know the cause yet so they definitely shouldn't be giving women chemo for it. Though chopping balls off? Wtf... I mean I'm glad medicine has advanced a bit but damn that awful
2021-06-18 00:53:49,wallstreetbets,"If I was an insider trying to dump this would be highly illegal and even more idiotic than anything else. 

No I’m not an insider or trying to dump. I’m holding this until the end."
2021-06-18 00:54:35,wallstreetbets,"For sources on Medicare, check the last 3 conference calls or the investor presentations from them. They openly discuss Medicare coverage status"
2021-06-18 12:35:06,wallstreetbets,It's not chemo.
2021-06-18 12:36:52,wallstreetbets,"Testosterone and estrogen are what feeds these tumors.  That's why this drug is used, in conjunction with chemo, surgery, and possibly radiation therapy for prostate cancer."
2021-06-18 12:38:47,wallstreetbets,"I say that because that's how it started. And the side effects are really similar- hair loss/thinning, nausea, bone loss, brain damage etc. Regardless- it's a shit drug and if this company is making it, then they are not really helping"
2021-06-18 12:41:46,wallstreetbets,"Again, they don't actually know what causes Endo. There's a theory that Endo implants trigger their own hormone production. And if hormone suppression worked, mine wouldn't have grown back after getting cut out. For some people it keeps growing, even with loupron. You just don't feel the effects until you're off the drugs. 
I hope they find something better for prostate cancer too."
2021-06-18 12:42:11,wallstreetbets,"It's not how it started, it's a small molecule hormone suppression drug that attacks the underlying mechanism."
2021-06-18 12:46:06,wallstreetbets,"Endometriosis occurs when endometrial tissue grows on your ovaries, bowel, and tissues lining your pelvis. It’s unusual for endometrial tissue to spread beyond your pelvic region, but it’s not impossible. Endometrial tissue growing outside of your uterus is known as an endometrial implant.

The hormonal changes of your menstrual cycle affect the misplaced endometrial tissue, causing the area to become inflamed and painful. This means the tissue will grow, thicken, and break down. Over time, the tissue that has broken down has nowhere to go and becomes trapped in your pelvis."
2021-06-18 12:49:40,wallstreetbets,"Yes thanks for the definition. Now go see one of the top Endo specialists in the country and have them explain it to you. What causes the tissue to grow in other places? Dunno. Why does it affect some women and not others? Dunno. Why do some men get it rarely? Dunno. But that last paragraph is a good way to explain what it does when it's trapped. 

If you want to argue the ignorance surrounding Endo, I suggest you dm me. I'm done blowing up a financial page explaining a condition I've lived with for 20 years to someone with Google."
2021-06-18 13:21:12,wallstreetbets,"Irrelevant, the issue needs to be managed and currently there aren't many good options.  That's also only half it's market as prostate cancer is abundant and not going away.  This provides a non permanent method to suppress the sex hormones that encourage tumor growth while the cancer is being treated.  Dunno about you but I'd prefer to have normal hormone and sex drive after beating cancer."
2021-06-18 13:22:53,wallstreetbets,Dude we're literally only talking about Endo. Again dm me. I'm not posting again on here. But that paragraph speaks volumes of your ignorance and privilege
2021-06-18 15:13:41,wallstreetbets,"This drug is for both prostate cancer and uterine fibroids, with promise towards providing a safe treatment for endo. Not just the condition you are personally biased towards. Where you are getting the idea I'm somehow privileged is laughable as you won't stop focusing on the one thing you're personally effected by.  Why the hell wouldn't you want to see something that can ease the suffering of women with Endo?  Remember to get approved it's gotta function better than current standard of treatment."

2021-06-17 21:31:41,wallstreetbets,The Macy’s in my town looks like a Sears store 10 years ago; empty and outdated in most departments. This was pre-Covid so I’m a little skeptical about that choice in these times of labor shortages and rising costs.
2021-06-17 20:48:30,wallstreetbets,That’s not a good sign.
2021-06-17 21:34:52,wallstreetbets,That means its about to go to shit.

2021-06-18 00:40:37,wallstreetbets,When did WSB follow Macy's recently? I must have missed it while harvesting tendies elsewhere.  And yet we all just had a long WSB discussion about P&Ds! lol

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CLNE CEO Speaks and Tweets: CLNE Ready for Launch I'll start off with the important bits:

🐄 💨🚀 ✨🌚

Andrew Littlefair, CLNE CEO was just on Mad Money with everyones favorite person to hate Jim ""We Like The Stock"" Cramer. During the interview Mr. Littlefair knocked it out of the park but also alluded to something Amazon wants to say about their deal.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htY1t6F5QVU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htY1t6F5QVU)

As of right know we all know that Amazon is buying in big time with 20% stake in CLNE (🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀) at 13.4X/share, but what's left unsaid is from the horses mouth at Amazon. Mr. Littlefair mentioned that Amazon is going to have something to say which is fair to assume is rather positive news.

Additionally Mr. Littlefair is active on Twitter and just dropped this bombshell (positive)

>Heard from  
>  
>[@TotalEnergies](https://twitter.com/TotalEnergies)  
>  
>CEO today that they have sold all they're going to sell. They wanted to re-coup their original investment and they have. Still own a little over 20% of our outstanding shares. Our partnership with them remains **firm and deep**.

[https://twitter.com/A\_Littlefair/status/1405672450902269955?s=20](https://twitter.com/A_Littlefair/status/1405672450902269955?s=20)

So what does this mean? Well, it appears Total Energies won't be dragging the fucking price down and now the $13 price point that was important for gamma considerations (🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀) has a higher probability for tomorrow.

(ETA: I'm aware of NrdRage's DD and his suggestions on other considerations, feel free to peruse his big dick energy DD [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o00qva/bezos\_cow\_farts\_and\_you\_how\_amzns\_deal\_w\_clne\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o00qva/bezos_cow_farts_and_you_how_amzns_deal_w_clne_is/) )

🐄 💨🚀 ✨🌚

Well, I like the fucking stock (and my $9 calls) so I'm holding and buying a little more. What do you do? That's up to you.

So what does everyone else think of the interview and the revelation by the CEO about Total Energies movement with their holdings in CLNE?

🐄 💨🚀 ✨🌚

ETA: I was doing some light reading and thought that this was important to include.  

https://www.act-news.com/news/propane-autogas-provides-energy-supply-resiliency/

I'll give my opinion of what the article says.

Essentially what they're saying is that resilience and diversification in the energy and vehicle markets are paramount for not just your everyday person and the environment but also our (or any nations) national security. However the argument in the article is for Natural Gas and not for Renewable Natural Gas that CLNE provides via 🐄 💨 and because of that glaring oversight I believe the article falls short. 

That said the articles premise can be applied to and expanded and improved upon with RNG which CLNE provides. We can't remain beholden to either fossil fuels or battery tech in order move freight and goods across the roads. CLNE is fortunately uniquely poised to provide not just proof of concept with RNG but bringing their product to scale in short order and making our country (and any country that would adopt the tech and infrastructure) stronger and safer for it.  

So... 🐄 💨🚀 ✨🌚 

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"

2021-06-17 20:34:54,wallstreetbets,"The Total update was the thing everybody was waiting for, now that it has been cleared the picture looks much better for $CLNE and for natural gas vehicles in general 🐮🐄💨⛽️🚚🚀🚀🚀✨🌛🪐

TOTAL recouped the original investment in $CLNE (around $80 million) and have to invest from $100 to $400 million in the RNG JV with $CLNE.

2021-06-17 20:26:33,wallstreetbets,CLNE is primed for takeoff
2021-06-17 20:28:42,wallstreetbets,This news fucking rules. I think Littlefair now knows what’s going on for the future of CLNE and the valuation of the stock. They’ve got other deals in the works like with UPS that I’m sure will be coming down the pipe in the coming months. And now the CEO cares about share holder value too. Mega bullish
2021-06-17 20:36:21,wallstreetbets,Imagine where it could be without the additional share sell-off this week. Tomorrow is a big day
2021-06-17 20:35:28,wallstreetbets,Ok cool… launch already !!!

For everyone else invested or looking to invest remember you hold interest in a great company that is turning stuff that nobody wants into a commodity that is cleaner for the entire planet, and for that I tip my 🧢 and give you a 🍻.  Stay strong, stay diligent, and I hope everyone is prosperous because of it in the long run!"

2021-06-18 03:57:41,wallstreetbets,"Looks like I’ll be setting my alarm for 3 hours from now so I can buy. I’d set a limit order if I had any clue what it was going to open at. Sleep, who needs it?"
2021-06-18 05:01:49,wallstreetbets,"I am ready baby, lets think about why you bought CLNE, its for our future!!!!🐄🐄🐄💨🌕🚀"

2021-06-18 06:06:10,wallstreetbets,"Can someone explain the gamma to me? Im assuming that there are a ton of ITM options at $13 but would that cause parabolic price action today more so in anticipation that these contracts are all executed on open Monday? Is that what were looking at, today and then Monday and into next week if we're over $13? Also is there any short interest here or is that not much of a consideration? I see ppl talking squeeze as its the new favorite word, but i don't know if this play is that. Only about ~6% here. Thank you and lets get this moon money. 💎 🙌 🚀🚀"

We can't have Ribeye's and double smash burgers without 🐄 💨  and since there are 🐄 💨  that can be converted to usable energy then we've got a sustainable and perhaps regenerative product.

2021-06-17 22:35:38,wallstreetbets,"Currently: “Alternative Fuels Tax Credit, which extends the $0.50 per gallon fuel credit/payment for the use of RNG as a transportation fuel, and the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit, which extends the 30 percent/$30,000 investment tax credit for alternative vehicle refueling property.”

I mean that’s a credit not a subsidy… infrastructure is the reason Total has been cashing out for. CLNE / Total JV"
2021-06-18 08:44:02,wallstreetbets,"The gamma squeeze thesis is when calls become ITM, the MM and the naked call writers need to obtain the shares to cover the call.

With CLNE, there's a TON of contracts written starting at the $10 strike (but a huge chunk at $13).  The ""squeeze"" belief is that when those strike prices are hit, it'll require them to cover and buy millions of shares.

There are a lot of additional contracts above $13 with a lot of interest.  So this triggers a ladder squeeze where the $13 contracts force to cover, which drive up the price, which then may push into the next strike which forces the $14 to cover, etc.

Now, if the day ends in the $13 range, then only the $13s and below need to cover.  The higher the strike contracts will no longer be part of the equation.

Some of the covering will occur throughout the day if a strike price is hit and maintained, and those shares purchased could help momentum forward.  Other covers have a couple days to settle and those buys will not impact today's action (but may impact price next week, depending on how many naked calls were sold).

Again, all of this is a thesis so nothing is guaranteed.

This is my brief understanding, so know this is not financial advice."

2021-06-18 00:50:01,wallstreetbets,"I have to assume you're referring to my dislike for Cult GME and their modus operandi and theatrics.

Your post here actually highlights the stupidity and reaffirms my position that Cult GME has a high density of deluded morons.

Regarding this post of mine, it's not DD bud it's a discussion that relates to a particular stock I like, and the fact you can't differentiate the two things says more about your standards and understanding than it does anything else.

I’m glad this company found a way to convert a byproduct waste into a renewable energy. Finding a new source of energy is always great for humans but the fact that it is renewable and sustainable is extra credit.

OP and i seriously CANNOT be the ONLY one that sees the long term sustainable growth play here for all parties with partnering up with the beef and dairy industries or even waste management companies (make use of landfills! not just take up mf space). MEDIUM RARE RIBEYES. AND its net zero carbon output!!!

2021-06-18 08:47:14,wallstreetbets,I appreciate that. It was always my understanding that a true gamma required everything you mentioned in addition to high short interest and covering in that aspect too.

2021-06-18 00:10:24,wallstreetbets,Correct but the girth of the stack is really showing you have no regard for anyone including yourself. When you’re “balls deep” your balls are never actually deep (At least mine aren’t since the left is obscenely massive from the cancer and OTM calls) because the sack would get ripped off like everyone who bought CLOV at $28 before they are actually deep. Therefore I stack my balls on top and force them in along with the shaft at the same time. The maximum potential girth is reached at a lot earlier length. Enjoy.
2021-06-17 23:13:34,wallstreetbets,Sometimes you gotta shake the magic 8 ball until you get the answer you wanted all along.

2021-06-18 09:21:21,wallstreetbets,"To my knowledge I believe Clean Energy Services (CLNE) holds a variety of patents (13) that oilfield companies may find attractive and potentially lucrative. If not directly then perhaps indirectly if they were to extrapolate and engineer based on applying similar ideas to their individual use cases.

For example there are methods of transfer of liquid nitrogen that CLNE uses that are proprietary and BP is similar but the application is different. BP and other well site owners use hydraulic fracturing (fracking) which required coiled tubing operators to pump liquid nitrogen down what are sometimes nearing a mile or miles long worth of tubing in to the ground. That process has been refined but can continue to be made safer or tweaked as time goes on. Perhaps a patent which CLNE holds may lead them in a direction which enables a more refined product for their own use case.

That is one example of potential patent holdings which may be attractive to any oil field operator services but it is by no means a deep dive with comprehensive analysis or 1 for 1 trade offs which benefit both parties."

Even then the OP would need to time it exactly to get 69,420.00~~

2021-06-18 14:45:25,wallstreetbets,"ummmm....  you understand we can do the math and that was taken when the price was $260.  If you have not sold your unrealized gain has dropped to $8,010.

You purchased at $188, took the screenshot at $260 and it's now $218."
2021-06-18 15:10:48,wallstreetbets,"Why would someone post a screenshot with gains that is over a week old?  


69,420 / 267  =  $260  


The SP hasn't been $260 since June 10th.  


The reason is they want diamond hands and strong apes to keep the price up while they realize their gains."
2021-06-18 13:04:37,wallstreetbets,$WISH also in the folds of greatness. Congrats my ape.

I have webull but I'm kinda over the Chinese Spyware. I need another that looks good on a computer monitor that I bought JUST for trading windows."
2021-06-18 07:05:08,wallstreetbets,"Opened a Fidelity account in January due to the RH nonsense (and Webull, and TD…they can’t all be red at the same time right?)
Shamefully still have money in RH but seeing how Fidelity is finally improving their app switching might not be so bad…once I’m approved for options."

2021-06-18 04:37:31,wallstreetbets,"Well no... the market does exist... I think some of the bizarre meme stock frenzies of late aren't unrelated... but It may just be someone seeing the ""wsb effect"" after January and trying to emulate it.

But I do think the media smear against GME and greenlight on AMC is worthy of a little skepticism. Realistically, only one of those companies is going to be relevant in a decade (assuming both follow their respective trajectories)."

2021-06-18 00:18:20,wallstreetbets,"I'm confused here. It clearly shows about a 50k cost basis with 19k profit. 50k cost basis for 287 is 188 per share.

2021-06-17 20:29:29,wallstreetbets,"(69,420 - 19142.95) / 267 = 188.30"

2021-06-18 15:14:51,wallstreetbets,"The number of shares is in the screenshot.  


He bought at $188 and took the screenshot @ $260, it's now $217 - so that $19k gain is now less than $8k."

2021-06-18 18:22:08,wallstreetbets,"He already did!  That screenshot is from when GME was $260!  His gain is down to $6,600."
2021-06-18 00:03:59,wallstreetbets,"$260 a piece is all it needed on June 2nd. I’m not posting my cost basis because you can calculate that yourself from deducting the profit from the $69,420."
2021-06-17 21:32:10,wallstreetbets,For now.
2021-06-18 00:05:49,wallstreetbets,Short it then.

2021-06-18 09:59:00,wallstreetbets,Well it’s obviously well into a correction as it’s down almost 50%. I do think it’s broken at the moment but I really keep my focus on the main event which at the moment is AMC. Sorry I don’t have a better answer
2021-06-18 18:35:37,wallstreetbets,It was a joke. And where did you get $6.600 from?

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$UWMC Undervalued 🚀 🚀 🚀 🌙 🌙 🌙 A Look into $UWMC Tells Us it's Undervalued - A Company with Strong Financials and Operations

[UWMC](https://utradea.com/stocks/UWMC) holds a strong reputation in the mortgage lender business which in turn translates to their large market position in the wholesale channel. With their continued growth from the market outlook, I expect to continue to see strong financials aided by their operational efficiency and their strong IT infrastructure which will help to drive their market share higher.

## Company Overview

**United Wholesale Mortgage Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ:** [**UWMC**](https://utradea.com/stocks/UWMC)**)** is a wholesale lender. The company underwrites and provides closing documentation for residential mortgage loans originated by independent mortgage brokers, correspondents, small banks and local credit unions. The company offers its broker partners direct access to dedicated in-house mortgage advisors as well as their own teams of underwriters and closers. It also provides training, technology, marketing support and more to help its entrepreneurial partners.

For the last 6 years included FY2020, they have been the largest wholesale mortgage lender in the U.S by closed loan volume, with approximately 34% market share of the wholesale channel.

**Strategy:** Operating solely as a Wholesale Mortgage Lender and thereby avoiding conflict with partners, independent mortgage advisors and their direct relationship with borrowers. By not competing for the borrower connection and relationship, they believe they’re able to generate significantly higher loyalty and satisfaction from clients.

## Market Opportunity

* Residential mortgage loan originations continuing to grow
   * Federal Reserve reports residential mortgages to represent the largest segment of the U.S consumer finance market
   * In 2020 annual residential mortgage origination volume reached $3.7T and an average of $2.2T over the last 5 years
   * Mortgage Bankers Association forecasts residential mortgage debt to increase to $12.4T by the end of 2022
      * An increase from FY2020 value of $11.1T
   * Loan origination volumes are continuing to shift to non-bank originators
      * Since 2008, non-bank originators have grown from 32% of the loan origination volume to 79% in 2020
      * Traditional banks have since reduced their footprint in mortgage origination
      * Non-bank originators and servicers have been able to meaningfully grow market share
   * Steady home appreciation driving higher mortgage purchase volume and increased residential mortgage loan originations for purchases

## Investment Thesis: Operational Excellence and Strong Revenues

By focusing solely on the wholesale channel, it provides UWMC with a differentiated, client-centric business model that allows for scaled, efficient and centralized processes and the ability to focus on high-quality loans. FY2020, UWMC closed approx. 561,000 loans, with an average submission to clear to close turn times of 17 days. With an average of 9.8 loans per month per production team member, UWMC outperforms the industry average of 3.5. At this rate, UWMC is able to capture a bigger market share in the growing industry, and in turn, generate attractive financial figures and returns for shareholders.

**Revenue:** In the 4QFY2020 alone, UWMC reported a net income of $1.37B- nearly half of their total net income in 2020. This was approx. a 700% increase YoY (2019-2020) and is expected to continue to rise given the industry outlook and opportunity. UWMC has a clear advantage over its competitors when it comes to operational strength, balance sheet and their liquidity and further enforces their position if there were to be drastic changes in the market that would add to uncertainty (as discussed in Risks)

## Investment Thesis II: Strong IT Infrastructure

UWMC’s own technology platforms and exclusively licensed technology allows them to support clients and borrower to provide a “best-in-class client experience.” Their variety of full-service technology platforms is offered to independent mortgage advisors and helps to deliver closely managed end-to-end experience for the borrower from origination through closing. Because of this, their technology platforms give them a competitive edge, helps to drive customer retention and offer the ability to efficiently and quickly achieve closing on loan originations. It is primarily due to their technology that they are able to achieve the faster-than-industry average for closing loans. As well, the technology helps to drive brand recognition and brand loyalty because of their personalized marketing tool offered to the independent mortgage advisors.

## Risks

**Their financial performance is directly affected by, and subject to substantial volatility from changes in prevailing interest rates.** A rise in interest rates and increased inflation expectations in the U.S could lead to stagflation in the coming years. As interest rates rise, refinancing generally becomes a smaller portion of the market as fewer consumers are interested in refinancing their mortgages (refinancing makes up 75% of their mortgage volume). In the mortgage loan business, higher interest rates may also reduce the demand for purchase mortgages as homeownership becomes more expensive. These could affect their financial position and the results of their operations.

**Their financial performance is highly dependent on the U.S residential real estate market conditions.** The U.S residential real estate industry is seasonal and highly affected by changes in general economic conditions. Economic conditions such as interest rates, slowed economic growth, unemployment numbers and wages affecting borrower’s income and ability to make loan payments directly affect UWMC’s financial position. Negative market conditions can lead to a decrease in loan originations and will result in lower revenues- or lead to an increase in loan delinquencies this increasing UWMC’s expenses for loans serviced.

## Valuation

Using a comps analysis, I found 6 companies of competition to UWM Holdings. Given their recent IPO, I found it hard to estimate revenue numbers and use EV/Revenue to further value the company.

**P/S Ratio:** Using a P/S multiple of 4.27, I arrived at a fair value of $15.23 representing a 50.88% upside.

**P/E Ratio:** With the P/E ratio, I arrived at a fair value of $28.27 representing a 179% implied upside.

**Using a 50/50 weighting system, I arrive at an estimated fair value of $21.75 which would imply approx. 115% upside.**

## Final Thoughts

Given the market opportunity, strong financials and the strong IT infrastructure UWMC brings, I think the company is positioned for solid growth in the coming years. By solely focusing on the wholesale channel, the company offers a competitive edge and presents operational efficiency in generating high-quality loans while also meeting the growing demand. Going forward, I hope to see increased revenues on their ER and also a changing social sentiment to help drive this stock forward (Reddit sentiment take from [here](https://utradea.com/feed))

There are also a lot of calls expiring, potentially ITM for quad-witch (we'll have to see how this shapes up). There is a potential gamma squeeze in the cards.

2021-06-18 11:36:05,wallstreetbets,Okay now  I know there is some shilling going on with $UWMC. This post looks like it was taken right from the bloomberg website. And it's the second one I've seen in about 2 minutes

2021-06-18 08:23:49,wallstreetbets,Come on don’t be such a pessimist. They’ll get to 11.59 surely. Then plunge to 10.
2021-06-17 22:44:36,wallstreetbets,"I dunno. ""Operational Excellence"" comes with figures and makes a proper case, ""Strong IT Infrastructure"" sounds like company PR without sources. The lone quote in the section (""best-in-class client experience"")  is unattributed.

The ""Valuation"" section refers to ""6 companies"" (EDIT: tickers in images I see now). Are they subject to the same interest rate risks? Are their business models comparable? How do UWMC's risks stack up against forward interest rates, or the Fed's dot plot? If the Fed says they're going to be raising in 2023, how many people will be refinancing then?

These aren't rhetorical questions, and they're not questions I have answers to. I have a small position in UWMC (mostly for FOMO innoculation) but this post doesn't really move the needle for me."

2021-06-18 07:31:22,wallstreetbets,What do the mods have against $UWMC? It's a 15 billion market cap so it's not like it's a penny stock

2021-06-18 00:49:24,wallstreetbets,1421 @ $8.56. This needs to close above $10 tomorrow for all of the ITM calls. I might add some shares in the morning.

2021-06-17 23:36:06,wallstreetbets,It will come sometimes in drips though hedges know paper hands don't have the patience though
2021-06-18 12:40:59,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. Options are great, I loaded up on them but volume is what it's going to take. This stock is severely undervalued but with a few heavy volume days it would really take off."
2021-06-17 21:03:44,wallstreetbets,Buy shares to boost your calls. Can’t go tits up!
2021-06-17 20:55:23,wallstreetbets,Lmao get got

Edit: (mandatory rocket emojis)🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"
2021-06-17 23:26:32,wallstreetbets,"Actually there were multiple attempts to submit posts about this exact issue, but they kept getting deleted by mods and the OPs finally gave up. One post that I saw right before deletion was literally the barebones data and an explanation of what FTD meant, with no commentary or editorializing. Still deleted. No idea why. 

I was actually shocked to see TWO posts about UWMC make it through the filter/mods tonight. Everything has gotten nuked the last few days. But I’m glad these got through, and hopefully we see some reasonable volume tomorrow. We should, because I think UWMC is one of the better plays right now!"
2021-06-17 21:23:54,wallstreetbets,So what you’re saying is buy more calls and shares….
2021-06-17 20:05:57,wallstreetbets,this ^^
2021-06-17 20:15:21,wallstreetbets,i think it’s gonna hit 12 tmrw. looking at all the calls everyone’s buying tmrw and all these shares. the june 18th calls are cheap rn and everyone gonna pick them up.
2021-06-17 22:34:32,wallstreetbets,"Don't know why but this got a chuckle out of me. 

You could draw two lines like that on any chart convince yourself its going to continue going up."
2021-06-18 13:43:17,wallstreetbets,Annnnnd it wasn't.
2021-06-17 23:39:28,wallstreetbets,Exactly cause they are a wholesaler
2021-06-18 07:08:54,wallstreetbets,"Interest rate hikes mean no more refis. You go from 30% refi business to 5% refi business and all you're left with is first and second mortgages. Rising interest rates also mean (a) people can afford less, and (b) people who financed at rock bottom would have to move down in house cost to maintain their current monthly payment, which depresses demand in the move-up market. 

It's a lowering effect on the future total business across the industry. Which is why there's short interest. If you have the backing it's cheaper to short than to buy puts and there's no expiry. 

UWMC is a good, solid, dividend-paying stock for an octogenarian that wants steady value and income. But that's about it."
2021-06-17 23:41:23,wallstreetbets,Part of mine are printing now...I also gambler on a hirer strike on a few others... Cause this is a casino
2021-06-17 23:44:33,wallstreetbets,Depends on the brokerage.. It could be at 4:01pm or buy 9:30am Monday morning that they call on the account... But they'd realistically need to cover before EOD Friday/tomorrow
2021-06-18 02:44:03,wallstreetbets,Just because something is in high demand and the prices are climbing higher doesn't mean it is about to crash.  Do you think inflation and/or fear of future inflation has anything to do with current high real estate prices?  There is a reason it's called REAL estate.  Why do you think there will be a real estate crash in Canada?
2021-06-18 01:48:26,wallstreetbets,Bagholder spotted!

2021-06-17 20:55:21,wallstreetbets,give me any good reason. i bet it’ll hit 11 tmrw at least hopefully 12

Some of us started trading in February/March and wanted to learn from out mistakes and not fomo into some overpumped stock with our nuts hanging out.

You clearly haven't been here that long UWMC has been on this forum for months. Not as long as amc, gme and BB but it's been steady DD on this stock since March."
2021-06-17 21:54:23,wallstreetbets,"Alright. Lets assume that hes shilling. I have just one question, how much of it is true?"
2021-06-17 23:30:21,wallstreetbets,Been in out of it since Feb... Great stock and for calls set it and forget it trading... Volume makes it move quickly... Paper hands day traders get thier lunch eaten by the hedges and thier 🍌 eaten by the uwmc investors taking the rest.
2021-06-17 21:37:46,wallstreetbets,"It's really getting sad how much of the DDs on here are shill write-ups.  
I hope UWMC takes off... but from everything I have seen so far if it does it pops to mid teens. Then crash back to earth in the 7s and 8s."

Look at the economy and hyperinflation.

2021-06-18 10:05:15,wallstreetbets,Of course their cheap. They expire in less than 24 hours. Pretty much no extrinsic value left...

2021-06-18 09:20:09,wallstreetbets,"Currently the interest rate of buying a house in Canada is below 1%. If the interest rates from the Bank of Canada increase even to 1-2%, people’s mortgage payments are going to skyrocket, because they bought a house during a pandemic when rates were predatory to save the economy.

Now that things are getting back to normal, and Canada is leading the charge of vaccines, I see the bank of Canada raising interest rates sooner than later.

In fact there’s an article here that talks about rates in the US, at least, increased by 2023. That’s not far off. And as we know, Canada follows US moves closely. [Federal Reserve Officials Project Rate Increases in 2023](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/16/business/economy/fed-meeting-inflation.html?campaign_id=60&emc=edit_na_20210616&instance_id=0&nl=breaking-news&ref=headline&regi_id=76475603&segment_id=60864&user_id=1d5018a087ae3465a62b080157ab67a9)

The market is hot, and realtors know this. They are making crazy amounts of commission, along with their partnered brokers.  Most of these people just want to put a deal through before everything goes to shit.

In my area, there are empty houses. Lawns over grown, and no movement around the properties for months. 

It’s a shit show waiting to happen, and I anticipate it to be bigger than the 2008 market crash.

In fact, Hamilton, Ontario is considered to be more expensive to live than LA. Fucking LA.  Let me tel you, Hamilton is NO LA. https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/affordability-canada-1.6034606"
2021-06-18 01:39:03,wallstreetbets,"that's a joke, right? people not paying their rent means owners not paying their mortgages, insurance, or taxes. it's extremely bad all around. that's been happening for over a year."
2021-06-17 20:56:37,wallstreetbets,"Been hearing that same argument for 4 months. It’s a pump and dump, always was, always will be. The current pumpers are the bag holders from last time. You should always look back at least 6 months into what’s been posted about a stock and you can easily pick out the pumpers."
2021-06-17 20:57:35,wallstreetbets,"That being said it may fluctuate some and if you get out at the right time then profit is there to be made, but that’s exactly the definition of a pump and dump. This isn’t a long term profitability stock"

2021-06-18 00:55:09,wallstreetbets,So you're unironically a retard?
2021-06-18 00:23:15,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah... it is painfully obvious.   
The humorous thing is most of those downvoting are in another breath ""fighting the man"" while unwittingly helping ""the man"" make even more money (at their expense).

I actually own 400 UWMC so if this pumps and dumps I'll actually be one of the winners... but the number of bagholders this will cause next week kinda makes me a lil sad."
2021-06-18 00:59:49,wallstreetbets,Not everything is a conspiracy. People catch on to a stock that jumps and post more to add fuel to the fire. How is this shocking? I see GME and AMC comments in your post history. Are you angry if someone posts DD on a stock besides those two because you got in at the top?
2021-06-17 23:15:19,wallstreetbets,"I don’t really think it’s “weird” when something is being pushed. Everyone of course has an agenda and positions. People aren’t sharing their good DD for free to be your pal or earn fake internet points, although I do like my fellow redditors and updoots. But DDers want money, and telling people why a stock is undervalued is a great way to spur the stock’s value in the right direction. I invested in UWMC because I think the stock is super solid and going to make me money eventually. The details in this DD are many of the same reasons I bought in. It’s true. UWMC is undervalued and has a lot of short term and long term potential. I want to see others buying in and embracing the stock, which I see as a win-win. Good DD makes people want a spot on the boat, and then the rising tide lifts our collective ship.  The one caveat is that sometimes people certainly try to escape their shitty positions with a pump/dump, or hyping up with bad DD. Not the case here. This stock is pretty well accepted as a good play, even if in the long term. If I felt like the stock was a stinker, I wouldn’t tell people it’s a good buy (and I certainly wouldn’t keep throwing my own money at it). This isn’t a meme stock with basically no intrinsic value. It’s a value play that may have meme-like upside.

Long story short. I don’t think this is the work of a shill or anything malicious. It’s just intended to do what good DD does—everyone buy the stock! There’s good reason to!"
2021-06-17 22:54:12,wallstreetbets,I am thinking the same thing and think the downvotes are funny

2021-06-18 01:09:03,wallstreetbets,Damn another one. Fuck this is crazy
2021-06-18 00:27:13,wallstreetbets,"For the last hour I’ve been looking through different accounts on WSB. It’s insane how many just started shilling certain stocks. It’s a big elaborate set up. No wonder the media keeps sending people here. 

These people are going to hell for sure. This is the devils work

And I’m not even religious"
2021-06-18 02:17:51,wallstreetbets,"These guys got so much tin foil in their hats, its interfering with their brain waves.  The shill witch hunt is just a sad and desperate way of saying ""only my stock is allowed"".  Both gme and amc are currently way overvalued, UWMC is still well undervalued.  And I'm talking value as in how much money the business earns, not how many people know about the name"
2021-06-17 23:56:48,wallstreetbets,"Interesting. You’ve been on Reddit for a year and only started talking about stocks 8 days ago. 

You’re a shill 😂 That’s why it’s not weird to you"

2021-06-18 09:18:01,wallstreetbets,Lmao touche.
2021-06-18 02:03:48,wallstreetbets,"Mortgage forbearance ending is bad for mortgage markets, but evictions moratorium ending is good. I don't think we'll see as large an effect from mortgage forbearance ending as people think. 

Mortgage companies have been buying up these loans from the govt like the new sub-prime and selling them on to investors. If they can restructure these mortgages by working with borrowers to get back to current status or by re-amortizing with a new extension essentially creating the ""31 year mortgage"" they can repackage these loans at a pretty nice profit.

Furthermore, the mortgage companies that initially issued these loans in forbearance have already eaten much of the losses from them over the last year as reduced cash flow or by selling them off at a lower rate to the repackagers I mentioned above."
2021-06-18 00:10:25,wallstreetbets,i don’t have to post about all my positions to be able to point out the obvious

2021-06-18 01:51:39,wallstreetbets,"Hello fellow human, I also like this stock"
2021-06-18 01:54:44,wallstreetbets,Im way too lazy but I hope someone screenshots all the made up accounts. Going through clov accounts and 70% of the posters have never posted on any other page. Most are within 6 months (I know I am but this was to remove my friends from my financial posts on my other account). Sadly looks like mum and dad investors will be the ones who lose
2021-06-18 00:36:54,wallstreetbets,"Since this is only seen if a user expands it let me add this:

\- you are correct in what you are seeing. I started seeing the same about a month ago.

\- look at how the media now reports on what wsb meme stocks are running at

\- heck... I'll take it a step further and read about ""meme"" stock performance as top headlines on brokerage websites

\- you either need to get in early and cash out or sit on the sidelines during these pumps. Otherwise you are just replacing the bagholders of 6 mos ago."

2021-06-18 02:12:39,wallstreetbets,"selling the dog shit sub primes to investors, eh? ""work with borrowers"" eh? what kind of fantasy land would the market be living in with that. MBS aren't even accepted as collateral from a number of banks for anything. the FED couldn't buy up all the worthless mortgage debt even if they wanted to. the market is about to lose a whole lot of value real fast. especially anything related to real estate."

And bam out of nowhere they have a super long, very detailed post about a company and it’s always the same companies BB CLOV UWMC CLNE. 

They could be bots, or existing users that were bought. Either way unless you got in low, don’t listen to anything on here. 

I feel like I’m in some weird ass simulation and no one gets it. Fuck this place 😂"

Good luck in hell bud. This karma will not be good if you meet god"

2021-06-18 00:21:15,wallstreetbets,yes you are unintelligent
2021-06-18 03:11:34,wallstreetbets,Leave. No one cares my dude. This place is a meme and anyone who takes it serious is retarded. This isn’t a Wall Street brokerage or an economics class. It’s people that wanna throw money at stocks with like minded people telling them where they puttin their money and why it’s a good idea.

2021-06-18 05:30:36,wallstreetbets,"Lol ok so lets say what you are saying is true.  So im just some greedy asshole taking away from other greedy assholes who are too dumb to realize the system is rigged.  So we are both are going to hell but at least I'll be wealthier here.

Yeah I'll take that side of the coin."
2021-06-18 02:48:09,wallstreetbets,"not the case anymore? pfft! says who?

notice I typed **some banks** can't use MBS as collateral. Bank of America and all of their affiliates fall into that set if banks. the same restrictions don't exist for others. this suggests some institutions are more guilty than others. 

also, there are numerous news stories coming out now about literally **the same thing** happening in CMBS for years up to now."
2021-06-18 00:23:49,wallstreetbets,I read your post history

2021-06-18 08:22:05,wallstreetbets,Except it probably isn’t. What makes anything you post different from what someone else posts? People said anything except GME was bots back during the GME craze. Just cuz y’all don’t like the stock don’t make it shills or bots
2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,$GE clinched another turbine deal. 
2021-06-17 20:05:40,wallstreetbets,The folks hold and never sell GE forever so that should be good enough reason alone.

2021-06-17 22:01:23,wallstreetbets,Did you get back in?
2021-06-17 23:18:28,wallstreetbets,I bought at $6 held for 12-13 years or so and just sold this year at $13.  I didn’t lose money but there were a lot of better plays out there.  And back then they even paid a bigger dividend.  But yeah it is pretty safe.
2021-06-18 00:03:23,wallstreetbets,Every time ge has a turbine deal news they go down
2021-06-17 22:20:44,wallstreetbets,Sadly... at $0.04... now worth $0.01

2021-06-17 23:14:30,wallstreetbets,Oh boy hope you hit a big one soon
2021-06-18 03:18:34,wallstreetbets,"F class has turbines are very old and low profit. Plus GE has a history of selling gas turbines for a loss, so any profit will come under the maintenance contract many years after it starts operation.
Also, an F class turbine in Australia will likely operate on cyclic operation instead of base load, so the profit is probably going to be delayed even more than normal. Selling an F class is not bad news, but it’s not anything which is going to affect the share price by itself."

2021-06-17 22:21:38,wallstreetbets,Not that crazy. There’s a huge technical gap at $29-$30. These gaps almost always get filled. I’m surprised it’s taken this long
2021-06-17 20:35:05,wallstreetbets,Exercise a bunch of those beautiful bastards! I think you are right about we could hit 27.xx next week before falling back. Sold my CCs mid July at 28.

2021-06-17 20:41:19,wallstreetbets,I just assumed you were ballin like that (I certainly couldn't exercise very many of those) maybe sell some and exercise others? Well whatever you decide congrats and fuck you on the 2nd successful pltr play
2021-06-17 20:44:28,wallstreetbets,"I will exercise what I can afford when PLTR gets to 27-28, I will almost certainly do what you mentioned in selling other options to gain buying power. Fuck you too 🤝"
2021-06-17 20:36:12,wallstreetbets,If you bought AMC yesterday you would be up $5 to $10 a share. You can trade PLTR sideways if you really think thats a yolo. I tried that for 2 months and gave up. I will wait for PLTR to dip back down in the 18 to 20 range before I buy again.
2021-06-17 20:39:09,wallstreetbets,"If I’m gonna lose my money it’s gonna be in the hands of a semi-respectable company with a business model I can hop on bird with.  Not a meme stock or meme coin, although I do admire what you guys are doing lol"

• Rob Wiesenthal, BLADE Air Mobility’s fearless CEO, will happily wear all the hats that the company needs him to, while not needing to validate his tedious, hard work by taking credit for everything.

• That Rob Wiesenthal and BLADE Air Mobility’s fearless team of management executives will do whatever it takes spread the word about the budding 10-figure UAM industry (proj. for 2050) in order take this innovative transportation company to the stratosphere of success.

• Rob Wiesenthal, BLADE Air Mobility’s fearless CEO, will proudly own up to and stand behind anything he does, while the scrutiny of the blood-sucking media stares him down, in quest of global glory. 

• That BLADE Air Mobility (NASDAQ: BLDE) should have a price target of ♾, as there is no telling just how far this group of leaders will go to take their company to the next level.

2021-06-17 22:38:20,wallstreetbets,"With rates not going up anytime soon, I fear for this YOLO.  Inflation right now is because the supply chain was shut off and pent up demand from stimulus checks.  I think the FED is probably right with its transitionary viewpoint and I believe commodities will come back down and metals will just play in range for a while.  Hope you make $$$ but this is a scary bet…after seeing what happened yesterday/today to gold and industrials.   The rotation back to tech seems to be on again.  🤷‍♂️"
2021-06-18 00:10:39,wallstreetbets,I think this may work out

2021-06-18 17:16:00,wallstreetbets,Inflation + fed not raising rates until 2023 at the earliest.
2021-06-17 20:06:43,wallstreetbets,It’s not at ATH but its as high as it ever got in 08 i think.  It will pop when everyone realizes the economy is perma-tanked and Russians steal their digi-dollars
2021-06-17 20:14:28,wallstreetbets,I hope so. I'm only up 17% but I'll likely cash out soon. Idk if I'll buy more. My other hold stocks are up 500-1K%. They're my favs.

2021-06-17 21:02:52,wallstreetbets,"Not really, it’s safer. Just a bit more expensive. You could buy ones that expire sooner for higher reward but also higher risk"
2021-06-17 21:59:22,wallstreetbets,only a SMALL portion of apes get their calls to succeed.  The vast majority of us lose 100% (or close) of our bought call positions.
2021-06-17 20:10:24,wallstreetbets,"I've been dabbling. But nothing like this hahahah. If you want to try it just read up a little and then buy something cheap (you can't lose more than you spend when buying calls) 
I started with a few that didn't cost more than $30 each, that worked so I just kept at it. 
Had some great luck with Wendy's wish and cline during last week's pumps"
2021-06-18 12:15:30,wallstreetbets,Start cheap with a couple of contracts and observe trends on that particular stock (ie charts). Also make sure you have enough funds to cover those contracts incase you exercise. Not financial advise.😳
2021-06-18 14:02:13,wallstreetbets,Surprised WSB don't know about financing? Unless you mean asking your wife's boyfriend for a $50 loan... I wonder what kind of bank bread you can get with a Wendy's paystub and a '93 volvo for equity...

A  shill is a hustler or con-person who tries to convince other people to buy something or think something is great (shilling). ... Many dictionaries maintain that shill comes from an older word, shillaber, a noun with the same meaning as shill and with an obscure origin.  
  
I'm doing the complete opposite.  Actually you are the one shilling you dumb ass. This is what happens when idiots hear about wsb from the GameStop stock in February and join.  I miss where there weren't so many actual retards here."
2021-06-18 00:00:17,wallstreetbets,To buy OR sell something... That is the meaning that it has now

Like I said, I do not claim to not be a dumbass, but I am educated.  You seem really upset for some odd reason?  Whatever, all this anger is coming from your own frustrations.  Get it out.  Life may get better for you, and I hope it does, but behavior like this is not going to lead to improvement for you"

2021-06-18 00:20:32,wallstreetbets,Maybe buy some shares instead of being a retarded pig?
2021-06-18 00:51:58,wallstreetbets,"Why don't you sell some calls at a higher strike and collect some premium while you're waiting.

I, personally, would wait into Monday and Tuesday of next week... If you're getting upward momentum I would sell them and switch over to shares or move to October, Even if I had to take a small loss... I really do not like how they added these weekly options.  I feel like we're going to be able to get pinned like Viac.  If the SEC rules do anything then hopefully we won't be trapped, But I'm a bit more risk-averse than a lot of people here. 😂

There was always a massive price gap between July and October so I always thought the original plan was to wait and move this bad boy up after the July calls expired.  Albeit, This was before Wall Street bets was part of the picture.

I own the $5 and 7.50 strikes for a couple different dates.  Most of mine are for December."

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why I bought Puts on $Wish: They are being sued for misleading investors. Position: $40k in puts

**The complaint alleges that ContextLogic’s IPO registration documents materially overstated the company’s business metrics and financial prospects. Specifically, the IPO registration documents touted ContextLogic’s exponential monthly active user (MAUs) growth, claiming its then 108 million MAUs was a key driver of revenue growth.**

**In reality, by the time of its December 2020 IPO, ContextLogic’s MAUs had declined materially and the IPO registration documents failed to disclose this known trend reasonably likely to materially impact ContextLogic’s profitability.**

**On Mar. 8, 2021, Context reported disappointing 4Q 2020 and full year 2020 results, disclosing its MAUs had already “declined 10% YoY during Q4 to 104 million.”**

**Then, on May 12, 2021, ContextLogic announced poor Q1 2021 results, including another 7% drop in MAUs to just 101 million, and the company slashed sales guidance for Q2 2021.**

**These disclosures caused the price of WISH shares to decline sharply.**

**“We’re focused on investors’ losses and proving ContextLogic overstated MAUs and concealed known trends,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.**"
2021-06-17 22:04:54,wallstreetbets,"... You realize that law firms filing class-action lawsuits against publicly traded companies is nothing out of the ordinary. ROKU, FSLY, FUBO, DKNG, SQ, ETSY, etc., etc. have all been hit with by these no-name firms once or twice before. These lawsuits are commonplace. If this were an actual event, most newsfeeds would be talking more in-depth about it, but they're not--because it *is* a non-event. It surprises me people *still* fall for shit like this--any time a lawsuit is filed against a company retard bears will spam like they found the next Enron. Nothing will come of this lawsuit.

You bought puts on a non-event on a stock that's bouncing off its lows, trading -50% from its IPO price, and slowly achieving meme following.

If I were you, I'd sell those puts and give that $40K to me. Do you have the Cashapp? Thanks."

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"AMD heading to MARS!!!... ETA SOON!!! - Next Stop: Galaxy limits! # Dear Crew, this is your Captain speaking.

On your left, you can see the moon, which we are about to pass.

Our destination is still MARS (thanks to Tesla & Elon adopting AMD's APU's and GPU's).

We expect an EARLY ETA thanks for the J-Powell tailwinds. Dr. Lisa Su is still thumbs up!

Recent events provide a **HIGH degree of certainty** that AMD’s **MISSION will be successful**.

Namely:

**1- AMD Genoa (Zen 4) to have 128 cores (256 threads) winning the DATACENTER (INTEL admits)**

AMD was already taking market share from Intel in the datacenter, but the latest leak (from the reputable Jim of AdoredTV / **HE's BACK!!!**) has Intel’s own internal presentations **admitting AMD will EXTEND the LEAD** in the Datacenter (screenshot below).

[Leak from the reputable Jim of AdoredTV - The Scottish king is BACK!!!](https://preview.redd.it/aajw3pq5bw571.jpg?width=1299&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e3bcd4f06a39c9bdae4c233fe7fb2e2c1ee81d1a)

Watch his latest video analysis here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNs432VgxmQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNs432VgxmQ)

His confirmation tweet here: [https://twitter.com/AdoredTV/status/1405161144843739148](https://twitter.com/AdoredTV/status/1405161144843739148)

In  essence, one should expect that if core count is going up for Zen 4  (from 64 to 128), at the VERY least, consumer chips will go from 16 to  24. Furthermore, Threadripper **Zen 4 will be a BEAST**.

&#x200B;

**2- AMD 6900XTX LC (liquid cooled) spotted.**

AMD already achieved the #1 World RECORD in FireStrike last month, breaking 3300MHz in a 6900XT.

[https://www.techpowerup.com/282216/radeon-rx-6900-xt-overclocked-to-3321mhz-breaks-firestrike-world-record](https://www.techpowerup.com/282216/radeon-rx-6900-xt-overclocked-to-3321mhz-breaks-firestrike-world-record)

However,  that is NOT their BEST chip. Thanks to better bins, there’s the 6900  XTX which is liquid cooled, with faster memory, higher clock speeds and higher TDP. **A MONSTER!!!**

[Latest super bin model spotted 6900XTX... a RECORD BREAKER for sure!!!](https://preview.redd.it/74prhnfabw571.jpg?width=1154&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=02bc05241e25485be5db87fa98c24ed94ce5a290)

This new model is expected to **BREAK ALL GPU** **WORLD RECORDS** once again.

**3- AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution to launch with 44 game developers.**

Latest leak from Vegeta (@Broly\_X1) published by videocardz.com has AMD launching FX SR on 7 games **next Tuesday**,  with 12 games coming SOON and 44 game studios CONFIRMING to support  AMD's FX Super Resolution (Capcom, Electronic Arts, Ubisoft, Warner  Bros., Valve, etc.).

This is **AMAZING** news.

In essence, ADOPTION is **already a SUCCESS**. Software developers will push AMD FX SR to GPUs, APUs, Consoles and mobile phones (e.g. Samsung Galaxy S22).

[44 developers already backing AMD FX Super Resolution!!!](https://preview.redd.it/lufh7pwfbw571.png?width=1309&format=png&auto=webp&s=2af3cb2219e4ca6071d681d04fc24db0633db79a)

**4- Xilinx acquisition update: UK regulator to respond within 3 weeks.**

The  Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) of the UK is planned to provide  a phase 1 decision on July 6th in connection to AMD’s acquisition of  Xilinx.

[https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/advanced-micro-devices-inc-slash-xilinx-inc-merger-inquiry](https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/advanced-micro-devices-inc-slash-xilinx-inc-merger-inquiry)

As per Jim Cramer’s Mad Money Lighting Round **YESTERDAY** (see video below) he expects the acquisition to trigger the stock to breakout and keep soaring.

[YESTERDAY - Jim Cramer confirms expectation AMD to SOAR after Xilinx](https://preview.redd.it/7kj8xnfjbw571.jpg?width=1272&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f87b2c5ebce97700f0b35c488154ac25334821f)

**5- AMD AM5 platform to launch Mid-2022 (Zen 3 stacked cache CPUs by end of 2021):**

As reported by RedGamingTech, AM5 is expected in Q2 and AM4 B660 in Q1.

[https://youtu.be/u2UWG-vE9cQ?t=195](https://youtu.be/u2UWG-vE9cQ?t=195)

In  essence, the AM4 will be the most successful platform in modern desktop  consumer history, with a new chip coming, with up to 15% performance  BOOST vs. AMD's AMAZING Zen 3 (5000 series).

But THAT'S NOT ALL, as in Mid-2022 Zen 4 is expected. With higher IPC, in the 5nm process, DDR5 RAM memory support and MORE CORES!!!

**To recap:**

AMD to continue **LEADING** the DATACENTER: **Check - all systems go!**

AMD to break more records with new GPU launch: **Check - all systems go!**

AMD to successfully deploy FX Super Resolution Software: **Check – all systems go!**

AMD to continue soaring with Xilinx: **Check – all systems go!**

AMD upcoming launch on track: **Check – all systems go!**

# Stock was up today 5.55% as we continue ACCELERATING!

# Guys.... prepare for a BREAKOUT warp jump!!!"

2021-06-18 04:27:13,wallstreetbets,"I fully agree that AMD is a great stock and I’ve been in since $24. I believe that it’s mirroring the Nvidia growth and will reach $xxx given enough time. But I feel that what you’ve mentioned with exception to datacenter is not really a catalyst for propulsive growth. Adoption of the Zen 3 and RDNA 2 chips in the new Tesla plaids are great for advertisement. But this is their “entertainment system"" in a car. Increasing consumer chip core count (while it would be nice because more core = wow factor) is not going to be helpful to the regular Joe’s. This will just drives power consumption and create more heat, deceasing overall performance unless you have a beefy cooler. AMD has done a great job at showing Nvidia that they are here and are competitive. This will drive competition but Nvidia has been very conservative with their internal R&D roadmap when compared to AMD. Overall AMD needs better catalysts, for example a competitive autonomy product to Nvidia. More investment and product in HPSC specifically AI. I think these things will be their next step now that they’ve created a solid foundation to grow from. But these things take time and you are probably looking more 3-5 year time line before it really gets to Mars. Personally I say buy AMD but it’s not exactly a GME or AMC."

2021-06-18 09:39:58,wallstreetbets,"You think more cores does nothing?... read what the VP of engineering from Epic Games (Unreal Engine 5) are saying about Threadripper CPUs.

[https://community.amd.com/t5/blogs/amd-partners-with-epic-games-in-unreal-engine-5-early-access/ba-p/473407](https://community.amd.com/t5/blogs/amd-partners-with-epic-games-in-unreal-engine-5-early-access/ba-p/473407)

If your argument on core count were correct, we would still be running 4 cores and 8 threads, paying $500 for a high frequency chip. Today, you can run 16 cores in your consumer desktop, or up to 32 in Threadipper.

Anyone doing serious CPU tasks will tell you just how powerful having more cores is.

Even Intel admits in their own internal slides that Genoa 128 will EXTEND the lead... and there's **NOTHING** they can do about it.

Just wait until AMD brings MCM (multi-chip) designs next year, with RDNA3, to the GPU market. They are already expected to increase performance by 2.8x vs. the Navi21 chip (6900xt). It will be the **BIGGEST** generation jump in GPU performance history **EVER**.

I'm just saying that to a regular Joe who buy pre-build gaming PC or someone that's on a budget, who's happy gaming 1080p/1440p at mid/high settings. these super high core count CPU are not going to be in the affordable range near term. This is why most pc gamers are still on 8 core/ 16 threads and new games are only now starting to scale with cores. AMD and Intel will get lucky with people upgrading to their respective revised sockets (AM5 or what ever LGA- des Intel is gonna use) but beyond that overall adoption will take a while (3-5 years). 

You have to scale in that chip shortage is expected to last for another year at least and the more complex the fabrication get the more expensive the product gets. 

Intel have admitted and most analyst sees them taking at least 5 years to catch up to AMD , I agree. And I am sure we are going to see generational leaps for both AMD and Nvidia in terms of GPU performance.

2021-06-18 01:55:00,wallstreetbets,"Seriously, WTF are you talking about???...

AMD released SmartAccess Memory (SAM) with better implementation than Nvidia and also have SmartsShift for the laptop space. They have recently launched the Asus G15 Advantage edition at $1650... with the best mobile CPU and a 6800M (using both SAM+Smartshift).

They have 44 studios backing AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution. We are talking 44 studios!!!... NOT 3 games they have to bribe a developer to justify some stupid RTX rip-off TAX.

AMD FX Super Resolution is **FREE**... available to everyone. Even RX 400's GPUs from 2016!!!... How is NVIDIA more consumer friendly???

AMD is **NOT** launching a 3080ti at $1199... which is frankly, **RIDICULOUS**.

Just look at the flak Linus is getting for attempting to sugarcoat supporting a stupidly priced product.

What ""consumer"" pays an extra $500 for +8% performance over a 3080??

Seriously, when you write ""Switching"" what are you switching from/to ???

You'd rather a 3080ti @ $1199 (12gb) vs. 6800 (16gb) at less than HALF the price ?!!?

FOR WHAT???... So you pay $1500 for a 4080 next year???... And then see AMD's MCM RDNA3 leave that crap in the dust???

The 6900XT is setting WORLD records all over the place. Just go an check.

I call bullshit dude, you're full of it and got caught. You aren't ""switching"" anything other than a stupid argument which you are making up.

Any informed consumer is buying AMD... because they have the BEST CPU, as well as a the best value GPU to go with it (not to mention the 5700G and 5600G APUs, which are the **CONSUMER KING PRODUCTS**).

Next Tuesday a total 44 developers will officially confirm supporting AMD FX SR.

But when you're on BOTH... as well as the Aya Neo and the upcoming Valve, you're talking about hardware leadership, NOT fanboyism.

Microsoft and Sony don't pick their hardware based on fanboyism. They bring the fanboyism to their brand through marketing.

APU's have the potential to satisfy people who can't afford a $800 GPU.... India, China, Malaysia, Latin America and the rest of the developing world (more than half of the world population **FOR SURE**). I wouldn't count them out, as they want to game too. Not to mention money conscientious people in the developing world.

Your 9900K 5ghz all core must be great to keep you warm during the winter season. And if you think that the 10 series and 11 series are pretty much the SAME thing, **THAT ALONE** should give you a hint of how much INTEL is improving every generation. Zen 3 with stacked cache will mop the floor with their current generations... and Zen 4 will leave everything in the dust.

Only 3 CPU's?... Yeah, sure. Provided you forget Threadripper.

Funny how the DIY market has the 5600X CPU ($ 297) as a Top #10 in sales for months... yet the 9900K, 10900K and 11900K are MILES BEHIND.

You think it is fanboyism???... or could it be that the educated consumer doesn't want to pay for an overpriced motherboard with a poor upgrade path to get less performance? (frankly, your argument alone could be considered fanboyism).

Given the current GPU market, I'd rather a 5700G than a 9900K... and I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one. More than half of the planet would make the same choice. It's purely an FPS/wallet decision.

Not paying $800 for a discrete GPU ensures you are free from ""fanboyism""."

If you want to keep your DDR4 RAM, you can consider AM4, which is already the most successful chip-set in modern history.

If you're happy spending money on DDR5, sure... go for AM5. Zen4 is going to smoke everything out there. Once again, AMD is only competing against itself in the enthusiast CPU market. I can't wait for Threadripper Zen3... which is likely delayed due to the shortage (it's all going to EPYC right now).

But just imagine that sometime next year you could get a Threadripper with 128 cores and 256 threads. That's just nuts. Any video editing/rendering would accelerate by an order of magnitude.

2021-06-18 10:10:42,wallstreetbets,"i'm not pos. i wont write the full name of the card every time.

i upgraded my 960GTX that i bought in 2013 when i built my AMD FX8350 system. have had the AMD system since then and love what AMD has done over the years. Dr. Su did a great thing with AMD, their CPUs are lower power and their GPUs are competitive against nvidia.

what i find odd is i called you out and you get pissy about it.

how about changing your name to MrObviouslyWrong!!"
2021-06-18 10:13:46,wallstreetbets,"Dude, I wrote an article about 5 recent events involving AMD.

You came to write a complaint about something you don't wish to sell. Use the Radeon Report tool and bugger off!

Seriously, just like the Radeon Report tool isn't to write a reddit post for WSB... why are you here writing product complaints???

GTFO"
2021-06-18 12:15:05,wallstreetbets,"Only complaint was the audio issues I'm having. 

I never said your post was shit. I've been an AMD fan since I built my my back in '13.  I love that they can maintain a socket for x years.

Not sure why your angry, maybe you need professional metal help."
2021-06-18 13:31:23,wallstreetbets,"It's a simple concept: you are bringing up something irrelevant in a forum that covers the stock price of a company. Your particular problem with a specific unit is completely unrelated to any of the 5 issues I've brought up in my post.

And precisely because I realized a while back that you just would not get it, I immediately suggested you either raise the issue with the Radeon Software tool (the proper channel to raise your issue) or you sell the card for more money than you paid for it (essentially profiting from your problem).

Hell, you could also RMA the product and see if the issue persists with a new one... but let's face it, you just won't take a hint, because you want everyone to know something irrelevant.

Any audio issue you have could be a compatibility issue, a software issue or a just a hardware glitch with your motherboard. This forum doesn't cover any of those topics, as you most likely already know.

As a result, I'm not exactly sure what you were attempting to do when contributing your comment. It is probably more helpful if you bring it up at Church this weekend with your priest and see if praying could solve it.

If that doesn't work, you might wish to consider professional technical help... although you might want to do something about those comprehension skills too.

I wish you the best of luck solving your hardware and software problems."
2021-06-18 13:42:00,wallstreetbets,"if the software is horrible the hardware is less likely purchased.  this happened before and it still plagues the image of AMD GPUs.  even on reddit you'll see people complaining about the driver issues.

the complaint was also a statement that the company isn't perfect and still has room to improve, in this case there's still a driver issue (at least for me and a few others).

i could RMA the card, however, the issue is when will the item be returned to me? i've read post with people saying they've waited months for RMA since the GPU shortage started, so who knows when/if I'd get the GPU back."
2021-06-18 13:54:34,wallstreetbets,"You've discarded the option that there's something wrong with the rest of your hardware. Welcome to 2021, NOTHING in our universe is perfect.

Everything can be improved... but it takes effort, NOT laziness.

And by laziness, I'm including you not using the Radeon Software reporting tool, not checking if you need a software bios update, or testing the card in another system.

Don't RMA the product. SELL IT, I'll buy it from you... how much you want for it?

If you did just a bit of research, you would realize that the problem you have described has already been **detected and ADDRESSED** (people in the San Diego bay area that have dealt with the problem). All you need to do is jack-it and restart. **It is basically a manual overclock & overvolt which your system obviously requires.**

Here's the link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKwW8PNZpOQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKwW8PNZpOQ)

2021-06-18 17:41:26,wallstreetbets,"my nvidia 960 had no issues. DDU, remove card. insert 6700, installed drivers, and i have issues.

clearly it isn't previous hardware that had the issue. 

bios update. lol the system is from '13. the last bios update is from '18."
2021-06-18 18:15:13,wallstreetbets,"Here's another video (this time it is official from AMD, no joke)... it has almost 300k views since last week. Amazing what TressFX can do. Put the video on loop and use the headsets I recommended earlier.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnR5BBNxzHs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnR5BBNxzHs)

If you ask me, the silicon shortage is obvious. A bit more silicon would certainly help on the front-end user interface... the more the better. A handful never hurt anyone... motor-boating is always important.

Give it a shot, as it can certainly help increase the bandwidth and load/download.

Hopefully it helps jacking your 6700xt and keeping your complaints to a minimum.

Make sure to dust-off your joystick and try to get a couple of head-shots. Have some tissue at hand... you don't want to ruin your electronics with your hardware output."

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"A deeper look into my $ASO  

I’ll be honest this is my first SWOT outside of a class that I didn’t do particularly well in so it probably won’t be great. That being said I’m not too worried cuz I’m pretty sure most of you retards don’t even know what SWOT is.

$ASO

**Strengths** – I won’t spend too long on strengths because honestly there have been a lot of great DD on ASO, which I’ll link below.

The tl;dr of strengths is: ASO is a company in a booming outdoors stores sector with strong fundamentals that has been blowing out earnings and steadily rising since they IPO’d last October. They have a below 10 P/E and sell guns/ammo in the south (as someone who used to live in Texas I know that y’all southern motherfuckers love your fucking guns).

[DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o18a7j/hunting_bears_with_aso/) by [u/TSLA\_WHISPERER](https://www.reddit.com/u/TSLA_WHISPERER/)

[DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o14jei/aso_this_week/) by [u/Hyptisx](https://www.reddit.com/u/Hyptisx/)

[DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o1xxd9/get_your_aso_in_here_a_long_term_performing/) by [u/absolutcity](https://www.reddit.com/u/absolutcity/)

[DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o1h53n/aso_some_sloppy_toppy_due_dickigence/) by [u/mypenismychoice](https://www.reddit.com/u/mypenismychoice/)

**Weaknesses** – The same way that gun/ammo sales set ASO apart, it also could be its downfall. Gun rights are a huge hot topic in America. Regardless of how you fall on it politically, anything gun related has chance of being badly hurt by gun regulation. This is also a reason to be cautious about expansion of ASO. Although they have been great about careful and controlled expansion, their heavy involvement in gun sales could affect expansion to more regulated states. We have also seen a huge pullback in outdoorsy companies like ASO, BGFV, DKS and others the past 5 days, with ASO dropping 7% in that timeframe.

**Opportunities** – This dip is a great opportunity to buy in, if you believe in the company. Before an earnings report that beat EPS expectations by 128%, the share price was 37.78. Today it closed at 37.77. It seems almost inconceivable to me that we don’t see significant growth in the coming weeks. Although I don’t rely solely on price targets, their average price target is around 45 across several different analysts. In a recent investor’s conference, they also discussed the possibility of dividends as they continue to expand and reduce debt and increase profits. We are coming out of a pandemic that will most likely drive people outside as well as increase the need for sports equipment, potentially increasing sales (although this is a double-edged sword I’ll explain below).

**Threats** \- Surprisingly, ASO has been greatly benefited by COVID. ASO was shorted pretty heavily at first because the general thought was that an outdoors store would be wrecked by COVID. In reality the pandemic caused a crazy increase in home gyms, treadmills, bikes, etc. This was a main driver of the blowout earnings ASO has reported the past two quarters. These pandemic-driven sales will obviously fall to the wayside, so if sales in other areas don’t pick up the slack we could see a slowing down in earnings and revenue from ASO stores.

I honestly don’t really give a fuck if you buy ASO. I do think that ASO will continue to rise and that this is where safe money goes. I have no problem with pump and dumps, I think they are great ways to make a shit ton or lose everything, like the casino this is. If that’s all you wanna do with your portfolio, good for you, lambo or wendy’s bitch. ASO is a stock that will give you consistent and significant gains in the coming months, so I don’t want y’all to bitch at me that I didn’t warn you when I post my gain porn. And hey, if I’m wrong I promise to post my empty portfolio so it’s a win win for you bloodsucking bitches anyways.

2021-06-18 14:01:03,wallstreetbets,"As I said in reply to another DD, the short interest is what I find interesting for a company with such solid fundamentals.  It's surprisingly high.   To me, that seems that $ASO could pop on a short-squeeze when the fundamentals require the shorts to eventually cover, which could be for some great upside.  Alternatively, it could mean they know something $ASO that we don't."
2021-06-18 09:21:50,wallstreetbets,"Guys, help me understand the play here, I would think that the pandemic drove ppl to these stores, buying stuff because they had nothing else to do with quarantine. Now with that lifting, and those big recreational purchases already made, I have major concerns about ASO continuing this upward trend.

Edit: typo"
2021-06-18 09:42:30,wallstreetbets,"Haha I mean..yes I did mention that. You're right that there will be a loss of sales from home gym equipment. But there are a lot of things that were limited or not available during the pandemic. We expect to see a boom in team sports, golf, tennis, even hunting. You also have fishing, exercise wear, camping, etc. I do agree that this is something to be wary/cautious of BUT these stores were around long before the pandemic AND have learned to adapt to online sales so I don't see them dying out once people are actually allowed to travel and go out again."

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"BABA is the biggest sleeping giant 🚀🚀🚀 Disclaimer: Turn away if you believe that BABA is going to be broken up because Ma hurt some feelings over Ant.

I personally discredit claims that BABA is in significant danger due to Ma's comments. Ant was dramatically overleveraged, and regulators stepped in to prevent a collapse. https://www.techbuzzchina.com/newsletter/signup/extra-buzz-19-ant-group-the-biggest-ipo-that-wasnt?fbclid=IwAR3T9V0ThoGj3W-vS3e-TCZJ1wpyKXJkmBZoUXLYeMBIpBcaMy1COgw2Qbs

Now to BABA, they trade at 27 times earnings. Coca Cola, the trusty dividend company, trades at 28 times earnings. Forward PE is even more egregious. BABA has sturdy competition in its retail business from Pinduoduo and JD, but BABA operates a platform with ancillary tools to keep merchants there, giving staying power. BABA is the leader in the transition to cloud (47% in 2019 according to Canalys). BABA is the inversed Amazon in terms of profitability. BABA makes money from their retail platform, doesn't get into the weeds, and is currently sacrificing profitability for market share in cloud.

Furthermore, BABA has stakes in a wide range of logistics and consumer service companies. Even after appropriately discounting ADR and BABA being a Chinese company, to me it's criminally undervalued trading at a lower multiple than companies like KO while having clear future growth. Would love to hear how BABA deserves this low multiple.

TLDR: BABA has growth in cloud, even after writing off their retail growth, with stakes in many companies, acting as a counterweight to the giant Tencent, all while trading at a lower multiple than companies like KO.

Edit: Tomorrow is the biggest online shopping event (618) in China! 🚀🚀🚀"

Or even part-time. I just think there's more to life and not THAT many hours in the day. I don't even play video games at all, not that there's anything wrong with video games.

I just don't think traditional work is as virtuous as our culture makes it out to be. It's a brain washing.  Someone even responded to me that I lack ambition because I don't go to work... Lmao... Really??!! I still have lofty financial and creative goals. What a limited mindset to think I have to go work for someone else in order to be... I don't know... Worthwhile? 🙄

2021-06-17 21:27:48,wallstreetbets,"Or close OTM calls… like $14-16. But yes. Or ITM calls. Then anyone selling them naked has to buy shares to cover, doubling the impact."
2021-06-17 21:31:14,wallstreetbets,"For real, shares are solid. Or just do this exact thing with half as many calls at $12 with a break even around $15/16 which it’s almost guaranteed to hit by jan’22, but $40 is…………… ambitious"
2021-06-17 20:34:14,wallstreetbets,Not really
2021-06-17 21:37:25,wallstreetbets,"They can if they’re ITM or near it. Most of these calls being sold are hedged with a certain number of shares (less than the actual 100) according to the delta value, but  if delta/gamma increases because of increased call volume (when the calls are ITM or reasonably close, which this does.. not qualify) then the large funds selling these calls have to increase their share positions, increasing the share price."
2021-06-17 21:43:47,wallstreetbets,"A call that is ITM or near it doesn’t matter then because it’s ITM or near it. It is functionally equivalent to having the underlying shares with the caveat that it doesn’t have any impact to the stock price as you aren’t reducing available shares. It would have to be significantly past his breakeven, and be uncovered to have any impact, and only on the future stock price, which is equivalent to a purchase of shares. Calls in all situations don’t do shut to affect the stock price unless you’re exercising them and by then you might as well have bought shares to start."
2021-06-18 00:55:30,wallstreetbets,"Well yes, but no. It depends on the stocks delta and gamma. If delta  and gamma values are  low, large movers will sell practically naked calls. When more interest develops and those delta/gamma values increase, it’s necessary for those call writers to increase shares to hedge. Buying calls that are ITM or nearly ITM doesn’t directly affect share prices- but if there’s lots of call volume, this increases gamma which increases delta which increases the number of shares required to hedge. 

So buying the calls doesn’t directly affect share price, but it indirectly does. This is how gamma squeezes occur."

Fidelity kept providing decent service, which is why I moved all my accounts to them."
2021-06-18 00:58:45,wallstreetbets,"Whoa, you're telling me a financial institution... *gasp* took profits?

People recommend Fidelity because they're reliable. Oh, and also because profit-taking isn't unethical (though the die-hards would have you believe so, fucking the hedge fund isn't the *point* and never has been), while stopping *buying* but allowing *selling* is absurdly unethical (and arguably illegal) market manipulation. They're not the fucking same thing, and you're pretending they are."

2021-06-17 23:42:04,wallstreetbets,Talk to us a year for now.
2021-06-18 08:08:05,wallstreetbets,"So... Complete honesty, I think you can't say Robinhood and other brokers ""fucked their customers"" by disabling buying but not selling. To this day, right now, gamestop has not yet reached $400 again, let alone $483. I think buying was disabled before/at the peak, so unless you were actually still buying at $483, you very likely would have made ""some"" profit from selling at the top. And, ultimately, they did pretty much give everyone a heads up that fuckery was afoot when they announced that the buy button was going bye-bye. 

Honestly, their scheme was intended to hurt the short squeeze, not the app users.

But if you want to talk about fucking your customers, let's talk about how Fedelity sold over 9 million shares on January 29th (so when it was at $330?). Yeah. You can't bitch that a bank takes profit. I said you can't even fault them. But when retards like you come defend them when they are happy as fuck to let you bag hold - since it's definitely not like they can see their customers orders themselves or anything and know that their customers are retards who are watching the top from an elevator down - it shows exactly who the fuck is smart enough to make money on the meme stocks.

It ain't you."
2021-06-18 06:55:10,wallstreetbets,The diehards are just morons who bought in over 400 and have now averaged down to 380 and post the same stupid fucking Warren buffet quote ad nauseaum because its alot easier that way than accepting the reality that once one big tremor hits the market this entire sideshow goes to the wayside and price levels to something rational.

2021-06-18 11:06:07,wallstreetbets,"Nah, it's all the same. :) I've been tracking both BB and GME like a hawk for months.

Then if you go to buy it, it has this open interest, delta gamma theta Vega stuff. How tf do you even begin to understand this?

The technicals I like to watch are: 9, 20, 50, and 200 ema’s, MACD, MO, Volume, and RSI. No system is perfect, but I try to enter trades when those technicals all point bullish. And I prefer when there has been a dip and the technicals have just begun to line up again."

Not into the day/week trading for now. But reading watching and learning so thank you for the replies.  Dealing with the IRS has been one of the things that has kept me from messing with it. Along with not enough knowledge about it all. So I go slow and often ask questions some people say are stupid.

You’re doing it right and while some people play fast and loose and lose their entire account, you’re going slow and steady and will win the race. Cruise and airlines stocks were an amazing investment when you scooped them up last year! ETF’s and REITS are also great. And you never have to get into day trading if you don’t want to. Actually, long term investors tend to outperform most daytraders. Have you read about the FIRE movement? They talk a lot about index fund investing and tax strategies. It might be your style! It got me where I am today and now I trade high frequency to keep it interesting because I already ditched the day job."

Zynga, the makers of CLASSICS like Farmville and Mafia Wars and their stock has been quiet for a long time.  Too quiet...

Until I noticed some odd price action on the stock today and I took a second look:

Holy Mackerel what did I stumble onto...then I come across this Motley Fool Article about Is Zynga an acquisition target.  The Fool is often a stupid analyst company (even though they added ZNGA into their top 10) but when there's smoke it's best to check if there really is a fire.

Here's why I was sold:

YOY Revenue: 68%

YOY Income: 78%

Active Daily User (people who use their game once a day): Up 85% (WHAT??!)

Active Monthly User: Up 140%

AD revenue: Up 100%

They acquired Echtra games.......For those of you that don't know.....Echtra is Max Scheffer and his team...you know the REAL brains behind titles like....DIABLO, DIABLO 2 and TORCHLIGHT.....for any real PC gamer I don't think I need to point out how significant this is.

They have some HUGE titles coming out for casual mobile gamers like Starwars Hunters and a Harry Potter game...whatever, they'll print money but who cares.....

I think ZYNGA really is thinking about selling their mobile gaming branch....maybe Microsoft with their xCloud platform that they're pushing hard.

For those of you that follow gaming stocks...GLU shares went up 36% when EA bought them out...

Position: I bought 2000 shares today."

2021-06-18 02:26:27,wallstreetbets,"SEC Form 4 insider filings suggest some pretty heavy buying pressure coming in from $ZNGA officers along with some sales (fewer shares sold than acquired), could this option flow be their orders? This one might pop, options are cheap as fuck with a nice little inflection point up at end of day today. In for 60x 7/16 $12c, this is a 10 bagger if it increases $2

Edit: free float is ~94% of 1.09B (with a B) outstanding shares, which is a pretty fat float. But daily average volume is pretty damn low at 13.5M, so this seems like it could still move. Probably not looking at a $2 increase without a miracle, but the options are so cheap this can still be a fairly easy 2-3x with a little movement and IV bump."

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Just the $TIP. The best inflation play out there What’s up retards. Time for some OG WSB. This isn’t just a random pump and dump on a meme stock, it’s an extremely legitimate play to make some serious tendies in these trying times.

So what are TIPS? Treasury inflation protected bonds. Bonds that go up in value accordance with inflation metrics 

Why is this such a good play? IV is ***dirt fucking cheap***. You can get calls 5 months out, 1$ out of the money, for only $1.50. If the stock moves up just 3% you make double your money on intrinsic value alone. This is an incredibly easy 10 bagger over the course of 5 months

\* (2021-06-11) ""Stornoway makes a profit Mr. LeBlanc gave news of the Renard diamond mine, of the Stornoway company, in the Chibougamau region. The mining company was privatized in the fall of 2019 following financial problems. “The mine was closed, and the workers were at home. \[Its leaders\] presented us with a recovery plan. They had lowered their operating costs to bring them into line with the depressed diamond carat price. We agreed to go ahead with a certain amount of money to revive the mine and its 500 jobs. Today, the price of the carat is on the rise. \[And Stornoway\] generates profit. "" ""

2021-06-17 22:37:07,wallstreetbets,$30 is a great strike price.  My PT is at least $40 and depending on momentum would ride her to $50.. With enough gorilla - hype she could go to $100.
2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Grab your $MAPS, we're going to THE AMAZON OF WEED I saw this post on Reddit recently that turned me on.

[AMAZON OF WEED... you son of a bitch, I'm in](https://preview.redd.it/59angmqvsv571.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=62dc4e595ffc2d3f837cdf3f4232b02908ee846b)

I'm a smooth brain monkey. Here's what I see.

Just look at the volume on $MAPS.

[PUNY. That's because some brokers still aren't allowing the ticker to be traded, or haven't added the ticker to their systems yet. THAT'S UNTAPPED BUYING PRESSURE.](https://preview.redd.it/j1pln5a1tv571.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=37bfb94b3d94fcdcf6c649d761d168ebbdd6bfa1)

And you know what else? Now that the ticker has changed to $MAPS, it's no longer a S P A C which means that ALL of the funds are able to add this name to their holdings. CNBS already has MAPS as its top holding. Just wait for the others to follow.

[LOOK AT THAT COMBINED AUM](https://preview.redd.it/m587qj9atv571.png?width=1502&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0b0f603414234e1dce515f933c1802c45d3b733)

Anyone who is short $MAPS is about to get brutalized. LFG 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

**TL;DR. $MAPS is the BEST way to play the imminent weed boom.**

Position: 15000 shares of $MAPS"

2021-06-18 13:36:52,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely retarded DD that belongs here. Here ask a Canadian about Legalization and how it impacted Weedmaps  


before legalization (and the same year of legalization) weedmaps was huge. Once legalization took place weedmaps stopped... its now only used as a directory here in Canada.  


Right from a snow mexican, youre welcome."
2021-06-17 21:07:04,wallstreetbets,More like amazon is gonna be the amazon of weed if that ever gets completely legalized

2021-06-17 20:25:26,wallstreetbets,It’s a two-sided market place not just a delivery service
2021-06-17 21:47:33,wallstreetbets,weedmaps is to the cannabis industry as to what netscape was to the internet
2021-06-17 21:45:54,wallstreetbets,shopify would have already started if they were serious about it
2021-06-17 21:47:04,wallstreetbets,We purchased the exclusive rights to online Cannabis sales in most provinces for a ridiculous amount of money. How are we not serious about it?
2021-06-17 22:06:00,wallstreetbets,"simply because you aren't here in the states already. its that simple. That means shopify isn't planning on it, at least until federal legalization, and by that point, your not only competing with Weedmaps, which you will lose, but a slurry of other emerging software as well.cool thing about weedmaps is they don't have to pay to play like your saying shopify does,

they just are."
2021-06-17 22:21:33,wallstreetbets,"I think you highly underestimate them. It is likely that theyare waiting for federal legalization, and at that point the sheer reputation that Shopify has and the power of the platform which is largely unrivaled will see merchants migrate. They already did in droves for Cannabis in Canada after it was legalised even brick and mortar stores with other ecommerce suppliers switching over. 

Once it's legalised federally, supply will be taken over completely by large corporations that require a platform that supports their scale, and they'll look for a player with a proven track record."
2021-06-17 23:42:07,wallstreetbets,"For corporate level weed suppliers sure. Analogy here is Budweiser. But at that point big suppliers will have their own platform they will be pushing. Even still there’s room for many, and it’s good for the industry. Lysol didn’t stop selling their products at Target because Amazon came through. Vendors won’t stop using Weedmaps because Shopify arrives. They will use both, or whatever has most attention, which will be Weedmaps. Getting situated right this very moment is crucial to gaining that preemptive market 
share, Weedmaps is already deep in the game. Right back at ya, Don’t underestimate Weedmaps."
2021-06-17 23:58:07,wallstreetbets,"I won't argue with you that vendors won't stop using Weedmaps because Shopify arrives but they will for sure see an exodus at the corporate level where what they need from the platform just cannot be provided elsewhere, but the main point I originally replied to was that they'd become the Shopify of Cannabis, which they won't. That will be Shopify. It already is in Canada, and it will be in the US. There was an established Cannabis scene here before it was federally legalised and a bazillion dispensaries, and the moment that happened and Shopify stepped in it took off despite the existing presences at the time. The amount of questions Shopify gets from existing US Cannabis retailers is insane. There is room for Weedmaps, but it's not going to be at corporate level which is where the bulk of revenue will come from."

Watch those fake gains ripple away, buy to close the calls on the dip for a loss. Sold remaining stonk for 1% profit. Amazing. Only three more times and that's 4% gains a year"

Wedge has been tightening. Any upward movement and it could be headed up big time. I feel like it’s sideways tomorrow. Then if it pops, it happens next week. I just can’t bring myself to buy in. But I’ll be watching."
2021-06-17 23:24:33,wallstreetbets,"This is why I think the current market is a scam:

1. When the market crashed in March of 2020, we actually pumped on Fed support because the market is ""forward looking"" aka the market looked passed the current bad news for future earnings of good news.

2. When the fed announce on Wednesday, they began the conversation of tapering and forsaw two rate hikes within roughly 18 months yet the market said oh well that's so long from now anything could happen or change.

To summarize, the market is only forward looking when it is convenient for the bull case, but it's not when it would support the bear case.

Scam mania, that's all this is now."

I keep yoloing , fomo-ing and playing FDs losing a shit ton of money for the next couple years. I find a hit a tenet style turn style and keep living backwards through time.

I have a log of all my old trades I made to lose all that money the past 5 years so I start from most recent to oldest making the reverse move at the exact same time. Building massive wealth as I live backwards in time.

Now 10 years older but back to the same date I originally started trading I have the sum of cash that I’ll lose over the next years. I hit another turnstile putting my life back in play and buy massive amounts of GME FDs like I’m DFV at with my future lost but gained tendies and become sick wealthy because I know from my past the exact date and time GME spikes.

So yea I’m losing now but it’s so I can get Rich and then wealthy in my later years.

To my future self that’s 10 years older than me living somewhere else in the world rn reading this thread on your fat stacks thanks to the money I’m losing for you to multiply... throw me a gold so I know it’s real."

With A flash of light and several yelps the bears dispersed and ran off into the woods. 

SPY opened her eyes and tried to focus them in the light to see her hero. JPOW takes his hand and gently brushes the market’s hair out of her eyes. She blushes. 

“Thank you for saving me from that terrible position. If he drilled another 7% I would never have been the same.”

JPOW looks deep into SPYs eyes. The energy around him shifts from a calming familiar friend to that of a sinister deviant. 

SPY senses she’s not out of harms way. She winced as JPOW leans in to her ear and whispers: “I put on my robe and wizard hat.”"

And it works! NET goes up last week, I sell the calls for a little over break even and feel relieved...but it was on shit that has still had 30 + 60 DTE...then I didn't buy the covered calls back either...

So yeah...lots of facepalm realization and regrets today when NET goes 100+...I could have just been holding those calls this whole time and kept an eye on them and even bought the ones I sold back yesterday for almost break even.

I will not sit idly by as deep pocketed, pleated pants wearing, cancerous human beings attempt to SHORT a company clearing the way for affordable healthcare. I am going to pump every bit of paper I can muster into a company that is clearing the way for a better future. I’d rather die poor with an ounce of fight left in me than die rich while others suffer financially just to live another day. CLOV isn’t a meme.

2021-06-17 21:36:22,wallstreetbets,"Hey guys can someone tell me why this trading strategy is retarded? 

So every Friday, on options expiration day there’s tickers like MVIS for example has puts that go for the minimum of 5$ premium expiring that day 1$ out of the money from whatever the price is at open and then 1$ less from whatever the high of the day is. 

MVIS as the example usually moves about 1.50$ + or - on just a normal day not even counting the wild days it’s known to have. 

So the strategy would be to find like 10 of these tickers that behave roughly the same way, puts that are above the average day to day movement  of the stock being sold at a broker minimum premium price and buy like 20 puts on each ticker every Friday so 100$ invested on each ticker 1000$ total and let’s say MVIS moves it’s daily average in the negative 1.50 and you got puts at 1.00 below open you’re 10xing your investment making it all back if just one of them hits. 

Please tell me why I’m stupid."

I personally believe the chart shows reversal back and beyond the once ATH of $36. The company sells shit products from China online makes money from merchants and shoppers. Products are cheap it’s like the Amazon dollar store or Ross. Shipping time is usually 1-2 months but they are working on expediting that by using more distribution centers. Revenue increases each year their expenses consist of a shit ton of marketing which will slowly be reduced as the customer base keeps growing. Positive cash flow also.

If it goes to $12.50, $13, $14 I think this thing could rocket on up to $50+. If it drops below $10 then I think stay away."

2021-06-17 20:09:42,wallstreetbets,Ok so CLOV. In case you dont know how shorts work 48% short means there is a 148% of float out there. At all times there is essentially 200% of float in exsistence due to how shorts work. It is essentially a cloned share. If retail bought the 148% and doesnt sell it back to the shorts they would be completely caught offsides. For contrast the VW squeeze happened with 10% short of float. Porsche refused to sell their shares so shorts could not cover. It went to 1000.

I still struggle with alcohol, and would hop back on my old adderall habit in a second if I still had a source for it even tho I haven’t had any in 2 years. 

If your friend really wants help, tell him to go to a good 28 day rehab and it will definitely be worth it. The withdrawals from coke are really not that bad and only really suck for the first couple days. Once you get clean for a couple weeks you realize how fucking expensive coke is for the short lived high."

       Veil'd Melancholy has her sovran shrine, 
               Though seen of none save him whose strenuous tongue 
       Can burst Joy's grape against his palate fine; 
His soul shalt taste the sadness of her might,

With A flash of light and several yelps the bears dispersed and ran off into the woods. 

SPY opened her eyes and tried to focus them in the light to see her hero. JPOW takes his hand and gently brushes the market’s hair out of her eyes. She blushes. 

“Thank you for saving me from that terrible position. If he drilled another 7% I would never have been the same.”

JPOW looks deep into SPYs eyes. The energy around him shifts from a calming familiar friend to that of a sinister deviant. 

SPY senses she’s not out of harms way. She winced as JPOW leans in to her ear and whispers: “I put on my robe and wizard hat.”"

2021-06-17 20:53:58,wallstreetbets,What do we say to the WISH bot? Not today.
2021-06-18 07:38:37,wallstreetbets,WITNESS MEEEEEEE
2021-06-18 08:21:54,wallstreetbets,Bots in here
2021-06-17 23:44:28,wallstreetbets,Far out in expiry OTM
2021-06-17 23:43:31,wallstreetbets,Basically just long dated calls. Like 2022 or 23
2021-06-17 23:43:50,wallstreetbets,Long dated call options. Watch YouTube or buy some and learn the hard way.
2021-06-17 23:49:19,wallstreetbets,You LEAP from a precipice after you “Diamond Hand” them into worthlessness
2021-06-17 23:48:08,wallstreetbets,"Long-term Equity AnticiPation Securities.  It's literally a call option but with a fancy acronym because a lot of people buying these calls don't want to feel like they're associated with degenerate gamblers.  Even though they're degenerate gamblers buying basically IOUs from people who actually have capital.

It's like when they call a strip club a 'cabaret', not fooling anyone"
2021-06-17 23:45:10,wallstreetbets,Leap is when you jump like a bit further
2021-06-17 23:44:15,wallstreetbets,"They are options at least a year out.

And ban."
2021-06-17 23:45:50,wallstreetbets,"Long dated call. Higher premiums because you have so much time for the price to move. Leaps are great because you don’t have to time them as well as weeklies or monthlies. Find a stock you like that’s beaten down, i.e. DG when it dipped a month or so back to like $170/180 and buy slightly OTM or ITM leaps and ride that shit to Valhalla.

Leaps are great for getting into a stock you like without the gamble risk of short-term options or tying up a metric fuck ton of capital to buy shares.

My portfolio is mainly stocks and leaps. I buy leaps when I like a stock, but probably wouldn’t hold for a long time. I get exposure and won’t get absolutely ass fucked if I time it wrong."
2021-06-17 23:46:09,wallstreetbets,"You’re literally already on the internet. Just google it lol

Basically just ITM Calls with 1yr.+ expiration with a 0.9+ delta"

DD on $STEM

Stem Inc. ($STEM) is an energy storage company focusing on battery storage systems, network integration, and battery optimization. They brand themselves as ""the first pure play smart energy storage company to go public"" - a lot of fancy words words I know but bear with me

First, let's take a moment to quickly understand how battery storage works. Battery storage is a type of energy storage power station that uses a group of batteries to store electrical energy. This is primarily used in the renewables space with solar and wind energy. In recent years battery storage (and in part renewable energy) hasn't seen the exponential growth that many are expecting due to limitations in battery technology and high development costs.

This being said, recent developments of battery tech and reduction of costs have now made battery storage much more feasible at the commercial / industrial level. Battery storage still has ways to go in the residential space due to risks that come with it.

https://preview.redd.it/xy2e3iml1yb61.png?width=2230&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8c903a5ac25ef5d70ad9993880886010df73d32

While battery storage has improved, it will not be stand alone solution for many years to come because it simply isn't feasible with our global energy infrastructure. Battery storage will work with our interconnected grid to reduce imbalances between energy demand and energy production.

Ok, so now that we know how it works, what does the market look like?

* All major global markets are forecasted to double over the next decade
* Over the next decade, the US market is expected to grow at \~45% CAGR and the global market is expected to grow 31% CAGR
* Future tailwinds with improvements in the regulatory environment

https://preview.redd.it/7x98ssvk1yb61.png?width=2236&format=png&auto=webp&s=94e525ba6bab348a408ec2b59297d03cbcf5b896

Great, so how is $STEM revolutionizing this space? They are doing so by providing a ""one stop shop"" solution for utility companies. Stem's solution can provide integrations with hardware (batteries) and the grid (network), while also using an AI powered software solution to optimize their energy storage.

https://preview.redd.it/ljxci0lu3yb61.png?width=2208&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2728140badcbc979109ce3c895f65d3e6057b26

Their solution could possible replace other pure play companies in the value chain which is key.

Interesting, so let's move on to their AI software called Athena. Athena is an operating system for energy distribution and storage systems, collecting big data that enables customers to alternate between onsite generation, grid power or battery power.

https://preview.redd.it/gdctb7fs1yb61.png?width=2230&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9d3265db7fc1978a56bece0b8cac1385bac36f1

Athena is a HUGE part of their value proposition and truly could be revolutionary. It is a large part of their moat, as they have 24 issued patents for it (so no competitor can replicate it).

Now, let's move onto their financials. First, it's important to understand they have a hardware and software business

* Increased rev from $17 mil to $33 mil YoY, expected to increase to $147 mil in 2021
* 81% CAGR from 2020-2026
* Gross margins have hovered around 12-18% since 2018 but expected to increase to 40%+ by 2026
* 90% of forecasted 2021 revs are from closed executed contracts (not pipeline!) -> underpromising and overdelivering
* Software revenue expected to account for 30% of total revenues by 2026
   * $14 mil in 2020 -> $240 mil by 2026
Yeah 
https://preview.redd.it/9mzekzoz1yb61.png?width=2224&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b5311875074372dab260a03471227a503c31641

A majority of their revenues are from their hardware segment but it will be interesting to see how Athena contributes to their financials moving forward. They need to execute yes, but I'm confident they can do so given it has been in development for 5+ years, and they have continuously improved upon due to years of data collection. They might have used this time to validate Athena with their customers and now feel comfortable scaling it exponentially.

Lastly, I was curious to see how they compare to Tesla as well all know a large part of Tesla's valuation is their energy business. Interestingly enough, they actually use batteries from Tesla, Samsung, and Panasonic. Additionally, they have a partnership with Tesla.

https://preview.redd.it/0xxgetre2yb61.png?width=1376&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb1046d1c13b9ea7363515171e0986eae45fbd0e

In my opinion, this is an extremely attractive play in the renewables space as it is one of the pick and shovel plays in the space. If any of you are interested, my investment thesis is finding the best pick and shovel plays in emerging industries, such as renewable energy, sports betting / gambling, genomics etc. You can follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/enigma3916) for other DDs I have done.

TLDR: Stem is a leading player in the energy storage market as they have solutions to address all major aspects of the value chain. More specifically:

* Large TAM + strong macro tailwinds
   * \~$1.2 trillion in new revenue opportunities for integrated storage expected to be deployed by 2050
   * Battery storage capacity expected to increase by 25x by 2030
* Market leader with best in class technology
   * 900+ systems operating or contracted with Athena
   * 75% market share in CA BTM storage market, largest in the US
   * First mover AI platform that operates with 40+ utilities, 5 grid operators and over 16MM runtime hours
* Highly visible growth
   * Recurring revenue streams provide strong financial position to accelerate growth
   * Revenues projected to grow at \~51% CAGR from 2021 to 2026

Hope y'all enjoy! Long $STEM

One more thing, according to John carrington. (Ceo) all of there 2021 revenue is locked in contracts, there already working on 2022 revenue 


Now for the Elon Musk fanboys/people who don’t like to read.


https://youtu.be/JY1Fymr9lHQ


Elon musk said the 3 most important things are EV, solar energy, AND ENERGY STORAGE (watch vid above at 0:30)


ELON MUSK is building the batteries to store renewable energy, $STEM uses there software on Tesla’s batteries/and other batteries that makes them smart batteries

$STEM has more sales then Tesla/any other competitor (leading the market) by using third party batteries from Tesla. So to have more sales it must mean there software is pretty damn good as there literally using batteries from others. 

This industry is going to be huge, we need to store renewable energy as the sun doesn’t shine at night, and wind isn’t always blowing.

This stock is a baby 4bill market cap, has the most sales in the industry that’s expected to 25x (over 1.2 trillion, YET $$STEM is leading the industry), and patented software with years worth of data 

$STEM YOLO FUCK TON OF SHARES


ALSO HERES A PHOTO OF STEM INC PARTNERING WITH TESLA ON A BATTERY PROJECT. There software is the real deal, and will be placed on batteries all over the world.

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Tomorrow's Quad Witching Day might actually be the perfect storm for this UWMC Gamma Squeeze on the 6/18 calls First things first, a gamma squeeze is when there is a shitload of options open and expiring ITM forcing a bunch of shares to be bought up and causing the share price to go up and then triggering all the options at the next strike to exercise, it's a snow ball effect, combine that with approximately 20 percent short you could get a mini short squeeze too. 

Now, Quadruple witching refers to a date on which derivatives of stock index futures, stock index options, stock options, and single stock futures expire simultaneously. Quadruple witching days witness heavy trading volume, in part, due to the offsetting of existing futures and options contracts that are profitable. Gamma Squeeze, plus mini short squeeze, plus Quad Witching expiry day which only happens once every quarter? Sign me up. 

Sooooo here is where it gets juicy, UWMC has over 40k options open at the 9c strike and another 40k at 10c, and another 40k at the 11c thats approximately 4 million shares that have to be bought if the share price is over 9... which it is, 8 million shares if its over ten... which it very well could be, and 12 million shares if it tests 11... all that would have to be bought sometime tomorrow to cover the open calls.... This is a perfect storm, Low IV too, seriously look how cheap the 6/18 10c on UWMC and see how close to the money it is? It's a no brainer. There is going to be heavy volume tomorrow and UWMC is going to snowball all the way to 12, I think it peaks out around 12.40 tomorrow up about 25%

TL;DR UWMC is gonna moon over 12 tomorrow, buy buy buy buy"

2021-06-18 03:03:55,wallstreetbets,"You really shouldn't just eyeball the options chain and come to conclusions.

Tomorrow will see massive negative charm -- meaning that as options come closer to expiry, their deltas will approach zero. How do you delta hedge against a zero delta? You sell shares.

That being said, gamma is rather high right now. So price movements in either direction can ""coast"" a bit due to deltahedging. Further, *vanna* is pretty high at the current price point (but gets less the higher up you go)... so a ""vanna squeeze"" is possible. A 1.5x spike in IV (from you apes buying loads of options) would possibly cause a significant amount of shares to be deltahedged, pushing the price up. However, at about $11.00 charm starts to become more of a factor than vanna, so that's where I'd probably cap the possible movement. (Unless there are other catalysts.)

I noticed this last night after seeing RKT's option chain looked insane. So I checked UWMC, sure enough, it's fairly wild. Not nearly as much risk/reward as RKT. RKT has a better set-up, and the FDs are dirt cheap.. it's at like 10th percentile historical IV cost, meaning FDs would pay off hugely, and that IV would be easier to pop (causing vanna squeeze). I think 10-baggers were quite possible there. I was going to write a DD on it, but was busy today... and the only way the trade works out is if you guys pile in and buy FDs.

So, yeah, RKT would have been a much better target... but give UWMC a shot if you want, it's not a bad choice and I'm eager to see the results of this.

Source: The below table takes into account all the options, IV skews, etc, not some retard eyeballing one or two contracts and doing multiplication.

2021-06-17 22:56:01,wallstreetbets,Fair value for UWMC Is 14$ a share. I'll sell if it hits 16; otherwise no reason not to hold
2021-06-18 14:06:22,wallstreetbets,Where's the ban for this idiot?
2021-06-17 20:07:24,wallstreetbets,"Sucks that I bought most UWMC at well over $10, but I just bought 4 more today and waiting on my paycheck to get even more. This is one of the stocks I want to go to the moon."

2021-06-17 22:20:33,wallstreetbets,Quad witching day you say? Easy to spot the new wsb-ers buying into this hype. Witching days are dead days. Hope I’m wrong and good luck to you. I want to see lots of gain porn tomorrow to show me how wrong I am. Good luck tards.
2021-06-18 00:11:06,wallstreetbets,I just want to see some chaos like last year. or was it 2 years ago. shit...
2021-06-18 01:48:28,wallstreetbets,Another stock that's gonna gamma squeeze?? Oh boy!
2021-06-18 11:36:39,wallstreetbets,I was told there would be heavy volume and mooning over 12 today.
2021-06-18 13:55:35,wallstreetbets,Narrator: It wasn't.
2021-06-18 10:54:58,wallstreetbets,Well I guess this was a lie.
2021-06-18 10:23:23,wallstreetbets,Lol quad witching again. Y’all are dumb AF.
2021-06-17 20:41:47,wallstreetbets,"All the DD all over Reddit is basically

> fact about the market 

> awful irrelevant conclusion

Why would a stock with no futures, and which isn’t included in an index so no futures index and no options on futures be affected by quad witching?"
2021-06-17 20:32:36,wallstreetbets,Realistic number this could reach?
2021-06-17 21:40:30,wallstreetbets,Nope. UWMC will close between 9.90 and 9.99. virtually guaranteed. Best case it goes to 10.90-10.99
2021-06-17 22:09:21,wallstreetbets,Witch strike should I buy?
2021-06-17 22:32:46,wallstreetbets,Please do. Backwards on some $9 calls I'm not too interested in exercising. Need to hit about $10.25 to be profotable

2021-06-18 08:45:06,wallstreetbets,I'd love to see a quad witching hour actually accomplish something.
2021-06-17 21:24:44,wallstreetbets,"That's absolutely not a Gamma squeeze and not at all how it works. Gamma squeeze is the reflexive dealer hedging by buying shares when Apes buy a ton of OTM options. As the underlying increases, gamma increases and Delta increases which makes dealers buy even more shares and so on.

Do you really think the market makers don't hedge their short call positions until the day of expiry and then have to scramble in the open market to buy shares to assign? They progressively buy more shares as the options get more ITM so as to always maintain a Delta neutral positioning. You boys are playing in the big kids pool with floaties on and your pants on backwards smh."
2021-06-17 22:39:46,wallstreetbets,you newbs need to quit falling for this witching day shit holy fuck
2021-06-18 03:05:51,wallstreetbets,Wasn’t the Quadruple Witching a load of crap last time? I have $10 July calls and $12 October calls in addition to shares…. But the Quad witch won’t fool me again
2021-06-18 07:37:11,wallstreetbets,"0 previous posts or comments on WSB or trading related subs, and now a DD on UWMC…which doesn’t even mention that gamma squeezes work both ways."
2021-06-18 03:52:50,wallstreetbets,On Board lets Goooo
2021-06-18 07:31:37,wallstreetbets,"You know if the calls expiring are close to ITM those shares are already purchased right? And if, let’s say around 3:59pm there’s no chance of those options expiring ITM those shares will more than likely be sold. You think the people who write those calls are stupid? They manage more money than this entire subreddit put together."
2021-06-17 20:32:44,wallstreetbets,That's not how gamma squeezes work you moron. It's not like market makers have done nothing to hedge their position until expiry day.
2021-06-17 21:42:13,wallstreetbets,"I got my Stonks bought, and my Calls ready!  Time to eat my tendies on the moon tomorrow!"

Also, why aren't more people talking about how this will also be included in the Russell 3000? Some banks / hedge funds are projecting a 2M share buy for it. Who knows what will happen, but I'm holding this one for a few months at least (the calls). I'll be holding the shares."

2021-06-17 20:57:02,wallstreetbets,The shares for those calls have probably already been bought/hedged against tho....

2021-06-17 21:15:01,wallstreetbets,Unironic quad witching day on WSB. Any survivors from original here?

2021-06-18 05:25:26,wallstreetbets,"couple things to note here...

1. they DON'T have to be bought by MMs, the moment they passed the strike they have already been hedged against by buying the underlying
2. you need to look at the delta here as the 11$ strikes have mostly been hedged against, in other words, NTM strikes with high deltas are irrelevant for a gamma squeeze but rather OTM strikes with lower deltas"

im hopeful for a squeeze :)"
2021-06-18 08:05:26,wallstreetbets,">Tomorrow will see massive negative charm -- meaning that as options come closer to expiry, their deltas will approach zero. How do you delta hedge against a zero delta? You sell shares.

So this is what you say will cap movement at $11, assuming no other factors?"

2021-06-18 03:01:46,wallstreetbets,Depends on timeframe. $15 after Q2 earnings is very reasonable. It could also gamma squeeze into a short squeeze and triple.

2021-06-17 20:06:32,wallstreetbets,"Isn’t it the case that MM typically only own a percentage of the number of shares sold as calls? And as calls become ITM, don’t MM tend to buy more shares to further hedge against additional increases?

Can’t be hypocritical. Well. People can and are but should take it like a man. You made the choice to sell the call. Plus, you can roll out and up to defend the covered call."

2021-06-17 21:46:07,wallstreetbets,"It's very, very, difficult to dislodge shorts. You're right. This is because the interest fee is divided by the daily. So %fee/365, and you get the interest you have to pay every day.

The difference is that this has been going on for something like 2 months now with an elevated interest rate, and with the buyback there's a floor that's set. 

Eventually, with increased maintenance requirements and a higher interest fee, and heightened and elevated prices, the short sellers are just going to have to bite the bullet instead of doing what their doing which is... Trying to wait it out and have the price come down."
2021-06-17 21:14:49,wallstreetbets,"It’s relevant to the stock price, expiration, volatility, and strike price

2021-06-18 00:20:50,wallstreetbets,"fair enough.

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$PRPL, a DD I wrote on Adderall Disclaimer, my position ($450@$25.05 and 25.09) shares is a small investment compared to some on here, but it's a large investment for me. 

I got interested in PRPL after seeing some chatter and the recent YOLO. I invested first, and decided to write a DD after to see if I'm retarded or not. Do your own DD on this if you get interested. I

Anyway here it goes, your Adderall DD writer is back.

Company profile:
Purple Innovation, Inc. They design and manufacture mattresses, pillows. It also offers a variety of other bed-related products such as weighted blankets for you autists (I couldn't help myself, I'm going to keep this DD serious though). 

The company sells it's products through direct to consumer online channels, brick and mortar wholesale, and third party online retailers - also it's factory outlet and company showrooms. 

Recent news:
- Bullish:

- ""Products will bolster the brand's line-up by offering greater variety in sizing and customization

LEHI, Utah, June 15, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Purple Innovation, Inc. (NASDAQ: PRPL) (""Purple""), the leader in comfort innovation and the creator of the renowned Purple® Mattress, today announced an expansion of its existing pillow product offerings. The Purple Harmony Pillow will now be available in additional sizes to fit every comfort level. The brand is also launching the new Purple TwinCloud Pillow which features cooling, durable, and adjustable support improvements to elevate sleep quality.""

- ""Purple Innovation Inc. said it named Patrice Varni as chief marketing and digital officer.

The mattress company said Ms. Varni has more than 25 years of experience with consumer brands.

Ms. Varni most recently was chief marketing officer and president of online beauty retail company Dermstore. Prior to that, she was chief customer officer at Corelle Brands.

Prior to Corelle, Ms. Varni was chief customer officer at Arhaus Furniture. Previously at Tempur Sealy International, she was senior vice president of marketing for Tempur Sealy Brands.""

- Bearish:
- ""Pano Anthos, Director, reported a sale of 17,241 shares in Purple Innovation (PRPL) on Jun 07, 2021, for $500,927. Following the Form 4 filing with the SEC, Anthos owns 9,033 shares of the company, which have a market value of $252,292 as of the prior-day closing price.

In the 90 days prior to the date of this filing, there have been 12 insider transactions reported to the SEC for Purple Innovation.""

Personally I buy a lot of pillows, although I invested on this on a whim I quite like the lineup of products they offer. If they ship to the UK I would consider ordering some myself. Pillows are something I buy quite frequently either for myself or my girlfriend. Anyway that was a quick comment, back to the DD.

""In trading on Wednesday, shares of Purple Innovation Inc (Symbol: PRPL) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 28.7, after changing hands as low as $25.12 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is 56.0. A bullish investor could look at PRPL's 28.7 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.""

We have previously seen a bounce at these levels after March. I'm hoping to see this bounce happen again. 

Ongoing market volatility may be an opportunity to buy PRPL at a good price. Make sure you clearly understand any positions you are entering. 
 
PRPL could soar high as many institutional investors are aggressively trading PRPL backwards and forwards amongst themselves. Be careful to set your exit target, and stop losses if it soars - in order to not get caught out on a crash.

Purple is a mid-cap company with a current market cap of 1.93B. 
The company has Profit Margin (PM) of 0.58 %, meaning that even a very small decline in it's revenue will erase profits resulting in a net loss. This is way below average. Similarly, it shows Operating Margin (OM) of 10.98 %, which suggests for every 100 dollars of sales, it generated a net operating income of 0.11.

The entity has return on total asset (ROA) of 12.67 % which means that it generated profit of $12.67 on every $100 spent on assets. This is normal in comparison to the sector average. Similarly, it shows return on stockholders equity (ROE) of 13.99 %, it created $13.99 for $100 dollars invested by stockholders.

General research:
- PRPL closed strong in 2020, showing top and bottom line growth

- However the market reacted negatively, despite predicted double digit revenue growth in the first quarter. 

- PRPL has grown both its revenue and operating margin since its IPO in 2018. From $200M to $648M in 2020. Operating margin has improved from negative to positive territory, to 5.7% at present.

- During 2020 people upgraded their living conditions at home, this resulted in a 2020 net revenue increasing 51% YoY to $649M. Gross margin also improved from 44.1% in 2019 to 47% in 2020 due to lower input costs.

- 2020 operating expense dropped to 36.1%, this caused a 339% YoY increase in operating income, to $71.2 million. This is stellar performance.

- Management pivoted the company well during the pandemic, as last year direct-to-consumer revenue increased by 83%, and wholesale revenue still increased slightly.

- The pandemic broadened it's consumer base. Management plans to increase this momentum by expanding its retail and online presence:
""With our additional manufacturing capacity coming online, we intend to lean into accelerated wholesale door growth. Our current plan is to add approximately 1,500 new doors in 2021, with a focus on both expanding our footprint with existing partners as well as launching with additional leading regional furniture players.

Now to launching a new e-commerce platform. We have been developing the new design and platform for much of 2020. In order to capitalize on immediate opportunities during the stay-at-home fuel demand, we deferred some of the work into this quarter.""

- Analysts are projecting strong earnings growth for the next two years, with 14% and 28% EPS growth estimates for 2021 and 2022.

Summary:
Purple has been a good investment over the past year, due to rapid consumer adoption of its products. Management continues to invest in growth and expand their consumer reach. This is supported by growth seen before the Pandemic. The recent dip is a good buying oppurtunity. As always, do your own DD. I'm just an autistic woman who writes DD's when I take extra adderall. 

I will expand and edit this DD as I do more research, but I decided to post it in it's current state as there has been a good dip just now following upwards movement. It's near the price I entered at (but above), but seems to be rebounding just now."

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why I think $MAPS is more than just a weed tech company with an app 


I’ve been following and participating in the cannabis industry for almost 10 years now and have witnessed the landscape change drastically. My insights from participating in the culture along with experience in marketing and brand strategy have brought me to the following conclusion. 

WeedMaps is NOT just a tech company with an app (which will be revamped soon). They are NOT just the “Yelp or Amazon” of weed and they are NOT just a tool for dispensary’s to gain attention. 

If this is all you see, your missing a very key aspect of their business - and that is their ability to drive, maintain and excel the cannabis industry as a whole. They have already proven to be a profitable with the current business model under strict regulations but they will really flourish when we start to see more media, events, and eventually consumption lounges - all curated and executed by WeedMaps. They will also be a key brand leading the fight for social justice reform within cannabis. 

I can’t stress enough how incredible their potential is for taking over not just Cannabis media in silos or within the confines of their app, but instead a full blown, mainstream take over. Documentaries, Cooking shows, commercials, behind the grow episodes, and eventually full fledged original movies.  

Events will be huge in the sense that they will enable consumers to experience cannabis in a whole new way with regulation loosening. They will infiltrate the entertainment and music industry to help catalyst the brand awareness while growing and maintaining relevance. 

The skys the limit for WeedMaps as a tech company alone, pair this with the roadmap to media, events, and eventually lounges? It’s game over. Your looking at a future house hold name with an incredible talented board of directors and new hires as they begin the rebirth of a company that grew up.

“The appointment of Wheelhouse Labs has two primary goals: to embed the brand further into popular culture and combat stereotypes of cannabis fans in the media landscape.”

“Our collaboration with Weedmaps could not be more timely,” said Sanborn, a Diageo alum. “We believe the [entertainment] industry is ready to embrace this bold new category.”

“Weedmaps has an entertainment track record with its Higher Together virtual concerts, first established in spring 2020 in the early days of the pandemic. The brand created a sequel of sorts, Even Higher Together, for the cannabis high holiday, April 20, this year, expanding it with a mini-conference dedicated to social justice issues.”

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I am a Type 1 Diabetic, And I'm Extremely Bullish on SENS I am a Type 1 Diabetic (for the last 16 years), and I'm extremely bullish on SENS.   


DXCM is trading above 400 rn. In 2009, it was trading right around where SENS is today (i.e. $3-4). Don't get me wrong: I think DXCM was a major disruptor in its own right and will continue to dominate the market for some time to come. I've worn DXM CGMs; they're nice. They tell you what your blood sugar is on basically a minute by minute basis and can communicate with your insulin pump. I've also worn Medtronic's system, which can communicate directly with your pump to correct high blood sugars with insulin adjustments.   


HERE's the thing!!!!!!!! The DXCM CGM fucking sucks to wear. It's an insane trash fire of an annoyance. You play a game of frisbee or golf or get out of the shower wrong, and it can rip right out. People say you can wear it for 10 days, but you're more than likely gonna be annoyed with it by day 5. Sure, there will be Type 1 Diabetics who will try to oversell you on how comfortable it is and how it changed their life and blah blah. But they're comparing it to the old shit, which was even worse! The DXCM system doesn't change the fact that from a convenience and ease-of-use perspective, you have a small fucking needle in your stomach or arm, that you have to pull out every 10 days. THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER NEEDLE THAT ALSO STICKS INTO YOU FOR YOUR FUCKING INSULIN PUMP. Great, I'm a fucking robot, why don't you put needles in my eyes too and charge me for it? In fact, it would be much better if the CGM connection lasted longer than 10 days and didn't involve opening a dumpster full of plastic packages every time you changed it.   


Oh wait. That's what SENS is. It doesn't tear out. It isn't painful to wear, because it's not half sticking in, half sticking out of your dumb body. It doesn't pop out at day 8. Because it's fucking implanted subcutaneously, you don't have to worry about it. It just works. Or at least, that's the hope and that's what's already happening in the clinical trials. The idea of not having to fuck with changing a CGM for 90 days... or 180 days (if the FDA approval goes through) is insane to me. It's literally unreal. That would be life changing.   


Now, I'm not saying SENS doesn't have a LONG way to go to become a competitor to DXCM or even just like a shitty little annoyance to DXCM. Because it does. It doesn't have the sales pipeline, it doesn't have the DIY aspect, because you have to go to a medical provider to get it in, it doesn't have a insulin pump manufacturer lined up to partner with it. But, if you don't think that Senseonics is thinking about these things and plans to fix them within the next 3-5 years, I think you're not thinking about this right. They've done the strategic partnership with the big Swiss diabetes company Acensia, for sales. They're on the precipice of an FDA approval for a 180-day system; who gives one slim fuck about DIY when you don't have to change much for 180 or possibly 365 days? On the pump partner, we'll see.   


But even making it mildly competitive with DXCM would be a huge money maker. This shit is at 3.59 a share! You'll have a catalyst with the FDA approval, and you'll have another once they start selling into the US market. You'll have more as other strategic partners start to notice what's going on. That's why I am sticking with SENS for the long term (at least 3 years). I'm also pretty sure that's why billionaires like Robert Smith and George Soros and quant hedge funds like Renaissance Technologies are holding millions of shares of this fucking penny stock? Are you kidding me?   


I think if you have shares of a company that can completely eliminate a major pain in the ass for ridiculously large population of fuckers, it will be rewarded. You don't need a gamma, you don't need short squeeze. You just buy and hold value."

2021-06-18 11:14:55,wallstreetbets,This industry needs more competition. I am not a diabetic but many family members are. It is so sad to see that many resort to hacking their own monitoring systems because there are no good off the shelf commercial ones. If sens enters the market it will be good as there will be more competition and thus innovation.

2021-06-18 06:06:49,wallstreetbets,Slowly building shares up…. How fricken cool if it went to $300 eventually
2021-06-17 23:24:14,wallstreetbets,"Also T1 diabetic and I could not be more bearish for the outlook of their cgm. 

For starters, DXCM, PODD, and MDT will continue to dominate the industry. Every endocrinologist in the country knows these systems well; they’re tried and true and insurance has varying coverage on all of them.

SENS comparably is very far away from mass producing an amount that could ever compete with the big three. They’d need to spend millions on demos, education for doctors offices, and doctors will probably opt to wait before diving headfirst. I give that 3-5 years at least before it could be a common recommendation.

What else is going to happen within 3-5 years? Smart pumps. I listened in on DXCM’s latest ER and they mentioned excessive funding toward R&D; probably in longevity/smart pump optimization. Once smart pump systems hit the market the cgm by itself will already be dinosaur tech in comparison. 

Addressing your bearish thoughts on dexcom:

-I have personally never had my dxcm fall or rip off in my life. Not saying it cant happen, but I question if youre using a G4 or earlier (2016 model) because I had that problem a long time ago but the adhesives on the G6 sensors are phenomenal. 

-its not a needle thats in you (that obviously gets pulled out); its a sensor thread and there really isnt any fair way to compare that to what the SENS cgm will feel like. What if it gets inserted uncomfortably? 6 months of any feeling at all would be a prison.

-The G7 is going to be the size of a thumbnail. I already forget im wearing my G6 but making it even smaller is huge for body placement and comfortability for kids especially. 

Can I see SENS hitting $10 someday? Absolutely; it reminds me of MVIS in its pump popularity in industries few people really understand. That being said I would not plan to invest in SENS in your boomer port for example."
2021-06-17 21:13:12,wallstreetbets,"From my understanding, the 90 day sensor is already on the market in the US. Do you think you would take the step and get the 90 day one before fda aproval of the 180?

I got some shares in SENS but id like to hear from a fellow retard if the sensor is improving your life. Maybe even some photos with the device.

Also my knowledge about diabetes requirimg insulin pump is extremely limited but if you can please explain if this is possible, i believe it is very uncomfortable to be stuck with a needle in your body the whole day. If the sensor would send you on your gadgets alerts to when insulin needs injecting, do you think you can not use the insulin pump? Maybe have micro-doses of insulin when alerted? Or you have to do it so frequently it would be impossible?"
2021-06-18 01:41:51,wallstreetbets,Explain username. Please.

2021-06-18 03:26:45,wallstreetbets,!opreport
2021-06-17 21:25:02,wallstreetbets,"I hope in 5-10 years they will move to broader projects,like using their tech to analyze everything blood related, not just blood sugar. That will be a game changer, getting a full bloodwork done whenever you want,share it remotely with your physician,insurance etc."
2021-06-17 20:14:28,wallstreetbets,"This part is key. I’ve seen a lot of misinformation claiming that the current product is only the implant, but the transmitter part makes it relatively similar to Dexcom. No needle, but you still need to wear something on your body with adhesive. If they’re able to perfect an implantable only device I can see it becoming huge, but not until then."
2021-06-18 11:17:18,wallstreetbets,Well depends in insurance covers it or not. I know many transpeople use implantable ones if their insurance covers it as it is a set it and forget it. Easier on their liver and kidney and has better results. I am not familiar with the diabetic implants but it would be good not to have to finick with external monitoring.

2021-06-17 23:41:48,wallstreetbets,Your experience with Dexcom G6 is exactly mine. As long as your smart about prep and placement I can push my dexcom sensor for far over its 10 days.
2021-06-18 06:05:20,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate a bearish POV as I am bullish on the company longer term. Genuinely curious on your opinion, everything SENS is working on now is a small steps to an eventual 360 day sensor without an on body transmitter. Nothing transcutaneous being worn on the skin. The sensor would speak directly to your phone, smart device, insulin pump etc. To me, that’s where the real potential is. Not trying to sell you on it but I’m genuinely on your thoughts on that advancement in the cgm space."
2021-06-18 04:26:15,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely. Every single post that pushes SENS is completely disingenuous on how dexcom and eversense actually work. 

If you tell me you can feel the sensor that’s the width of a hair under the skin, safe to assume everything that comes after is bullshit.

G7 is going to be incredible, plus what dexcom has done for tandem and pod users alone make it worth more than sense could do for years to come."

2021-06-17 20:58:35,wallstreetbets,100%. It’s a few years out but SENS is working on a completely subcutaneous 365 day sensor with no on-body transmitter.
2021-06-18 12:51:18,wallstreetbets,Agreed. It is currently covered by Cigna and other major insurers. I worked in the industry for years and insurance companies have a habit of following each other on coverage because their clients (employers) demand it for their employees.
2021-06-18 09:57:24,wallstreetbets,Nice one.
2021-06-17 21:03:50,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate you taking time away from your busy day to review my entire comment history. I’m honored. I’m unsure however why you think there is anything wrong with suggesting that OP post his quality DD (that involves investing for the long term) in the subreddit pertaining to investing in the long term. OP clearly trying to get the word out and I’m letting him know there is an audience out there that is more inline with his post. 

P.S. Go Fins."
2021-06-18 12:35:56,wallstreetbets,"They can’t just pair with a pump, it’s far from that simple. The algos used in the tandem pumps are tuned specifically for Dexcom. 

Connecting the sensors to the pumps is also going to require a whole separate set of clinical trials. While it may eventually happen, you’re talking about years and years, for a company that is already doing quite poor financially."
2021-06-18 12:54:30,wallstreetbets,"Right. I’m not saying their sensor will talk to any insulin pump and I’m not intimately knowledgeable on the tech. But they do have trials started with Dex and Beta Bionics on a bionic pancreas. If you listen to their earnings calls and look at their product pipeline a closed loop system is their goal.

2021-06-18 13:58:33,wallstreetbets,So all senseonics needs to be valuable is a complete redesign of their tech (eliminating the bulky transmitter and sensor tape) and the worlds first artificial pancreas? Am I reading that right?
2021-06-18 14:29:38,wallstreetbets,Really not sure how you can call it a complete redesign. It’s an evolution of their tech. Longer battery life and eventually near field comms to lose the on body transmitter. Both of those things are in their pipeline. They start 360 day trials later this year. I’m not trying to say they don’t have a ways to go to be truly game changing. But I have a hard time believing their future is bearish.

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Oil update and current market Hey guys. 

I posted last time about the oil environment and since then things have only gotten spicier. Here is the link to the last post. 

https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n5dzl9/return_of_big_oil_the_death_of_oil_has_been/

Sorry to use a baseball reference but we are in the 2nd or 3rd inning of a great oil supercycle regardless of what the Kingdom of Saudi says through OPEC+. Last time I was speculating on the upside and I will continue to do so but update the current progress. I have sold some of my lower price calls ($60 and $70 and moved them to $80 calls) additionally, I have increased exposure to OXY calls.

TLDR: Current Trends are now showing from Gov. agencies that we will not have enough increase to cover demand causing the price to continue to march upward. 
XOM Calls: 244 $80 calls for 1/21/22 63 $75 calls for 1/21/22 77 $70 calls for 1/21/22 6 $60 calls for 1/21/22

OXY Calls: 31 $40 calls for 1/20/23

Ok. So here's some news. EIA reported their details yesterday and Baker Hughes put a great graph showing the number of rigs in correspondence with the oil price. One thing to note is that even with efficiencies in Rig use we will still need additional rigs to hold production flat as we see the large decline profiles on the well brought online in 2018-2019. Keep that in mind when looking at the US production. Might be time to look at Oilfield Service companies.

https://twitter.com/chigrl/status/1405170946097483783

The expectation from WoW was for roughly a -4 million barrel draw and we doubled expectations with -7.5. One other thing  to note was that the refineries are running at extreme capacity in the US. They have yet to shut in for preventative maintenance that usually happens around this time. (92.7% utilization)

https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/weekly/crude.php

This shows the current information on the week from the EIA on Crude Oil stocks. Clearly we are smack dab in the middle of the 5 year average however we should see draws consistently from this point on in the summer and even with significant activity we will expect that this summer oil will continue to rise. Macro wise, the Russian oil minister said that if more money is not reinvested in finding and developing oil (2020 $384 billion, normally its around $800-900 B) then the supercycle in oil will create a demand spike to prices of $150 per BBL. Take his commentary with a grain of salt. Its Russia.. That being said this new information prior to Q2 earnings from any O/G company has not been fully realized.

Focusing on XOM, BOA announced that XOM will increase the dividend in Q4 and the share price should be around $90/share by the end of year while bringing the debt levels back to 20-25%. 

https://pulse2.com/xom-stock-price-increased-3-64-why-it-happened/

They are on the extreme end of pricing in terms of valuation but here is the consensus amongst analyst:
Goldman:           $65
Morgan Stanley: $71 edit MS just upped price target to $84
Credit Suisse:    $72
Morning Star:    $74
JPM:                 $76
BOA:                $90

Obviously, there are some that I am missing but you get the point at the current share price of $62.27 (sell off this morning) there is some upside in the near term. My key takeaway is that the analysts expect a large earnings report next quarter and the rest of the year. The Engine 1 board takeover (25% of the board) was able to convince the largest shareholders (Blackrock, Fidelity, California School Board) that the changing of the board would help govern the spending of XOM (not really focused on the climate side) however it would show that the large money managers are trying to make an attempt at moving towards climate issues. (IMO it was all about the recent performance of the stock and a referendum on Woods performance not on climate issues.)

So, where does that leave us?

XOM in the next quarters at the current Oil price of $70.73 will be able to pay off a large portion of their debt from last year, pay the dividend and potentially raise the dividend by EOY. All while the price of oil remains above $70. Not to mention the activity in Guyana in which XOM found another zone to target offshore that will produce and sell at Brent pricing $72.83. (Might also be time to look at HESS)

https://www.naturalgasintel.com/exxonmobil-partners-strike-more-oil-in-stabroek-offshore-guyana/

All of that is on the crude side w/o the refining capacity that XOM has increased and now lets talk about natural gas. The XTO acquisition was terrible by all means but it has provided some benefit of large natural gas exposure. Henry Hub currently is at $3.24 and essentially, XOM produces the gas and ships it to Asia where it sells for 2-3x HH. Currently, the outlook is good and should remain stable with more gas going to exports until we see a larger increase in export capacity and there is a chance that with a colder winter this year, 2022 would have large swings in gas pricing. Roughly we are 4% down on the 5 year average curve but gas companies have been extremely hesitant to increase production and have contained supply.

Now on to OXY. What a terrible company. Literally every time I look at the balance sheet I cry. So bad. However, they have a couple good signs that they will make it out ok. 
#1 Burry decided to pick up 225,000 shares
#2 CNBC reported live that David Tepper thinks oxy will end the year at $40-50/share
#3 As quoted in their IR slides, for every $1 increase from $45 in WTI Oxy will have 185MM (46.25MM per QTR) so lets play on this further and we would be around $1.1 B of FCF per QTR assuming everything is consistent. (Highly doubt its that high but whatever)
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-16/david-tepper-says-he-s-bullish-much-loathed-oil-stocks

Also, BOA had a call with OXY as the last presenter and here is the transcript
https://www.oxy.com/investors/Documents/BAML%202020%20Conference%20Presentation%20Transcript.pdf

This presentation let us know that OXY plans on continuing its divestment of non-core assets while retaining a large amount of the purchased Anadarko acreage. Recently, OXY divested $508 million set of properties in Reeves which was a great price per acre and flowing barrel (10k per acre ish). I think that this will shock the investment community on their Q2 and Q3 reports when they significantly reduce debt. Their focus is to push out the maturities in 2024 and pay off almost all of the debt due in the next 2 years with FCF. This will make OXY extremely attractive at the current price.

OXY is a bet on the company not being a shit company. That is why my calls are set out so far. I don't trust the management but I cannot deny the money they will make give the price of oil and the land positioning of their interests in the Permian. Let me know your thoughts about what companies you see making a killing this year and this is not financial advice just thoughts about my positions.

edit: updated MS price target on XOM. Additionally, they upgraded OXY and MRO. They cite the FCF and debt reduction."

2021-06-18 12:45:22,wallstreetbets,"So the part that is interesting is that MS just upgraded both OXY and MRO (edited post). I would say that both companies are great trades but I would be in OXY for longer term. MRO had some interesting idea about the LA gas assets in the Haynesville area and they made a couple good wells out there. Do not know if they will go back to that to make it work. If they got more creative on the development side it would push me over the edge. 

Fun fact I can see their office building from our office at work. I know a lot of people who work there and they are a great place to work. I just dont have faith that they will innovate. Thats the bias. OXY does not have to innovate to return to growth. The literally need execution which I think is easier. 

Also meant to say that their management is great LOL. just reread my post and meant to put that. I will edit now."

Since topping out a couple weeks ago - AMC has been forming a fantastic symmetrical triangle on the 2 hour chart. We rejected off of it today - and are battling with it as we speak (maybe we break it today?)

For a breakout - we need a **2 hour close above 63.55 -** this would then target **75.00 --> 100.00.**

There is also key support sitting at **60.63 -** would set your stop loss under here (if you have one) - below  we likely oscillate to the low end of the triangle.

In that scenario - the breakdown point is a **2 hour close below 42.00 -** this would then target **33.61 --> 20.00.**

Great setup to play either way - so try not to hold a bias if you like money.

One last note - be fucking careful tomorrow. I've noticed **they** **love to rail meme stocks** on Fridays - most often making them trade sideways and bleeding weekly call holders.

*Not Financial Advice*

\---

Edit: forgot to mention - when I said the play is invalid below **60.63 -** i meant for today, not altogether. its a big setup and we could coil for a few more days technically"

2021-06-17 22:08:24,wallstreetbets,Sure
2021-06-18 07:01:31,wallstreetbets,Sometimes it gets processed after hours depending on the flow of things. So doing it so close to closing might just help after hours action.I was watching a interview with Dave lauder ( sorry if his name spelled wrong) he was explaining all of this stuff. The interview is on Matt kohrs channel if you wanna check it out.

The world is about to go through MASSIVE amounts of steel."
2021-06-18 09:25:50,wallstreetbets,"The only reason CLF hasn't rallied heavily is because ArcelorMittal sold quite a few shares.

The price should now go up much faster."
2021-06-18 09:41:15,wallstreetbets,"I thought CLF did yearly contracts? If so, would they be able to capitalize on these price hikes soon enough? 

That's why Ternium looked like the better play since the Mexicans are playing 4D chess with quarterly contracts instead of yearly.

2021-06-17 20:58:24,wallstreetbets,Due to chip shortage? Or lack of demand?

2021-06-18 02:38:22,wallstreetbets,"Majority is chip shortage I believe. I think demand is probably there, but my company and alot of other auto makers produce through a JIT (Just in time) methodology, thus we don't order raw coils to stamp unless finished product is basically being bought. We do not stamp or assemble unless orders are there from OEM. So that way you don't have millions of dollars in parts sitting on a shipping floor. We are a tier 1 supplier, ship directly to an OEM."
2021-06-18 00:47:59,wallstreetbets,"I’m not bearish, more neutral. We are talking a commodity here. While the price of steel is going up a lot of people are assuming that costs are not keeping up. Raw materials, labor costs, and inflation are all impacting the price as well. Now consider who are the biggest consumers of steel. Agriculture and automotive are both facing headwinds. If you’re short term hoping for a bump you might see some momentum from retailers, but in all reality everything is priced in. The party is only going to last so long."

I mean, even if steel goes up 50%, how much more could the CLF price go up? especially since the underlying assumption is that this cannot last that long, so any profit effect on the company will last about, what, 1 year? it's not like it will 'grow' in any meaningful sense.

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Quadruple Witching tomorrow! June 18th... Hey Noobies,

Just a heads up that tomorrow (June 18th) is a quadruple witching!  No we dont get to dress up in our halloween costumes early, though its always encouraged...

Quadruple witching is like an options holiday...  It happens every quarter on the third Friday..

""Quadruple witching refers to a date on which stock index futures, stock index options, stock options, and single stock futures expire simultaneously. While stock options contracts and index options expire on the third Friday of every month, all four asset classes expire simultaneously on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December."" -Investopedia

Expect large options volume, many people rolling their calls and puts, institutions resetting their futures hedges, and possibly increased volatility (good for theta gang to roll on a day like this due to increased IV (sometimes))

So welcome to wallstreetbets and your first options holiday...  Feel free to post pictures of yourself in your best costume to celebrate.. 

Good luck and godspeed..."
2021-06-17 20:49:36,wallstreetbets,"SPY and QQQ go ex-dividend on Friday 6/18.  Often this causes strange movements in the major averages.  Often the market pushes higher.  I have observed that big market players buy calls or sell short puts expiring the same day, and push SPY (in particular) higher.  They front run their own trades with same day expiring call options.  

What is noteworthy this week is the S&P was down the last 3 days.  DOW down every day this week."

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Vascepa vs Generic Vascepa is an FDA approved drug to decrease Cardiovascular risks such as heart attacks and strokes. Vascepa is protected by 60 patents listed by the FDA. Once it hit the market, HIKMA a generic giant jumped in to harvest the market and infringe beyond the thin label granted for the generic. A federal court ruling in 2020 invalidated 6 key patents for Amarin/Vascepa. Today the case is at the Supreme Court and decision will be made about whether to re-validate the patents and stop the infringement or let the un-tested generic swamp the market and compete the validated medication out. In my opinion this is both not fair and dangerous. Dangerous because the generic is not clinically validated, the in-active ingredients side effects are not known and the stability. The public only knows that the generic is slightly cheaper and ignore the rest.

Will Vascepa win the SCOTUS challenge? Do judges really know the real difference between Brand and generic? and how dangerous can a generic be? Is the Supreme Court going to rectify the course of justice by re-instating Amarin's patents or Is it going to pave the road for generics to harvest the hard work and the results of years of clinical trials? Does everybody know that generics are allowed by the FDA to have up to 20% variation margin in their products and that the in-active ingredients in the generics are not clinically tested or proved harmless? A cheap medication that harms is more costly than a brand name that is fully tested and approved."

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Swerve Into VERV **Tl;dr:** I like Verve Therapeutics.  It could be a good stonk.  


Verve Therapeutics (VERV) is a company that just started trading today.  MASSIVE SHORT SQUEEZE INCOMING.  Just kidding.  Not everything is a short squeeze people.  I will never get WSB's new obsession with thinking they can control the float of any stock or saying if all the calls at x price get executed, shorts will be forced to cover.  Some jabronis on CNBC told you wallstreetbets is more powerful than all the hedge funds and you all ate that up like candy and regurgitated your money into garbage stocks.  We’ll see how that plays out, but it’s not for me.  What I like to do is find companies that are poised for growth or are fundamentally undervalued, and I think I have found one here.  


VERV is a preclinical base-editing company that is working to develop a treatment for familial hypercholesterolemia.  Basically, they are solving high cholesterol due to genetics.  They IPO’d today, none of that SPAC garbage.


**So, what is base-editing?**  
Think CRISPR 2.0.  Instead of creating double stranded breaks like CRISPR, it works by identifying a specific DNA base and chemically changing it to a different base, thus editing the DNA code one base at a time.  Creating double stranded breaks is terrible for your DNA.  This is actually one of the ways they can age mice when performing anti-ageing studies in the lab.  


**What is VERV doing?**    
VERV is going to treat heart disease by treating the liver.  That’s a bit of a simplification, so let me explain that a bit.  LDL’s (low density lipoproteins) are the bad cholesterol that are known to cause heart disease.  High LDL’s can lead to atherosclerosis, which is the narrowing and hardening of arteries that can lead to heart-attacks.  The liver is the organ that primarily removes cholesterol from the bloodstream and can therefore be very helpful to heart health.  VERV made a base editor targeting the PCSK9 gene, which helps recycle cell receptors that are mostly found in the liver to pull LDL’s out of the blood.  There is a class of drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors that have shown without a doubt to reduce bad cholesterol in the blood.  Their studies in monkeys have shown that their treatment is very effective at reducing LDL’s in the bloodstream.  Here’s a link to their website that shows some of the nifty graphs: https://www.vervetx.com/pipeline/  


**So why invest in this company?**    
The market should be huge.  PCSK9 inhibitors show that they are targeting the right thing.  Base editing is better than CRISPR.  Preclinical data looks good.  


This is probably a 3-5 year play.  The thing could add a lot of value with positive results from their clinical phases.


**Disclaimer:**  This is not financial advice and I could be 100% wrong.  Maybe gene therapy isn’t the future at all.  Maybe they have technical hurdles that I don’t understand.  Maybe they will have to raise so much money that I’ll be diluted to nothing.  Maybe I don’t understand fully what to put in a disclaimer…  IDK

Made “$3000”…so that’s about 13 contracts by my estimate.  I dunno how to reverse engineer how much they paid in premium, but it’s not cheap.

Atea pharma’s AT-527 is one of the drugs HHS is considering. This drug is already in phase 3 trials. If HHS gives them a grant or a loan ( not sure what how they plan to fund) this stock is going to moon. I am guessing something will happen in a month.

Also, Atea has a partnership deal in place with Roche. They reached a milestone on June 16th ,2021 ( yesterday ) which brings in $50 M from Roche. Looks very good to me.

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"How to play inflation without exposing yourself to market risks of Jerome Powell and his money printer Many people believe inflation is here. I personally think inflation is here, and is going to get worse. If you believe inflation is “transitory” then this post isn’t for you. If you think the U.S government printing $120bn a month + paying people to not work, may have an effect on the monetary supply. Then this post is how to play inflation, without simply trying to short the indexes and getting blown out when Jerome turns on the printer

1. Commodities

Commodities are the absolute best place to be during times of inflation. Metals like gold aren’t needed and they often times act on pure irrational speculation in times of inflation. Steel, food, land, these things are necessary to run the economy, and unless the entire country collapses, commodities will always be the first thing people spend their inflated incomes and salaries on

2. TIPS

Treasury inflation protected securities, or TIPS, are bonds that raise in value based on inflation metrics. Calls on $TIP can be extremely lucrative in times of inflation

3. TLT

The final thing that moves rapidly when inflation starts kicking into gear are bond yields. Buying puts on the $TLT will produce fantastic returns in the event that inflation fears go full swing

I recommend opening long dated options on these indexes, at least 3+ months out, as inflation fears should continue to get worse over the summer as the economy re opens and the fed continues to release monthly inflation metrics"

2021-06-18 03:01:44,wallstreetbets,TLT tracks 20 year US treasury bonds which yield attractive returns on its rate vs elsewhere with interest rates so low. If interest rates are hiked then you could have better returns elsewhere than bonds thus bonds become less attractive—>TLT slips and TBF+TBT spikes. However TLT is still rising because most people don’t believe inflation is a concern until the Feds actually raise interest rates 🤷‍♂️

Beside the obvious demand shift that is underway, green energy stocks have received extra attention of late in the political arena. Everything from hydro to wind and solar power are now in the purview of governments around the world.

However, one green energy sector that’s been waiting in the wings for quite a while for a boost has been the hydrogen sector. It’s a sector that’s been around for decades, but has seemingly always lacked that one catalyst that could take it over the edge.             - President Biden’s recent infrastructure spending bills seek to change that. The Biden Administration has promised increased funding to various hydrogen-related projects on the horizon. Although the details remain murky, investors seem to like Plug Power (PLUG) as a key beneficiary (directly or indirectly) of this spending.

Let’s take a look at what sort of upside may be on the horizon for PLUG stock in this bullish environment for hydrogen plays today..📈🚀📈.   Let’s go to the moonn"

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Biowarfare is the future The recent pandemic and the COVID-19 virus has shown has susceptible we are to the smallest things. Literal viruses. As I am writing, the COVID-19 pandemic has killed 3.83 million people. The serious implications of the COVID-19 caused worldwide economic shutdown, political instability, and immense loss.

A few months into the pandemic, the origins were still a mystery, but mostly everyone agreed it was natural born, probably from someone eating a bat in the wet market. Theories sprung up that the virus could be man made, and have its origins from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. This place has studied the coronavirus quite a lot. However, people and media dismissed this as right wing conspiracy theory that Donald Trump brought about.

With the rise of the new presidency under Joe Biden, the search for the origins continued. A new face in leadership let some ideas begin to grow beyond a conspiracy theory. The recent investigations has brought lots of scrutiny on China, which themselves has called a ""smear"" and have tried to hide it. They initially hid crucial information at the early stages of the pandemic as it was globalizing. WHO which led the search in terms of the origins of said virus, dismissed the lab leak theory early into the search despite no significant data.

There was a mine that those who worked researched on which carried bats and lots of strains of coronavirus. Supposedly, there were miners that worked in there, but quickly got sick.

[BBC's Article for Overall View](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-57268111)

Whether or not it came from the lab, it does not matter. What has happened happened. China will continue to deny it and hide it if true, as they have tried pointing fingers at the US for causing the virus. Its mostly about politics, which is not what I want to talk about.

This pandemic showed the real threat of creating viruses and how devastating they can be. Compared to things such as the Spanish Flu, COVID-19 was tame, but that caused worldwide pandemonium. What is more scary is how easy it to create said virus with the new leaps in technology bringing down costs.

*I am not responsible for the information I am going to give you. If a new plague comes out of this, I am not responsible. Use the information at your own risk. This is for education purposes only.*

# HOW TO CREATE A VIRUS 101

Right now online, there are resources that show the RNA code of viruses. I am not a virologists, so I don't know what I would need exactly, but listed below is a genome (or at least partial) of the Spanish Flu. The same pandemic that killed 40 million people. Yeah.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore)

Thanks GenBank. Now two things to clarify, I'm not a virologist like I said, so I don't know exactly the strain code I would need. But someone that was willing to do a little research and spend a few hours could figure out it.

2nd part, making the virus. There are things called oligo printing facilities and also things like twist biosciences, which make custom DNA to order. The price of doing this is cheaper by the day. As new technology comes out, we allow people to access such information and make such leaps in terms availability to synthesize DNA. Governments around the world are already developing technologies to try and beat each other

That's how you make a virus.

&#x200B;

When these virus come, great investments will be made into learning how to make them and vaccines. Whether it be oral vaccines, injections, or other types.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So the stocks that benefit long term are obvious. Any biotech that has a technological advantage that can help with DNA sequencing. $CRSP or Crispr therapeutics will benefit greatly as people utilize their technology. $TWST/Twist bioscience has the technology to do this as well. $MRNA/Moderna with their mRNA technology can make vaccines faster then ever. The only cusp I have with lots of the stocks are their valuations, but the future is clear, biotechnology is advancing in pace never seen before. Government spending on such projections will increase rapidly in the future.

Those with technology of the future will beat those out of the past. Will the competition is fierce, those on top will be the best.

My positions don't include any of the above. I used to own Moderna, but sold on the recent up movement. I'm looking towards finding bargains, but if I can't then I will invest in these. I'm looking at all my options. Interesting companies include $CVAC, $TWST, $MRNA, $BNTX, $CRS, $ME, and $ILMN. There is a whole host of others that I didn't include but are interesting as well."
2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"How to capture profits and avoid PDT when using options All you poors with margin accounts under 25k need to learn that you can sell a strike above/below your calls/puts to capture profit and close out the position tomorrow to avoid performing day trades and getting PDT flagged.

I've been there before and know how it feels to see your low expiry contracts disintegrate from +200% to -50%. I have provided an example below.

Disclaimer: **THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO 0 DTE'S.** Also, if you dont understand spreads, this will be difficult to understand. TDA has a free comprehensive course on options trading that I highly recommend. You can use google to find it.

Example:

**Buy to open** 6/18 SPY 420c at the bottom of the day for 1.2. This contract eventually reached +100% intraday, but youre outta day trades. Obviously selling for 2.4 is ideal, but it cant happen. The alternative?

**Sell to open** 6/18 SPY 421c for 1.6. This move puts your initial investment back into your pocket with an additional 40 dollars. But what about the overall position?

Youre now holding a vertical call spread or what I have self dubbed **ghetto spreads**. Typically a vertical call spread is when both calls are opened at the same time and are referred to as a debit spread when you pay upfront for the position and a credit spread when you get paid upfront. Your current position in this example would be a debit spread, BUT you made 40 dollars by opening the position at different times. Because you took the risk of having naked contracts and the underlying went in your favor, youre now enabled to make plays like mentioned above. Ghetto spreads are a way of capping your risk (loss) however it also caps your gains.

Max Gain

Should SPY remain above 421 on expiry, you can close out both calls for an additional profit of 100 dollars. Meaning your overall gain was 140 bucks on 120 (or 116%).

Max Loss

Should both calls expire worthless, you still made 40 bucks on 120 (or +33%).

&#x200B;

How is this not a daytrade? Because youre opening two different positions. You can close them later, but in this example you at least capped your max Loss to still be a gain.

&#x200B;

This is probably a great idea for a Youtube video, but I dont have the will or resources to do so. Any broker where you are enabled to create spreads should allow the strategy mentioned above. **You must have spreads enabled on your account.** 

&#x200B;

Oh, and with puts? Sell the strike below."

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Cruiselines and airlines I think they’re a good play. Yes debt has increased but it’s cheap debt and I believe they’ll benefit heavily from reopening. Pre pandemic trends was already switching from things to experiences. The younger generations place their money with experiences not things which increases travel demands. Also the cruiselines are still cut in half. Yes the headwinds are real but to bet against them is to bet the pandemic won’t go away. They have recently sold off the highs and are a great entry point. Also most of the travel stocks got upgrades recently making them a good choice this year. This isn’t financial advice and be careful. It’s just my two cents.

**TLDR:**

* **Major global drought, buy $CORN potential >50% pop in 2 months.**
* Significant drought in the Midwest/Grain belt, similar to 2012
* Drought in Brazil
* Increased Demand globally, especially China
* Current price increase in corn is from general commodity rally and increased global demand, not supply concerns from the drought.

**Preface:**

After talking with family in Iowa about how abnormally hot it has been there, and they mentioned how the corn isn't even growing. Just curious, I thought I would look into how bad the corn growing really was. Surprisingly the drought in the Midwest is as bad and potentially worse than the 2012 drought that occurred in the Midwest that drove up corn prices 65% from $5.06 on June 14th 2012 price to $8.38 on August 21st 2012. Additionally the drought on the West coast is the worst in history.

**US Corn Production:**

The majority of corn in the US is produced in the Midwest/High Plains, like most of us would expect.

&#x200B;

Surprisingly though the Western states actually have the highest corn yield per acre. But the Midwest has significantly more land allocated to Corn than the West resulting in more total crop production in the Midwest. (Crop yield is the amount of crop harvested per area of land.)

&#x200B;

**Droughts in the US:**

The drought in the West is very severe and expanding into the Midwest. Starting with the Midwest we will review the drought there, and into the High Plains and the West.

&#x200B;

[The drought in the US as of June 15, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/tmbc08ig1v571.png?width=3300&format=png&auto=webp&s=542b748d92af744bfa05db3a41e2926efb4261ae)

&#x200B;

[Starting with the drought in the Midwest, viewing the past 20 years, the graph shows how bad 2012 was and how it caused the dramatic increase in Corn Prices.](https://preview.redd.it/hymjjq4j1v571.png?width=688&format=png&auto=webp&s=423025b40f781f78484156eed480c60535e88ef9)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Zooming in on 2011 through 2012, 2011 there was a abnormally dry to Severe Drought until June 19, 2012. Then the extreme drought began in the Midwest in July 24, 2012.](https://preview.redd.it/6l1bsb2l1v571.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=37c5024a248618a353f70d8b12cb28b7748963b1)

&#x200B;

[In 2020 there was a very similar drought as 2011, but this time there was some extreme drought. As of the last date of this graph \(July 15, 2021\) that the drought is starting to increase similar to the increase in 2012.](https://preview.redd.it/2vws5sxm1v571.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=613081fbff039ba4a39dd7a1b23c08e179e5b143)

Next is reviewing the High Plains, of which the main concern is; North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska. Starting with 2012 then 2021.

&#x200B;

[2011 had some exceptionally drought time, then increased in Mid June 2012 to become an exceptional drought.](https://preview.redd.it/t9uj2xwo1v571.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=54db772da9fc33f8101e9f2e65be4fd37423b9c9)

&#x200B;

[In 2020 it is clear that the drought was much more severe and continued in 2021 and didn't subside like in 2012. Coming into summer with such exceptionally drought land, will obviously be horrible for corn.](https://preview.redd.it/xmkhuwaq1v571.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fb891d00a63d9c26ec1fb9f844a7f66ef01af46)

&#x200B;

[The last region is the West because now corn is grown in this region. This region is suffering its worst drought in more than 20 years.](https://preview.redd.it/vlh9zjjs1v571.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e85d79971f244b0824bde31dfc2ca5326019107)

**Iowa Supply Specifically:**

Going to review Iowa specifically because it is the largest corn producing state and actually produces 16% of the USA's total corn. but it is also in the center of the grain belt. If a rain storm occurs in Iowa then it went through Nebraska and most likely kept going through Illinois, hitting three of the largest corn yielding states or 44% of the USA's corn yield, 6.2 billion bushels in 2020.

https://preview.redd.it/o8ommhcy1v571.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=0001f42d43433a51089b25f7667356e370fd898e

Looking at June 2021 vs June 2012 the highs (thick Red line vs thin red lines) the highs have been on avg. 5 degrees higher and the lows (blue lines) have been 4 degrees higher. Rain has been -2.12"" MTD in 2021 vs 2012. Looking to be an even worse June for crops then even 2012 during the most crucial time for corn.

**International Supply/Demand Concerns:**

USA is the largest corn grower in the world. The next two largest countries are China and Brazil. China had a bad growing season in 2020 and has increased their 2021 US corn export order 9.5 Million Metric Tons/ 394Million Bushels ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-19/china-has-bought-37-of-next-year-s-corn-imports-just-from-u-s](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-19/china-has-bought-37-of-next-year-s-corn-imports-just-from-u-s)). According to BIMCO the past 9 months of exports of corn to China are 77% higher than the previous year. Additionally, Brazil is having a bad growing season from severe drought and June 10th the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report issued by the USDA reduced their latest production from 102million metric tons (mmt) to 98mmt, a reduction of 4mmt. While the Conab (Brazil's Agriculture Government) said Brazil production will go from 106.4mmt to 96.4, an even worse reduction of 10mmt according to their forecast. I'll split the difference and say 7mmt/273million bushels of supply will need to be made up in the global market. This is nearly 650 million bushels that need to be made up on the global market.

https://preview.redd.it/sea5yjcz1v571.png?width=445&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5c9134096fc8b282e84ec11bdc2f38ae0ccb3be

**Why buy $CORN ETF:**

Currently the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) is projecting 1.5 billion bushels extra of ending stock for the US. This forecast was prior to the drought in Brazil and increased demand from China. From the extra demand from China and Brazil demanding an extra 650 million bushels, that leaves under a billion bushels. If the drought continues in Brazil, and China demand increases, there will be less than a billion bushels of extra corn supply/yield. Then the drought in the US that is not getting any media attention and WASDE has not adjusted down the 1.5 billion bushel ending stock forecast since March 2021, making it inline with the average corn growth yield per year of a 2% increase. In 2012 the drought caused a 22% decline in US corn supply, that would be 3.1 BILLION bushels or 2.2 billion bushels under supplied for the world. This is a 🚀 about to blast to the moon!

**$CORN price:**

These images are from Seeking Alpha and they state they can see the closing price for corn going up to $8 to $10. Historically $8 has been a ceiling but with a shock to supply like this I would expect this to go to above $10. In 2012 when the drought hit and made headlines on June 15, 2012 the price of corn rose 64% in 2 months in a straight line. If corn prices rose 64% from here it would be $13, which seems like a big increase for corn in 2 months, but this increase has happened before and with commodities like lumber 🚀, corn could be the next when it breaks $8 resistance. What this means for ticker **$CORN**, it mirrors the gain in the actual commodity. Currently $CORN is trading at **$20.96**, if corn rose 64% then $CORN would go to **$34** in about **2 months**. With inflation, general increased demand in the US currently, and the current drought $34 may be actually low. The 64% increase in 2012 was only based on a US drought. Now in 2021 we have a global drought and the economy is expected to do a 7% GDP and inflation is much hotter than 2012.

2012 Corn commodity price. Commodity prices are different then stock prices, the 840 at the top is actually $8.40. Corn commodity uses whole numbers to reflect the price, basically just dropping the decimal.

In June 2012 corn was sitting sitting at similar highs before the drought got attention and rallied 64%. Now in June 2021, we have pulled back from the highs and once the drought takes its effect on corn and the USDA reduces their forecast supply, there should be no problem blowing through the $8.00 resistance in corn and going to all time highs. 🚀🌑 Some media attention would help too. When most droughts occur, the media loves to discuss the impact, continuously.

**Short Interest:**

There is currently a 14% short interest in Corn. I expect as the price goes up closer to $8 more shorts will try to come in. Similar to other shorted stocks, these shorts will have to cover when corn goes above $8. When they cover this will just add more fuel to the 🌽🚀.

**Concerns:**

* Rain, the droughts end.
* A bill is being talked about at the federal level to allow gas companies to not have to put ethanol in gas anymore. I don't see this passing or getting any traction under a democrat presidency because ethanol makes gasoline less harmful to the environment. Biden is pushing more environmentally friendly energies. Though ethanol gas is not better than electric or other forms of energy, removing ethanol from gasoline all together would be very harmful to the environment.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

* **Major global drought, buy $CORN potential >50% pop in 2 months.**
* Significant drought in the Midwest/Grain belt, similar to 2012
* Drought in Brazil
* Increased Demand globally, especially China
* Current price increase in corn is from general commodity rally/inflation and increased global demand, not supply concerns from the drought.

Here is to high corn prices and enjoying chicken tendies! 🌽🍻 Look forward to peoples comments."

&#x200B;

[https://www.fool.ca/2021/06/17/could-well-health-stock-be-the-next-couche-tard/](https://www.fool.ca/2021/06/17/could-well-health-stock-be-the-next-couche-tard/) 

&#x200B;

Couchetard started in Canada, built the largest chain of convenience stores, started doing aggressive M&A into the US and now they are doing $54B/yr in revenue and have a $50B Market cap… 

&#x200B;

WELL also started in Canada, has now become the largest clinic provider  in Canada and has a top 2 TeleHealth platform, they have just started doing aggressive M&A activity into the US with CRH and the multiple acquisitions CRH has been making with its $300M USD line of credit from JP Morgan. Not to mention they have partnered with Fenwick & West for a NASDAQ IPO in Q4. 

&#x200B;

WELL seems to be on the exact same trajectory as Couche Tard, only WELL is in a much more exciting, innovative, and actually life changing industry that typically sees a much higher multiple. They are approaching $400M in revenue with almost $100M in EBITDA so this is just getting started.

My personal opinion is that the others aren’t necessarily any better positioned, they just haven’t had as much bad news. Fisker (are vegan cars really a thing?), Canoo, XL, Hyllion, all the others as well. Even Lucid I think faces an uphill battle to break through the traditional brands."

2021-06-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$MX DD - A Buyout Value Play Analysis **TL;DR for the lazy: Institutions and shareholders alike place a price target for $MX at $30 or higher that they have shown they are willing to actually execute at. Regardless of successful buyout, $MX is highly undervalued at its current ~$23.25 price point.** 

**What is $MX?**

Magnachip Semiconductor Corporation is an odd company that is incorporated in Delaware, is headquartered in Luxembourg, and operates almost entirely in South Korea designing and manufacturing analog, mixed signal, and digital semiconductors. Among its various product offerings, Magnachip most notably controls the second largest market share globally for OLED display driver integrated circuits, preceded only by Samsung. Recently, their stock has seen a lot of up and down movement due to a combination of multiple potential buyout offers, shareholder litigation, and federal regulatory interference that, given the following information, presents a clear buy opportunity at the current price point.  

Note: This post won't be covering any financials or other fundamentals regarding the company, simply the details regarding the company's merger status and effective price implications. 

**1st Buyout Offer - Wise Road**

Back on May 25th, [Magnachip confirmed the details of a merger agreement with South Dearborn Ltd](https://investors.magnachip.com/static-files/40589cb3-9433-4d68-af2c-62e1c76af403)., a sub-corporation for a Chinese private equity fund Wise Road Ltd. with a track record of acquisitions in the semiconductor manufacturing industry in Asia, for a buyout offer proposing the acquisition of all outstanding shares at a price of $29 per share. This led to an overnight increase in share price from the low $20s range to ~$25. It would continue to trade in this range with a slow decline to around $23 until this past Friday, June 11th when [a second unsolicited buy offer came through from Cornucopia Capital Ltd](https://investors.magnachip.com/static-files/af010acc-8ffb-4482-b8a6-aa02436ee7d1#page=11&zoom=100,21,9) on behalf of another group of Chinese investors. This **unsolicited** offer was significant due to the fact that the initial merger agreement with Wise Road included a ""No Solicitation"" provision that restricted Magnachip from attempting to directly solicit any competing offers that might have pressured Wise Road to raise their initial purchase price. 

**2nd Buyout Offer - Cornucopia**

This second buyout offer came with a proposal to acquire all outstanding shares of $MX at **$35 per share** compared to Wise Road's $29 per share offer. However, Magnachip was already quite far along in its deal with Wise Road and had plans to gather shareholder votes by June 14th to approve/deny the acquisition, and announce the results and further details of the acquisition at a virtual shareholder conference on June 15th. This bid from Cornucopia led to Magnachip delaying the shareholder conference until June 17th while Magnachip's board and legal team reviewed the new potential deal with Cornucopia with a deadline of 5:00 P.M. June 16th. Which was yesterday, meaning there's going to be a press release in the immediate future.  

**US CFIUS Review**

On May 26th, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) requested that Magnachip and Wise Road submit a notice for a formal review of the merger, which both parties complied with and filed on June 11th. Now, Magnachip itself has released statements in their SEC filings stating that they **do not** believe that there should be any approvals required for the merger in the US, for the following reasons as quoted from their filing: 

> ""All manufacturing and research and development activities take place in South Korea, and substantially all sales activities take place in South Korea, with the remainder of sales operations located in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan and Germany. Substantially all of the employees are based in South Korea and employed by Magnachip Semiconductor, Ltd., the Korean operating company; and the remainder of the employees are located outside the United States. There are no tangible assets or IT systems located in the United States, and all intellectual property is owned by Magnachip South Korea or, to a very limited degree, other non-U.S. subsidiaries of the Company""

[Source](https://investors.magnachip.com/static-files/8117620b-c4f2-485b-b80e-c9cadbdfec88)

On June 16th, the CFIUS imposed an ""Order Establishing Interim Mitigation Measures"", ordering Magnachip and Wise Road to completely halt all further progress/discussion on the merger until their review was approved. As a result, Magnachip further delayed its shareholder meeting intended for June 17th to a currently unspecified future date. This led to the spike downward to today's price as shareholder confidence in the merger fell. 

The primary concern on behalf of the CFIUS is the sale of advanced proprietary semiconductor manufacturing tech to a competing nation in China while both nations have recently committed heavily to increased investment in domestic semiconductor manufacturing. However, Magnachip's manufacturing, R&D, and sales are all based out of South Korea, [with China already accounting for over 50% of their sales in 2020 while U.S. sales composed only 1%](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/MAGNACHIP-SEMICONDUCTOR-C-6361073/company/). In addition to the reasons stated by Magnachip, it seems further unlikely that the U.S. would risk further aggravating US-China relations over a company that 

* does not even command a $2B market cap
* barely conducts any business within the United States
* conducts over 90% of its sales across Asia 
* does not contribute to *domestic* semiconductor manufacturing goals  
* [has over 80% institutional ownership of available float](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/mx/institutional-holdings) (i.e. investors that hate losing money, would vote yes for guaranteed profit in a heartbeat, and wield significant political power in the financial sector)  

But most importantly, the U.S. does not compete and has not shown any indication of competing in the future in the specific market in which $MX currently holds its most distinct competitive lead - its OLED DDIC technology, most commonly adopted for modern smartphone displays.

**South Korea Regulation**

The United States isn't the only entity that $MX requires the okay from to proceed with the merger. South Korea has a list of technologies that it classifies as ""national core technologies"", or technologies that require regulatory approval in cases such as this where a company that produces such technology is being sold to foreign investors. Originally, industry insiders in Korea believed that this would not apply to $MX, as $MX's OLED semiconductor technology did not fall under this classification and China already possesses relatively high level OLED and semiconductor manufacturing technology. However, it was [recently confirmed that as of June 9th](https://view.asiae.co.kr/article/2021060917303625530), South Korea's Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy has registered OLED DDIC semiconductor technology as part of their national core technologies, which confirmed that $MX would be required to undergo review on the Korean side as well in order for any foreign acquisition attempts to proceed. 

[Magnachip SEC filing from June 17th regarding aforementioned Korean regulatory review.](https://investors.magnachip.com/static-files/d7f8ba0b-1d32-48e3-86c3-d5c0a6731bfd) 

The reason for the rushed regulatory attempt from the South Korean government can be traced back to 2002, when Hydis, an liquid crystal display-focused spinoff from Hynix Semiconductor, was sold to China's Jingdongfang. At the time, Korea was the dominant world leader in liquid crystal display semiconductor production. But after the acquisition of Hydis, Jingdongfang began its own production within a year and is today the world's largest producer of liquid crystal displays. Seeking to avoid a repeat of this scenario, Korean citizens petitioned the government to intervene on the deal. 

Currently, it is being speculated on the side of the Korean media that the decision of the CFIUS's review will likely be the final deciding factor for the South Korean government's decision on the matter and the national core technology classification served to appease citizens and establish precedence for regulatory precedence for future international dealings involving OLED technology.

**Shareholder Litigation** 

Magnachip is also currently involved with multiple litigation claims from individual shareholders claiming that Magnachip failed to carry out its fiduciary duty in negotiating the deal with Wise Road. The shareholders that brought forth the suit believe that the $29 per share acquisition deal **undervalues** their shares and that Magnachip did not perform its duty in negotiating a fair price for the buyout on behalf of public shareholders, one of whom stated the following:

> ""First, the compensation afforded under the Proposed Transaction to Company
> stockholders significantly undervalues the Company. The proposed valuation does not adequately
> reflect the intrinsic value of the Company. Moreover, the valuation does not adequately take into
> consideration how the Company is performing and its promise.""

[Source - read from point 44 (page 12) onwards to see why $MX is undervalued EVEN WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE BUYOUT OFFERS.](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.558913/gov.uscourts.nysd.558913.1.0.pdf) AKA the stuff I would have included if this was a normal DD. 

Essentially, this states that if the company executives weren't so greedy on securing a deal that gets them a fat bonus, they could've easily negotiated a deal that reallocates more of that value into a greater than $29 per share buyout. **Shareholders are literally suing Magnachip because they believe the stock is worth significantly more than $29.**  Yeah, if that's not bullish, I don't know what is.

**Price Action Analysis**

Due to a relatively low average daily trading volume, the stock price tends to jump quite a bit in a short period of time when positive/negative news comes out. As of time of posting, $MX is trading at around $23.25 - a significant drop from the $25.50-$26 range it traded at just a few days before. We've seen that ever since the announcement of the initial buy out offer in late March, $MX has seen a strong price floor at $23. And given that basically all of the negative news that could possibly have come out has already come out, I believe that the downward pressure is now or soon to be fully priced in, leaving a significantly favored upside compared to downside from here on out. 

Additionally, **regardless of whether either deal with Wise Road or Cornucopia goes through or not**, these two buy offers have shown that there are large professional investment institutions out there that value $MX at a price of $29 **minimum**, a sentiment seemingly aggressively shared by shareholders as well. The above, along with the recent drop in price attributed to the unease surrounding by the CFIUS Interim Order, present what I believe to be a great buy opportunity when looking at a medium to long term reversal with a huge potential catalyst in the short-term as well. 

And even if these two buy offers fall through, would shareholders ever vote to approve a buy offer for LESS than $29 in the future after all of this? Not a fucking chance.


**Conclusion**

Might be boring, but I'd go shares over calls here for this play. If your *personal risk tolerance* is on the higher side and shares are for boomers, I'd go for calls at the 25 or 30 strike at least a few months out. If a buyout is confirmed, calls are printing infinite. If not, then they still have a solid chance of going ITM assuming a decently far out expiry. 

Do note that at the current trading volume, options can be fairly illiquid. 

Positions - 250 shares at ~$24 each and 5x 30c 9/17 for fun. 

This is my first DD so go easy on me. I'd love to hear some discussion about any points I may not have thought of or covered."

2021-06-17 20:32:36,wallstreetbets,"I can't see any reason to buy calls on this one, unless you think a bidding war will ensue. Buy shares, sell CCs at $30 while you wait. Until they abandon the Wise Road deal and enter a definitive agreement with Cornucopia (if they ever do) I don't see the price staying above $30, given that it was stable $23-25 on a definitive agreement at $29.  I expect the deal will go through... eventually!  Could be a while unfortunately to have your money tied up."

Even the 20MA is above at $28.51. So what gives? Nothing gives there is no explanation on why $PRPL is trading so low at its point of $25.28 other then ""missing"" per share on earnings 3 months ago. Yeah it shows they missed but revenue **increased 52.3% to $186.4M.** Cost of Revenue was $98.9M. We can do some monkey math and comes out to 88M of gross profit. IS this why some people are posting yolo's? I looked more into the chart and noticed that at 24.93-25.08 range there are huge bounces in share price.

Basically, yes - you pick a ""strike"" price and expiration date for the options.  If the current price of the stock is higher than the strike price by even one cent before the contract expires you are ""in the money"" (ITM).

Presumably, many of you are aware of the WKHS news that was dropped yesterday. If you are not, here is a slight briefing:

Pretty much a 6 billion dollar contract to replace our USPS vehicles was awarded to a company, Oshkosh, that didn't provide an Electric Vehicle Model. Congress stated, the fleet must be 75% electric, and after the contract was awarded, only 10% was said to be electric after conversion from I.C.E. There was a suspicious block purchase of Oshkosh stock the day prior to the contract announced awarding Oshkosh the deal. WKHS has now filed a legal challenge officially. Oh, and did I mention the SI is over 50% in WKHS, and the market cap is 1.7 Billion.

Now, this is huge. Please review the articles I have snipped below. Dejoy for DeJail.

&#x200B;

**The Corruption:**

* The contract was awarded to Oshkosh, who cannot confirm neither deny that the company submitted an EV model for durability testing. Nor did they say whether they have performed a powertrain transition swap, swapping out an internal combustion engine transmission for electric counterparts, as the contract stated. (See below)
* The fact that our favorite hedgies are back at it again, (See their WKHS short position below) is once again short against a company that is purposely being driven down with the help of our Post Master General for his own personal gain. Also, WKHS currently an SI of \~53%.

2021-06-18 00:46:57,wallstreetbets,"so he exercised his call options and bought at $40/share x 6,000 shares = $240k

and these shares now r worth $61 x 6,000 shares = $366k"
2021-06-18 02:15:02,wallstreetbets,"Yeah basically, at base level as it came close to expiration, I'm getting 6k per dollar over breakeven price of 41.13. So I could have sold my contract today around 130k. When it was really raging from 15 to 70 in a week, the contract value per share doubled because of the greeks, specially that IV. Soooo at that point, I could have sold at 330k....... Since shit went super volatile and kept getting short ladder attacked, IV came in to fuck me. So as experation neared, I decided I wanted the shares instead since all I wanted to do was stay in the game anyways. This way, I avoided getting taxed twice anways."
2021-06-18 02:16:33,wallstreetbets,"The screenshot is confusing but yes, 240k plus the 6130 buyin for the 60x contracts (already paid), to exercise today. Then I went ahead and bought around 220k worth of more shares with the extra cash I had. So it was two separatte transactions in that screenshot."
2021-06-18 00:53:37,wallstreetbets,"Yep yep, and have another pile of shares... scattered around in thinkorswim and elsewares."
2021-06-18 02:27:27,wallstreetbets,"In the words of a great Bolton--- ""I mean, I guess I sorta like them all."""
2021-06-18 02:27:55,wallstreetbets,Yes and yes
2021-06-18 02:28:23,wallstreetbets,"Now they are, that I've executed them"
2021-06-18 02:29:22,wallstreetbets,I feel yuh. I have others already but I like having some in the old chestnut too.
2021-06-18 01:07:40,wallstreetbets,"Basically, given the greeks, I'm getting around 6k for every dollar it goes passed my breakeven price at 41.13. Now, when it was mad peaking from 20, 30 40 50 to 75, my contracts peaked at like 330k in value if I would have sold the contract. However, since it dipped so many times from that, the greeks, specially that IV, really fuckd that epic contract value. So, I'm down to the last week and I'm getting my 6k per dollar in gains, but the reality is, Iwant the shares because if I did harvest the 130 to 150k in profit from this contract, I would pay 42% in capital gains. Now if I had no intention in going back into AMC stocks, that would fine. If I exercise, I convert my potential profit to shares at 41.13 a pop, and can now sell my shares later on and get taxed on exit at 42%. Now if I sold the contract, and then bought shares with said profit of 130k, then sold again. I would in turn be taxed twice at 42% percent because they would complete two taxable events. A long story short, I'm balls deep in shares and wanted more and save on mad tax money. In hind sight, I could have made mad bank on selling the contract at 70 dollar peak but didn't think it was going to dip that hard and fuck the IV. Huge lesson there for options trading in general that I wasn't educated on. Still stoked where I landed though as I think I'm going to make even more anyways."
2021-06-18 01:02:23,wallstreetbets,"I'm up 7 figures between all my accounts. Believe me, I didn't look at the charts. Just pay for Ortex and Roench Capital, and mad crayons."

2021-06-18 05:30:56,wallstreetbets,So you're aiming to get long term capital gains tax? Do you think AMC will be worth $60 a year from now?
2021-06-18 01:04:55,wallstreetbets,"I hated, I was wrong. Props man  that’s some real money"
2021-06-18 01:05:30,wallstreetbets,Did you sell today?
2021-06-17 20:10:21,wallstreetbets,I could be wrong but I don't think that's how it works. You get taxed on the profit over the entire year not per trade. So if you started with 10k and bought and sold you way to 400k it doesn't matter if that was 100s of trades or one gamble lucky trade. The tax is the same.
2021-06-18 12:46:12,wallstreetbets,I wouldn’t be wouldn’t be worried about the puts my dude I’d be worried about the calls and all the shares there not reporting.
2021-06-18 00:55:39,wallstreetbets,I think it was Febuary when I bought those 60 calls.
2021-06-18 02:30:15,wallstreetbets,I'm chillin tough in all the platforms
2021-06-18 02:21:23,wallstreetbets,"Basically, any taxable event that generates profit from input is taxed. Since I'm in the highest tax bracket plus 5% for my state nonsense..... I'm at 42%. So basically, since I chose to get stocks instead of creating another taxable event that would yield me a 130kish gain, I avoided another taxable event. I will be paying when I sell though. The difference is only important if I planned on jumping back into the same stock, which I did. So I avoided capital gains on this round for now. All in all, I'm happy with the outcome. To sum though, anytime you make gains, you pay taxes. The only deduction you can claim is up to 3k a year in losses, only, at least in the u.s. tax system."
2021-06-18 08:46:42,wallstreetbets,Ah ok. You avoided the wash sale bullshit that they have out there. Now I get it. Smart.

You know that I could end this whole AMC thing within a wink. Yes, I have that power. But I hold it back, for the sake of you all. It's a burden I have to live with.

Because the exact moment, I buy AMC stock, it will crash into oblivion. That's what always happens when I buy a stock. Every single time.

So cherish the time while I try to hold myself back and stay on earth while you go to the moon and beyond."

2021-06-17 20:12:54,wallstreetbets,Don’t waste your energy. OP is a shill (check his post history) and people investing in WISH are beyond help.
2021-06-17 21:35:23,wallstreetbets,"So we come full circle, trader writing call is betting on price going down. WISH has lots of written, unsettled calls (OI). Many traders are betting WISH is going down."
2021-06-17 21:46:48,wallstreetbets,"But it could also be long calls as well which is bullish. So it would seem unfair to only look at one side. OI will include both bullish and bearish bets, I don't believe we have access to the data to see which has the heavier weighting. But considering that gamma squeezes happen when there is enough momentum and calls are itm, one would assume OI will consist of more call buyers."
2021-06-17 23:47:54,wallstreetbets,"I don't think you understand call contracts... OI includes open contracts. Open contracts entitle holder to buy the underlying (or take cash-out option). If a lot of these contracts are floating around, it means a lot of them were made in the first place. Which means the makers wanted to sell (at a certain price) so they wrote a lot of the contracts. Abnormally high # of people selling = increasing supply = bearish?"
2021-06-18 00:12:09,wallstreetbets,"OI includes call buyers, not just sellers. Do you understand call contracts? Or just lmao at how short calls don't exist because you didn't Google?

Whole point of a gamma squeeze is to force MM to delta hedge if calls are itm."
2021-06-18 01:30:56,wallstreetbets,It’s like saying lots of selling can be bullish because there’s buyers
2021-06-18 00:18:36,wallstreetbets,"Your trying to say because the increased # of sells are finding buys it's bullish, smh. The fact they're being created and sold in the first place (just like selling regular stock) is the only take. Selling puts you in a short position, buying puts puts you in a long position. Increased number being sold = increase to bearish sentiment"
2021-06-18 00:22:26,wallstreetbets,"$WISH just opened weekly options. I'm enjoying this volatility. I actually think this stock/company has a lot more value than $AMC. AMC has $11.5B in debt and only $813M in cash so the stock is a lot more expensive than it is. Wish, on another hand has $1.77B in cash and almost no debt so it's a lot cheaper than it seems.

I'm selling $9.5/9 put spread on WISH"

2021-06-17 21:17:16,wallstreetbets,"The lockup ending isn't a good thing but the fact that it ended i.e. a ton of new supply free to sell and the price rose on huge volume is what I'm talking about! It means there are significant buyers stepping in.

On the app and customer service being shit those are easily fixed. It doesn't matter if it's the worst app in the world selling literal dog shit of it's increasing revs by +50% year after year. What matters is that these are the top 4 shopping apps by time spent in April: Amazon, eBay, Walmart, Wish... spot the odd one out?

I never said it will squeeze since there is very low short interest and I don't know enough to say whether a gamma squeeze is possible.

p.s. You might be right but people were probably saying the same about Amazon in the early days. We can have this argument at $20-$30 and I'll agree with you that WISH has a lot to prove. At $10 and $6B marketcap with +$3B of sales forecast next year I think it's a good bet."

2021-06-18 04:05:11,wallstreetbets,"But wish doesn't do anything better or different. It has a bunch of competitors like banggood, gearbest, you name it. And all of them lack in comparison to AliExpress, which has the big advantage of being a marketplace and not a giant reseller, so there is competition between sellers and a decent dispute system.
wish will probably grow with the entire sector of e-commerce and Chinese online shops, but I don't see them take any customers from Amazon or any Chinese reseller and I'd much rather expect the opposite.
More and more of the stuff on wish can be found on Amazon for similar prices and people will go with the site they trust more, or find the absolute cheapest place to get them, which also isn't wish.

I don't see wish fixing their customer service either, because that would mean providing more refunds or replacements and making less money."

We shall see though. Things can change and maybe one of the other companies I believe in fucks up or hits what I think is the peak and I decide I just want even more CLNE.

2021-06-18 02:41:28,wallstreetbets,"So the fed is left with two decisions:

1) Do not raise rates. continue to devalue the dollar until it is no longer the reserve currency. This would be done to avoid the pain and suffering which comes from recessions, and actually a depression which is likely to ensue if they stop printing money. By the way, the decline of the dollar is inevitable. You cannot simply create wealth. That’s not how any economic system works. There will be a flight from the dollar if they continue doing what they are doing. And most likely it will happen regardless. 

Or

2) the fed must increase rates at the cost of slowing the US economy. This would likely trigger a large stock market crash due to the extreme speculation. 

The issue here is that the US consumes far more than it produces. They have this privilege due to being the worlds reserve currency. We have become over consumers, and complacent. It is sad. I’m not exactly sure how much of the USD supply is held by other countries. I can only assume there is a great deal of money out there not within the borders. Why won’t the US be able to control inflation? Because they have no ability to tax USD which exists outside of its borders. That is the cold hard truth. They can only tax US citizens. This is why inflation won’t be able to be controlled. They have a claim on anything we produce. 

And as the purchasing power of the dollar decreases, so does its appeal as a reserve currency. And look at the political system, people want checks! For doing nothing, for producing nothing. But the issue is that they aren’t taking from the wealthy in the US. They are taking from everyone across the globe. And I have news for you, they won’t continue to let that happen. 

At some point, whichever option the fed chooses, the people of the US must return to hard work and austerity to bear the unfathomable debt load taken on by the US Govt. We have to continue to invest in the country, and within our borders. People have to work and produce. People have to be educated. That’s the only way forward to get out of this. But first there is going to be a lot of pain. That’s just how it has to go."

2021-06-18 10:25:01,wallstreetbets,They missed their chance to raise rates two+ years ago when they chose not to at behest of the almighty orange (who with all his business prowess tanked countless companies). Powell is a moron and someone else will clean up the mess when he steps down.
2021-06-17 22:53:12,wallstreetbets,Rates will go up.  Billionaires don’t like inflation.
2021-06-17 20:22:29,wallstreetbets,"> Paul Volker had to raise rates to 20% to stop the inflation of the 1970s. WTF is 0.75% two years from now going to do?

He had to raise such high rates because inflation was equally high, like 15%. The proposed rate hikes now are proportional to the expected inflation.

> In 2008 the Fed said QE and low interest rates were temporary. Temporary means 13+ years?

You mean the third round of QE ended entirely in 2014? And the fourth round was only started back in 2018? I didn't know continuous means with a 4 year gap - that's probably the same way you tell others you've had continuous employment.

>In 2018 the Fed tried to normalize interest rates and unload their balace sheet and THEY FAILED. They couldn't even raise rates back then, before the money supply increased by 30%, before all the covid debt.

They've initiated plans to unload their balance sheet in 2017, and they were well on their way with a mix of gradual selling and letting their securities mature without reinvesting. It halted because if the aforementioned fourth QE in 2018.

> If just talking about a 0.25 increase two years from now crashes the market what do you think will happen when they actually do it? It's bullshit propaganda. They will NEVER raise rates. They will choose an inflationary depression over a debt caused crash.

What crash? A 0.8% intraday move is a crash to you?

2021-06-17 20:55:33,wallstreetbets,"Globalization made the world one giant economy. Cheap goods & subsidized food are why they FEDs expected inflation throughout the 2000s and 2010s never materialized.

I’ve got bad news coming for you if you think our economy resembles anything like 1970.

I just got mangoes at the store for 50 cents a piece. They’ve been over $1-$3 each before. 

It’s transitory. There’s always going to be cheap goods and cheap labor."
2021-06-17 21:14:17,wallstreetbets,Uhh yes inflation can be and likely is largely transitory.
2021-06-17 21:38:22,wallstreetbets,"Stupid argument. 

Fed can always raise rates to destroy demand. They don’t need to keep them high for too long either. 

This isn’t 1970s. We live in a globalized world where imports can squash any US excess demand."
2021-06-17 21:55:33,wallstreetbets,"The main danger of QE is not inflation, it is asset bubbles.  Which we clearly have a whole lot of....present company included.

I do agree with you that they will probably never be able to unwind their balance sheet or meaningfully raise rates without causing those bubbles to pop and wiping out a ton of the wealth Americans think they own....  So for the time being, they are just going to let the bubbles keep being bubbles.

But the forces that drive inflation don't seem to be spiraling out of control at this point either.  Until recently it was very much to the contrary....We have been in a mild deflationary environment most of the time since 2008 despite QE.  By that I mean the Fed has repeatedly undershot its inflation target of 2%, despite 0% rates and despite trillions in QE purchases.  That would not have happened if QE and low rates cause inflation by themselves....they just don't."

I recognize people may have a few gold bars in their safe in case a meteor hits Earth, but those that go all in on gold are likely to miss out on the continued slow steady upward climb of the success of well-run US companies. Back in the day (around 15 years ago?), they used to have gold banks that would pay around 5% interest on physical gold deposits, but now even that is gone, so gold bar generates zero income. 

Betting alongside Uncle Sam has served me well and I feel continuing to own a small slice of the American success story will outperform tying my future to a yellow metal."

They aren’t trying to be Amazon. Amazon can beat anyone at their own game. But remember, Amazon offered to buy wish for $10billion, which is more than wish’s current market cap. Amazon doesn’t buy competitors. They buy to add to their customer base and business model. Wish isn’t like Amazon, it’s different with different clients. The current Amazon does not want to offer those crappy products, but they want those customers, so buy wish and expand it. Only thing is, WISH said no."

2021-06-18 04:40:28,wallstreetbets,"I'll say it again, if you believe that Blackberry is going to generate **significant revenue growth** in the immediate future that outpaces inflation... then buy the stock at 200, 300, 400% its price from 6-8 months ago.

There is no squeeze play on BB. It's a fundamental bet... and the fundamentals haven't proven themselves. You're betting on growth in a company that hasn't ever made that transition obvious, in a time where people are rotating out of growth companies.

Don't become *B*ig *B*agholders."

2021-06-18 00:46:11,wallstreetbets,"If this administration has any sense, they’d be distancing themselves from China. The “build back better” opportunity is clearly one to decentralize from China.  

Toss in the already anti Chinese sentiments brewing due to the lab leak theory and you have a fairly clear pivot away from China (I.e. they fucked the global economy for an entire year). 

With the semiconductor investment, I see this as a nice start. Also, unless those tariffs get relieved (25%), American steel is more competitive than it was 3 years ago."
2021-06-18 00:39:37,wallstreetbets,"This is a dumb sentiment. 

Steel is used by construction firms and large manufacturers. It’s not an everyday product for Americans like gas. 

The price of steel can increase and get passed onto those that are using it for a year or two with nobody getting too worked up about it. 

Beyond that, America has long since needed to be rid of Chinese steel. Momentary growing pains while American manufactures scale/increase capacity is completely acceptable IMO. 

Even in the construction of homes, lumber is the defining price and not steel 9 times out of 10. Steel is a commercial product, the commercial sector can pass on those costs for those that NEED to build right now."
2021-06-18 14:53:56,wallstreetbets,What you are saying makes absolutely no sense. They aren't even remotely the same or linked to each other at all. The last recession was due to fraudulent MBS's. You are talking about a supply shortage and high prices of lumber. It's like comparing a car to the color purple.

2021-06-18 07:18:42,wallstreetbets,"I recommend researching the so called fat tail distributions in the context of probability. The whole calculation of options assumes a standard distribution of returns. In reality of the stock market however, ""extreme"" outcomes are often more probable than the standard distribution assumes. 

Thus, what I'm saying here is, that there is risk in options, that is not accounted for in the way options are calculated. The reasoning is that the probability of extreme events is underestimated with the normal means of risk assessment. 

To be more precise, the outcome may also hit regular stocks, as the distribution of returns of the underlying stock is fat-tailed. However, given the element of expiration in one case you hold a stock that might come back eventually, while in the other you hold empty bags."
2021-06-17 22:22:04,wallstreetbets,Please enlighten me how marginable securities work and how options differ? I’m not being thick I really don’t know.
2021-06-18 11:08:51,wallstreetbets,"> If it's heavy ITM with a long expiration,

Those cost like 98% of the stock.  Why not just buy the stock?"
2021-06-17 23:25:40,wallstreetbets,"Some traders use margin accounts which allows them to leverage the account assets for larger trading power. Stocks held in a margin account but for which are already fully paid for count towards the amount of the buying power. If you exclusively trade in options as a buyer, this isn’t an issue. But OP asked why people wouldn’t just always choose ITM LEAPs to act as essentially synthetic shares; delta is approaching 1 at its limit so it’s almost as good as a 1:1 ratio with the underlying stock. But the marginable nature of equities is an advantage to margin traders (which is inherently higher risk than other strategies because of asset leverage)."

2021-06-18 01:58:34,wallstreetbets,"I'm long RKT but just so you're all aware, the float is significantly higher than the last squeeze. Thus it's a lot harder to push the price up. Dan Gilbert sold a ton of shares just before the disappointing earnings forecast and thus increased the float. It still looks like he owns 90% of the shares in some weird share structure.

TLDR don't bet on another squeeze. Play the long game if you like the company. More dilution is guaranteed."

2021-06-17 23:04:56,wallstreetbets,"AMC option writers trying to strike the stock at 60 tomorrow.  The defense started today with a wall of sell orders at every whole number above 60.  

Tomorrow the same futile strategy will be employed with the quarterly expiration.  

Scenario 1: it gets away from them and the stock capitulates tomorrow 

Scenario 2: more likely. The call option writers  throw all the ammo  (short sale orders) they can and close it at the 60 strike.   THEN as is ALWAYS the case, Monday morning, the options are gone but the short stock position is greatly increased.  This likely ignites the final capitulation above the intraday high of 73.  Be careful young apes.  This final blowoff top is fast, violent and could easily take the stock above 100 and beyond only to exhaust the short position and set up a key reversal (new high and new low same day).  This is when u feed your stock back to the shorts and let them pay the top and you bank the cash. 

Also likely imminent, the completion of the stock offering via Jefferies (my Alma Mader) which would send the stock into the capitulation phase.

2021-06-17 22:32:50,wallstreetbets,"Extremely optimistic. For weeks, we thought we were being short like fucking crazy but it was just one of CLNE's large institutional holders selling their holdings. The CEO announced today on his Twitter that said institutional will stop selling and continue to hold 20% ownership of the company. If we continue to buy like we have been for the past weeks, we win tomorrow and all calls below $15 will most likely go ITM.

2021-06-17 23:54:44,wallstreetbets,Without the morning dump that we’ve been seeing every morning that’s been killing momentum (Total) my conservative guess is that  we’ll see $14. I’m not a financial advisor
2021-06-17 23:56:12,wallstreetbets,$13-14 should be on the cards after the CEO’s interview.
2021-06-17 23:47:36,wallstreetbets,It's got to go to $15 tomorrow or I lose some money on my calls.  :(
2021-06-17 20:33:19,wallstreetbets,Dude you're so funny whenever I hear fart or whn I fart i remember a person.. she has this holding fart face 🤣😂

2021-06-17 20:35:27,wallstreetbets,I think BB will continue to climb. Conservatively I would say another 8% up to around 15.12. But what I really hope happens is it just starts rocketing up which I think it might one of these days. Hoping for a big BB day. Holding strong for the 🌝. BB 🚀🚀🚀

2021-06-17 22:32:03,wallstreetbets,No one knows honestly anyone who says they do is lying or they have been to the future. I think if we break 70$ And Consolidate there it could cause a good run up to low 80’s Next week.
2021-06-17 22:09:15,wallstreetbets,Alot of people are convinced it'll explode tomorrow. Idk seems more likely to fall in pre market and stay down unless more shares are bought heavily.
2021-06-18 03:21:27,wallstreetbets,CLOV will run again. Too much going for it

2021-06-17 21:05:20,wallstreetbets,CLOV has opportunity. But I think there’s just too many bag holders on it right now. They are missing out on other opportunities unfortunatley. But I wish you best bro!
2021-06-17 21:07:24,wallstreetbets,I'm already in deep on CLNE but spent my last $1000 on CLOV today because I think it has the most squeeze potential out of the meme stocks.
2021-06-18 01:50:37,wallstreetbets,yikes
2021-06-18 04:37:52,wallstreetbets,wait\~ now CLOV is going down and AMC is going Up.... Selling their CLOV to buy AMC....

2021-06-18 06:14:25,wallstreetbets,Waiting for Monday
2021-06-18 07:01:32,wallstreetbets,"Depends on whether they are in the money or not and whether there are more calls or puts and at what level. Generally speaking, other actors want calls/puts to expire out the money, meaning that they'd be worthless as the share price is below strike price in case of calls and vice versa for puts. That also means if there are loads of open calls, the ones profiting off selling calls will want to suppress the price. Once the options are in the money, the gamma changes and they possibly need to cover options positions, thus purchasing more stocks and driving the price further up."
2021-06-17 20:33:45,wallstreetbets,That was because Total was selling off shares to get back their initial investment. They're done selling
2021-06-17 23:25:35,wallstreetbets,Trying to get you to look away so they can get in early then pump
2021-06-17 23:25:53,wallstreetbets,Or push you to an already crazy overvalued stocks so they can get out

2021-06-17 22:56:30,wallstreetbets,I’m also optimistic! But we Actually we knew total was selling the shares to fund their JV. And  CLNE had also been shorted over the last few weeks.. if there was also this pesky CFO. But that’s all just cow farts in the wind at this point!

2021-06-17 20:21:19,wallstreetbets,"I hate Cramer most of the time but he was pretty decent for the interview and his statements in the next segment about how fucked bears are and what the real inflation problem is I agree with completely. Rate hikes won’t do shit, market won’t crash, it’s production issues and lack of employees in certain industries mostly caused from all the shutdowns the past year + from covid. The government also will do everything in its power no matter how fucked it might be to prevent an economy crash as we recover from covid. That was our big crash and it will be several years before another."

2021-06-17 20:58:19,wallstreetbets,Yup! It’s crazy to see all the bots push other tickers and seeing the momentum get lost on random stocks.
2021-06-17 21:12:45,wallstreetbets,I just like CLNE more as a company so I felt better putting the majority of my money into them incase there is no moonshot and I have to hold long term. I see CLOV as the squeeze play so I wanted to have at least a little skin in the game for when the shorts eventually have to cover.
2021-06-18 05:14:24,wallstreetbets,Lol at people who look at the market like this
2021-06-17 23:41:13,wallstreetbets,Because of the tickers you decided to mention.  EWWW!

2021-06-18 04:28:59,wallstreetbets,">Westport

Very excited for a DD on Westport. Would you say that the current price of $5 is a good entry point, and what are your price targets?"
2021-06-18 04:34:52,wallstreetbets,"The recent capital increase was a surprise for me. I was expecting it to be closer to the finalisation of the weichai launch

This premature move may be due for several reasons (that can coexist)
- weichai launch needs to wait for the meng wanzhou release from Canada, that is too far away (august this year at best) to wait for efficiency optimisation of the factory line)
- Volvo demand in Europe is high, therefore management could not wait. Indeed in the Netherlands in one month volvo sold 120 lng trucks, basically half of what they sold in the entire 2020
- there has a been a major disappointment on a partnership expectation. Likely cummins jv is not going to be renewed and mgmt needs to increase cash flows through acquisitions (as they stated in the capital raise)

If Cummins walks away surely is a bad news, but Volvo has plans to launch HPDI in North America, plus insiders bought the stock during the capital raise... not so bad 


In conclusion, before making a forecast, I am going to wait the 17th of July European Commission decision on alternative fuel support for light duty. There is the possibility that cng cars will be incentivised thanks to RNG

this would make the picture of Westport far safer.. 

(Also the $clne saga is helping of course, Cramer presentation yesterday was amazing for natural gas mobility)"

2021-06-17 23:28:24,wallstreetbets,"*I used an AI to generate this story from the name of our association:*

At the next meeting of the Fraternal Association of Gambling Gentlemen and Yacht Degenerates, the following motion was passed unanimously:  
  
""That the Fraternal Association of Gambling Gentlemen and Yacht Degenerates hereby ratify the appointment of the Honorable and Right Honorable Lord Sir Reginald Bumstead-Fipps, KG, as Admiral of the Fleet, in recognition of his outstanding service to the Fraternal Association and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.""  
  
N.B. - The name ""Fipps"" is traditionally a corruption of ""fop,"" or ""dandy."" In keeping with this tradition, all members of the Fipps family -- including Lord Fipps himself -- are expected to wear their hair long, sport bright pink bowties, and make a point of being generally obnoxious.  
  
Of course, it is the ultimate goal of each and every Fipps to become Prime Minister. In the meantime, each Fipps waits for his turn to serve as Prime Minister, and in the mean time, behaves as offensively as possible. The average Fipps, therefore, is a loud, obnoxious, boorish, noisy, and smelly cretin, who is always either drunk or on the verge of getting drunk, and who has a close personal relationship with the local constabulary, and with several prostitutes, as well."

I just saw your last comment about liking set theory. It's pretty rare to have a good set theorist in a department to advise you. There are usually algebraists, topologists, both of which can mean anything, and anal-cists. I said what I said!

I'm just happy to see math comments on wsb, lol.

During the wsbgod bs and influx last year, there was a private WSBElite (dead now), but a mathematician posted about how a certain homology theory might be used to analyze markets. The sub is private, but I reproduced his post in a personal journal sub.

Where i can agree is that the gas price always was goin up. The grocery too but its got worse since covid. Like a lot. 

And materials are just crazy expensive , 50% raise on wood around here and thats when you can actually get your hands on some.

The cooked rotisserie chickens were either 5.99 or 6.99 a year ago and they are definitely 6.99 now.  But a dollar a week is pretty negligible and I'm not even certain it changed. 

Regarding things like frozen pizza, yogurt, cereal, milk, fruits and vegetables, condiments, pasta, pasta sauce, king crab (specifically, in the rare case that I buy it), crackers, cheese, etc, I have not seen a significant move in price.

2021-06-18 16:52:57,wallstreetbets,And One day Soylent Green is on the menu.  Remember it’s people!  Not everyone is a day trader specialist.  One wrong zero or 1 and your account is fubar.  Trading is fun.  Until you lose.  I made money on Lucent and put money in and pulled it out in two weeks.  I also saw everyone in JCP say the stock was going to split and laid on it.  I sold at 50 ish it went to 88 and swiftly dropped like a rock.  The problems I saw with the Walgreens’s acquisition were as follows…. Some idiot decided making a whole bunch of new stores on their own land was a good thing.  That’s why I jumped out.  Turns out that time I was right.

2021-06-18 10:38:58,wallstreetbets,"have you not have of hedonic indexing, weighting, substitutions to ""measure"" inflation?"
2021-06-18 11:41:57,wallstreetbets,Better than swallowing!
2021-06-17 22:18:39,wallstreetbets,Calculated the way we used to calculate it in the 80s. Source: http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/inflation-charts
2021-06-18 10:41:48,wallstreetbets,I'm familiar with them as components of and/or alternatives to CPI. There are plenty of reputable organizations tracking inflation independent of the Fed. This conspiracy is easily debunked.
2021-06-17 23:42:31,wallstreetbets,I feel like I'd notice if my costs increased 10% a year. I'm guessing they measure different things because the things that used to get measured aren't relevant anymore. Modern goods often deflate... think of cost of li-on batteries.
2021-06-18 10:52:10,wallstreetbets,"you do realise inflation by definition is the increase in money supply.

and if you recall the government gave out trillions of dollars in so called ""stimulus spending"". most of that money didn't come from an increase in tax revenue, it was printed - the money supply increased."
2021-06-18 14:22:48,wallstreetbets,Perhaps its not relevant but perhaps we'd prefer thinking it was 2% so they started from =2% and worked the math to reach that number. I'm not sure myself but this was something I had read and thats why I brought it up.
2021-06-18 11:03:08,wallstreetbets,"That is not the definition of inflation. Inflation is a fall in value of currency, regardless of cause. The money supply has increased through quantitative easing, however it's still very illiquid. The Fed has actually slowed down printing money for almost half a year now, yet we're just now seeing the inflation. There's a fairly simple reason for this:

 Before the economy opened up, consumer spending was low. This means people were saving, and demand for money was higher (household savings hit a several decade high last year/early this year). If demand shifts with supply, then there shouldn't be any perceived inflation (in fact, in 2020 we saw deflation despite the money supply increasing by nearly 30% because this change in demand was so significant). Now that the demand for money is going down as people trade it for goods and services again rather than hoarding it, we are beginning to see inflation despite the money supply no longer increasing at a fast pace. Specific to this inflation we are seeing, it's entirely driven by demand, not supply. This should alleviate our concerns because while supply can of course stretch upward infinitely, demand can only fall a certain amount before it settles. This is why they call it transitory: inflation has a ceiling under these conditions.

Of course, none of this has anything to do with the original topic of discussion: the accuracy of the Fed's tracking of inflation and whether it is accurate. I believe it is accurate, as do the vast majority of economists, investment banks, market makers, etc."
2021-06-18 11:37:12,wallstreetbets,MVIS baby!
2021-06-18 16:05:52,wallstreetbets,Tough luck man. The interest rates are gonna kill MVIS in my opinion. Bought puts a few days ago
2021-06-18 10:13:59,wallstreetbets,Hmmm we not looking so good today
2021-06-18 11:00:16,wallstreetbets,"Either way, I do a bunch of covered calls and this stock has enough volatility to make some good money on it."
2021-06-18 18:11:31,wallstreetbets,So many people buy UWMC because they rather pay 10 buck per share instead of 20 🤣😂🤣🤣
2021-06-17 20:24:38,wallstreetbets,I didn't ask. I refinanced my mortgage through him again and got UWMC.  Their website is so shitty. I can agree on some of the comments below.
2021-06-17 20:15:55,wallstreetbets,"Rkts business is largely build on refinances which have boomed with current low interest rates. Uwmc's business plan is focused on processing new loans. The housing market is still expected to boom even with rising rates due to high demand and low inventory, (new buildings, new homes, new mortgages, etc) while refinances are expected to slow as interest rates increase eventually. And now demand for refinancing has slowed since so many people have already locked in incredibly low rates. 

These green crayons taste good. Usually stick to red... 🤷‍♂️"
2021-06-17 21:17:12,wallstreetbets,So if they have over 90% retention how many of the 10% were treated poorly?  I bet less than 1%.  The other 9 probably just went somewhere else.
2021-06-17 20:06:01,wallstreetbets,Might want to dump first thing in the am.. The CNN article that was posted an hour ago does not contain good info
2021-06-18 09:23:14,wallstreetbets,My apologies for such a silly question but what app is this? I'm trying to get into stocks like you guys but I dunno where to start and what apps/tools to use x)

2021-06-18 13:59:52,wallstreetbets,you realize inflation expectations have been cratering this week right?
2021-06-18 14:12:51,wallstreetbets,If it’s OTM calls. It’s crushed.
2021-06-18 14:12:37,wallstreetbets,Oh is that how you reading it?  Good luck

A combo play"
2021-06-18 06:22:37,wallstreetbets,It’s bc they want that multiplier. You can massive amounts of money if you’re correct on options.
2021-06-18 08:10:06,wallstreetbets,"Sure. But the underlying factor that makes the stock move up in price is more demand for it. Contracts that provide the ability to purchase at a strike price in the future do not help the stock move up. People trying to reap the benefits of gambling with options in here should also own the stock and help their own cause.

Options can work in certain circumstances. Many people have made a lot of money through options over decades. Many more have had their lives ruined."
2021-06-18 08:19:36,wallstreetbets,Yes I agree with everything you said. The ones that ruin their lives don’t know how to live within their means and self control. If I risk 20k it’s because I have 200k or if I risk 1000 is because I have 10k. I can never understand those who risk that amount and don’t have anything fall back on. Yolos are kinda cool and a good laugh if it works out but can be devastating if they fuck up.
2021-06-18 08:22:05,wallstreetbets,Right on

For stocks to outperform the market, they have to outperform expectations going forward. It’s very hard to outperform expectations going forward when the spotlight is on you. Big money knows your business inside and out and your success makes everyone aware. Furthermore rivals are chipping away at your market shares and political will builds against you."

2021-06-18 00:21:55,wallstreetbets,"Aside from the reddit push everything. They've been in the red for years. They held a ton of debt with no real way to turn around their prehistoric business model.   Unless you're feeding into the hype, a video game provider that sells video games (while every other platform does the same) isn't special anymore. It would take them restructuring their entire model. 

Redditors with actual knowledge know this. But this sub is full if people who will boast about how well GME will do just to get people hyped to buy the stock.  They don't care if those people get in at 200, 300 or 400, because it works better for them.  But when it comes time to sell, notice how it's real quiet."
2021-06-18 00:31:50,wallstreetbets,"My guy, chill with the high and mighty attitude. They have been red for years and the hedge funds knew this. Hence, they shorted them way too much. Redditors saw this and bought in. Leading to a domino effect of retail traders buying the entire float. Now hedge funds have billions invested in shorting this. (Not exaggerating). And in order to buy those back, they must purchase shares at the price that float holders wish. 

It wasnt quiet when a bunch of people sold in january out of panic. To further retort towards your first paragraph. The business model of gme is flipping right before our very eyes. A whole new board, new innovation, ecommerce market being tackled that allows the resale of digital games and mlg format rooms being built worldwide. Granted this could never be possible before but we need to stop focusing on the past. Just because ""it was red then"", doesnt mean that it will be forever. I dont think gme's value after the squeeze will be that astronomical but it will still be worth something much greater than it was. But as for the squeeze, the hundreds are gonna look like pennies when it comes.🦍🦍🚀🚀💎🙌"
2021-06-18 01:53:48,wallstreetbets,"1st off none of that is high and mighty it's just numbers and facts, and neither care about your feelings.  2ndly, none of what you mentioned is game changing or new. Companies shuffle boards around all the time, and I already mentioned the digital platform, how does that put them ahead of their competition?  That's not even a restructuring and won't save them in the long run. Can they do better?  Sure, but not with what we've been shown so far. It's questionable as to whether they would even still be here if the rallies had not happened. 

Whenever there's a massive sell-off there's never a bunch of people saying sell.  That's just pure and simple fact. Nobody gets on here to advise everyone to sell so they don't end up carrying bags.  So, while this may be an exciting once in a life time opportunity, anyone with even slightest bit of business sense can see what is happening.  Should you get in and make some money off of the WSB push?  Absolutely if you've got money to burn. Should you expect this to happen with every other company or GME to moon every month because of their restructuring/gamma/si squeeze?  No."
2021-06-18 17:22:26,wallstreetbets,"This is why the stock will always continue trading sideways. Institutions make more money selling calls than rising share price. The longer they can keep the undervalued stock low people will scream, ""uNdErVaLuEd StOcK tImE tO sPeNd AlL $$ On CaLl OpTiOnS!"" Then they keep making 10-15% a month selling call options while spending peanuts just to short it because we're not buying shares."

2021-06-18 15:05:47,wallstreetbets,I ended up making 116k. I got out about 1:23. This is my fill on my first comment on the original page.
2021-06-18 14:05:35,wallstreetbets,I'm dying to know too
2021-06-18 15:07:44,wallstreetbets,I closed an hour and a half ago. Posted my fills on my first comment on the thread
2021-06-18 00:33:19,wallstreetbets,"cost per share of $3.23 x 70,000 shares (700 calls) = $226,100"
2021-06-18 15:14:37,wallstreetbets,Yeah man can't be mad about making 20K. Would I like to be 2 million. Yeah but there's always next week
2021-06-18 15:14:17,wallstreetbets,"I starting to get nervous for this dude lol


Reading some more comments, it looks like he got out of it while up over 100k.

Nice play op, nice play"
2021-06-18 12:56:30,wallstreetbets,Op's trade is already negative.  He is going to turn his incredible luck and 6 figure gains into 6 figure losses.
2021-06-18 14:43:11,wallstreetbets,"OP paid $3.23 for his options.  He needs the stock to be above 61.23 to be in the money.  As of the moment, he is currently down about $70,000 after being up $200,000 yesterday."
2021-06-18 14:54:17,wallstreetbets,"He didn’t. He said yesterday that he would either gain over million or lose 200K.

This is exactly how I turned 450K profit into a 19K loss within 48 hours with GME at the beginning of the year. 

Big gain eludes us to to see only one side of the reality. A lot of people only wake up after losing all the gains and some or all the capital."
2021-06-18 15:06:42,wallstreetbets,Nah. Didn't sell when I was up 2.5 x. Ended up 116k on both my AMC trades this week combined though. I posted the fill on my first comment on the original thread
2021-06-18 15:15:58,wallstreetbets,For a little gain. I held as long as I could
2021-06-18 18:15:20,wallstreetbets,"Added update on first comment on thread. I'm hoping for consolidation next week and for IV to drop, then pick up calls for the 27th and 28th when 35 day FTDs have to be bought"

2021-06-18 15:26:45,wallstreetbets,"This guy has balls of steel and hands made of precious gemstones, I woulda sold when I was up $200k but he hung on there until the last possible second.

2021-06-18 00:57:36,wallstreetbets,Hey friend. Thanks for stopping by and sharing your opinion. I hope you have a great Friday and weekend.

2021-06-18 15:06:43,wallstreetbets,Good decision to get out before market close.. usually they dump around that time.. Great play AZ
2021-06-18 15:12:29,wallstreetbets,Surprised you didn’t take some off the table when the contracts hit $7.70
2021-06-18 16:02:12,wallstreetbets,"Certainly not a bad week, though it could have been a lot better. Anyway, congrats, great play!"

2021-06-18 16:19:59,wallstreetbets,"I noticed that big order in the ""Time and Sales"" order data. You sold most of them at $3.55. These contracts were at that price range for about 30 more minutes and then it was mostly down trend and you could never break even after 2:00pm. 

Happy for you because you at least were able to get out intact with a small profit."
2021-06-18 14:34:01,wallstreetbets,"hope he did, he was being ballsy holding"
2021-06-18 13:21:06,wallstreetbets,How do u figure? Not being rude just from what I read and my understanding he’s betting that’ll be above $61? And it’s sitting at 61.58?
2021-06-18 15:01:40,wallstreetbets,The thing is fridays have been terrible for AMC and GME for the last few months. Not sure why OP bought into the gAmMa sQueEzE bullshit that clearly did nothing. I get downvoted every time I shoot down the gamma squeeze theories but look at CLOV and AMC. they were supposed to squeeze today according to the apes.

2021-06-18 16:44:06,wallstreetbets,That was a good decision obviously but what I don't understand is why did you exited your 50c (probably over 600 contracts) within 15 minutes yesterday. You could easily hold that 2 more hours and could lock over 400K instead of 100K. I mean why sold those but hold these?
2021-06-17 20:07:09,wallstreetbets,Depends how much $ you have.

2021-06-18 16:48:54,wallstreetbets,"Hindsight is 20/20. My reasoning was I already had 200,000 cost basis in the 58s. 

I thought again was squeeze was definitely possible but not a sure thing. So I got in and out of the $50 calls to reduce my exposure but I kept the 58 because I like to gamble and if it did start to gamma squeeze I would make more from the 58 contracts as the price Rose instead of the 50s. I would also have less exposure. 

Yeah in hindsight it would have worked out best if I sold the 58 dollar calls during the run up  to 60 and hold on to the 50s."
2021-06-18 15:38:55,wallstreetbets,Because that would make too much sense and I would also miss out on whatever the strike price I sell at if it moons

2021-06-18 17:07:13,wallstreetbets,"👍
Good thought process.

After I lost over 470K in two days back in Feb I tend to lock profit too early from my runners but hold my loosers until they goes to zero. Not sure why I kept repeating the same pattern despite rigorously researching my past trades and identifying the problem. Most of my speculative bets are good pick but my account is not growing at all over the last 3-4 months. 

I bought some large amount of weekly contracts in SPY, NVDA, MVIS, RBLX, BYND over the last 6 weeks and sold them at measly 15-20% profit, which are then lost in my losing trades. If I just held them until expiry, they all could ended up at 2000-5000%. 

Any advice to shift my mentality?"
2021-06-18 16:01:26,wallstreetbets,"with your capital you could hold some shares and FDs for the moon, but also hedge with options."
2021-06-18 05:51:30,wallstreetbets,"So I’m pretty new to options, but if he had a $60 strike price on his option, and the stock ends up at $62, his profit is the $2 minus what he paid per call times number of calls?

Sorry if that’s a retarded question"
2021-06-18 18:46:31,wallstreetbets,"Aw cool, I tried to look for it and didn’t see it…thanks bruthuh!"
2021-06-18 17:19:06,wallstreetbets,"I get that. When I took 10K to $460, 000 during AMC's run up from 12 to 30. I knew it could run after 20-21 because there was no intraday high higher than that. Yeah I still cashed out 2/3 of my options at $23.50 luckily I kept the other third when I hit 30. But got out just a bit early. It's hard to time it and then you always question in hindsight"

2021-06-18 12:02:44,wallstreetbets,"Yes that's correct at expiration. Before that, there's still time value left in the contract so it would be worth a bit more than the intrinsic value. It might be worth $2 at a $62 stock price the day it expires, but a week before could be worth $3 or more."
2021-06-17 22:08:04,wallstreetbets,"I think the key word you used was 'need', sure that's the price he needs if he exercises. But I'm not really sure that's what anybody in this community is playing the game for.

The breakeven makes no difference if you understand the Greeks and the markets. I dont, so I don't mess around with them. But, I do understand you can day or swing trade options and never sniff the breakeven and still make a shit ton of money."
2021-06-17 21:45:04,wallstreetbets,"The price of a $58 call on 6/18 is now $4.95 per share as of right now, he paid around $3 for his. So he’s very much in the green right now big time even though the share price is well under his break even at $59.95."
2021-06-18 17:49:57,wallstreetbets,How did you learn so much about trading options in such a short amount of time?
2021-06-18 13:00:12,wallstreetbets,"Yep, gotcha, the time value is higher based on the expected volatility and the time left. 

However, let’s say the value is $3, that minus $1 he paid for the option means $2 per call profit? Times like 60 calls? Lol I’m sure I’m missing something big in there"
2021-06-18 12:05:25,wallstreetbets,"yes very true.  Money can for sure be made under breakeven.  But generally to make a lot of money, you need to hit over breakeven, even with greeks.  But this is not a general type of time we are in."

2021-06-18 17:53:48,wallstreetbets,"I learned by experience. Probably lost 10 to 20,000 over 3 years (if you we're judging my experience by my Reddit profile, I had another account I lost last year). And I'm not/was not rich by any means. But I looked at it as an investment. For me the biggest problem starting with small amount of money is I would hold calls way too long because I always wanted a big payday instead of taking the small wins.  This would be money I would use for restaurants or leisurely activities. Start out with cheap calls. But I literally just read books, watch YouTube videos, and learn by experience. Honestly my recommendation for people is to learn options and sell covered calls, credit spreads, and iron condors. Its so easier when theta is on your side.  I'm just gambling with a Black swan event in  AMC."

2021-06-18 00:04:00,wallstreetbets,"DirectTV uses the Ku band, so it's actually not that different! The frequencies are the same, but there are a few key differences:

1. 5G signals are bidirectional, meaning the cell tower talks to you and you also talk to the cell tower. DirectTV is just one-way, broadcasting the same content to everyone. Your DirectTV dish doesn't have the capability to transmit signals. 

2.  Satellite signals are *much* weaker than cell tower signals. Something a few km away from you is going to be able to broadcast a much stronger signal with less spread than something hundreds to hundreds of thousands of km away

3. DirectTV is sent from geosynchronous orbit, which is very far away (35,786 km). It takes about 0.4 seconds for the radio waves broadcast by the satellite to get to you. That's why traditional satellite internet has very terrible latency, you need to send signals to and from a satellite that's extremely far away. That's why companies like Starlink, OneWeb, and AST & Science are targeting low earth orbit, which is only about 500-1200km in altitude. The signal only takes a tiny fraction of a second (4-7 milliseconds) to get to this altitude, which makes the service far lower latency. Being closer also keeps the beams of RF energy from spreading out so much, which improves the number of subscribers you can add."

2021-06-17 23:51:04,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I don't think I can read, or what I just wrote. All in."
2021-06-17 23:26:00,wallstreetbets,I guess I never realized that nasal spray and crystal meth were the same. But as you say...speed is speed.
2021-06-17 23:54:08,wallstreetbets,"The alternative is teaching your kids how to use meth safely and how to dispose of needles properly. That's sounds so dumb , I could barely write it."
2021-06-18 10:09:00,wallstreetbets,It means the feds won't ask local law enforcement for help if they decide to bust you.  They'll just ride solo.
2021-06-17 20:24:11,wallstreetbets,Amen to that
2021-06-17 21:09:32,wallstreetbets,Where I’m coming from is 6 links that say I’m right.  Where are you coming from?
2021-06-18 01:18:01,wallstreetbets,"I’m coming from common sense. You’re coming from internet links you fool. You seem like a druggie tbh, since you want to defend yourself so bad."
2021-06-18 04:50:20,wallstreetbets,"Right, the notoriously bad source Web MD 🤣

Yes, I have been known to indulge. Primarily psychedelics, so by your own admission I must be one of the smart ones lol."
2021-06-18 05:10:51,wallstreetbets,What kind of psychedelics?
2021-06-18 05:20:06,wallstreetbets,LSD mostly.  It’s very different from what most people think it is.  But I’m not here to advertise it.  I do think especially this class of drug is misunderstood and seems to have a positive effect on my mental health. But to each their own.
2021-06-17 20:19:07,wallstreetbets,"If you think decriminalization would mean that biker gang give up on meth, youre crazy. In fact, the problem would probably be tenfold. I have thought deeply about this. The fact is that meth heads are zombies that will hurt, maim and kill for their fix. Their is literally zero medical use for meth.

None of this was even what my original comment was about. All drugs should not be legal. Cannabis should. Its pretty simple. I guess if thats me drawing a line in the sand, then ok. 

The current administration promised to make cannabis reform a priority. Not making more business for private prisons. That is the only thing you could guarantee if everyone's just allowed to have meth and heroin."
2021-06-17 20:20:18,wallstreetbets,No comparison at all. I have friends who have kids that have been prescribed Aderall. Not one of those kids has sucked a dick for more Aderall.
2021-06-17 20:21:34,wallstreetbets,How would you enforce a law? Ask nicely and hope the criminal agrees?
2021-06-17 20:52:13,wallstreetbets,"Ok, this comment is all over the place for me. First, I'd push back against your first assertion. And ask what logic or evidence you have for it, besides deep thought. Then you go into the zombie thing. Then double down on the incorrect meth claim. 

But I agree with the middle part. Politicians do lie and use. They are all liars and thieves and will say whatever they need to accumulate power and resources. I wish they would go ahead and advance a cannabis bill separate from this and there is no excuse not to. 

Then, the last part, are you asserting decriminalization would fill prisons moreso than they are now? A second lofty assertion..."
2021-06-17 20:44:48,wallstreetbets,"Lol. Oh man. This is so naive. Speed is speed. If those kids were taking high quality crystal meth in an appropriate dose, orally, they would have similar effects. And unfortunately a lot of those kids will have negative consequences from having that prescription."
2021-06-17 20:39:59,wallstreetbets,I'm not saying that sort of violence shouldn't be used to enforce laws. I'm saying we should be much more picky about what laws we have and not have bullshit laws that harm peaceful people
2021-06-17 20:59:19,wallstreetbets,"Right now,nif you go to Fort Collins Colorado and talk to 5 people, you will meet someone who has weed for sale. Well that's odd there are dispensaries that sell it legally. So why is there still a black market? So, push back all you want, youre wrong. 

I can tell you have never seen the effects of long term use of crystal meth. I have. 

Decriminalization is guaranteed to put more people in prisons. Unless you're talking about handing out free rocks to people."
2021-06-17 21:01:32,wallstreetbets,"Also, let me triple down real quick. Crystal methamphetamine has less than zero medical use or benefit."
2021-06-17 20:47:03,wallstreetbets,I promise you you don't know what you're talking about. You have the experience of reading what you found on Wikipedia.
2021-06-17 20:47:59,wallstreetbets,"So methheads are ""peaceful people""?🤣🤣🤣"
2021-06-17 20:53:38,wallstreetbets,"Have you snorted Adderall and meth? Been addicted to either? I'll grant you they aren't exactly the same,but you saying there no comparison is demonstrably false"
2021-06-17 20:54:51,wallstreetbets,"Maybe. And if they aren't, there are *plenty* of laws to punish that behavior. Increase the penalties for real crimes if you are so hungry to punish people. Don't fuck with them preemptively"
2021-06-17 21:13:36,wallstreetbets,"Zero comparison. One lasts a couple hours, one can last days."
2021-06-17 21:14:41,wallstreetbets,"No, they arent peaceful people. They will do anything for more meth. Kinda why I compared them to zombies"
2021-06-17 21:53:35,wallstreetbets,"Yea, you said they would steal maim and kill, all things that are already illegal. And for good reasons"
2021-06-17 22:26:25,wallstreetbets,They do it because they are on the drug that you want them to have unfettered access to.
2021-06-17 22:28:31,wallstreetbets,"And I realize that people are going to do drugs, but to make it ok to have and carry is ridiculous. Do you know how much meth I can make in my bathroom for ""personal use""?"
2021-06-17 22:56:01,wallstreetbets,"Yay for preemptive violence. Collateral damage schmateral damage.

 I don't see how anyone can look at the last century and legitimately support prohibition. I mean, if there was even evidence that it worked, I could understand how some could hold a statist machivellian view that it's justified. But it doesn't. It hasn't. It's been corrupt. It is corrupt. It's ineffective. Moe importantly, it's immoral. I'm not saying that my first priority would be to decimibalize meth, but if you start your argument with an arbitrary line, don't expect great results."
2021-06-17 22:48:45,wallstreetbets,"Idk.id rather people be able to go buy something high quality legitimateand dosed correctly from a reputable vendors whose supply chain can be vetted. Better for everyone. Speed is one of the worst ones imo, mainly bc it leads to lack of sleep, which drives people crazy. But people already make that shit in their bathrooms. And it's even more dangerous bc of the draconian punishments people face for drugs"
2021-06-17 22:57:54,wallstreetbets,Who said anything about violence? Arresting someone for committing crimes isn't violence
2021-06-17 23:00:01,wallstreetbets,I dont see how someone can look at dangerous man-made chemicals and think to legitimize them through decriminalization.
2021-06-17 23:00:35,wallstreetbets,"Taking someone against their will and putting them in a cage isn't violence? News to me.

Anything the state enforces is through violence or the threat of. The state is literally just the monopoly on legitimate violence in a given geographic area. 

And any law that is made is potentially a death sentence. Just ask Eric garner, Breanna Taylor , or thousands of others"
2021-06-17 23:08:03,wallstreetbets,"I don't see how someone can look at armed agents occupying territory and terrorizing people over consensual trade and think it's not evil, but hey, here we are.

And, dude, like I don't know how you still don't understand this. They sell methamphetamine legally. The brand name is desoxyn. I know you're claiming that's just a Wikipedia conspiracy, but a chemical is just a chemical. There is no magical line that makes it evil. You seem really invested in that line, bit it doesn't exist. Heroin is just another opioid. Meth is just speed. It is what it is. People do disgusting things to get high. Prohibition makes that environment more dangerous and more expensive and destroys families and communities and just hasnt worked. People don't trust police anynore bc of how they act bc of the war on drugs. Central and south america are decimated bc of our black market demand. It's bullshit. It's not worth supporting in any form."
2021-06-17 23:03:01,wallstreetbets,"So, you are basically an anarchist."
2021-06-17 23:01:45,wallstreetbets,"Nope, it's not violence. Those criminals chose to risk their freedom, so don't act like they are innocent victims."
2021-06-17 23:24:36,wallstreetbets,The black market demand won't go away. Maybe in some utopia but not in reality. Legalization of cannabis in Colorado is growing...not going away. That will always be the case with any drug. A dose of Aderall is 2.5 milligrams per day. A dealer will sell you 1000 times that and expect to see you back in the morning. These two things are not the same.
2021-06-17 23:11:05,wallstreetbets,"If I had to create a utopia, it'd be very much anarchist. 

But that doesn't mean that's what I'm advocating here. I think freedom will improve our lives, even incrementally"
2021-06-17 23:09:50,wallstreetbets,That's exactly what they are. Our laws are immoral. And they don't make sense. If they did they would be busting down people's doors for having a beer.
2021-06-17 23:38:09,wallstreetbets,"And you're claiming that prohibition works? If that's the case, it's only logical that you'd want to see more of it?"
2021-06-17 23:26:48,wallstreetbets,"Oh, so now violent gang members are innocent victims? Holy shit."
2021-06-17 23:28:10,wallstreetbets,Murderers are just misunderstood victims of state sponsored violence?
2021-06-17 23:51:13,wallstreetbets,I know prohibiting the use of meth is the most effective way of dealing with it
2021-06-17 23:36:10,wallstreetbets,"Are violent people peaceful? Hmm. Idk i think I've made a pretty clear distinction between actions that directly harm others and people engaging in consensual trade. I've never downplayed or excused other actions that could result from someone using drugs. If you're not able or willing to make that distinction, I don't know what to say"
2021-06-17 23:33:56,wallstreetbets,"I didn't say all laws are immoral. But many are, you know, like the ones were talking about, where the only ""victim"" is the state"
2021-06-18 00:17:17,wallstreetbets,"Yea, it makes you feel good. More bad guys to look down. Meanwhile all the problems you claim this fixed remain just as bad or worse. But you get to cause more destruction in the meantime."
2021-06-17 23:49:10,wallstreetbets,Do you know methheads that are productive members of society? Cause I've never seen one.
2021-06-17 23:47:43,wallstreetbets,And the victims of the methheads.
2021-06-18 00:21:11,wallstreetbets,"Lmfao. The best thing for a methhead is jail. You don't have to like that, but its the truth. You'd have these people suffering endlessly like zombies looking for brains, because they are innocent victims."
2021-06-18 00:19:06,wallstreetbets,Idk what most people do in their free time and down time. I know there are plenty of normal productive members who use hard drugs recreationally.
2021-06-18 00:18:01,wallstreetbets,"Hey, if there's an actual victim, they may be an actual crime. And they you go, right back where we started"
2021-06-18 09:23:17,wallstreetbets,"No, you would, bc you support the current system. Lol. Even your ignorant, nonfactual view is based on the things you have seen under a prohibitive state wit draconian punishments.

It's crazy that you are literally just saying chemistry is a lie."
2021-06-18 00:22:37,wallstreetbets,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
2021-06-18 00:23:06,wallstreetbets,Show me some.
2021-06-18 00:22:10,wallstreetbets,There is guaranteed to be crime. 100% guaranteed.
2021-06-18 00:27:39,wallstreetbets,I really don't think you understand the effects of substance abuse on society as a whole. Have you ever even seen someone high on meth? Those people aren't going to their jobs and taking care of their lives. I cant believe anyone who has seen the reality would ever advocate for the use of that drug.
2021-06-18 13:38:29,wallstreetbets,"Nah, it's you that wants everyone to be able to have and use crystal meth. Do you have any idea how dumb that sounds? 

I can promise you that nobody is sucking dick for Aderall"
2021-06-18 09:19:56,wallstreetbets,"You really believe there is noone out there who does hard drugs and holds a job? Are you like 14 years old straight out of dare class?

Edit: and I'm not saying it's good or healthy or anything else, but your view is made up of weak stereotypes. Stereotypes to create scapegoats to justify the states violence aggression"
2021-06-18 09:20:54,wallstreetbets,"Oh yea, bc of bullshit laws where the state is the victim. But in actuality, the state is the aggressor"
2021-06-18 09:18:44,wallstreetbets,"Your view is just very limited man, and just factually incorrect. I've lost family and friends to drugs, both legal and illegal. And I've never advocatedfor using any substance. Again, speed is speed.opioids are opioids. All the negative aspects you point out about these chemicals and their production are directly *because of* prohibition. You know, when they make Adderall, it's a crystalline salt before it's put into the pill. And yet another time, they make and sell meth legally, under the brand name desoxyn. 

Any negative thing you bring up has occured under the current system. So justifying and defending the current system bc of things that it doesn't actually prevent, doesn't make sense."
2021-06-18 13:50:08,wallstreetbets,"Bullshit. I promise you they have. 

You're pretty naive man. Go pop the Adderall. It's perfectly safe and fine for you. But then prete d anyone who does meth is a zombie. 

I'm guessing DARE is really fresh for you. You may change your opinions as you have more experience in the world"
2021-06-18 13:36:18,wallstreetbets,"You really believe that it only affects the state when methheads are robbing and stealing for their fix?

Your idea that methheads are responsible people is fucking hilarious and shows that you dont have a clue what you're saying."
2021-06-18 14:16:33,wallstreetbets,It's not me being naive. It's you not having a clue. Seriously. I dont do Aderall or meth. Just another sign that you'll say any old dumb shit to keep your hilarious beliefs.
2021-06-18 14:20:47,wallstreetbets,"How are YOU gonna talk about real world experience? You actually believe aderall and crystal meth are the same thing. And you believe both of those things are the same thing as nasal decongestant. You are seriously clueless. You have some utopian idea about anarchy, that is both stupid and unrealistic. You actually think criminals are innocent victims. Wtf actual experiences do you actually have? Reading Wikipedia in you parents basement isn't an experience YOU had. And to keep calling me naive when you believe mucinex and meth are the same thing is a joke."
2021-06-18 13:48:20,wallstreetbets,"You either havea mental block or you're just arguing in bad faith. I'll repeat it, for like the 10th time.

Robbing and staling are illegal. And there is a victim. Robbing and stealing are illegal.and there is a victim. Robbing and stealing are illegal. And there a victim. 

And *again*, these things are already happening now, despite the immoral , oppressive laws you support. And *again*, If it's really about the actual crimes, you can raise the penalty for those. It doesn't justify preemptive violence to purportedly prevent actual crimes, when we already know it doesn't."
2021-06-18 14:35:47,wallstreetbets,"No, I think they are all slightly different versions of speed. They are similar compounds. Adderall is a slightly different chemical. It's amphetamine salts. Desoxyn is legally prescribed methamphetamine salts. Literally the exact same chemical people are synthesizing at home when they make ""crystal meth"". They

And I never once brought up dextromethorphan, so I don't know where that came from. Some fever dream, I guess. 

Your bad faith arguments would be laughable if they werent in support of violence. I've never actually spoken support of using these drugs, whether they be currently legal or illegal. In fact, it seems like I'm the only one who actually understands what they are and how dangerous they can be, even if you have a Drs permission slip. 

It's crazy you have such a strong opinion on something while having so little technical knowledge on the matter"
2021-06-18 14:22:10,wallstreetbets,Robbing and stealing are side effects of the the drugs that you're advocating for. Not hard for most people to understand.
2021-06-18 14:22:56,wallstreetbets,Explain what an immoral law is. That's the dumbest fucking thing I've ever heard.
2021-06-18 14:42:06,wallstreetbets,I've never once said I support violence. On the other hand you have. You want everyone to have meth and the violence that comes with it. So take that argument to someone who thinks you know what you're talking about.
2021-06-18 14:40:46,wallstreetbets,"Lmfao. I have a strong opinion based on experience. You have yours based off what you gleaned from Wikipedia. I guess if you believe ""speed is speed"" based on Wiki, then enjoy that opinion. Just don't try to convince someone that knows what they're talking about."
2021-06-18 14:24:20,wallstreetbets,"Ok, so you understand those things are crimes, for good and legitimate reasons. So you understand that what you're advocating is preemptive violence t hopefully prevent crime. Bjt obviously we see that it doesn't actually prevent that crime. So really you're advocating for useless violence"
2021-06-18 14:53:09,wallstreetbets,"Oh shit. You think the legal code is equivalent to morality? Well, that's patently insane."
2021-06-18 14:52:24,wallstreetbets,"Enforcing laws requires violence. Is violence acceptable to catch a murderer? Sure. If violence acceptable to control what people do with their own bodies? No, absolutely not"
2021-06-18 14:56:28,wallstreetbets,"Yea, some zombie you met. And now you don't believe in chemistry. 


And again with the Wikipedia conspiracy. It's just a fact. I didn't need Wikipedia to tell me tht fact, but I thought sourcing Wikipedia would be straightforward enough that you would understand where you're wrong."
2021-06-18 14:28:03,wallstreetbets,"First off fucktard, it's only YOU talking about violence. And it's dumb as fuck to hear it. Arresting a criminal isn't violence. I'm advocating that criminals go to jail. Do you understand what a crime is?"
2021-06-18 14:29:31,wallstreetbets,"If you really believe that meth use is a victimless crime, then you are beyond help. Again, it just proves that you're arguing about shit you don't even understand. Why would you pick a side when you dont even understand the argument?"
2021-06-18 14:55:46,wallstreetbets,So you can't explain why laws are immoral. I didn't think you could.
2021-06-18 14:54:47,wallstreetbets,Thats a lie. Why do you keep telling it?
2021-06-18 15:00:26,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, wiki told you speed is speed. Since you have never had any experience, you just roll with that stupid narrative. Nasal decongestant is the same as crystal meth to you. No way you'll ever understand that what you're saying is moronic....cause Wikipedia is all you have to base youre juvenile opinions on"
2021-06-18 14:54:31,wallstreetbets,"You're the one who saying taking zmekne against their will and putting them into a cage isn't a violent act. Again, ask Eric garner what the punishment is for selling loose cigarettes. That's why we should be picky af about how we use that violence"
2021-06-18 14:55:07,wallstreetbets,"Lol, I don't believe it. I know it. It's a fact"
2021-06-18 14:58:53,wallstreetbets,"Ok,I got it. you're just being a troll. Either tht or you are still a teenager who has a very tenuous grasp on what the state actually is"
2021-06-18 15:02:52,wallstreetbets,"No, it's you whose repeating a lie. I never mentioned nasal decongestant or Mucinex. You made that shit up out of thin air.

Since you are the chemical expert, you tell me he difference between ampetamine salts, methamphetamine salts, and ""crystal meth"""
2021-06-18 14:56:58,wallstreetbets,Arresting a criminal isn't a violent act. You sound sooooo fucking dumb. I've probably been arrested 20 or 30 times. Never was there violence.
2021-06-18 14:57:52,wallstreetbets,You are so unbelievably naive it's astounding.
2021-06-18 14:58:22,wallstreetbets,"You should read up on that, since you have no real world experience"
2021-06-18 15:01:02,wallstreetbets,"Nope, just pointing out that you're lying."
2021-06-18 15:01:48,wallstreetbets,I'll be 50 this year and I've actually experienced the things that you have only read about.
2021-06-18 15:04:56,wallstreetbets,"Again, you lie and then act like it's me. How quaint."
2021-06-18 14:59:50,wallstreetbets,"As long as you comply, they might not kill you...

The same can be said for some the most brutal regimes in history."
2021-06-18 15:01:21,wallstreetbets,"Ok, yea, I don't have the experience of being arrested 30 times. You must be a real scumbag. Either tht or an unbelievable simp."
2021-06-18 15:04:05,wallstreetbets,"It's not a lie to define he state as the monopoly on legitimate violence. Hell, even president Obama described it as such. 

It's pretty naive of you to not understand what that means and to call it a ""lie"""
2021-06-18 15:05:40,wallstreetbets,"I'm sure. If you've been arrested for drugs and are still shilling the drug war, you're a joke. 

If you've been arrested tht many times and none of it was drug related, I can only imagine the dumb shit you've done . I would imagine you had to create a lot of actual victims. Hopefully not. Maybe it's just other Victimless crimes that shouldn't exist."
2021-06-18 15:10:01,wallstreetbets,"Ok, quote me then. Find where I said that. Or anything like that 

You can't bc you're making it up"
2021-06-18 15:03:36,wallstreetbets,And you're dumb enough to believe that isolated incidents are what the whole criminal justice system is about. You have a lot of learning to do.
2021-06-18 15:04:25,wallstreetbets,No dipshit. I was a victim🤣🤣🤣 see how quick your stupid fuck opinion changed about criminals. You're pathetic.
2021-06-18 15:06:11,wallstreetbets,"Nope, it's a boring lie made up by fruitcakes that want everyone to use crystal meth"
2021-06-18 15:07:19,wallstreetbets,The only joke here is the douchebag advocating the use of crystal meth and calling methheads victims.
2021-06-18 15:09:24,wallstreetbets,"Aint it fucking cute how quick your opinion switched about criminals tho? I bet I make 10 times the money you do on any given day. I'm a journeyman electrician who owns my own business. Meanwhile, youre advocating for meth heads. The only scumbag is you."
2021-06-18 15:13:19,wallstreetbets,The lie that laws are immoral and are just violence. I'm not making that up dipshit. You've said it a thousand times and it's a lie.
2021-06-18 15:07:56,wallstreetbets,"I don't know what you're even talking about. Since taking someone against their will and putting them in a cage is an inherently violent act, there are no shortage of incidents where that violence spills over. You can prevent that spillover by not initiating that violence over bullshit.


You really don't understand this concept?  I thought you were 15. Instead, you're 50 stuck on an idea that you should give up at 15"
2021-06-18 15:09:12,wallstreetbets,"No, not at all. If you didn't harm anyone a d got arrested for drugs, I see you as the victim.

I just think you're dumb as shit for shilling the drug war afterwards"
2021-06-18 15:11:48,wallstreetbets,It really just seems like you have shit reading comprehension. Either that or voices in your head. I didn't change my opinion at all. I made an assumption about why you were arrested. I guess I was wrong. Anything I said about those respective crimes stays the same.
2021-06-18 15:20:00,wallstreetbets,"Not all laws are immoral. But there are plenty tht are, specifically the ones were talking about.

Your comment was asserting that I said meth was the same thing as Mucinex. You said it twice, called me a liar that's what I was responding to"
2021-06-18 15:20:41,wallstreetbets,"Violence is required to enforce laws tho, whether they are immoral or perfectly just."
2021-06-18 15:10:05,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, cause laws are bad right? 🤣🤣🤣🤣 dumbfuck"
2021-06-18 15:11:02,wallstreetbets,"Nobody is shilling for the drug war, but I do see you shilling for kids to have crystal meth."
2021-06-18 15:15:23,wallstreetbets,"Oh, so, I'm a scumbag criminal becausebI used to fight a lot and meth heads are just innocent victims is my reading comprehension? Nope. When I said I'd been arrested, before you knew why, I was an automatic scumbag. So your argument is just that much dumber."
2021-06-18 15:21:44,wallstreetbets,Got it. You get to decide what crimes you think are immoral 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I'm glad that 99.9% of the world disagrees with you or we'd be in trouble.
2021-06-18 15:22:18,wallstreetbets,You said speed is speed. Guess what's in nasal decongestant?
2021-06-18 15:22:38,wallstreetbets,Don't change your stance now.
2021-06-18 15:23:45,wallstreetbets,Another lie
2021-06-18 15:13:36,wallstreetbets,"I madeitclear like 10 times the difference between a legitimate crime with a victim and a bullshit crime where the state is the aggressor. 

You're comments are getting more stupid as you go. It really has to be intentional. You're just trolling to pretend you don't understand."
2021-06-18 15:17:59,wallstreetbets,"I think assaulting someone is worse than using meth, yes."
2021-06-18 15:28:37,wallstreetbets,We've probably exchanged 100s of comments in the last day. I think I explained what laws I see as immoral in a number of those comments. You'd know that if you hadn't been busy trying to create strawmen.
2021-06-18 15:26:45,wallstreetbets,"Well, I figured you knew that speed was a slang term for a particular type of uppers ( meth, crank, amphetamine, etc.) 

I wasn't intending to use ""speed"" interchangeably with ""stimulant"". 

There are others drugs of abuse that are in that family,but I wouldn't consider dextromethorphan one of them."
2021-06-18 15:28:56,wallstreetbets,Never did. Probably never will
2021-06-18 15:30:19,wallstreetbets,"You can say it's wrong or try to explain how ""comply or die"" isn't violence. But To call it a ""lie"", idk, seems immature"
2021-06-18 15:17:39,wallstreetbets,"But society as a whole thinks you're wrong. Just because you have sympathy for violent criminals, you assume that arresting them is violence, but me being arrested is me being a scumbag. If you can't see the stupid hypocrisy, you're lost."
2021-06-18 15:19:18,wallstreetbets,Well isn't that cute.
2021-06-18 15:20:17,wallstreetbets,Do you understand that at the very best youre a hypocrite with a dumb agenda?
2021-06-18 15:30:07,wallstreetbets,Not once have I used a strawman argument. That's the kind of shit people say to pretend they aren't hypocrites
2021-06-18 15:28:38,wallstreetbets,That speed is in nasal spray tho. So why is it different when I bring up nasal spray? You're literally making my while fucing point. Thankyou
2021-06-18 15:31:36,wallstreetbets,"But your stance on me being arrested is that im scum, while with meth heads they are innocent victims. Pretty huge change of stance if you ask me."
2021-06-18 15:33:55,wallstreetbets,But it's just a lie. Enforcing laws is not violence.
2021-06-18 15:23:56,wallstreetbets,"How am I a hypocrite?

My agenda is to see the world become a more peaceful and  prosperous and I think we get there through more freedom, not less. I think your arbitrary line based on all the ""zombies"" youve met isn't a real standard and really only detracts from your original goal of more cannabis freedom."
2021-06-18 15:35:30,wallstreetbets,"""hurr durr you just want everyone to do crystal meth!"""
2021-06-18 15:32:16,wallstreetbets,Which is..?
2021-06-18 15:39:01,wallstreetbets,"Lol, I made an assumption and called you a name, bc you were calling me dipshotnor dumbass in every other comment. The reason I made the assumption is bc there are a lot of laws that are legitimate and involve harming other people. Since you seemed t support drug laws, it seemed plausible you had committed other crimes.

Either way, I didn't change my stance. 

If you got arrested for selling drugs to people, consensual trade with aggression or violence towards others, then I absolutely see you as a victim to these policies.

Just like I see a peaceful meth head as being a victim of that immoral policy. It's pretty simple"
2021-06-18 15:40:29,wallstreetbets,"Again, pretty basic. Enforcing laws is always done through violence or the threat of. Otherwise, why would anyone submit to being arrested? Why would anyone ever pay a fine? Why would anyone not keep breaking whatever law they please?"
2021-06-18 15:41:32,wallstreetbets,"Why wouldn't you, when the blue lights come on, just keep driving?

Bc you know what will happen if you do."
2021-06-18 15:24:35,wallstreetbets,"Idk how you came to be a hypocrite, but you are."
2021-06-18 15:25:26,wallstreetbets,All meth heads are scum. I dont even know why you're trying to argue that they are good people and victims.
2021-06-18 15:36:06,wallstreetbets,Which is exactly what you're advocating for.
2021-06-18 15:34:49,wallstreetbets,That aderall and meth are not the same thing.
2021-06-18 15:57:29,wallstreetbets,Why can't you understand that there are no peaceful meth addicts? They plain don't exist. How do you think they support their addiction?
2021-06-18 15:53:34,wallstreetbets,Again. That's a lie
2021-06-18 15:54:35,wallstreetbets,Why keep lying? Have you ever been arrested? Have you ever been out in the sunlight?
2021-06-18 15:53:07,wallstreetbets,"Wow. You don't understand how anything works, do you?"
2021-06-18 15:30:37,wallstreetbets,Great argument
2021-06-18 15:27:12,wallstreetbets,When I was selling that shit I saw it. I never once had a good person show up looking for the drugs. But you want to pretend that their drug use exists in a vacuum and that anything they do to aquire their drug has nothing to do with their drug use
2021-06-18 15:42:25,wallstreetbets,"""you don't think abortion should be illegal. You want everyone to get abortions! """
2021-06-18 16:00:13,wallstreetbets,By doing meth? How do alcoholics support their addiction?
2021-06-18 15:54:02,wallstreetbets,Explain it then. Educate me
2021-06-18 15:52:20,wallstreetbets,Now that's actually a strawman.
2021-06-18 16:04:18,wallstreetbets,"There are what is called functional alcoholics, they are about 80% of all alcoholics. On the other hand, there is no such thing as a functional meth addict. 

What I meant by support, is how do they get the money to feed their addiction?"
2021-06-18 15:58:36,wallstreetbets,I cant. You can't even admit that aderall and crystal meth are different. You guaranteed me that kids are sucking dicks for Aderall.
2021-06-18 15:53:34,wallstreetbets,"It's literally the exact same connection you're making.

I've made it clear that I believe all forms of speed are generally not good for you. I still don't think they should be criminalized"
2021-06-18 16:08:32,wallstreetbets,"And my point was they get their money the same way alcoholics do.

Some work. Some steal. Some have wealthy parents. Some sell drugs.

I mean, the statement ""there are no functional meth heads"" is ridiculous and based on nothing at all besides a stereotype you've made.n"
2021-06-18 16:02:30,wallstreetbets,"Lol. I never said they were the exact same thing. I said they are both speed and that they have similarities asthe are similar chemicals. And I hate to be the bearer of bad news, you seem pretty invested in how great and safe it is, but people do abuse Adderall. And it's not just kids who take it"
2021-06-18 15:55:23,wallstreetbets,Not at all. You're talking about shit nobody even said shit about. Strawman argument.
2021-06-18 15:56:00,wallstreetbets,"So again, youre advocating the use of crystal meth."
2021-06-18 16:10:43,wallstreetbets,"The majority of alcoholics go to work and lead productive lives. What part of ""functional"" is hard to understand?"
2021-06-18 16:12:38,wallstreetbets,There is no such thing as a functional meth addict. You don't have to like that statement but it's 100% true. Which you would know if you had anything more than Wikipedia to base your argument on. You don't even understand the premise of the arguments you make.
2021-06-18 16:06:27,wallstreetbets,Bullshit. But are least you moved your goalposts. The potential for people abusing aderall is definitely there. With meth it's a guarantee
2021-06-18 15:56:40,wallstreetbets,"Ok troll. If you can't even acknowledge it's the same exact argument,you're just fucking with me. No need to waste anymore time"
2021-06-18 15:59:05,wallstreetbets,"Me: it's bad but I don't think it should be criminallized

You: you're advocating people use crystal meth!!

Me : "" you don't think abortion should be illegal. You're advocating everyone get an abortion

You: that's not even close to the same thing


Lol, on troll"
2021-06-18 16:22:39,wallstreetbets,I don't think you know what those words mean
2021-06-18 16:09:42,wallstreetbets,"You were probably confused bc I mentioned legally prescribed methamphetamine, brand name desoxyn. You chose to ignore tht point and continue on with your chemical misinformation"
2021-06-18 16:00:33,wallstreetbets,It's not tho. Are you telling me now that abortion is the same thing as crystal meth now? Cause nobody was talking about abortion
2021-06-18 16:01:36,wallstreetbets,But I never said fuck all about abortion. You literally want meth to be available for all the peaceful meth heads
2021-06-18 16:27:12,wallstreetbets,I've experienced both. It's you that really doesn't have a clue.
2021-06-18 16:14:15,wallstreetbets,Because it's just another chemical akin to aderall and is again nothing like crystal meth.
2021-06-18 16:03:31,wallstreetbets,"Dude, you're either dense or really Are a troll"
2021-06-18 16:05:09,wallstreetbets,"I don't really care how available it is . I just want the state to stop aggressing against peaceful people for the substances they choose to put in their body.

Their body. Their choice."
2021-06-18 16:22:03,wallstreetbets,Ok. Can you explain the difference between desoxyn and crystal meth?
2021-06-18 16:07:23,wallstreetbets,Show me where we were talking about abortion before your strawman argument. You don't even know my stance on abortion.
2021-06-18 16:09:35,wallstreetbets,"If it was just their body, their choice, then great. But its not. This drug fucks people's entire lives and affects everyone around them. Taxpayers have to pay for treatment of for jail sentences when they commit crimes to support their habits. There are dozens of articles you can read on that subject."
2021-06-18 16:26:39,wallstreetbets,"The same as the difference with Aderall. One is made in a lab under supervision with all kinds of controls and is prescribed by doctors to people that can experience a benefit at very low doses. The other is made by scumbags in bath tubs in their houses using anything as a chemical and is sold to anyone that wants it in large quantities. One has potential for addiction, but under the watch of a doctor, the other is guaranteed addiction and/or overdose."
2021-06-18 16:12:08,wallstreetbets,"...And i don't care. Is completely irrelevant to the point.

 Like, dude, how do you not understand this? How the hell do you operate your own business? I couldn't imagine trusting you with a set of plans.th abortion line was in quotes bc it was an analogy. If you don't understand the connection, I truly don't see how you can be so detached."
2021-06-18 16:14:15,wallstreetbets,"You said tht bc I didn't want a law prohibiting something, that I was advocating for everyone to go do that thing. I simply brought up another example where you could believe a law should not exist and not at all be advocating for people to take that action.

At this point, I don't even expect you to understand."
2021-06-18 16:24:31,wallstreetbets,"Lol, great logic. Society is a victim bc these people may go on to commit other crimes and wed have to pay to jail them. So we need to go ahead and jail them preemptively.

Yea, makes sense. Lol"
2021-06-18 16:27:42,wallstreetbets,"So, the only difference is the quality? So, exactly what I said from the beginning. Thanks."
2021-06-18 16:16:09,wallstreetbets,"Dude, I doubt you ever leave your moms basement. I wish you couldn't imagine arguing a point that you can't even understand."
2021-06-18 16:17:21,wallstreetbets,Yeah you brought up a strawman. That's exactly what I said you did. It's amazing that you dont even know what a strawman argument is. Yet you have to nerve to say that's what I'm doing.
2021-06-18 16:18:35,wallstreetbets,Is there anything you have real world experience in? Anything at all.
2021-06-18 16:28:08,wallstreetbets,Why do you think they commit the crimes genius?
2021-06-18 16:29:48,wallstreetbets,"It's not about they ""may"" commit other crimes. It's a guarantee."
2021-06-18 16:29:12,wallstreetbets,"Possession is a crime. Period. So it's not ""jailing them prematurely"". That's just you simpinf for meth heads."
2021-06-18 16:32:08,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, cause all meth addicts are just looking for a way to treat their adhd.🤣🤣🤣🤣"
2021-06-18 16:18:32,wallstreetbets,"Lol dude you are so dense. I don't give a fuck about your stance on abortion. The only reason I brought you hat up was t explain to why what you were saying was a strawman argument. I figured you'd could understand through an analogy. But your reading comprehension is shit. 

This shit is a joke. Peace"
2021-06-18 16:32:06,wallstreetbets,"So you're saying without laws against using meth, every meth user woud end up in jail anyways? Seems like anothr argument for my point"
2021-06-18 16:35:10,wallstreetbets,"So now it's not about the chemical, it's about why they take it?

Seems like you're moving the goalposts"
2021-06-18 16:19:19,wallstreetbets,"Ok, so youbdont even understand what a strawman is, but Im dense???🤣🤣🤣🤣"
2021-06-18 16:33:07,wallstreetbets,Meth addicts yes. Can you comprehend the difference between someone who used meth once and an addict?
2021-06-18 16:34:12,wallstreetbets,"But in your scenario,those people get to have their lives ruined and their families before they get the help they need."
2021-06-18 16:36:20,wallstreetbets,"It seems like you're the one who can't make that distinction, given your views. You said there are no functional meth users"
2021-06-18 16:37:24,wallstreetbets,"That's already happening. So we still get the shit you claim to want to prevent, but we also get all the negative consequences of a militarized police force. *Golf clap*"
2021-06-18 17:23:49,wallstreetbets,I said there are no functional meth addicts because it's true. Sorry Wikipedia didn't help you with a dumb argument for that point.
2021-06-18 17:25:23,wallstreetbets,Good. Cause fuck meth heads. They get help when they go to jail. They get to be away from the drug long enough to think straight. You seem to want them to suffer by not facing consequences

Total and CLNE are still in good standing.  Amazon must purchase 500 million gallons of gas before they can purchase 1 share.  Also RNG can be pumped through the US pipelines that are already in place without having to make any modifications.

Do it once do it right. Change to BEV or Bacon cell based transportation. Anything using a combustion is a dead end except in a very small niche category.

This is a sideways step, not a step forward. I also have no faith in this concept lasting more than a decade at most.

I think it’s a waste of time and the whole notion that there’s any point in this stuff at all is a furphy imo.

Bezos doesn’t own Amazon, he’s just a majority stake holder. 10.3% is his stake in Amazon."
2021-06-18 02:03:46,wallstreetbets,"No you are wrong , methane has a 30x worse effect than co2 if leaked into the atmosphere, thus the very same methane burnt into the engine is not that bad if the alternative was that

That is why it has a NEGATIVE carbon intensity according to the California air resource board"
2021-06-18 04:06:06,wallstreetbets,"What? You’re not very clear friend I don’t understand what you’re getting at?

CLNE produce a methane based liquified gas that’s used to power combustion engine vehicles. Much like LNG is used today for that same purpose (more popular outside of the USA).

Outputting any GHGs is a bad idea. We are way past the line of no return already. We’ve set off multiple feed back loops already and thwaites glacier is about to fucking pop which will lead to +5m of ocean rise as the western shelf collapses.

It doesn’t have negative ghg output fyi. That’s some garbage on the part of a pile of clowns. It’s CCS all over again. Huzzah got green washing."
2021-06-18 04:09:54,wallstreetbets,"Very wrong on multiple fronts

- first most of the sales of Clne are compressed natural gas, not LNG

- second, the company is starting again its producing efforts today, as outlined in my DD yesterday (at the moment they are just distributing not producing)

- third, Ghg effect is essential and methane is one of the worst gas for global warming. Agriculture emissions account for 10-15% of global emissions mostly for the methane leakage from animal feedstocks. If you don’t collect this methane global warming will get worse (methane is 30x worse than co2 from a global warming effect)

That is, RNG plants are good for the environment and even if you burn the rng in the ICE, the global warming effect is still minimal"
